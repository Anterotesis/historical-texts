            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO THE
READER.</head>
            <opener>Reader,</opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Cannot Imagine any thing, that our
Dissenting Zealots will be able to
object against this Ensuing Treatise,
unless perhaps in some Places the Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
and Severity of its Style; for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
I know they must: and if they can
raise no Tolerable Exceptions against the
Reasonableness of the Discourse it self,
it shall suffice to pick quarrels with Words
and Phrases. But I will assure thee, the
Author is a Person of such a tame and
softly humour, and so cold a Complexion,
that he thinks himself scarce capable of
hot and passionate Impressions: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if he has sometimes twisted Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
with his Arguments, it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not from Temper but from Choice;
and if there be any Tart and Vpbraiding
Expressions, they were not the Dictates of
Anger or Passion, but of the Iust and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Resentments of his Mind. And I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:64701:3"/>
to any Man, who knows upon what
sober Grounds and Principles the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Church of England</hi> stands;
and how that its <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi>
are not only countenanced by the best and
purest times of Christianity, but establisht by
the Fundamental Laws of the Land; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can so perfectly Charm and Stupifie
his Passions, as not to be chafed into some
heat &amp; briskness? when he seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that this Church so rightly constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and so duely authorised should be so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagely
worried by a Wild and Fanatique
Rabble; that this Church so soberly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled,
so warrantably reformed, and so
handsomly settled, should have been so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
beleaguered, and be yet not out of all
danger of being rifled, if not utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molisht
by Folly and Ignorance; that the
publick Peace and Settlement of a Nation
should be so wofully discomposed upon such
slender and frivolous Pretenses, and that,
after they have been so often and so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
baffled; that both Church and State
should be so lamentably embroyl'd by
the Pride and Insolence of a few pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
ignorant and malepert Preachers;
And lastly, that these Brain-sick People,
if not prevented by some speedy and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:64701:3"/>
Remedy, may in a little time grow to
that Power and Confidence, as to be able

               </note>
               <hi>shut the Heavens that they
shall not rain,</hi> i. e. <hi>to restrain
the Highest Powers of Church
and State from their wonted
Influence; and to have Power over the
Waters to turn them into Blood,</hi> i. e.
<hi>to turn the still People of a State or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into War and Blood:</hi> or, to speak
in our own plain <hi>English,</hi> to tye the Hands
of Authority, to instigate the people of God
to Rebellion, and once more involve the
Kingdom in Blood and Confusion. Let the
Reader consider all this, as throughly and
seriously as I have done, and then be a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
if he can.</p>
            <p>But besides this, let any man, that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Wisdom and Sobriety of
True Religion, tell me, how 'tis possible not
to be provoked to scorn and indignation
against such proud, ignorant, and superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Hypocrites; who though they utterly
defeat all the main Designs of Religion,
yet boast themselves its only Friends and
Patrons; signalize their Party by distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Titles and Characters of Godliness,
and brand all others, howsoever Pious and
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:64701:4"/>
Peaceable, with bad Names, and worse Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicions?
who I say, that loves and adores
the Spirit of true Religion, can forbear
to be sharp and severe to such thick and
fulsom abuses? In that there is not any
thing can so much expose or traduce true
Piety, as this sort of Hypocrisie; because
whilst Folly and Phantastry appears in the
Vizour of Holiness, it makes that seem as
ridiculous as it self. And hence the greatest
Friends of true Goodness have always been
the severest Satyrists upon False Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and our Blessed Saviour scarce seemed
more concern'd to plant and propagate
Christianity, than to explode the Pharisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Hypocrisie, <hi>i. e.</hi> Religious Pride and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence.</p>
            <p>I know but one single Instance, in which
Zeal, or a high Indignation is just and
warrantable; and that is when it vents
it self against the Arrogance of haughty,
peevish, and sullen Religionists, that under
higher pretences to Godliness supplant all
Principles of Civility and good Nature;
that strip Religion of its outside to make it
a covering for Spight and Malice; that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
their peevishness with the Mask of
Piety, and shroud their Ill Nature under
the demure pretences of Godly Zeal; And
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:64701:4"/>
stroak and applaud themselves as the only
Darlings and Favourites of Heaven, and
with a scornful pride disdain all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue
of Mankind, as a Rout of worthless
and unregenerate Reprobates. Thus the
only hot fit of Zeal we find our Saviour
in, was kindled by an Indignation against
the Pride and Insolence of the Iews, when
he whipt the Buyers and Sellers out of the
outward Court of the Temple: For though
they bore a blind and superstitious Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
towards that part of it, that was
peculiar to their own Worship, yet as for
the outward Court, the place where the
Gentiles and Proselytes worship't, that was
so unclean &amp; unhallowed, that they thought
it could not be prophaned, by being turn'd
into an Exchange of Vsury. Now this
Insolent Contempt of the Gentiles, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
conceit of their own holiness, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
the mild Spirit of our Blessed Saviour
to such an height of Impatience and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as made him with a seeming fury
and transport of passion whip the Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
thence, and overthrow the Tables. So
hateful is all proud, testy, and factious Zeal
to a loving and Divine Temper of mind.
And indeed what can we imagine more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
or mischievous than a spirit of Pride,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:64701:5"/>
Peevishness, and Animosity adopted into the
Service of God? This divides Religion into
Factions and Parties, engenders a sullen
and unsociable Niceness towards all that
herd not with themselves, breeds nothing
but rancour, malice and envy, and every
thing that is destructive of the Common
Peace and Amity of Mankind. And when
People Separate and Rendevouz themselves
into distinct Sects and Parties, they always
confine all their kind Influences to their own
Faction, and look with a scornful and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Aspect upon all the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
become Enemies and Outlaws to
Humane Society, and shatter in pieces that
natural Peace and common Love, that
preserves the Welfare and Tranquillity of
Humane Nature. Their minds (like the
savage <hi>Americans)</hi> are as contracted as
their Herds, and all that are not within
the Fold of their Church, are without the
Sphere of their Charity: this is entirely swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up within their own combination, and
'tis no part of their duty to commiserate or
supply the Wants of the Vnregenerate. As
the Poet describes the <hi>Jewish</hi> Bigots,
<q>
                  <l>Non monstrare vias, eadem nisi sacra
colenti,</l>
                  <l>Quaesitum ad fontem solos deducere
Verpos.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:64701:5"/>
They would not so much as direct the way
to any but a circumcised Brother, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
a Cup of cold Water upon a thirsty
<hi>Samaritan.</hi> The Elect are confined to their
own Party, and all besides are the Wicked
and Reprobate of the Earth, hated of God,
and unfit to be beloved by his People.
And this possesses their minds with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Inhumanity; and then, if the Saints
ever get into Power, no Tyrant so cruel
and butcherly; and they have the same
esteem of the Wicked as of Insects or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,
and use them accordingly: But when
they are out of Power, they are then forced
to support their Malice with Slanders and
Calumnies and proud Comparisons: when
they meet and gossip together, How do
they congratulate each other, that they are
not as this or that Formalist? and the
greatest part of their Idle Tattle is usually
spent either in Censuring or Pitying, or
Slandering some of their Neighbours, as
poor carnal and unconverted Wretches. And
when they deign to converse with the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
and Men of the World, <hi>i. e.</hi> all
out of their own Rowt, they make them keep
their distance; and the Language of their
Deportment is that of their Predecessors in
the Prophet <hi>Isaiah: stand by thy self,</hi>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:64701:6"/>
               <hi>come not near to me; for I am holier
than thou.</hi> In brief, whoever is proud
and conceited upon the score of Religion,
naturally falls into the most savage inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and baseness of Nature, and is utterly
uncapable of being either good Subject, or
good Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Now to lash these morose and churlish
Zealots with smart and twinging Satyrs,
is so far from being a criminal passion,
that 'tis a zeal of Meekness and Charity,
and a prosecution of the grand and diffusive
duty of humanity, and proceeds only from
an earnest desire to maintain the common
Love and Amity of Mankind. And
though good manners oblige us to treat all
other sorts of People with gentle and civil
Language; yet when we have to do with
the Scribes and Pharisees, we must point
our Reproofs with sharp Invectives, we
must discover them to themselves to humble
them; we must lance their Tumour, and
take out the Core of their proud Flesh before
we can cure them; Anodynes and softer
Medicines make no Impressions upon them,
to treat them smoothly does but feed the
humour; soft and tender Words do but
tempt their disdain, and sooth up their
Vanity; they think you flatter and fawn
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:64701:6"/>
upon them, if you speak them fair, your
Civility they will interpret Respect, and
a forced Esteem of their Godliness. They
know that you and the rest of the World
hate the people of God, and would use
them basely and inhumanely; but that the
greatness of their Piety gives check to your
Malice, and, in spight of all your outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Passion against them, extorts a more
gentle usage, if not a secret Love and
Veneration. But beside, that soft Reproofs
do but cocker their presumption, they would
suffer true Goodness to be run down by the
violence of Ignorance and Zeal. And to
think to argue rude and boystrous Zealots
out of their folly meerly by the strength of
calm and sober Reason, is as likely a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as to endeavour by fair words to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the Northern Wind into a Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Point. If you will ever silence
them, you must be as vehement as they:
nothing but Zeal can encounter Zeal. And
he that will oppose the Pharisees, must do
it with their Eagerness, though not their
Malice. Clamour and Confidence make
stronger Impressions upon the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
than strength of Reason; and the Rabble
ever runs to that Party, that raises the
biggest noise. And therefore seeing we
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:64701:7"/>
are not so ill-bred, as to oppose Clamour to
Clamour; we must supply our want of
Noise and Throat (as our Saviour did in
his Invectives against the Pharisees) by
Sharpness and Severity. And though there
is but little ground to hope that the keenest
Reasons should be able to pierce their thick
and inveterate prejudices; yet however
the sharper Edge they have, the deeper they
will stick in the minds of those, whose
Concern and Interest it is to punish and
correct them. For I am not so vain as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
or expect their own Conviction: as good
attempt the Removal of Mountains, as of
some mens Scruples. And I remember
the <hi>Italian</hi> proverb, <hi>Chi lava la Testa
d'al Asino perde il Sapone.</hi> And therefore
I never proposed to my self any other aim
in this following Discourse, than by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the palpable inconsistency of Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Tempers and Principles with the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
and security of Government, to awaken
Authority to beware of its worst and most
dangerous Enemies, and to force them to
that Modesty and Obedience by severity
of Laws, to which all the strength of
Reason in the world can never perswade
them.</p>
            <p>When I first resolved upon this Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:64701:7"/>
the Main Design in my Thoughts,
was to represent to the World the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Folly and Silliness of these mens
Religion, aud to shew what pitiful and
incompetent Guides of their Actions their
own Consciences are; and that to leave
them to the Government of their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
is only to deliver them up to be
abused by all manner of Vices and Follies;
and that when they have debaucht their
minds with Pride, Ignorance, Self-love,
Ambition, Peevishness, Malice, Envy,
Surliness, and Superstition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they
then bestow the Authority and Sacredness
of Conscience upon their most violent, boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous,
and ungovernable passions: In brief,
that their Consciences are seized on by such
morose and surly Principles, as make them,
the rudest and most barbarous people in
the World; and that in comparison of them,
the most insolent of the Pharisees were
Gentlemen, and the most savage of the
<hi>Americans</hi> Philosophers. But in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
I found my self happily prevented
by a late Learned and ingenious Discourse,
<hi>The Friendly Debate,</hi> that has unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd
all their affected Phrases with so
much perspicuity of Wit, discovered the
Feebleness of their beloved Notions, with
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:64701:8"/>
so much Clearness of Reason, demonstrated
the Wildness of their Practices by so many
pregnant and undeniable Testimonies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the palpable unwarrantableness of
their Schism, the shameful Prevarication of
their Pretences, and utter inconsistency of
their Principles with Publick Peace &amp; Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement;
and in brief, so evidently convicted
the Leaders in the faction of such inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Knavery, and their followers of such a
dull and stubborn simplicity; that 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any thing should hold out against so much
force of Reason and Demonstration, but
invincible Impudence and Obstinacy: And
when men insconce themselves in their
own Wills, they are there Impregnable.
Wilfulness is enchanted Armour, upon
which the sharpest Steel makes no Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and they are secure from the Power
of conviction, that are unalterably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
never to be convinced. Otherwise
nothing could be more apparent to any man
(that has but a competent knowledge of the
Nature of the things there debated) that
never any Cause in the world was more
shamefully baffled and triumphed over,
than this of Schismatical Non-conformity.
And though it has gaul'd them into an
implacable rage and indignation (for that
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:64701:8"/>
as <hi>Solomon</hi> observes, is the humour of some
sorts of men, to rage and be confident, when
they are convinced) yet in spight of Affronts
and Provocations, it has found them a tame
and patient People, that can generously
endure to see themselves so smartly pelted
for their Folly and Villany, and never so
much as snarl, or attempt to fasten upon
those Weapons, that have so sorely bruised
them; and as for those little Cattel that
have been so hardy as to nibble at a Reply,
they have only put us in mind of the old
Fable of the Serpent and the File, and have
proved nothing but the strength of their
Folly, and weakness of their Teeth; and all
of them may wear their Fangs to the Roots,
before they make any Impression upon the
Body of the Discourse.</p>
            <p>The main and most popular Objection, I
could ever meet with against it, is its form
and method, <hi>viz.</hi> its being written in way
of Dialogue; in which way of writing (they
say) a witty man may make any thing
look as uncouth and ridiculous as he pleases.
And this is true, in absurd and inartificial
Dialogues; but when they are skilfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
(as this is) there is no way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
more smart and convictive: For the
Design of such Composures is to represent
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:64701:9"/>
the Authors own thoughts upon occasion of
something affirm'd or intimated by the
Counter-party; and therefore if his own
Discourse be rational and concluding, there
is nothing more required to that of the
other Party, than that his talk be agreeable
to the pretenses of those men he Personates:
So that, if the Authors own Arguments
and Opinions (that are the Substance of
the Treatise) be unreproveable, 'tis not
material how wise his Adversaries Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is, so it be not false. Neither would
he require them to defend and justifie every
thing that is said in the Person of the
Non-conformist (for many things are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral,
and only design'd to set off his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
with a comical humour and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness)
but only to reply to the Scope
and Substance of his Book by justifying their
own Notions that he has confuted, and by
confuting those that he has asserted. Which
unless they shew themselves able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
they must acknowledge he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
shamed their Folly, and unmaskt
their Hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>But besides, this being but a general
Exception, must by the Laws of Reasoning
pass not only for a precarious but a false
Cavil, till it is proved by some particular
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:64701:9"/>
Instances, &amp; neither needs, nor admits of any
other Reply, than barely to challenge them to
alledg any thing of moment in their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
about the particular matters there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
that he has not sufficiently represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
If in any thing considerable he has been
disingenuous, let them point it out; but if
they cannot, let them not think to satisfie
the World, by objecting what they confess
they cannot prove, because they do not. 'Tis
true indeed, the speeches of the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist
are not so large and copious as his
Adversaries, because his part consists mainly
in hinting Doubts and Objections, which
must of necessity be in all forms of Arguing
much shorter than their just and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
Replies; especially when they are not
barely answered, but confuted too: And
therefore considering the difference of the
parts of the Dialogue, he has as clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
their sense as his own; and if all he
says for them were composed into one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Speech, it would be no easie matter to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
it from one of their own Discourses.</p>
            <p>But the thing that really grieves them,
is, that in this method he has stopt all
their Subterfuges, as he proceeds, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
their shifting of Phrases, and
hiding themselves in a maze of Words;
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:64701:10"/>
For, whereas 'tis their usual Artifice to tire
out the Wise, and amuse the Simple, by rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and down in canting and ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Expressions, he has been at the pains to
serret them from Phrase to Phrase, and
never left his pursuit till they were left
quite naked and defenceless, and without
one crany whereby to make an escape: In
so much, that they can never be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
any tolerable Answers to one part of his
Treatise, that are not already prevented in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>But that which chiefly tempts less discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
People to suspect some partiality, is,
that the Discourse of the Non-conformist
looks all along so simply; though for that
they ought to consider, that 'tis no wonder
if Non-sense runs so lamely, when Truth
and Reason tread so close upon its heels;
and the babble of a Fool never appears so
fulsom, as when he discourses with a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher;
'tis the smartness and perspicuity of
the Reply, that makes their folly so transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
Remove the Conformist, and then the
other talks at as wise a rate, as any of their
own Writers.</p>
            <p>But I beg the Readers pardon, for having
so much tired his patience with satisfying
the Cavils and Impertinences of these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:64701:10"/>
when I am so well assured that they are
uncapable either of being ashamed or argued
out of their Follies. 'Tis one thing to Baffle,
and another to Convince them. And where
they want stores of Reason to encounter an
Adversary, they never want Magazines of
Reproaches: And therefore I shall only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
that excellent Person, the Author of
the <hi>Debate,</hi> to be careful how he lays aside
his Vizour; for if ever they discover him,
let him look to be pelted to purpose with
Slanders, and blasting Reports: and though
he be a Person of the Clearest and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
Innocence, that is no fence against
the foulest Aspersions; but if they ever find
out the place of his Residence, let him assure
himself, they will quickly find the next Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil
to it, how clean soever he sweeps his own
Door.</p>
            <p>As for my own part I am hardned enough
to be proof against the poison of Asps, the
Stings of Vipers, and the Tongues of—and
rest satisfyed in this, that they can never
abuse me more than they are pleased to abuse
themselves; it being the most solemn strain of
their Devotion to vilifie themselves with
large Confessions of the hainousest and most
aggravated Sins: they will freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their offences against all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:64701:11"/>
and that with the foulest and
most enhancing Circumstances they can rake
together, and confess their Injustice, Vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Extortion, and all the Publican
and Harlot Sins in the world: And in
all their Confessions they stick not to charge
themselves with such large Catalogues of Sin,
and to amass together such an heap of Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as would make up the compleatest Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of Lewdness and Villany. And if their
Consciences do really Arraign them of all
those Crimes, whereof they so familiarly
endite themselves, there are no such guilty
and unpardonable Wretches as they. So that
their Confessions are either true, or false:
if false, then they fool and trifle with the
Almighty; if true, then I could easily tell
them the fittest place to say their Prayers in.
But however 'tis pity to abridge them the
liberty all men have, to abuse themselves:
but if they will extend this their Priviledge
so far, as to attaint other mens Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I shall only admonish them as a Friend
before-hand, that there is somebody in the
world that will not fail to requite their
slanders, and false aspersions, with their own
true Character. And so I take my leave of
them, to address my self to those for whom
this Discourse was intended. And though I
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:64701:11"/>
dare not be so sawcy as to teach my Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
how to Govern the Kingdom, out of
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> or the <hi>Revelations;</hi> yet I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to put up this single Petition, in order to
the security of our Publick Peace and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That whatsoever Freedom they may
think good to Indulge to Religion, they
would not suffer Irreligion to share in the
Favour, nor permit Atheism to appear
openly (as it begins to do) under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of Liberty of Conscience.</hi> I am not
so utterly unacquainted with the Experience
of former Ages, as to be over-apt to complain
of the degeneracy of our own: the World I
know has ever had its Vicissitudes, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
of Vertue and Wickedness: and all
Common-wealths have advanced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to their Power and Grandeur by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and Wisdom, and a tender Regard of
Religion; and from thence have declined
again by Softness and Effeminacy, by Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
and Prophaneness, and a proud Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of God and his Worship. This is the
Circle of Humane Affairs, and on these
constant Turns depend the Periods and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Fates of Empires. So that though
Atheism reigns and prevails more in the
present age, than in some that went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:64701:12"/>
before it; yet there have been sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
when it was mounted up to a greater
height of Power and Reputation, than 'tis
yet advanced to: but then those have always
been black and fatal Times, and have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
brought on Changes and Dissolutions
of States. For the Principles of Irreligion
unjoynt the Sinews and blow up the very
Foundations of Government: This turns
all sense of Loyalty into Folly; this sets men at
Liberty from all the effectual Obligations to
Obedience, and makes Rebellion as vertuous,
when ever it either is, or is thought as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous.</p>
            <p>And therefore it imports Authority to
nip this wanton humour in the Bud, and
to crush it whilst 'tis young and tender; for
as yet it has found but slender entertainment
with wise and sober Persons, and is only
propagated among little and unlearned Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
discreet men that have not more Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have yet at least more wit and manners:
The only Zelots in the Cause are the young
Nurslings, and small Infantry of the Wits,
the wild and hair-brain'd Youths of the
Town. A sort of Creatures that study nothing
but Sloth and Idleness, that design nothing
but Folly and Extravagance, that aspire to
no higher Accomplishments than fine Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:64701:12"/>
terse Oaths, and gay Plumes, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to no other stock of Learning, but a
few shavings of Wit gathered out of Plays
and Comedies; and these they abuse too, and
labour to pervert their chaste Expressions
to Obscene and Irreligious Purposes; and
<hi>Johnson</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> are prophaned, as
well as the Holy Scriptures. They measure
the Wit of their Discourse by its Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Ribaldry; and nothing sets it off
so handsomly as neat and fashionable Oaths:
and the only thing that makes them appear
more Witty then other Folk, is their daring
to be more wicked: Their Iests are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for nothing but their Presumption,
and the picquancy of their Conceit lies in
their Boldness. Men laugh not so much at
the Wit, as the Sawciness of their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
and because they dare vent such
things, as a discreet or civil man would
scorn to say, though he were an Atheist. But
these shallow fools are proud and ambitious to
gain a Name and Reputation for Debauchery,
they slander themselves with false Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and usurp the Wickedness they were
never guilty of, only to get a Renown in
Villany.</p>
            <p>'Tis these Apes of Wit, and Pedants of
Gentility that would make Atheism the
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:64701:13"/>
fashion forsooth, and Prophaneness the
Character of a Gentleman; that think it a
piece of Gallantry to scoff at Religion, droll
upon God and make sport with his Laws;
that account it an Argument of Iudgment
and Ingenuity, to be above the Follies of
Conscience: and a height of Courage and
Magnanimity, at all adventure to brave
and defie Heaven, and out-dare the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
and the noblest part of a gentile
Behaviour, to counterfeit an Haughty and
Supercilious Disdain of Religious Sneeks;
and to beg all men that are respective to
their Consciences, for soft and cowardly
Fools, that are scared with Phantastick and
Invisible Powers, and easily abused with
<hi>Tricks,</hi> and <hi>Juglings,</hi> and <hi>Publick Tales.</hi>
Now certainly, these Phantastick Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
must needs be wonderfully qualified, to
judge of the most serious and most difficult
Enquiries in the world. Are they not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(think you) to search into the deepest
Foundations of Religion, to weigh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
all the Arguments for the Being of
God, and Immortality of the Soul; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the Grounds of the Christian
Faith, and to take an account of the Truth
and Credibility of the Scriptures? And,
when they have so utterly emasculated their
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:64701:13"/>
Vnderstandings with Softness and Luxury,
are not they prodigiously able to examine
what Agrees or Quarrels with the Dictates of
Pure and Impartial Reason? Are they not
likely to determine what is truely Great and
Generous, that never heard of any other
Maxims of Philosophy, but what they have
pick'd up at Plays, out of the stiff Disputes
of <hi>Love and Honour?</hi> And are they not
likely to give a wonderful Account of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of Ancient Times (without which they
are utterly unable to judg of the Truth or Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood
of any Religion) that were never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with any History, unless perhaps
that of the Follies, and Amours of the <hi>French</hi>
Court? And yet how briskly do these giddy
Youths determine these, and a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Difficult Theories, that they never had
Learning or Patience enough to understand,
much less to make an exact and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
search into their Truth and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</p>
            <p>Alas young men! you are too rash and
forward, your confidence swells above your
Vnderstandings: 'Tis not for you to pretend
to Atheism, 'tis too great a Priviledge for
Boys and Novices. 'Tis sawsiness for you to
be Prophane, and to censure Religion Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and ill Manners: and whatsoever Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:64701:14"/>
Pleas Atheism may admit of, 'tis not
for such as you to pretend to Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enough to understand them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take heed of exposing your Vanity and
Weakness; and, if you will not be Wise, yet
at least be Modest: Be advised, not to set up
before your time, and better to furnish your
Vnderstandings, before you vent your wit.
Consider, what a fulsome thing it is, that
when the most Learned and Inquisitive of
the Philosophers could never raise Atheism
above the certainty of a <hi>Grand Perhaps:</hi>
and therefore denied not, but only doubted,
the Truth of Religion: For none of them
could ever be so utterly forsaken of his
Reason, as to attempt to demonstrate there
could be no God; but only by shewing how,
to solve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature and
Providence without him, that possibly there
might be none: and therefore they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so absurd, as to affront the worship of the
Deity; but thought themselves as effectually
obliged in Prudence to the duties of Vertue
and Religion by the possibility, as by the
certainty of things. Now I say, when these
men of Parts and Learning were so Modest
and Diffident in their singular perswasions;
what an unhandsome thing is it for such em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
Fops as you, with so bold and frontless a
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:64701:14"/>
Confidence, to defie the Almighty, to deride
the wisdom of his Laws, to cavil at his Sacred
Oracles, and to give the Lye to the Vniversal
Sense of Mankind; and all this at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <p>And yet, methinks, 'tis pretty to hear one
of these little Mushrome Wits, Charge Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with Credulity and easiness of Belief;
and talk confidently, that 'tis want of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Enquiry that betrays Fools and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
People to be scared with the tales
and threatnings of <hi>Ambitious Priests:</hi>
though it be so utterly impossible that any
men should be more chargeable with Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
than themselves; and no mans Faith
is capable of being more <hi>implicit,</hi> than their
Vnbelief; nor can the most illiterate Peasant
take up his Countries Religion upon more
slender Grounds and Motives, than they do
their Infidelity: their being equally Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
forces them to be equally Credulous. For,
not to repeat any of the forementioned parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
with what a greedy confidence do
they swallow down the Principles of the
<hi>Malmsbury Philosophy,</hi> without any chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or consideration? How hussingly will
they assert, that the Notion of an Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Substance implies a Contradiction, for
no other reason, than because it does? That
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:64701:15"/>
men have no Faculties but of Sense and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
that Vnderstanding is Reaction,
and Reason a Train of Phantasmes; that
the Will is a Corporeal Motion, that its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
are Fatal and Mechanical, and
necessitated by the Impressions of External
and Irresistible Causes; that its Liberty of
choice is as absurd and insignificant Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
as a round Quadrangle; that Religion
is the belief of Tales publickly allowed; that
Power is Right, and justifies all Actions
whatsoever, whether good or bad; that
there is nothing just, or unjust in it self; that
all Right and Wrong is the Result of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Contracts; and that the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are nothing but Maxims and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of self-interest! How boldly do they
take up with these and other resembling
Principles of Baseness and Irreligion, upon
the bare Authority and proofless Assertions
of one proud and haughty Philosopher? How
much severe Study and Contemplation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to a Competent Knowledge of these
things? And yet with what a stiff and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
Confidence are they determined by
these men, that cannot pretend to any other
knowledge, (and 'tis a very candid presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
to allow them so much) than of the
Laws of a Play, or Poem? In brief, these
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:64701:15"/>
empty Spunges suck in Opinions, for their
agreeableness with their debauched and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
Practices, without ever considering
their Truth and Evidence; for alas! they
never troubled their heads with such Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
And therefore, whatever they pretend,
'tis not their Reasons, but their Lusts and
Vices, that cavil at the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and they except against it, not because
it contradicts their understandings, (for that
they never considered) but their Appetites:
'tis their Sins and sensual Inclinations, that
prejudice and bar up their minds against it:
and though they were convinced of its
Truth, they would however be Infidels still,
in spight of all the Reason and Demonstration
in the world. Their Irreligion is an after-game
of their Debauchery, they are forced to it in
their own Defence. Their wickedness has
made Infidelity their Interest, and Atheism
their Refuge; and then they cannot, will
not believe, for no other Reason, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they dare not.</p>
            <p>But that I may not pursue their Ignorance
too unmercifully, I will venture, before
I conclude, to commend their skill: For I
cannot but acknowledge them guilty of one
little piece of Art and Sophistry, <hi>viz.</hi> That
being Conscious to themselves, that no tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:64701:16"/>
exceptions can be raised against the
Principles of True Goodness, they affect to
reproach it with forged and disingenuous
Aspersions, and wittingly disparage its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Beauty and Loveliness, by representing
it in false and uncouth Disguises. For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there is nothing more noble and generous,
more cheerful and sprightly, more courteous
and affable, more free and ingenuous, more
sober and rational, than the Spirit and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of true Religion; these witty Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are pleased to paint it out in sad and
melancholy shapes, with poor and wretched
Features, with soure and anxious Looks, as
an enemy to all Mirth and Cheerfulness,
and a thing that delights in nothing but
Sighs, and Groans, and discoloured Faces:
They dress it up in all the Follies and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of Superstition; and then, when they
have made it ridiculous, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
sport with it: And thus by represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it as a humour unworthy the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a generous mind, that justifies
their contempt of so weak a Passion, and
makes a sumptuous Apology for the gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of Atheism and Prophaneness. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if Religion were as mean and absurd,
as these men would make it, <hi>and others
have made it,</hi> let it not only excuse but abet
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:64701:16"/>
their practices; let it be the mark of an
high and gallant Spirit, to be an Atheist;
let it be Gentility to despise, and Wit to
droll upon Religion; let all Devotion be
esteemed the Child of Folly and Weakness;
let it be an Argument of Wisdom, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and vicious, and let Vertue become a
name of the greatest Reproach and Infamy.
But alas! when 'tis so demonstratively evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that true Piety (though it were an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture)
is our greatest wisdom and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that it both adorns, and advances Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature; that it is so highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to the peace and happiness of the
World; that it carries in it all that is ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and lovely, all that is cheerful and
ingenuous, all that is useful and profitable;
and that 'tis whatever can advance either
our Content, or Interest, or Reputation:
When all this is so amply evident, What
can be more unpardonably base and disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous,
than for these men, in spight of all
Remonstrances, still to upbraid it with the
Villanies of Hypocrisie, and blast its Credit
with the Absurdities of Superstition, which
is the greatest folly in the world, for no
other reason, than because it debauches
what is the greatest Wisdom? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:64701:17"/>
they would do well to understand a little
better what Religion means, before they
take upon them to disgrace and defame it;
and let them not discover their lamentable
rawness and ignorance, by laughing at its
folly and meanness, till they can first prove a
base and selfish spirit to be more noble and
generous, than an universal Love and
Charity; Pride and Luxury to be more
amiable than Sweetness and Ingenuity; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
and Impatience more honourable
than Discretion and Civility; Excess and
Debauchery more healthful than Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Sobriety: to be enslaved to their
Lusts and Passions more manly, than to
live by the Rules of Reason and Prudence;
Malice and Injustice to be more graceful and
becoming a gentile Behaviour, than Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Benignity; and the horrors of an
amazed Spirit to be fuller of Pleasure and
Felicity, than that Peace and Calmness of
Mind that springs from the Reflections of
an exact Conscience. Till all this, and much
more is made good, that is, till all the
Maxims of Folly and Wisdom are changed,
let them be Civil, and Modest, and not scorn
too confidently. And though all this could be
done, yet, as for their parts they will be so
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:64701:17"/>
far from ever performing it, that they will
never be at the pains of attempting it; and if
they should, 'tis (God knows) too great a
work for their little understandings. And
therefore I appeal to all the wise and sober
world, Whether they that would make Religion
ridiculous, are not infinitely so themselves?
Whether to consute it with Raillery and Bold
Iests, be not as void of Wit as Reason?
And whether all the Folly and Madness in
the World can equal this of these scoffing
Atheists?</p>
            <p>And thus having scourged their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Presumption with severity
enough, I shall forbear either to expose
them for their Pedantry, or to lash them
for their rudeness and ill manners: though
what can be more pedantick, than to be so big
with every little Conceit, as to be in labour
to vent it in every Company? And a pert
School-boy is scarce more troublesome with
a petty Criticism against <hi>Mr. Lilly,</hi> than
these truantly Youths are with any singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Exception, that they have picked up
against the Holy Scriptures. They cannot
meet with a person of any Reputation for
Learning, but they must be pecking at him
with their Objections; and if he slight
their impertinent Pratings (as all discreet
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:64701:18"/>
men do) then the next time they meet their
<hi>Dear Hearts,</hi> with what <hi>triumphant
shrugs</hi> do they boast their success against the
man in Black, and so laugh and drink
themselves into Confidence and Folly! And
then, as for their want of manners, what
deportment can be more course and clownish
than to affect to be offensive to all discreet
men, and to delight to loath and nauseate all
Civil Company with the filthiness of their
Discourse? A behaviour more irkesom to a
Gentleman of any Breeding and Civility,
than the Buffoonry of Hostlers and Porters.
They can scarce meet with a Clergy-man,
but they must be pelting him with Oaths, or
Ribaldry, or Atheistical Drollery; <hi>i. e.</hi> they
study to annoy him with such Discourse, as he
is obliged (though he were inwardly as great
a Villain as themselves) to detest by his Place
and Profession: a piece of Breeding much like
his, that would have refused to entertain a
Vestal with any other Discourse, than by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the Rites of <hi>Priapus,</hi> or the lascivious
Arts of <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so I leave them to the Correction of
the Publick Rods: and 'tis high time that
Authority check, and chastise the Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Boyish humour. For the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
spreads and grows fashionable, and
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:64701:18"/>
creeps out of Cities into Villages. To Impeach
Religion is become the first exercise of Wit,
in which young Gentlemen are to be Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined;
and Atheism is the only knowledge
and accomplishment they gain by a gentile
Education; and they have nothing to make
them fancy themselves more witty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
People, than illiterate Peasants and
Mechanicks, but a readiness and pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to rally upon Religion: and he is a raw
Youth, and smells rank of his <hi>Grandame</hi>
and his <hi>Catechism,</hi> that cannot resolve all
the Articles of his Faith into the Cheats
and Impostures of Priests. And thus they
live here till they have sinned, or fooled
away all sense of Honour and Conscience;
and so return home useless, and unserviceable
to their Countrey; and if they turn Sots,
they may prove less dangerous: but if not,
they are prepared for any designs of
Mischief and Publick Disturbance. For at
the same time they shake hands with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
they bid adieu to Loyalty; in that
whilst they own no tyes of Conscience, they
know no honesty but advantage; and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is the only endearment of their Duty
to their Prince: and therefore, when-ever
this happens to run counter to their Loyalty,
'tis then the strongest and most effectual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:64701:19"/>
to any attempts of Treason, and
Rebellion. And thus they may prove good
Subjects, as Rogues and Out-laws are, who
will be honest when 'tis their Interest; but
when 'tis not, then any thing is their Duty,
that contributes to their Security. And with
these men in all Civil Wars and Dissentions
of State, the strongest side has always the
justest Cause; and if Rebels prove success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
against their Lawful Prince, they gain
their Assistance. And to these Principles
we must ascribe the unhappy success of the
late Rebellion: the silly and well meaning
Zealots were only abused by sly and crafty
Incendiaries for the compassing of their own
ambitious ends, and by their Councils only
was the Cause managed, advanced, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished;
till they raised their own Fortunes
upon the Ruines of the Royal Interest, and
establish'd themselves in the Royal Power
and Dignity. And though the men and their
Designs are perished, yet their Principles
thrive and propagate; and 'tis strange, yet
easie to observe, how the contempt of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
works men into a dislike of Monarchy;
and I scarce ever met with any zealous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths-man,
whom I could not easily
discover to have more of the Atheist than
the Politician; in brief, all men of this
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:64701:19"/>
Perswasion are so far from being inclined to
love their Prince, that they are engaged by
their very Principles to hate the Vsurper:
For, take away the Divine Institution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the Obligations of Conscience
to Obedience, and then all Government is
Vsurpation, and all sense of Obedience Folly:
and Princes have no other Right to their
Crowns, but what is founded upon Force and
Violence; their Empire was first gain'd by
Wars, Butcheries, and Massacres; their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adems
hang upon their Swords; and their
Thrones stand deep in Humane Blood; and
all Kingdoms are nothing but Societies of
Slaves and Tyrants; and if any Subject can
set himself free from his Sovereigns Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he is the braver man; and when he can
win his Crown, he deserves to wear it. And
there is no man that laughs at the Folly of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
who is not angry at the Superstition of
Government. And therefore I leave it to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to consider, how much it concerns them
to restrain the Insolence of this wanton Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
and to punish those, who make it their
business to propagate Irreligious Principles, as
the worst and most dangerous Enemies to the
State.</p>
            <p>But my Scorn and Indignation against
the presumptuous lavishness of these redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:64701:20"/>
Wight swells this Preface to too large and
tedious a length; and therefore, I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
crave leave to premise this one caution
for the advantage of the ensuing Treatise,
and so have done; <hi>viz.</hi> That in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Debate, I have been careful to
confine my discourse to the weightiest and
most material Considerations, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
waved all matters of an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and subordinate Importance. For to
what purpose is it to examine every little
Exception, and every gay and plausible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
when the Enquiry is so clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable,
by Arguments of the greatest
Evidence and Concernment? And therefore
I have only represented the inconsistency of
<hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> with the first and
Fundamental Laws of Government. In
which if I have spoken Reason, I have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more ado, carried the cause; if I
have not, I am content to lose my labour. For
there are no Considerations of equal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Importance with those that relate
to the Peace and Settlement of Societies: So
that, if those I have urged prove ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
all others, drawn from less considerable
Topicks, would have been impertinent; and
so far from strengthning my discourse, that
they would rather have abated of its demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:64701:20"/>
Truth and Evidence: for being in
their own natures not capable of such enforcing
and convictive Proofs, to mix them with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more certain Reasonings, were only to
allay their strength, and dilute their perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity.</p>
            <p>And for this Reason have I purposely omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Examination of that Argument,
that so strongly possesses the warm and busie
brains of some undertaking men, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>Liberty of Conscience would be mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conducive to the advancement of
Trade.</hi> For whether it be so, or so, it matters
not, after it is proved to be apparently
destructive of the Peace of Kingdoms. And
though perhaps it might be no difficult task to
prove the vanity of their Conceit, yet, after
this performance, it would be at least a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
and frivolous undertaking; because no
man can be so utterly forsaken of all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Discretion, as to think of promoting
Traffick by any ways that are destructive of
the Ends and Interest of Government. And
therefore, if I have sufficiently proved, that
Liberty of Conscience is so; 'tis but an idle
speculation after that to enquire, what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
it would do to the advancement of
Trade: because 'tis already proved inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with a greater Good, than all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:64701:21"/>
of Commerce can amount to. So that
granting these Projecting People all they can
demand, and supposing their Design as service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the benefits of Trade, as they pretend;
yet, what can be more shamefully imprudent,
than to put the Kingdom upon so great an
hazard for so small an advantage? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Publick Peace and Settlement (that is the
first and Fundamental end of all Societies)
is to be valued above any advantages of
Wealth and Trading: and therefore, if Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience as naturally tends to the
disturbance of Government, as it can to the
advancement of Trade (if any thing may
be supposed to contribute to the Wealth of a
Nation that tends to the dissolution of its
Peace) so vast a mischief must infinitely out-weigh
this, and a thousand other lesser advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
For there is nothing in the world of value
enough to balance against Peace, but Peace it
self.</p>
            <p>And therefore I confess I cannot but smile
when I observe how some, that would be
thought wonderfully grave and solemn States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
labour with mighty Projects of setting
up this and that Manufacture, in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
respective Towns and Corporations; and
how eagerly they pursue these petty Attempts
beyond the great Affairs of a more Publick
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:64701:21"/>
and Vniversal Concernment; and how wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they neglect the Settlement of a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for the benefit of a Village or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.
If indeed the Affairs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were in a fix'd and establish'd condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
these Attempts might then have been
seasonable; and the enriching of particular
places would be an Accession to the Wealth
and Power of the whole Kingdom. But whilst
we are distracted among our selves, with such
a strange variety of Iealousies and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities;
whilst the Publick Peace and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is so unluckily defeated by Quarrels and
Mutinies of Religion; and whilst the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men are acted by such peevish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable
Principles; to erect and encourage
Trading Combinations, is only to build so many
nests of Faction and Sedition, and to enable
these giddy and humoursom People to create
publick Disturbances. For 'tis notorious, that
there is not any sort of People so inclinable to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Practices as the Trading part of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and their Pride and Arrogance natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increases with the improvement of their
stock. And, if we reflect upon our late miserable
Distractions, 'tis easie to observe, how the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
was chiefly hatch'd in the Shops of Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and cherish'd by the Zeal of Prentice-boys,
and City-gossips. And hence it is, that the
Fanatick Party appears so vastly numerous and
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:64701:22"/>
considerable, above and beyond their real num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
partly because these bold and giddy People
live in greater Societies of men, and so are
more observable; whereas in Country Towns
and Villages their account is inconsiderable,
and arises not (to speak within compass) above
the proportion of one to twenty; and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in those places where these Vermine natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
breed and swarm, they are always most
talkative, and clamorous, and full of Buzze:
and therefore, though their party be much the
least, and the meanest Interest; yet whilst their
number is conjectured by their noise, they make
a greater Appearance, than twice as many sober
and peaceable men. Riots and Tumults are
much more remarkable, than Societies of quiet
and composed People; and a rout of unlucky Boys
and Girls raise a greater noise (especially when
they wrangle among themselves) than all the
Parish beside. But whether they are more or
less considerable, 'tis a very odd and preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
piece of Policy, to design the inriching of
this sort of People, whilst their heads are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd
with Religious Lunacies: for it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
puts weapons into the hands of Madmen,
wherewith they may assault their Governours.
Their Fundamental Principles incline them to
perverse and restless Dispositions, that never
are, nor will be, satisfied with any establish'd
frame of things: And if the Affairs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:64701:22"/>
are not exactly model'd to their own nice
and peremptory Conceptions, that is ground
enough to overturn the present Settlement, and
to new model the Church by a more thorow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
Now whilst men are under the
power of this proud and peevish humour, wealth
does but only pamper and encourage their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and tempt them to a greater boldness
and insolence against Authority. And if their
Seditious Preachers do but blow the Trumpet
to Reformation <hi>(i. e.</hi> to have every thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
they dislike) how easily may they fire these
heady people into tumults and outrages? How
eagerly will they flow into their Party in spight
of all the Power and Opposition of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours?
And how prodigally will they empty
their Bags, and bring in even their Bodkins
and Thimbles, and Spoons to carry on the
Cause? He is a very silly man, and understands
nothing of the Follies, Passions, and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Humane Nature, who fees not that
there is no Creature so ungovernable, as a
<hi>Wealthy Fanatick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore let not men flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with idle hopes of Settlement, any
other way, than by suppressing all these
dissentions, and reducing the minds of men
to an Agreement and Vnity in Religious
Worship. For it is just as impossible to keep
different Factions of Religion quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:64701:23"/>
as it is to make the common people wise
men and Philosophers. If indeed we could sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them sober and discreet, it were then no
great danger to leave them to their Liberty;
but upon the same supposition we may as well
let them loose from all the Laws of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Policy: because if every private
man had wit &amp; honesty enough to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and his own Actions, there would be no
need of Publick Laws and Governours. And
yet upon this impossible Presumption stand all
the Pretenses for Liberty of Conscience, <hi>That,
if men were permitted it, they would use it
wisely and peaceably;</hi> than which 'tis hard
to suppose a greater Impossibility. For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the multitude is the same thing with
their Wisdom and Discretion: and therefore,
'tis as natural for them to fall into the snare of
an abused and vicious Conscience, as 'tis to be
rash &amp; foolish: For an erroneous Conscience is
but one sort of Folly, that relates to the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their moral Actions; in which they
are as ignorant, and as likely to mistake as in
any other Affairs of Humane Life. There is no
Observation in the world establish'd upon a
more certain and universal Experience, than
that the generality of mankind are not so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to any sort of Follies and Vices, as to
wild and unreasonable conceits of Religion;
and that, when their heads are possess'd with
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:64701:23"/>
them, there are no principles so pregnant with
mischief and disturbance as they. And if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would but consider, how liable mankind are
to abuse themselves with serious and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Villanies, they would quickly see it to be
absolutely necessary to the Peace and Happiness
of their Kingdoms, that there be set up a more
severe Government over mens Consciences and
Religious perswasions, than over their Vices
and Immoralities. For, of all Villains the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
Zealot is the most dangerous: Such
men have no checks of Conscience, nor fears of
miscarriage to damp their Industry, but their
Godliness makes them bold and furious; and,
however their Attempts succeed, they are sure
of the Rewards of Saints and Martyrs. And
what so glorious as to lose their lives in the
Cause of God? These men are ever prepared
for any mischief, if they have but a few active
and crafty Knaves to manage and set them on:
(and there is never want of such in any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.)
And there needs no other motive
to engage their Zeal in any Seditious Attempt,
than to instil into their minds the Necessity of
a thorow Reformation; and then you may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them wheresoever you please, and they will
never boggle at any Mischief, Out-rage, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
to advance the Cause. And therefore,
it concerns the Civil Magistrate to beware of
this sort of People above all others, as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:64701:24"/>
that is always ready formed for any Publick
Disturbance. One would think, the world were
not now to be taught, that there is nothing so
difficult to be managed as Godly Zeal, or to be
appeased as Religious Dissentions: People ever
did, and ever will pursue such Quarrels with
their utmost rage and fury; and therefore let
us be content to govern the world as it ever
has been, and ever must be govern'd; and not
be so fond as to trouble our heads with contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ways of Settling a Nation, whilst 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled
by Religion. Agreement in this is the
first, if not the only foundation of Peace: and
therefore, let that be first established upon
firm and lasting Principles; (which it easily
may by severe Laws faithfully executed, but
otherwise never can.) But till it is done, 'tis
just as wise and safe for a Prince to enrich his
Subjects with Trade and Commerce, as 'tis to
load weak and unfinished Foundations with
great and weighty Superstructures. to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
all Arguments are to be considered in
their proper place, and order: and 'tis but an
unskilful, and inartificial way of discoursing, to
argue from less weighty and considerable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
against the first and Fundamental reasons
of things; and yet of this preposterous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
are those men guilty, who talk of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of Trade in opposition to the Interests of
Government: And therefore for a fuller An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:64701:24"/>
to this, and all other the like pretenses, I
shall now refer the Reader to my Book; where
I think I have proved enough to satisfie any
man of an ordinary understanding, That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
and Toleration is the most absolute
sort of Anarchy, and that Princes may with
less hazard give Liberty to mens Vices and
Debaucheries, than to their Consciences. As for
my Method, 'tis plain and familiar, and suited
to every man's Capacity; I have reduced the
state of the Controversie to a few easie and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Propositions; under these I have couch'd
all the particular matters concern'd in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Debates, and by Analogy to their Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
have cleared off all Difficulties and
Objections; and have been careful all along
to prove the absolute Necessity of what I assert
from the most important ends and designs of
Government, compared with the Natural Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Inclinations of Mankind. And
whoever offers to talk of these Affairs without
special regard both to the Nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to the Nature of Man, may amuse
himself with the fine Dreams and Hypotheses
of a warm brain; but shall be certain to miss
the necessary Rules of Life, and the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
measures of practicable Policy; that are
suited only to the Humours and Passions of
men, and designed only to prevent their Follies,
and bridle their Enormities. And therefore the
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:64701:25"/>
main Notion I have pursued has been to make
out, how dangerous a thing Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is, considering the Tempers, and Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Humane Nature, to the most necessary
ends and designs of Government. A vein of
which Reasoning I have been careful to run
through all parts and Branches of my Discourse,
it being vastly the most considerable, if not the
only thing to be attended to in this Enquiry.
And as I have kept close to my main Question,
so have I cautiously avoided all other collateral
and unnecessary Disputes; and have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
my self to any Hypothesis, nor determined
any Controversie, in which it was not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
concern'd; but have expressed my Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
in so general terms, as that they might be
equally forcible upon the minds of all men, of
howsoever different Perswasions in all other
matters.</p>
            <p>And now I have no other Favour, or Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to request of the Reader, than that he would
suspend his Iudgment, till he have seriously
perused, and weighed all parts of the following
Treatise: But, if he shall pass Sentence upon any
part, before he has considered the whole, he
will in all probability put himself to the pains
of raising those Objections, I have already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
to his hand; and perhaps the next thing
he condemns may be his own Rashness.</p>

               <p>THe Competition between the Power
of Princes, and the Consciences of
Subjects, represented. The mischiefs that
unavoidably follow upon the Exemption
of Conscience from the Iurisdiction of
the Supreme Power. The absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of its being subject in affairs of
Religion to the Governours of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
This proved at large, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Religion has the strongest influence
upon the Peace of Kingdoms, and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64701:26"/>
Interests of Government. Religion is
so far from being exempted from the
Restraints of Laws and Penalties, that
nothing more requires them. 'Tis more
easie to govern mens Vices than their
Consciences, because all men are bold
and confident in their Perswasions. The
remiss Government of Conscience has
ever been the most fatal miscarriage
in all Common-wealths. Impunity of
Offenders against Ecclesiastical Laws,
the worst sort of Toleration. The Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
that ensue upon the permitting
men the Liberty of their Consciences are
endless. Fanaticism a boundless Folly.
Affairs of Religion as they must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Supreme Civil Power, so to
none other. The Civil and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Iurisdictions issue from the same Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Nature, and are founded upon
the same Reason of things. A brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Original of Civil Power.
The Original of Ecclesiastical Power the
same. In the first Ages of the World,
the Kingly Power and Priestly Function
were always vested in the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and why. When they were sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the Iewish State, the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
was annexed to the Civil Power.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64701:26"/>
And so continued until, and after our
Saviours Birth. No need of his giving
Princes any new Commission to exercise
that power, that was antecedently vested
in them by so unquestionable a Right.
And therefore the Scripture rather sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
than asserts it. The argument
against penal Laws in Religion from the
practice of our Saviour and his Apostles,
answered and confuted. The Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Iurisdiction of Princes not derived
from any grant of our Saviours, but
from the natural and antecedent Rights
of all Sovereign Power. Christ and his
Apostles could not use any coercive Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
because they acted in the
capacity of Subjects. Their threatnings
of Eternity carry in them as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
upon Conscience, as secular pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.
The power of the Church
purely spiritual. In the first Ages of the
Christian Church God supplied its want
of Civil Iurisdiction by immediate and
miraculous Inflictions from Heaven.
Diseases of the Body the usual conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of Excommunication. And this
had the same effect as temporal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
All this largely proved out of
the writings of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> When the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64701:27"/>
Emperors became Christian, the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Iurisdiction was reannext to the
Civil Power. And so continued till the
Vsurpation of the Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi>
How since the Reformation the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Power of Princes has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
by some pragmatical Divines.
Their Confidence has scared Princes out
of their Natural Rights. Of the clause
of Exception annexed to the <hi>Jejunium

from all the Premisses for the absolute
Necessity of the Ecclesiastical Power of

            </argument>
            <p>§ 1. NOtwithstanding that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is the best, if not
the only security of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
yet has Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
never been controul'd or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd
so much by any thing as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
This has ever rival'd Princes
in their Supremacy, and pretends to as
uncontroulable an Authority over all
the Actions and Affairs of humane life,
as the most absolute and unlimited
Power durst ever challenge. Are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64701:27"/>
Gods Vicegerents? so is this.
Have they a power of deciding all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies?
so has this. Can they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
Rules of Virtue and Goodness
to their Subjects? so may this. Can
they punish all their Criminal Actions?
so can this. And are they subject and
accountable to God alone? so is this,
that owns no superiour but the Lord of
Consciences. And of the two Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
seems to be the greater Sovereign,
and to govern the larger Empire. For
whereas the Power of Princes is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to the outward actions of men,
this extends its Dominion to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thoughts: Its throne is seated in
their minds, and it exercises all that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over their secret and hidden sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
that Princes claim over their
publick and visible practices. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account is it set up upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
to grapple with the Scepters
and Swords of Princes, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
any Laws, they think good to
prescribe; and whenever Subjects have
a mind to controul or disobey their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
this is immediately prest and
engaged to their Party, and does not
only dictate, but vouches all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64701:28"/>
Do Subjects rebel against
their Sovereign? 'tis Conscience that
takes up Arms. Do they murder Kings?
'tis under the conduct of Conscience.
Do they separate from the Communion
of the Church? 'tis Conscience that
is the Schismatick. Do they tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by one Oath to contradict and
evacuate another? 'tis Conscience that
imposes it. Every thing any man has a
mind to, is his Conscience; and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Treason, and Rebellion plead its
Authority. The Annals and Histories of
all times and places are too sad a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that this great and sacred thing has
ever been abused, either through the
Folly of some, or Hypocrisie of others,
to patronize the most desperate Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
and Villanies, that were ever
acted.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Here then we see is a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
between the Prerogative of the
Prince, and that of Conscience, <hi>i. e.</hi> every
private mans own judgment and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of things: The judgment of the
Magistrate inclines him to Command,
that of the Subject to Disobey; and the
Dictates of his Conscience countermand
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64701:28"/>
the Decrees of his Prince. Now is there
not likely to be untoward doings, when
two Supreme Powers thus clash and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
each other? For what power
would be left to Princes, if every private
mans perswasion (for that is his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
may give check to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?
Most mens minds or Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are weak, silly, and ignorant things,
acted by fond and absurd principles, and
imposed upon by their vices and their
passions; so that were they entirely left
to their own conduct, in what mischiefs
and confusions must they involve all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties?
Let Authority command what
it please, they would do what they list.
And what is this but a state of perfect
Anarchy, in which every man does what
is good in his own eyes? And therefore
whilst men contend for the Sovereign
Empire of their Consciences, and invest
it with the Royal supremacy, by making
it subject and accountable to none but
God alone, they do in effect but usurp
their Prince's Crown, defie his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and acknowledge no Governour
but themselves. For seeing that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is nothing but the judgment and
opinion of their own Actions, if this be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64701:29"/>
exempt from the Commands of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and if men not only may, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ought to comply with their own
Dictates, when they oppose their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
'tis easie to determine whether
themselves or their Governors be vested
with the Supreme Authority. In brief,
every single person is subject to two Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Powers, the Laws of his Prince,
and the Dictates of his Conscience, <hi>i. e.</hi>
to his own and his Princes Opinion: and
therefore if the Supreme Power of the
Prince must give place to that of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
it ceases upon that score to be
Supreme; because there is a Superior
Authority that can countermand all its
Laws and Constitutions. What then is to
be done in this case? Who shall arbitrate
between these two mighty rival Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and so justly assign the true bounds
of their respective Dominions; that
Princes may never intrench upon the
rights of Conscience, nor Conscience
lay waste the rights of Princes, but both
may act within their proper spheres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
invading each others Territories?
For whenever their Powers happen to
interfere, the quarrel quickly proceeds to
all the mischiefs and confusions of War.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64701:29"/>
For there is not any thing so tender, or
so unruly as Conscience: if Authority
curb it too severely, it grows wild and
furious, and impatient of all restraints;
if it permit it an unbridled liberty, it
soon runs it self into all the mischiefs and
enormities in the world. And therefore
it must be managed with equal tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and severity: and as it must be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by wise and sober Laws, else it grows
giddy and exorbitant; so must it not be
provoked to resistance by Tyranny and
Oppression: for if it once put the Sword
into Subjects hands, it proves of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
the most fatal and implacable, and
is the best Commander of a Rebellious
Army in the world. We see then that
'tis a matter of equal difficulty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to avoid all the mischiefs and
calamities that naturally follow upon the
Contentions of these two Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
'Tis difficult to bring them to terms
of Accommodation, because neither of
them will own any Superiour that may
umpire their Controversie; and yet that
this should be done is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the Peace, Settlement, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of all Common-wealths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64701:30"/>
§ 3. And therefore 'tis the design of
this Discourse by a fair and impartial
Debate to compose all their Differences,
adjust all their quarrels and contentions,
and settle things upon their true and
proper foundations. Which I think
may be effectually enough perform'd by
these two considerations.</p>
            <p>1. By proving it to be absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the Peace and Government of
the World, that the Supreme Magistrate
of every Common-wealth should be
vested with a Power to govern and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
the Consciences of Subjects in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Religion.</p>
            <p>2. By shewing this to be so certain
and undoubted a truth, that it is and
must be acknowledged by its fiercest Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries;
and that those who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
the supreme Civil Power of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in reference to the Conduct of
the worship of God, are forced to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it in other more material parts of
Religion; though they are both liable to
the same inconveniences and objections.
And this will oblige me to state the true
extent of the Magistrates power over
Conscience in reference to Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64701:30"/>
by shewing it to be the very same
with his Power over Conscience in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Morality, and all other Affairs of
Religion. Under one of which two
Considerations I shall have occasion to
state the most material Questions, and
to answer the most considerable Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that occur in this Controversie.
And I do not question but things may be
made out with that demonstrative evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and settled upon such safe and
moderate principles, as may abundantly
satisfie every mans Conscience, how nice
and curious soever, provided it be not
debauch'd with vice, and wicked princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;.
but if it be, then 'tis easie to make
it appear both the Magistrates Duty and
Interest to punish such vicious and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased
Conscience as much as all other
immorality.</p>
            <p>§ 4. First then 'tis absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Peace and Tranquillity of the
Commonwealth, which, though it be the
prime and most important end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
can never be sufficiently se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
unless Religion be subject to the
Authority of the Supreme Power, in that
it has the strongest influence upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64701:31"/>
Affairs; and therefore if the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power cannot order and manage it,
it would be but a very incompetent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of publick happiness, would
want the better half of it self, and be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
weak and ineffectual for the ends of
Government. For 'tis certain, nothing
more governs the minds of men than the
apprehensions of Religion: this leads or
drives them any way. And as true Piety
secures the publick weal by taming and
civilizing the passions of men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uring
them to a mild, gentle and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
spirit: So superstition and wrong
notions of God and his Worship, are the
most powerful engines to overturn its
settlement. And therefore unless Princes
have Power to bind their Subjects to that
Religion that they apprehend most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to publick Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity,
and restrain those Religious
mistakes that tend to its subversion;
they are no better than Statues and
Images of Authority, and want that
part of their Power that is most necessary
to a right discharge of their Government.
For what if the minds of men happen
to be tainted with such furious and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
Conceptions of Religion, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64701:31"/>
them to stubborness and Sedition,
and make them unmanageable to the
Laws of Government; shall not a Prince
be allowed to give check to such unruly
and dangerous Perswasions? If he may,
then 'tis clear that he is endued with a
power to conduct Religion, and that
must be subject to his Dominion, as well
as all other Affairs of State. But if he
may not, then is he obliged in some cases
tamely to permit his Subjects to ruine
and overturn the Common-wealth. For
if their wild and capricious humours are
not severely bridled by the strictest Laws
and Penalties, they soon grow headstrong
and unruly, become always troublesome,
and often fatal to Princes. The minds of
the multitude are of a fierce and eager
temper, apt to be driven without bounds
and measures, whithersoever their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
hurry them: and when they have
overheated their unsettled heads with
religious rage and fury, they grow wild,
talkative and ungovernable; and in their
mad and raving fits of zeal break all the
restraints of Government, and forget all
the laws of order and sobriety. Religion
sanctifies all their passions: anger, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and bitterness are holy fervors in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64701:32"/>
the Cause of God. This cancels and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenses
with all the obligations of sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety:
And what has prudence to do with
Religion? this is too hot and eager to
be tyed up to its flat and dull formalities.
Zeal for the Glory of God will both
excuse and justifie any Enormity. There
can be no Faction or Rebellion in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Interests of the Godly Party,
and the great work of a thorough Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
must not be trusted to the care
of carnal and lukewarm Politicians.
And by these and the like pretences do
they easily destroy the reverence of all
things Sacred and Civil, to propagate
any wild Propositions; are arm'd with
Religion, and led on by the Spirit of God
to disturb the Publick Peace, kill Kings,
and overthrow Kingdoms. And this has
ever been the bane and reproach of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in all times and places: and there
is scarce a Nation in the world that has
not felt the miseries and confusions of an
Holy War: and the Annals of all Ages
are full of sad Stories to this purpose.</p>
            <p>§ 5. And therefore to exempt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and the Consciences of men from
the Authority of the Supreme Power is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64701:32"/>
but to expose the peace of Kingdoms to
every wild and Fanatick Pretender, who
may, when ever he pleases, under preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Reformation thwart and unsettle
Government without controul; seeing
no one can have any power to restrain
the perswasions of his Conscience. And
Religion will be so far from being at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
from the Authority of the Civil
Power, that nothing in the world will be
found to require more of its care and
Influence, because there is not any other
Vice to which the vulgar sort of men
are more prone, than to Superstition or
debauched conceptions concerning God
and his Worship, nor any that more
inclines them to an unruly and seditious
temper. It inflames their crazy heads
with a Furious and Sectarian Zeal, and
adopts their rankest and most untoward
passions into the Duties of Religion. And
when passion becomes Holy, then it can
never be exorbitant; but the more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and ungovernable it is, so much the
more vehement is their zeal for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God; and they that are most pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
and refractory, are upon that account
the most godly. And then all passion
and stubbornness in Religious Quarrels
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64701:33"/>
must be christned Zeal, all Zeal must be
sacred, and nothing that is sacred can be
excessive. And now when men act furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
upon these mistakes (as all that are
possessed with them must) what can the
issue be but eternal Miseries and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions?
Every Opinion must make a Sect,
and every Sect a Faction, and every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
when it is able, a War, and every
War is the Cause of God, and the Cause
of God can never be prosecuted with too
much violence. And then all sobriety is
lukewarmness, to be obedient to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
carnal Complyance, and not to
proceed to Rebellion for carrying on the
great work of a thorough Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is to want Zeal for the Glory of God.
And thus are their Vices sanctified by
their Consciences, malice, folly, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are ever the prevailing ingredients
of their superstitious Zeal, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
only obliges them to be more sturdy
and impudent against the Laws of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and they are now encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to cherish those passions in spight
of Authority, from which the severity
of Laws might effectually have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
them, were it not for the cross
obligations of an untoward Conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64701:33"/>
§ 6. And for this reason is it, that
'tis found so nice and difficult a thing
to govern men in their perswasions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Religion, beyond all the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
and transactions of humane life;
because erroneous Consciences are bold
and confident enough to outface Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
whereas persons of debauch'd and
scandalous lives, being condemn'd by
their own Consciences as well as the
publick Laws, can have nothing to
bear them up against the will of their
Superiors, and restraints of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But when mens minds are possest
with such unhappy Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as are more destructive of the Peace
and Order of civil Society than open
lewdness and debauchery, and when
the Vertues of the Godly are more
pregnant with villany and mischief than
the Vices of the wicked, and when their
Consciences are satisfied in their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
and ungovernable perswasions,
and when they seriously believe that
they approve themselves to God by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
refractory and irreclamable in their
Fanatick Zeal, then how easie is it to
defie Authority, and trample upon all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64701:34"/>
its threatnings and penalities? And those
Laws, that would awe a prophane and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
Person at least into an outward
compliance, shall but exasperate a boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Conscience into a more vehement
and seditious disobedience. Now when
'tis so difficult for Magistrates either to
remove these Religious Vices, or to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
their unruliness, they must needs find
it an incomparably harder task to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the extravagancies of Zeal, than of
Lewdness and Debauchery. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seeing the multitude is so inclinable
to these mistakes of Religion, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when they are infected with them,
they grow so turbulent and unruly, I
leave it to Governours themselves to
judge, whether it does not concern them
with as much vigilance and severity ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prevent their rise or suppress their
growth, as to punish any the foulest
crimes of Immorality? And if they would
but seriously consider into what exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
peevish and untoward principles
about Religion naturally improve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they could not but perceive it to
be as much their concernment to punish
them with the severest inflictions, as any
whatsoever Principles of Rebellion in
the State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64701:34"/>
§ 7. And this certainly has ever been
one of the most fatal miscarriages of all
Governours, in that they have not been
aware of this fierce and implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
but have gone about to govern un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
Consciences by more easie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
Laws, than those that are only able to
suppress scandalous and confessed villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and have thought them sufficiently
restrain'd by threatning punishments,
without inflicting them. And indeed in
most Kingdoms (so little have Princes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
their own Interests in reference
to Religion) Ecclesiastical Laws have
been set up only for Scar-crows, being
established rather for shew and Form
sake, than with any design of giving them
life, by putting them into Execution;
and if any were so hardy as not to be
scared into obedience by the severity
of their threatnings, they have been
emboldned to disobedience by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misness
of their execution, till they have
not only plaid with the Law it self as a
sensless trifle, but have scorn'd the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Power that set it up. For there
is nothing more certain in experience,
than that Impunity gives not only war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64701:35"/>
but encouragement to Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and by habituating men to controul
the Edicts of Authority, teaches them by
degrees to despise it. And this is the main
reason why Ecclesiastical Laws have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
proved such ineffectual instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Uniformity, because they have
either been weakned through want of
execution, or in a manner cancell'd by
the oppositions of Civil Constitutions.
For when Laws are bound under severe
penalties, and when the Persons, who are
to take cognisance of the Crime, have
not Power enough to punish it, or are
perpetually check'd and controul'd by a
stronger Power, no wonder if the Laws
be affronted and despised; and if, instead
of bringing mens minds to compliance
and subjection, they exasperate them
into open contumacy. Restraint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
their stubbornness, and yet redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
not the mischief. And therefore
it were better to grant an uncontroul'd
Liberty by declaring for it, than, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having declared against it, to grant
it by silence and impunity. The Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
disobliges Dissenters, and that is
one evil; and the impunity allows them
Toleration, and that is a greater: and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64701:35"/>
where Governours permit, what their
Laws forbid, there the Common-wealth
must at once lose all the advantages of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
and suffers all the inconveniences
of Liberty. So that as they would expect
Peace and Settlement, they must be sure
at first to bind on their Ecclesiastical
Laws with the streightest knot, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to keep them in force and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
by the severest Execution; in that
wild and Fanatick Consciences are too
headstrong to be curb'd with an ordinary
severity; &amp; therefore their restraints must
be proportion'd to their unruliness: and
they must be managed with so much a
greater care and strictness, than all other
principles of publick disturbance, by how
much they are more dangerous &amp; unruly.</p>
            <p>§ 8. For if Conscience be ever able
to break down the restraints of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and all men have Licence to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their own perswasions, the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
is infinite, and the folly endless;
and they seldom cease to wander from
folly to folly, till they have run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into all the whimsies and enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that can debauch Religion, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
the publick Peace. The giddy Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64701:36"/>
are of a restless and stragling hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
and yet withalso ignorant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious,
that there is nothing so strange
and uncouth, which they will not take up
with Zeal and Confidence: Insomuch
that there never yet was any Common-wealth,
that gave a real liberty to mens
Imaginations, that was not suddenly
over-run with numberless divisions, and
subdivisions of Sects: as was notorious
in the late Confusions, when Liberty of
Conscience was laid as the Foundation
of Settlement. How was Sect built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sect, and Church upon Church, till
they were advanced to such a height of
Folly, that the Usurpers themselves
could find no other way to work their
subversion, and put an end to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies,
but by overturning their
own Foundations, and checking their
growth by Laws and Penalties? The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of Fanaticising is a boundless folly,
it knows no restraints; and if it be not
kept down by the severity of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
it grows and encreases without
end, or limit, and never ceases to swell
it self, till it has broke down all the
banks and restraints of Government.
Thus when the Disciplinarians had in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64701:36"/>
pursuit of their own peevish and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Principles divided from the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> others upon a farther
improvement of the same principles sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
from them; every new opinion
was enough to found a new Church, and
Sect was spawn'd out of Sect, till there
were almost as many Churches as Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
For when they were once parted
from the order &amp; sobriety of the Church
they lived in, nothing could set bounds
to their wild and violent Imaginations.</p>
            <p>§ 9. Schismaticks always run themselves
into the same excess in the Church as
Rebels and Seditious Persons do in the
State, who out of a hatred to Tyranny are
restless till they have dissolved the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
into Anarchy &amp; Confusion;
and, because some Kingly Governments
have proved Tyrannical, will allow no
free States but under Republicks. As
was notorious in all the Apologies for
the late Usurpers, who took it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in general, That all Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a single Person was slavish and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
without respect to its particular
Constitutions; and that the very name
of a Common-wealth was a sufficient
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64701:37"/>
preservation of the Peoples Liberties,
notwithstanding that those who mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it were never so Imperious and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
in the exercise of their Power.
And in the same manner our Church Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,
out of abhorrency to the Papal
Tyranny and Usurpation upon mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
never think the liberty of
their Consciences sufficiently secured, till
they have shaken off all subjection to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Authority: and because the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> by her unreasonable Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
has invaded the Fundamental Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of mankind, they presently conclude
all restraints upon licentious Practices
and Perswasions about Religion under
the hated name of Popery. And some
Theological Empericks have so possess'd
the peoples heads with this fond conceit,
that they will see no middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
spiritual Tyranny, and spiritual
Anarchy, and so brand all restraint of
Government in Affairs of Religion as if
it were Antichristian, and never think
themselves far enough from <hi>Rome,</hi> till
they are wandred as far as <hi>Munster.</hi>
Whereas the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her
first Reformation was not so wild as to
abolish all Ecclesiastical Authority, but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64701:37"/>
only removed it from those who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
usurp'd it to its proper seat, and
restrain'd it within its due bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits:
And because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
had clogg'd Christianity with too many
garish and burdensome Ceremonies, they
did not immediately strip her naked of
all modest and decent Ornaments out of
an over-hot opposition to their too flant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pomp and Vanity, but only cloathed
her in such a Dress, as became the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and Sobriety of Religion. And this
is the Wisdom and Moderation of our
Church to preserve us sober between
two such unreasonable Extremes.</p>
            <p>§ 10. But not to run too hastily into
particular disputes, 'tis enough at present
to have proved in general the absolute
necessity that Affairs of Religion should
be subject to Government; and then if
they be exempt from the Jurisdiction of
the Civil Power, I shall demand, Whether
they are subject to any other Power, or
to none at all? If the former, then the
Supreme Power is not Supreme, but is
subject to a Superiour in all matters of
Religion, or rather (what is equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd)
there would be two Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64701:38"/>
in every Common-wealth; for it the
Princes Jurisdiction be limited to Civil
Affairs, and the concerns of Religion be
subject to another Government, then may
Subjects be obliged to (what is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
contradictory Commands: and at the
same time the Civil Magistrate requires
him to defend his Country against an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion,
the Ecclesiastical Governour may
command him to abandon its defence,
for the carrying on an Holy War in the
Holy Land, in order to the recovery of
our Saviour's Sepulchre from the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Turks and Saracens. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no man can be subject to contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
obligations, 'tis by consequence utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impossible he should be subject to two
Supreme Powers.</p>
            <p>If the latter, then the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
returns; and as to one half of the
concerns of the Common-wealth there
must be a perfect Anarchy, and no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
at all. And there is no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
to be made against all those pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
mischiefs and disturbances that may
arise from Errors and Enormities in
Religion; the Common-wealth must for
ever be exposed to the follies of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts,
and villanies of Impostors; and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64701:38"/>
any man, that can but pretend Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
may whenever he pleases endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
its Ruine: So that if Princes should
forego their sovereignty over mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
in matters of Religion, they
leave themselves less Power than is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to the Peace &amp; Defence
of the Common-wealths they govern. In
brief, the Supreme Government of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Common-wealth, wherever it is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
must of necessity be universal, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
and uncontroulable, in all Afairs
whatsoever, that concern the Interests of
mankind, and the ends of Government:
For if it be limited, it may be controul'd:
but 'tis a thick and palpable Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to call such a Power Supreme, in that
whatever controuls it must as to that case
be its Superiour. And therefore Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Religion being so strongly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential
upon Affairs of State, and having
so great a power either to advance or
hinder the publick felicity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
they must be as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulably
subject to the Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as all other Civil Concerns; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
otherwise it will not have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
enough to secure the Publick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the Society, to attain the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64701:39"/>
and most important ends of its
Institution.</p>
            <p>§ 11. Now from these Premisses we
may observe, That all Supreme Power;
both in Civil and Ecclesiastical Affairs,
issues from the same Original, and is
founded upon the same Reason of things;
namely the indispensable necessity of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
to the preservation of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of Government to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Humane Society: a Supreme
Power being absolutely necessary to the
decision of all those Quarrels and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
that are naturally consequent
upon the Passions, Appetites, and Follies
of men, there being no other way of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Differences but by the Decrees
of a final &amp; unappealable Judicature. For
if every man were to be his own Judge,
mens Determinations would be as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
as their Judgments, &amp; their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as their Humours or Interests; and
so must their Dissentions of necessity be
endless: And therefore to avoid these and
all other Inconveniences that would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follow upon a state of War, it
was necessary there should be one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and Publick Judgment, to whose
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64701:39"/>
Determinations the private Judgment of
every single person should be obliged to
submit it self. And hence the Wisdom of
Providence, knowing to what passions
and irregularities mankind is obnoxious,
never suffered them to live without the
restraints of Government; but in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of things so ordered affairs, that
no man could be born into the world
without being subject to some Superior:
every father being by nature vested with
a right to govern his children. And the
first governments in the world were esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
purely upon the natural Rights
of paternal Authority, which afterward
grew up to a Kingly Power by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of posterity; and he that was at
first but Father of a Family, in process of
time, as that multiplied, became Father
of a City, or Province: and hence it
came to pass that in the first Ages of the
World, Monarchy was its only Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
necessarily arising out of the
Constitution of humane Nature, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so natural for Families to enlarge
themselves into Cities by uniting into a
body according to their several Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,
whence by consequence the
Supreme Head of those Families must
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64701:40"/>
become Prince and Governour of a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
&amp; more diffused Society. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cedrenus</hi> makes <hi>Adam</hi> the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
in the World, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And thus
afterwards in the division of the Earth
among the Posterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> the heads
of Families became Kings and Monarchs
of the Nations of which they were Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
from whence were propagated the
several Kingdoms of the first and elder
times; as appears not only from the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick</hi>
History, but also from all other the
best and most ancient Records of the first
Ages of the World: But as for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
they are comparatively
of a very late discovery, being first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracies
and Optimacies were made
out of the Ruines of Monarchick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
which was but sutable to the
proud, factious, and capricious humour of
that Nation, where scarce any one could
pretend to a little skill in <hi>Poetry or Wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
(their two greatest accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
but he must immediately be an
<hi>Vndertaker</hi> for new modelling the
Common-wealth; which doubtless was
one of the main causes of their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64701:40"/>
Confusions, and frequent Charges
in Government.</p>
            <p>§ 12. Having thus firmly founded all
Civil Government upon <hi>Paternal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
I may now proceed to shew, That
all Ecclesiastical Power bottoms upon
the same Foundation: For as in the first
Ages of the world, the Fathers of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
were vested with a <hi>Kingly Power</hi> over
their own Posterity; so also were they
with the <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> executing all the
Holy Functions of Priesthood in their
own Persons, as appears from the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
testimony of Histories both Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and Prophane. Thus we find all the
Ancient Patriarchs Priests to their own
Families; which Office descended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Royal Dignity to the
first-born of each Family. And this custom
of investing the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> with the
<hi>Supreme Priesthood,</hi> was (as divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
both Ancient and Modern observe)
universally practis'd over all Kingdoms of
the world for well nigh 2500 years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any one president to the contrary.</p>
            <p>In that among all Societies of men
there is as great a necessity of publick
Worship, as of publick Justice; the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64701:41"/>
power whereof, because it must be seated
somewhere, can properly belong to him
alone, in whom the Supreme Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides;
in that he alone having authority
to assign to every subject his proper fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and among others this of the
Priesthood; the exercise whereof as he
has power to transfer to another, so may
he, if he please, reserve it to himself. And
therefore this the wisdom of the elder
Ages always practised, in order to the
better security of their Government; as
well knowing the tendency of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and false notions of the divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
to Tumults and Seditions; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to prevent the disturbances that
might spring from Factions in Religion,
they were sollicitous to keep its manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their own immediate disposal.
And though in the Jewish Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
the Priestly Office was upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
peculiar to that State separated by a
divine positive command from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Power; yet the Power and Jurisdiction
of the Priest remained still subject to the
Sovereign Prince, their King always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
a Supremacy over all persons,
and in all Causes Ecclesiastical: Nothing
can be more unquestionable than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64701:41"/>
of <hi>David, Solomon, Hezekiah,
Iehu, Iehosaphat, Iosiah,</hi> &amp;c. who exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
as full a Legislative Power in Affairs
of Religion, as in Affairs of State. They
alone restrain'd and punish'd whatever
tended to the subversion of the Publick
and establish'd Religion; they suppress'd
Innovations, reform'd Corruptions, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Decencies and Solemnities of
publick Worship, instituted new Laws
and Ceremonies, and conducted all the
concerns of Religion by their own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Authority. Now there is nothing
that can be pretended against the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Jurisdiction of Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
that might not with as great a
shew of Reason have been urged against
these Jewish Kings.</p>
            <p>§ 13. And thus were the Affairs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in all Nations govern'd by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power till our blessed Saviour's
birth, who came into the world to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
new Laws of Religion, and not to set
up any new Models of Politie. He came
not to unsettle the Foundations of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or to diminish the natural
Rights of Princes, and settle the conduct
of humane affairs upon new Principles,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64701:42"/>
but left the Government of the world in
the same condition he found it: All his
Discourses were directed to private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and such whose duty it was to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
and not Command; and therefore
though we find him every where highly
solicitous to press men to Obedience in
general, (and perhaps it would be no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
task to find out any Professors of the
Art of Policy, either ancient or modern,
that have carried the Doctrine of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
so high as the Sermons of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and the Writings of his Apostles)
yet no where he takes upon him to settle,
much less to limit the Prerogatives of
Princes; and therefore the Government
of Religion, being vested in them by
an antecedent and natural Right, must
without all controversie belong to them,
till it is derogated from them by some
Superiour Authority: so that unless our
Saviour had expresly disrobed the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Power</hi> of its Ecclesiastical Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nothing else can alienate it from
their <hi>Prerogative.</hi> And therefore 'tis
no wonder if he left no Commands to
the Civil Magistrate for the right Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Religion; for to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
should he give them a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64701:42"/>
to exercise that Power, that was
already so firmly establish'd in the world
by the unalterable dictates of Natural
Reason, and Universal Practice, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Nations: it being so clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
from the Supreme Power in
every Common-wealth, that it loses both
its Supremacy, and its usefulness, unless
it be universal and unlimited? In that
the end of all Government is to secure
the Peace and Tranquillity of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
and therefore it must have Power to
manage and order every thing that is
serviceable to that end. So that it being
so clearly evident from the experience
of mankind, and from the nature of the
thing it self, that nothing has a stronger
influence upon the publick Interests of a
Nation, than the well or ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion; its conduct must needs
be as certain and inseparable a Right of
the Supreme Power in every Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
as the Legislative Authority it
self; without which 'tis utterly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
there should be any Government at
all. And therefore the Scripture seems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to suppose than assert the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Jurisdiction of Princes. What else
means that Promise, That Kings shall be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64701:43"/>
               <hi>nursing Fathers to the Church</hi> of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
by their Power they may cherish and
defend the true Religion, and protect it
from being destroyed by Hereticks and
Seducers? What does the Scripture
mean when it styles our Saviour <hi>King of
Kings,</hi> and makes Princes his Vicegerents
here on earth? What means the Apostle,
when he says, Kings are appointed to this
end, <hi>That under them we may live a quiet
and peaceable life, not only in all honesty,
but in all godliness too?</hi> Where we see, that
the propagation of Godliness is as much
the Duty of Governours, as the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Justice; neither of which can
a Prince (as such) effectually promote,
but by the proper effects of his Power,
<hi>Laws and Penalties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides all which, all the Power of the
Common-wealth our Saviour lived in,
was fall'n into such mens hands, that
would be so far from concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the defence, protection, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of Christianity, that he knew
they would exert the utmost of their
force to suppress and destroy it. Now to
what purpose should he entrust them
with a Commission to govern his
Church, when he knew they would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64701:43"/>
its utter ruine and destruction? And
hence was there no other peaceable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to propagate the Christian Faith in
the world, but by the patience and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of its Professors: and therefore
our Saviour, to secure his Religion from
the reproach of being Factious and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
against the State, was sollicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things to arm them with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Patience; and to this purpose
he gave them glorious promises to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
their submission to their unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Fate, and severe Injunctions to secure
their Obedience to all the Commands of
lawful Superiours, except when they run
directly cross to the Interest of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
which as the posture of Affairs
then stood, was incomparably the most
effectual, as well as most innocent way of
its propagation.</p>
            <p>§ 14. And therefore 'tis but an idle
and impertinent Plea that some men
make for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> when they
would restrain the Magistrates Power
so, as to make use of no other means
than what our Saviour and his Apostles
used to convince and convert men: An
Argument that much resembles that,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64701:44"/>
which they urge with so much popular
noise and confidence against that little
Grandeur &amp; Authority that is left to the
Governours of our Church; because for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
the Apostles, by reason of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
juncture of Affairs in their times,
lived in a mean and persecuted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore what was their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
these men would make our Duty:
but it were to be wished they would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
their Argument to all the purposes
for which it may as rationally serve: and
so they must sell their Lands, and bring
the money and lay it at the <hi>Bishops</hi> Feet;
they must pass away all their Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and have <hi>all things in common, and
part them to all men as every man has
need,</hi> because the Primitive Christians
did so. At so prodigious a rate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency
do men talk, when their Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
dictate their Discourses; and to so
fine a pass would the Affairs of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
be brought by this trifling pretence
of reducing the state of the Church to
its Primitive Practice in all accidents and
circumstances of things.</p>
            <p>But yet I suppose these men themselves
would scarce imitate the practice of our
Saviour and his Apostles in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64701:44"/>
for if the Scribes and Pharisees were
now in being, I hope they would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them the liberty openly to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
the Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
all that would not believe him an
Impostor; which though they did fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
in his own time, yet he never went
about to restrain their Blasphemies by
Laws and Punishments: and therefore I
only demand, Whether the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
may make penal Laws against
Swearing and Blasphemy, and such other
Irreligious Debaucheries? If he may,
why then they are matters that as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and immediately relate to Religion, as
any Rites and Ceremonies of Worship
whatsoever; and for the Government of
which they are as utterly to seek for any
Precedent of our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
Nay more, if this Argument were of
any force, it would equally deprive the
Magistrate of any Power to compel his
Subjects to obedience to any of the moral
Precepts of the Gospel by secular Laws
and Punishments; because our Saviour
and his Apostles never did it: especially
when all matters of Morality do as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
belong to our spiritual concerns, as
any thing that relates immediately to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64701:45"/>
Divine Worship, and Affairs of meer
Religion; and therefore if the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
may not compel his Subjects to a
right way of Worship with the Civil
Sword, because this is of a spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
(as is pretended:) upon the
same ground, neither may he make use of
the same force to compel men to Duties
of Morality, because they also equally
relate to their spiritual Interests: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the Magistrates Authority in both is
founded upon the same Principle, <hi>viz.</hi>
The absolute necessity of their due Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
in order to the Peace and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Common-wealth. We
derive not therefore his Ecclesiastical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
from any grant of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
but from an antecedent right where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
all Sovereign Power was indued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever he was born into the world;
forasmuch as the same Providence, that
intrusted Princes with the Government of
Humane Affairs, must of necessity have
vested them in at least as much Power, as
was absolutely necessary to the nature
and ends of Government.</p>
            <p>§ 15. But further yet, all the ways
our Saviour has appointed in the Gospel
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64701:45"/>
for the advancement and propagation of
Religion, were prescribed to Subjects, &amp;
not to Governours; and this indeed is
certain, that no private person can have
any power to compel men to any part of
the Doctrine, Worship, or Discipline of
the Gospel; for if he had, he would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that very account cease to be a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
person, and be vested with a Civil
Power. But that no Magistrate may do
this, will remain to be proved, till they
can produce some express prohibition of
our Saviour to restrain him: and till that
be done, 'tis but a strange rate of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when they would prove that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
may not use any <hi>coercive Power</hi> to
promote the Interests of Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is forbidden to their Subjects;
especially when 'tis to be considered,
that Christ and his Apostles acted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the capacity of Subjects to the
Common-wealth they lived in, and so
could neither use themselves, nor impart
to others any coercive Power for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
and propagation of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
but were confined to such pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and peaceable Methods, as were
lawful for persons in their condition to
make use of, <hi>i. e.</hi> humble Intreaties, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64701:46"/>
Perswasions. Our Saviour never took any
part of the Civil Power upon himself, and
upon that score could not make penal
and coercive Laws; the power of Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being so certainly inseparable from
the Supreme Civil Power: But though
he back'd not his Commandments with
temporal punishments, because his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was not of this world; yet he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
them with the threatnings of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
which carry with them more
compulsion upon mens Consciences than
any Civil Sanctions can: For the only
reason why Punishments are annex'd to
Laws, is because they are strong Motives
to Obedience; and therefore when our
Savour tied his Laws upon mankind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Eternal Penalties,</hi> he used as much
force to drive us to obedience, as if he
had abetted them with <hi>temporal Inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
So that the only reason why he
bound not the Precepts of the Gospel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Consciences by any secular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsories,
was not because Compulsion
was an improper way to put his Laws
in execution, for then he had never
established them with more enforcing
sanctions; but only because himself was
not invested with any secular Power,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64701:46"/>
and so could not use those methods of
Government, that are proper to its Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</p>
            <p>§ 16. And therefore the Power,
wherewith Christ intrusted the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of his Church in the Apostolical
Age, was purely spiritual; they had no
Authority to inflict temporal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or to force men to submit to their
Canons, Laws and Penalties; they only
declared the Laws of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the threatnings annexed to
them, having no Coercive Power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
the Judgments they declared, and
leaving the event of their Censures to the
Divine Jurisdiction. Though alas! all this
was too weak to attain the ends of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<hi>(viz.</hi> to reclaim the offending Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and by example of his Censure to
awe others into Obedience) and could
have but little influence upon the most
stubborn and notorious Offenders. For
to what purpose should they drive one
from the Communion of the Church, that
has already renounced it? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
should they deny him the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Ministries of Religion, that
cares not for them? To what purpose
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64701:47"/>
should they turn him out of their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that has already prevented them by
forsaking it? How should offenders be
reclaim'd, by being condemn'd to what
they chuse? How should they be scared
by threatnings, that they neither fear nor
believe? And if they will turn Apostates,
how can they be awed back into their
Faith by being told they are so? And
therefore because of the weakness of this
spiritual Government to attain the ends
of Discipline, and because that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Church being subject to
those of the Common-wealth, they were
not capable of any coercive Power; 'tis
wonderfully remarkable how God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was pleased to supply their want of
Civil Jurisdiction by his own immediate
Providence, and in a miraculous manner
to inflict the Judgments they denounced;
that if their Censures could not affright
refractory Offenders into Obedience,
his Dreadful execution of them might.
For 'tis notoriously evident from the best
Records of the Primitive and Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Ages, that the Divine Providence
was pleased to abet the Censures of
the Church by immediate and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
inflictions from Heaven. In
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64701:47"/>
those times torments and diseases of the
Body were the usual consequents of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication;
and this was as effectual
to awe men into subjection to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Government, as if it had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with <hi>coercive Iurisdiction.</hi> For this
consists only in a power of inflicting tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
punishments; and therefore when
the Anathema's of the Church were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with such Inflictions, Criminals
must have as much reason to dread the
Rod of the Apostles, as the Sword of the
Civil Magistrate, in that it carried with it
a power of inflicting temporal Penalties,
either of Death, as on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi>
or of Diseases, as on <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer.
And this is that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> wherewith
St. <hi>Paul</hi> so often threatens to lash the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
<hi>Corinthians</hi> into a more quiet and
peaceable temper. Thus 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 21. What
will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or
in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</hi> i. e.
Consider with your selves, that seeing I
have determined to <hi>visit</hi> the Church of
<hi>Corinth,</hi> whether when I come you had
rather I should chastise you with the
Apostolical Rod by exercising my
Power of inflicting punishments, and by
consigning the refractory to those sharp
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64701:48"/>
and grievous Diseases that are wont im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to follow <hi>Apostolical Censures;</hi>
or whether I should come with a more
gentle and merciful design without being
forced by your stubborness upon a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of using this severity among you? As
you behave your selves, so may you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to find me at my coming. And thus
again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. He threatens them
with his being <hi>in a readiness</hi> (if he should
come among them) <hi>to revenge all their
disobedience:</hi> And upon this account he
immediately professes himself not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to boast of his Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the Church. And in the 13.
<hi>Chapter</hi> of the same Epistle, he again
shakes the same Rod over them, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that if their refractoriness force
him to strike them with some Judgment,
that it should be a sharp and severe one:
<hi>If I come again I will not spare, since ye
seek a proof of Christ speaking in me.</hi>
These extraordinary inflictions were
signs and evidences of his Apostleship.
And he would make them know, that he
was Commissioned by Christ to teach
and govern their Church, by making
them to feel the sad effects of his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Power, if nothing else would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64701:48"/>
them about the right of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And to the same purpose is the
same Apostles command to the same
Church concerning the incestuous <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,
1 Cor.</hi> 5. 5. that they should <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him to Satan for the destruction of the
flesh,</hi> i. e. that they should denounce the
sentence of Excommunication against
him, which would amount to no smaller
a Punishment, than his being resign'd up
to the power and possession of some evil
spirit, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Chrysost. in 1. ad Cor. Hom.</hi> 15. to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with Ulcers, or some other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Diseases and Inflictions, which was
then the usual consequent of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.
The end of all which is, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
follows, <hi>The destruction of the
flesh, that the Spirit might be saved in the
day of the Lord Iesus,</hi> i. e. that being
humbled and brought to a due sense of
his Sin by the sadness of his Condition,
and the heavy strokes of this cruel Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
of the Divine Justice, this might
be a means of working him to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Reformation. And to the same
end did the same Apostle deliver <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
and <hi>Alexander</hi> unto Satan, <hi>that they
might learn not to blaspheme;</hi> that being
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64701:49"/>
vexed and tormented by some evil spirit,
this might take down their proud and
haughty stomachs, and make them cease
to traduce and disparage his Apostolical
Authority, when they had smarted so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
for contradicting it. And thus was
the Divine Providence pleased in the first
Ages of the Church, when it wanted the
assistance of the Civil Magistrate, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that defect by his own Almighty
Power: so necessary is a coercive Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to the due Government and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
of the Church, that God himself
was fain to bestow it on the Apostles in a
miraculous manner. And thus was the
Primitive Discipline maintain'd by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of severity, as long as it wanted the
Sword of the Civil Power. But when
Christianity had once prevail'd and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
over all the oppositions of Pagan
Superstition, and had gain'd the Empire
of the world into its own possession, and
was become the <hi>Imperial Religion,</hi> then
began its Government to re-settle where
nature had placed it, and the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Jurisdiction was annexed to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Power: For as soon as the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
thought themselves concern'd to
look to its Government, and Protection,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64701:49"/>
and were willing to abet the <hi>Spiritual
Power</hi> of the Clergy with their <hi>Secular
Authority;</hi> then began the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to withdraw the miraculous
Power of the Church (in the same manner
as he did by degrees all the other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Gifts of the Apostolical Age, as
their necessity ceased) as being now as
well supplied by the natural &amp; ordinary
Power of the Prince. So that though the
Exercise of the Ministerial Function still
continued in the Persons, that were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
Originally Commissioned by our
Saviour, the Exercise of its Authority
and Jurisdiction was restored to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Diadem;</hi> and the Bishops became
then (as they are now) Ministers of
State as well as Religion, and challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not any Secular Power, but what
they derived from the Prince: who, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
them best able to understand and
manage the Interests of Religion, granted
them Commissions for the Government
of the Church under himself, and vested
them with as much Coercive Power,
as was necessary for the Execution of
their Office and Jurisdiction: In the
same manner as Judges are deputed by
the Supreme Authority of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64701:50"/>
to govern the Affairs of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and to inflict the Penalties of the
Law upon Delinquents: So that Bishops
neither have, nor ever had any <hi>Temporal
Authority,</hi> but only as they are the
Kings Ecclesiastical Judges, appointed
by him to govern Affairs of Religion, as
Civil or Secular Judges are to govern
Affairs of Justice.</p>
            <p>§ 17. And now that the Government
of all the Affairs of the Church devolved
upon the Royal Authority assoon as it
became Christian, is undeniably evident,
from all the Laws and Records
of the Empire:<note place="margin">Socr. l. 5. Praes.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
<hi>From the time that
the Emperors became Christian, the
Disposal and Government of Church Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
depended entirely on their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
Constantine</hi> was no sooner settled
in his Imperial Throne, but he took the
settlement of all Ecclesiastical matters
into his own Cognizance: He called
Synods and Councils, in order to the
Peace and Government of the Church,
he ratified their Canons into Laws, he
prohibited the Conventicles of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64701:50"/>
and demolish'd their <hi>Meeting-Houses,</hi>
he made Edicts concerning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals,
the Rites of Sepulture, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
of Churches, the Authority of
Bishops, the Priviledges of the Clergy,
and divers other things appertaining to
the outward Polity of the Church. In
the exercise of which Jurisdiction he was
carefully followed by all his Successours:
which cannot but be known to every man
that is not as utterly ignorant of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law, as he in the Comedy who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>Corpus Iuris Civilis</hi> to be a <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
The Code, the Authenticks, the
<hi>French</hi> Capitulars are full of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Laws and Constitutions. The first
Book of the <hi>Code</hi> treats of nothing but
Religion, and the Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Publick Worship, the Priviledges
of Ecclesiastical Men and Things, the
distinct Offices and Functions of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
degrees in the Ecclesiastical Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
and the Power and Jurisdiction
of Bishops both in Civil and Religious
Affairs, and infinite other things that
immediately concern the Interests of
Religion. And then as for the <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
Ecclesiastical Laws are every
where scattered up and down through
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64701:51"/>
the whole Volume; which being divided
into nine <hi>Collations,</hi> has not above one
<hi>(viz.</hi> the fourth) that has not divers Laws
relating to Church Affairs. And as for
the Capitulars of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Additions of <hi>Lewis the
Godly,</hi> his Son and Successour, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
little else but Ecclesiastical Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions;
as may be seen in <hi>Lindembro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
his Collection of Ancient Laws, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with divers other Laws of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorick,</hi>
and other <hi>Gothish</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>§ 18. And next to the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
we owe the Settlement and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Christian Religion in the
World to the Conduct of Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For by the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Primitive Spirit and Genius of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was wearing out of fashion, and the
Meekness and Humility of its first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
began to give place to a furious
and tumultuary Zeal; and no sooner did
the heats of Persecution begin to abate,
but the Church was presently shatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into swarms of Factions by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Passions and Animosities of its
Members about bare Speculations or
useless Practices: And of all the quarrels
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64701:51"/>
that ever disturbed the World, there
were never any perhaps so excuseless or
so irregular as those of Christendom; of
which 'tis hard to determine, whether
they were commenced with more folly
and indiscretion, or pursued with more
passion and frowardness. The rage and
fierceness of Christians had kindled such
a Fire in the Church, that it must una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
have been consumed by its
own Combustions, had not the Christian
Emperours employed all their Power
to suppress the Fury of the Flames. And
though in spight of all their Prudence
and Industry, Christianity was sadly
impaired by its own Tumults and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
yet had it not been for the care
of Christian Princes, it had in all humane
probability been utterly destroyed; and
the Flames that had once caught its Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructures,
must without remedy have
burnt up its very Foundations. And if
we look into the Records and Histories
of the first Christian Emperours, we
shall find that the most dangerous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances
that threatned the State,
had their beginnings in the Church;
and that the Empire was more shaken
by the intestine Commotions that arose
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64701:52"/>
from Religion, than by Foreign Wars
and Invasions. And upon this account is
it, that we find them so highly concern'd
to reconcile all the Discords, and allay
all the Heats about Religion, by silencing
needless and unprofitable Controversies,
determining certain &amp; necessary Truths,
prescribing decent Rites &amp; Ceremonies
of Publick Worship, and all other wise
and prudent Expedients to bring the
minds and practices of men to Sobriety
and Moderation.</p>
            <p>§ 19. And by this means was the
outward Polity of the Church tolerably
well established, and the Affairs of
Religion competently well grounded
(though better or worse, according to
the wisdom and vigilance of the several
Emperours) till the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi>
usurp'd one half of the Imperial Power,
and annexed the Ecclesiastical Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Supremacy to their own See.
For taking advantage of the Distractions
occasioned partly by the Incursions of
the Northern Nations on the West,
partly by the Invasions of the <hi>Turkish</hi>
Power on the East, but mainly by the
Division of the Empire it self, they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64701:52"/>
gain'd either by force or fraud the whole
Dominion of Religion to themselves,
and by pretending to the Spirit of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,
usurp'd an absolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
Empire over the Faiths and
Consciences of mankind. And whilst they
at first pretended no other Title to their
Sovereignty but what they derived
from Religion, they were constrain'd
to scrue up their Power to an unmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Tyranny, thereby to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in those Insolencies and Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
wherewith they perpetually affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Princes of Christendom: And
knowing the <hi>Free-born Reason</hi> of men
would never tamely brook to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved
to so ignoble a <hi>Tyranny,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
it a <hi>Traytour</hi> or (what is the
same) a <hi>Heretick</hi> to the Catholick Faith,
and by their lowd noises and menaces
frighted it out of Christendom. In
which design they at length advanced so
far, till <hi>Rome</hi> Christian became little less
fond and superstitious than <hi>Rome</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;
and Christianity it self was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
debauched to the lowest guise of
Paganism, and <hi>Europe,</hi> the Seat of the
most refined and politest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
was involved in a more than <hi>African</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:64701:53"/>
Ignorance and Barbarity. And thus did
they easily usher in the grand <hi>departure</hi>
and Apostasie from Religion by the <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
away</hi> from Reason, and founded
the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith as well as <hi>Empire</hi> upon
the Ruines of Humane Liberty.</p>
            <p>§ 20. In which sad posture continued
the Affairs of Christendom till the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:</hi>
which though it has wrought
wonderful Alterations in the Christian
World, yet has it not been able to reset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Princes in their full &amp; natural Rights,
in reference to the Concerns of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For although the Supremacy of the
Civil Power in Religious matters be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
asserted in all the Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
of the Reformed Churches, but
especially in that of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
which is not content barely to
affirm it, but denounces the Sentence of
Excommunication against all that deny
it: Yet by reason of the exorbitant
Power that some pert and pragmatical
Divines have gain'd over the minds of
the People, this great Article has found
little or no entertainment in their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
there starting up a race of proud and
imperious men about the beginning of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64701:53"/>
the Reformation, who, not regarding the
Princes Power, took upon themselves to
frame precise <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of Orthodoxy,
and to set up their own <hi>Pedantick Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems
and Institutions</hi> for the Standards
of Divine Truth; and wanting, what
the other had, the Authority of Prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
they pretended to the Spirit of
God: and this pretence not only excused,
but justified any wild Theorems they
could not prove by sober Reason; and
those that would be awed with it, they
embraced for Orthodox, and those that
would not, they branded for Hereticks:
by which little device they decoyed the
silly and ignorant rabble into their own
party. The effect of all which has been
nothing but a Brutish and Fanatick Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
making men to talk of little else
but Raptures and Extasies, and filling the
World with a buzze and noise of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit; whereby they are only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnably
possess'd with their own wild
and extravagant Fansies, become saucy
and impudent for Religion, confound
Order, and despise Government, and
will be guided by nothing but the whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and humours of an unaccountable
Conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:64701:54"/>
§ 21. And hence it comes to pass, that
most Protestant Princes have been fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(not to say Hector'd) out of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of their Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
by the Clamours of giddy and distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
Zealots; Superstition and Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm
have out-fac'd the Laws, and put
Government out of Countenance by the
boldness of their Pretensions. Confident
men have talked so lowdly of the Invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
Sacredness and Authority of their
Consciences, that Governours, not
throughly instructed in the nature and
extent of their Power, so lately restored
to them, have been almost scared from
intermedling with any thing, that
could upon this score plead its Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Exemption from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
And how peremptory soever
some of them have been in asserting the
Rights of their Supreme Power in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Affairs, they have been forced to
seem modest and diffident in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of their Ecclesiastical Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
and dare scarce own their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slative
Power in Religious Affairs, only
to comply with the saucy pretences
of ungovernable and Tumultuary Zeal.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64701:54"/>
One notorious Instance whereof in our
own Nation, is the <hi>Iejunium Cecilianum,</hi>
the Wednesday Fast, that was injoin'd
with this clause of Exception, <hi>That
if any person should affirm it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
with an Intention to bind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
he should be punished like the
spreaders of false News.</hi> 
               <q>Which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to them that understand it, (as a late
Learned Prelate of our own observes)
a direct Artifice to evacuate the whole
Law: for (as he excellently argues)
all Humane Power being derived
from God, and bound upon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
by his Power, not by Man,
he that says it shall not bind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
says it shall be no Law;
it shall have no Authority from God,
and then it has none at all; and if it
be not tied upon the Conscience,
then to break it is no Sin, and then to
keep it is no Duty. So that a Law
without such an intention is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
it is a Law which binds on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if we please, and we may obey
when we have a mind to it; and to so
much we are tied before the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
But then if by such a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it was meant, That to keep such
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64701:55"/>
Fasting-days was no part of a direct
Commandment from God, that is, God
had not required them by himself im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
and so it was (abstracting
from that Law) no Duty Evangelical,
it had been below the wisdom of the
Contrivers of it; for no man pretends
it, no man says it, no man thinks it:
and they might as well have declar'd,
That the Law was none of the Ten
Commandments.</q> The matter indeed
of this Law was not of any great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but the Declaration annexed to
it proved of a fatal and mischievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence;
for when once the unruly
Consciences of the <hi>Puritans</hi> were got
loose from the restraints of Authority,
nothing could give check to their giddy
and furious Zeal, but they soon broke
out into the most impudent Affronts and
Indignities against the Laws, and ran
themselves into all manner of disloyal
Outrages against the State. As is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
evident in the Writings and
Practices of <hi>Cartwright, Goodman, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,
Gilby, Whitehead, Travers,</hi>
and other leading Rabbies of the
Holy Faction; whose Treatises are
stuffed with as railing, spightful, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64701:55"/>
malicious Speeches both against their
Prince, the Clergy, the Lords of the
Council, the Judges, the Magistrates, and
the Laws, as were ever publickly vented
by the worst of Traytors in any Society
in the world. And as for the method of
their Polity, it was plainly no more
than this, first to reproach the Church
with infamous and Abusive Dialogues,
and then to Libel the State with bitter
and Scurrilous Pamphlets, to possess
mens minds with dislikes and jealousies
about Publick Affairs, whisper about
reproachful and slanderous Reports,
inveigle the people with a thousand lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and malicious Stories, enter into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Leagues and Confederacies, foment
Discontents and Seditions, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
streight and exigence of State threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and beleaguer Authority: In fine, the
scope of all their Sermons and Discourses
was to perswade their Party, <hi>that if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
refuse to reform Religion, 'tis lawful
for the People with Direction of their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ministers,</hi> (i. e. themselves) <hi>to do
it, and that by violent and forcible cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
And whither this Principle in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of time led them, the Story is
too long, too sad, and too well known
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64701:56"/>
to be here repeated: 'tis sufficient, that it
improved it self into the greatest Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
&amp; concluded in the blackest Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that was ever acted upon this Island.</p>
            <p>§ 22. Well then, to sum up the result
of this Discourse, 'tis evident, we see,
both from Reason and Experience, what
a powerful influence Religion has upon
the peace and quiet of Kingdoms; that
nothing so effectually secures the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace, or so easily works its distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
and ruine, as its well or ill Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration;
and therefore that there is
an absolute necessity that there be some
Supreme Power in every Common-wealth
to take care of its due Conduct
and Settlement; that this must be the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate, whose Office it is to secure
the publick Peace, which because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sufficiently provide for, unless he
have the Power and Conduct of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
its Government must of necessity be
seated in him and none else. So that those
persons, who would exempt Conscience
and all Religious Matters from the
Princes Power, must make him either a
Tyrant or an impotent Prince; for if he
take upon him to tye Laws of Religion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64701:56"/>
upon their Consciences, then according
to their Principles, he usurps an unlawful
Dominion, violates the Fundamental
Rights and Priviledges of Mankind, and
invades the <hi>Throne</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of God
himself: But if he confess that he cannot,
then does he clearly pass away the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Security of his Government, and lay
himself open to all the Plots and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that can put on the <hi>Mask of Religion.</hi>
And therefore should any Prince
through unhappy miscarriages in the
State be brought into such streights and
exigences of Affairs, as that he cannot
restrain the head-strong Inclinations of
his Subjects, without the hazard of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such Commotions and Disturbances,
as perhaps he can never be able to allay,
and so should be forced in spight of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to indulge them their Liberty in
their Fansies and Perswasions about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
yet unless he will devest himself
of a more material and more necessary
part of his Authority, than if he
should grant away his Power of the
<hi>Militia,</hi> or his Prerogative of ratifying
all <hi>Civil Laws;</hi> unless, I say, he will
thus hazard his Crown, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
too weak for Government by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64701:57"/>
the best part of his <hi>Supremacy,</hi>
he must lay an Obligation upon all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to whom he grants this their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
freedom, to profess that 'tis mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of meer favour and indulgence; and
that he has as much Power to govern all
the publick Affairs of Religion, as any
other matters that are either conducive,
or prejudicial to the publick Peace and
Quiet of the Common-wealth. And
if they be brought to this Declaration,
they will but confess themselves (to say
no worse) Turbulent and Seditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
by acknowledging, That they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
their Obedience to those Laws,
which the Supreme Authority has just
Power to impose.</p>

               <p>THE Parallel between matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Religious Worship, and the
Duties of Morality. Moral Vertues the
most material Parts of Religion. This
proved, (1.) from the Nature of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
and the Design of Religion:
(2.) By a particular Induction of all the
Duties of Mankind. A Scheme of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
reducing all its Branches either
to the Vertues or Instruments of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.
Of the Villany of those mens
Religion, that are wont to distinguish
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64701:58"/>
between Grace and Virtue. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
the substance of true Goodness
for meer Metaphors and Allegories. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors
the only cause of our present
Schism; and the only ground of the
different Subdivisions among the Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
themselves. The Vnaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of Mens Conceits, That when
the main Ends and Designs of Religion
are undoubtedly subject to the Supreme
Power, they should be so eager to exempt
its Means and Circumstances from the
same Authority. The Civil Magistrate
may determine new Instances of Virtue;
how much more new Circumstances of
Worship? As he may enjoyn any thing
in Morality, that contradicts not the
ends of Morality; so may be in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship, if he oppose not its design.
He may command any thing in the
Worship of God, that does not tend to
debauch Mens practices, or their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of the Deity. All the subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Duties both of Morality and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship, are equally subject to the
Determinations of Humane Authority.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64701:58"/>
§ 1. HAving in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sufficiently made out
my first Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi>
That 'tis absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the Peace and Government of
the World, that the Supreme Magistrate
of every Common-wealth should be
vested with a Power to govern the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of Subjects in Affairs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
I now proceed to the proof of
the second thing proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> That
those who would deprive the Supreme
Civil Power of its Authority in reference
to the Conduct of the Worship of God,
are forced to allow it in other more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
parts of Religion, though they are
both liable to the same Inconveniences
and Objections: Where I shall have a
fair opportunity to state the true extent
of the Magistrates Power over Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in reference to Divine Worship, by
shewing it to be the same with his Power
over Conscience in matters of Morality,
and all other Affairs of Religion. And
here it strikes me with wonder and
amazement to consider, That men should
be so shy of granting the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
a Power over their Consciences
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64701:59"/>
in the Rituals and External Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Religious Worship, and yet be
so free of forcing it upon him in the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Duties of Morality; which are
at least as great and material Parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as pleasing to God, and as indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensably
necessary to Salvation, as any
way of Worship in the World. The
Precepts of the Moral Law are both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
of our own Natures, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
to the Happiness of others; and the
Practice of Vertue consists in living suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the Dictates of Reason &amp; Nature.
And this is the substance and main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of all the Laws of Religion, to oblige
Mankind to behave themselvs in all their
actions as becomes Creatures endued
with Reason and Understanding, and in
ways suitable to Rational Beings, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
and qualifie themselves for the state
of Glory and Immortality. And as this
is the proper End of all Religion, That
Mankind might live happily here, and
happily hereafter; so to this end nothing
contributes more than the practice of all
Moral Vertues, which will effectually
preserve the Peace and Happiness of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Societies, and advance the Mind of
Man to a nearer approach to the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64701:59"/>
of the Divine Nature; every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Vertue being therefore such, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis a Resemblance and Imitation
of some of the Divine Attributes. So
that Moral Vertue having the strongest
and most necessary influence upon the
End of all Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> Mans Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
'tis not only its most material and
useful Part, but the ultimate End of all
its other Duties: And all true Religion
can consist in nothing else but either the
Practice of Vertue it self, or the use of
those Means and Instruments that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to it.</p>
            <p>§ 2. And this, beside the Rational Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the thing it self, appears with
an undeniable evidence from the best of
Demonstrations, <hi>i. e.</hi> an Induction of all
Particulars. The whole Duty of Man
refers either to his Creator, or his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or himself: All that concerns the
two last is confessedly of a <hi>Moral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
and all that concerns the first, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
either in Praising of God, or Praying
to him: The former is a Branch of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Gratitude, and is nothing but a
thankful and humble temper of mind,
arising from a sense of Gods Greatness
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64701:60"/>
in himself, and his Goodness to us: so
that this part of Devotion issues from the
same virtuous quality, that is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of all other Resentments and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Gratitude; only those Acts
of it that are terminated on God as their
Object, are styled Religious: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Gratitude and Devotion are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Things, but only different Names of
the same Thing; Devotion being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the Virtue of Gratitude
towards God. The latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer
is either put up in our own or other
mens behalfs: If for others, 'tis an Act
of that Virtue we call Kindness or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
If for our selves, the things we
pray for (unless they be the Comforts
and Enjoyments of this life) are some
or other virtuous Qualities: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the proper and direct use of Prayer
is to be instrumental to the Virtues of
<hi>Morality:</hi> So that all Duties of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
(excepting only our returns of
Gratitude) are not Essential parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but are only in order to it, as
they tend to the Practice of Virtue and
moral Goodness; and their Goodness is
derived upon them from the moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
to which they contribute; and in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64701:60"/>
the same proportion they are conducive
to the ends of Virtue, they are to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
among the Ministeries of Religion.
All Religion then (I mean the Practical
Part) is either Virtue it self, or some
of its Instruments; and the whole Duty
of man consists in being Virtuous; and
all that is enjoin'd him beside, is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to it. And what else do we find
enforc'd and recommended in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Sermons, beside heights of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?
What does St. <hi>Paul</hi> discourse of
to <hi>Felix</hi> but moral matters, <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Temperance, and Iudgment to
come?</hi> And what is it that men set up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Morality, but a few figurative
Expressions of it self, that without it are
utterly insignificant? 'Tis not enough
(say they) to be completely Virtuous,
unless we have Grace too: But when we
have set aside all manner of Virtue, let
them tell me what remains to be call'd
<hi>Grace,</hi> and give me any Notion of it
distinct from all Morality, that consists in
the right order and government of our
Actions in all our Relations, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
all our Duty: and therefore
if Grace be not included in it, 'tis but a
Phantasm, and an Imaginary thing. So
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64701:61"/>
that if we strip those Definitions that
some men of late have bestowed upon
it, of Metaphors and Allegories, it will
plainly signifie nothing but a vertuous
temper of mind; and all that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
intends by the Graces of the Spirit,
are only <hi>Vertuous Qualities</hi> of the Soul,
that are therefore styled Graces, because
they were derived purely from Gods free
Grace and Goodness, in that in the first
Ages of Christianity he was pleased, out
of his infinite concern for its Propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in a miraculous manner to inspire its
Converts with all sorts of Vertue.
Wherefore the Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he
compiles a complete Catologue of the
<hi>Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> reckons up only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Vertues, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. Love, Joy or
Chearfulness, Peaceableness, Patience,
Gentleness, Goodness, Faithfulness,
Meekness, and Temperance; and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11. the same Apostle
plainly makes the Grace of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in gratitude towards God, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
towards our selves, and Justice
towards our Neighbours. <hi>For the Grace
of God that bringeth Salvation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to all Men, teaching us that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64701:61"/>
should live soberly, righteously, and godly
in this present world.</hi> Where the whole
Duty of Man is comprehended in living
<hi>Godlily,</hi> which is the Vertue of humble
Gratitude towards God: <hi>Soberly,</hi> which
contains the Vertues of Temperance,
Chastity, Modesty, and all others that
consist in the dominion of Reason over
our sensual Appetites: <hi>Righteously,</hi> which
implies all the Vertues of Justice and
Charity, as Affability, Courtesie, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Candour, and Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>§ 3. So destructive of all true and
real Goodness is the very Religion of
those Men that are wont to set Grace at
odds with Vertue, and are so far from
making them the same, that they make
them inconsistent; and though a man
be exact in all the Duties of Moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yet if he be a <hi>Graceless Person (i. e.</hi>
void of I know not what Imaginary God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness)
he is but in a cleaner way to
Hell, and his <hi>Conversion</hi> is more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
than the vilest and most notorious
Sinners; and the <hi>Morally Righteous Man</hi>
is at a greater distance from Grace than
the <hi>Profane,</hi> and better be lewd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd,
than live an honest and vertuous
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64701:62"/>
life, if you are not of the Godly Party.
<hi>Bona Opera sunt perniciosa ad salutem,</hi>
says <hi>Flaccus Illiricus.</hi> Moral Goodness is
the greatest Let to Conversion; and the
prophanest wretches make better Saints
than <hi>your Moral Formalists.</hi> And by
this means they have brought into fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Godliness without Religion, Zeal
without Humanity, and Grace without
good Nature, or good Manners; have
found out in lieu of Moral Virtue, a
<hi>Spiritual Divinity,</hi> that is made up of
nothing else but certain Trains and
Schemes of Effeminate Follies and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Enthusiasms; and instead of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Devotion, a more spiritual and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
way of Communion with God,
that in truth consists in little else but
meeting together in private to prate
Phrases, make Faces, and rail at Carnal
Reason <hi>(i. e.</hi> in their sense all sober and
sincere use of our Understandings in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Matters) whereby they have effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
turn'd all Religion into unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Fansies and Enthusiasms, drest
it up with pompous and empty Schemes
of Speech, and so embrace a few gawdy
Metaphors and Allegories, instead of the
substance of true and real Righteousness.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64701:62"/>
And herein lies the most material diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the sober Christians of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and our modern Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries,
That we express the Precepts
and Duties of the Gospel in plain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
Terms, whilst they trifle them
away by childish Metaphors and Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and will not talk of Religion but in
barbarous and uncouth Similitudes;
and (what is more) the different Subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
among the Sects themselves are
not so much distinguish'd by any real di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Opinions, as by variety of
Phrases and Forms of Speech, that are
the peculiar <hi>Shibboleths</hi> of each Tribe.
One party affect to lard their Discourses
with clownish and slovenly Similitudes;
another delights to roul in wanton and
lascivious Allegories; and a third is
best pleased with odd, unusual, unitelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
and sometimes blasphemous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.
And whoever among them can
invent any new Language, presently sets
up for a man of new Discoveries; and
he that lights upon the prettiest Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
is thought by the ignorant Rabble
to unfold new Gospel-Mysteries. And
thus is the Nation shattered into infinite
Factions, with sensless and phantastick
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64701:63"/>
Phrases; and the most fatal miscarriage
of them all lies in abusing Scripture-Expressions,
not only without but in
contradiction to their sense. So that had
we but an Act of Parliament to abridge
Preachers the use of fulsom and luscious
Metaphors, it might perhaps be an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Cure of all our present Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
Let not the Reader smile at the
odness of the Proposal: For were men
obliged to speak Sense as well as Truth,
all the swelling <hi>Mysteries of Fanaticism</hi>
would immediately sink into flat and
empty Nonsense; and they would be
ashamed of such jejune and ridiculous
Stuff as their admired and most profound
Notions would appear to be, when they,
want the Varnish of fine Metaphors and
glittering Allusions. In brief, were this a
proper place to unravel all their affected
Phrases and Forms of Speech, which
they have learn'd like Parrots to prate by
Rote, without having any Notion of the
Things they signifie, it would be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
Task to demonstrate, That by
them they either mean nothing at all, or
some Part or Instrument of Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
So that all Religion must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
be resolv'd into Enthusiasm or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64701:63"/>
The former is meer Imposture,
and therefore all that is true must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the latter; and what-ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
appertains to it, must be subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the Ends of Vertue: such are
Prayer, Hearing Sermons, and all
manner of Religious Ordinances, that
have directly no other place in Religion,
than as they are instrumental to a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life.</p>
            <p>§ 4. 'Tis certain then, That the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Morality are the most weighty
and material concerns of Religion; and
'tis as certain, That the Civil Magistrate
has Power to bind Laws concerning them
upon the Consciences of Subjects: So
that every mans Conscience is and must
be subject to the Commands of lawful
Superiours in the most important matters
of Religion. And therefore is it not
strange, that when the main Ends and
designs of all Religion are avowedly
subject to the Supreme Power, that yet
men should be so impatient to exempt
its means and subordinate Instruments
from the same Authority? What reason
can the Wit of man assign to restrain it
from one, that will not much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64701:64"/>
it from both? Is not the right pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Moral Duties as necessary a part
of Religion, as any outward Form of
Worship in the World? Are not wrong
Notions of the Divine Worship as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of the Peace and settlement of
Common-wealths, as the most vicious
and licentious Debaucheries? Are not
the rude multitude more inclined to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
Government by Superstition than
by Licentiousness? And is there not vastly
greater danger of the Magistrates erring
in matters of Morality, than in Forms
and Ceremonies of Worship, in that
those are the main, essential, and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Duties of Religion; whereas these
are at highest but their Instruments, and
can challenge no other place in Religion,
than as they are subservient to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of Morality? Nay, is it not still more
unaccountable, that the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
may not be permitted to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Circumstances and Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages
of the subordinate Ministeries to
Moral Virtue, and yet should be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(in all Common-wealths) to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the particular Acts and Instances of
these Virtues themselves? For Example,
Justice is a prime and natural Virtue,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64701:64"/>
and yet its particular Cases depend upon
humane Laws, that determine the bounds
of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum:</hi> The Divine Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
<hi>Titius</hi> from invading <hi>Caius</hi>'s Right
and Propriety; but what that is, and
when it is invaded, only the Laws of the
Society they live in can determine. And
there are some Cases that are Acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
in <hi>England,</hi> that are not so in <hi>Italy;</hi>
otherwise all Places must be govern'd by
the same Laws, and what is a Law to
one Nation must be so to all the World.
Whereas 'tis undeniably evident, That
neither the Law of God nor of Nature
determine the particular Instances of
most Virtues, but for the most part
leave that to the Constitutions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Laws. They in general forbid
Theft, Incest, Murther, and Adultery;
but what these Crimes are, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
not in all Cases, but is in most par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
to be explained by the Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions;
and whatsoever the Law of
the Land reckons among these Crimes,
that the Law of God and of Nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids.</p>
            <p>And now is it not strangely humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to say, That Magistrates are instrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with so great a Power over mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64701:65"/>
in these great and weighty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of Religion, and yet should not be
trusted to govern the indifferent, or at
least less material Circumstances of those
things that can pretend to no other
Goodness, than as they are Means ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to Moral Purposes? That they
should have Power to make that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of the Divine Law, that God has
not made so; and yet not be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the use of an indifferent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
because (forsooth) God has not
determin'd it? In a word, That they
should be fully impowered to declare
new Instances of Vertue and Vice, and
to introduce new Duties in the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
parts of Religion, and yet should
not have Authority enough to declare
the Use and decency of a few Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in its subservient and less materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Concerns.</p>
            <p>§ 5. The whole State of Affairs is
briefly this; Man is sent into the World
to live happily here, and prepare himself
for happiness hereafter; this is attain'd
by the practice of Moral Vertues and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Devotions; and wherein these main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consist, Almighty Goodness has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64701:65"/>
by the Laws of Nature and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
but because in both there are
changeable Cases and Circumstances of
things, therefore has God appointed his
Trustees and Officials here on Earth to
Act and Determine in both, according to
all Accidents and Emergencies of Affairs,
to assign new Particulars of the Divine
Law, to declare new Bounds of right and
wrong, which the Law of God neither
does nor can limit; because of necessity
they must in a great measure depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Customs and Constitutions of
every Common-wealth. And in the
same manner are the Circumstances and
outward Expressions of Divine Worship,
because they are variable according to
the Accidents of Time and Place, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
(with less danger of Errour)
with the same Authority. And what
Ceremonies this appoints (unless they
are apparently repugnant to their Prime
end) become Religious Rites; as what
particular Actions it constitutes in any
<hi>Species of Virtue,</hi> become new Instances
of that Virtue, unless they apparently
contradict its Nature and Tendency.</p>
            <p>Now the two Primary Designs of all
Religion, are either to express our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64701:66"/>
Opinion of the Deity, or to
advance the Interests of Vertue and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Goodness; so that no Rites or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
can be esteemed unlawful in the
Worship of God, unless they tend to
debauch men either in their Practices, or
their Conceptions of the Deity: And 'tis
upon one or both of these Accounts that
any Rites and Forms of Worship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
criminally superstitious; and such
were the <hi>Lupercalia,</hi> the <hi>Eleusinian</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
the Feasts of <hi>Bacchus, Flora,</hi> and
<hi>Venus,</hi> because they were but so many
Festivals of Lust and Debauchery; and
such were the Salvage and Bloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to <hi>Saturn, Bellona, Moloch, Baal-Peor,</hi>
and all other <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the
Antient Paganism; because they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the <hi>Divine Being</hi> to take pleasure in
the Miseries and Tortures of its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
And such is all Idolatry, in that
it either gives right Worship to a wrong
Object, or wrong Worship to a right
one, or at least represents an infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
by Images and Resemblances of
finite things, and so reflects disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon some of the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
by fastning dishonourable Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
and Imperfections upon the Divine
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64701:66"/>
Nature. As for these, and the like
Rites and Ceremonies of Worship,
no Humane Power can command
them, because they are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to the Ends of Religion;
but as for all others that are not so, any
lawful Authority may as well enjoyn
them, as it may adopt any Actions
whatsoever into the Duties of Morality,
that are not contrary to the Ends of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
            <p>§ 6. But a little farther to illustrate
this, we may observe, That in matters
both of Moral Vertue and Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
there are some Rules of Good and
Evil that are of an Eternal and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
Obligation, and these can
never be prejudiced or altered by any
Humane Power; because the Reason of
their Obligation arises from a necessity
and constitution of Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be as Perpetual as that: But
then there are other Rules of Duty that
are alterable according to the various
Accidents, Changes, and Conditions of
Humane Life, and depend chiefly upon
Contracts, and Positive Laws of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
these suffer Variety, because their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64701:67"/>
Matter and their Reason does so. Thus
in the matter of Murther there are some
Instances of an unalterable Nature, and
others that are changeable according to
the various Provisions of Positive Laws
and Constitutions. To take away the
life of an innocent Person is forbidden
by such an indispensable Law of Nature,
that no Humane Power can any way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
or indirectly make it become
lawful, in that no Positive Laws can so
alter the Constitution of Nature, as to
make this Instance of Villany cease to be
mischievous to Mankind; and therefore
'tis Capital in all Nations of the World.
But then there are other particular Cases
of this Crime, that depend upon Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Laws, and so by consequence are
liable to change according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Constitutions of the Common-wealths
men live in. Thus though in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
'tis Murther for an injured Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to kill an Adulteress taken in the
Act of Uncleanness, because 'tis forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the Laws of this Kingdom, yet
in <hi>Spain</hi> and among the old <hi>Romans</hi> it
was not, because their Laws permitted
it; and if the Magistrate himself may
punish the Crime with Death, he may
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64701:67"/>
appoint whom he pleases to be his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner.
And the Case is the same in
reference to Divine Worship, in which
there are some things of an absolute and
indispensable Necessity, and others of a
Transient and changeable Obligation:
Thus 'tis absolutely necessary every Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creature should make returns of
Gratitude to its Creator, from which
no Humane Power can restrain it; but
then for the outward Expressions and
Significations of this Duty, they are for
the most part Good or Evil according to
the Customs and Constitutions of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Nations, unless in the two foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Cases, that they either counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
Vice, or disgrace the Deity. But as
for all other Rituals, Ceremonies, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
&amp; manners of performing the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Expressions of Devotion, that are
not chargeable with one or both of these,
nothing can hinder their being capable
of being adopted into the Ministeries of
Divine Service, or exempt them from
being subject to the Determinations of
Humane Power. And thus the Parallel
holds in all Cases between the Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Emergent Laws of Morality, and
the Subordinate and Instrumental Rules
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64701:68"/>
of Worship; they both equally pass
an Obligation upon all men, to whom
they are prescribed, unless they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contradict the ends of their Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>And now from this more general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the Agreement between
matters of meer Worship and other
Duties of Morality in reference to the
Power of the Civil Magistrate, we may
proceed by some more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
to discover, how his Dominion
over both is of equal extent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
within the same bounds and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
and that in what cases soever he
may exercise Jurisdiction over Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in matters of Morality, in all the
same he may exercise the same Power in
Concerns of Religious Worship; and on
the contrary, in what cases his Power over
matters of Religion is restrain'd, in all
the same is it limited as to things of a
Moral Nature: Whence it must appear
with a clear and irresistible Evidence,
That mens right to Liberty of Conscience
is the same in both to all Cases, Niceties,
and Circumstances of things, and that
they may as rationally challenge a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from the Laws of Justice as from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64701:68"/>
those of Religion, and that to grant it in
either is equally destructive of all Order
and Government, and equally tends to
reduce all Societies, to Anarchy and
Confusion.</p>

and not to our Actions. It may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

Christian Liberty consists pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
in the Restauration of the Mind of
Man to its Natural priviledge from the
Yoke of the Ceremonial Law. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
part of Religious Worship is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
and out of the reach of the
Civil Magistrate. External Worship is
no part of Religion. It is and must be
left undetermined by the Law of God.
Sacrifices the most antient Expressions of
Outward Worship were purely of Humane
Institution. Though their being expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
depended upon a positive Law of
God, yet their most proper and original
Vse, <hi>viz.</hi> To express the Significations
of a Grateful Mind, depended on the
Wills of Men. Of their first Original
among the Heathens. The Reason why
God prescribed the particular Rites and
Ceremonies of outward Worship to the
Iews. Vnder the Christian Dispensation
he has left the disposal of outward Worship
to the power and discretion of the Church.
The Impertinency of mens Clamours
against Significant Ceremonies, when
'tis the only use of Ceremonies to be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64701:69"/>
significant. The Signification of all Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
equally Arbitrary. The Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Ceremonies is of the same
Nature with that of Words. And men
may as well be offended at the one as the
other.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>§ 1. FIrst then, Let all matters of
<hi>meer Conscience,</hi> whether
purely Moral or Religious,
be subject to Conscience
meerly, <hi>i. e.</hi> Let men think of things
according to their own perswasions,
and assert the Freedom of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against all the Powers of the
Earth. This is the Prerogative of the
Mind of Man within its own Dominion;
its Kingdom is intellectual, and seated in
the thoughts, not Actions of Men; and
therefore no Humane Power does, or can
prescribe to any mans Opinions and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Thoughts, but men will think as
they please in spight of all their Decrees,
and the Understanding will remain free
when every thing else is bound. And this
Sovereignty of Conscience is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
upon that of Princes: because
'tis concern'd only in such matters as are
of a quite different Nature from their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64701:70"/>
Affairs, and gives no restraint to their
commanding Power over the Actions of
men; for meer Opinion, whilst such, has
no Influence upon the Good or Evil of
Humane Society, that is the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Government; and therefore as
long as our Thoughts are secret, and
lock'd up within our own Breasts, they
are out of the reach of all Humane
Power. But as for matters that are not
confined within the Territories of meer
Conscience, but come forth into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Action, and appear in the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of men, there is no remedy but they
must be subject to the Cognizance of
Humane Laws, and come within the
Verge of Humane Power; because by
these Societies subsist, and humane Affairs
are transacted. And therefore it concerns
those, whose Office it is to secure the
peace and tranquillity of mankind, to
govern and manage them in order to the
Publick Good. So that 'tis but a vain
and frivolous pretence, when men plead
with so much noise and clamour for the
Sacred and Inviolable Rights of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and apparently invade or infringe
the Magistrates Power, by submitting its
Commands to the Authority of every
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64701:70"/>
Subjects Conscience; because the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Lawful Authority are so far
from invading its proper Liberty, that
they cannot reach it, in that 'tis seated in
that part of Man, of whose Transactions
the Civil Power can take no Cognizance.
All Humane Authority and Jurisdiction
extends no farther than mens outward
Actions, these are the proper Object of all
their Laws: Whereas Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is Internal and Invisible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the minds and Judgments <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> men; and whilst Conscience acts within
its proper Sphere, that Civil Power is so
far from doing it violence, that it never
can. But when this great and imperious
Faculty passes beyond its own peculiar
Bounds, and would invade the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
Authority by exercising an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Dominion within his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or by venting such <hi>Wild Opinions</hi>
among his Subjects, as he apprehends
to tend to the disturbance of the Publick
Peace, then does it concern him to give
check to its proceedings as much as to
all other Invasions; for the care of the
Publick Good being his Duty, as well as
Interest, it cannot but be in his Power
to restrain or permit Actions, as they are
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64701:71"/>
conducible to that End. Mankind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have the same Natural Right to
Liberty of Conscience in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship, as in Affairs of Justice
and Honesty, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Liberty of <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but not of <hi>practice;</hi> they have
an inviolable freedom to examine the
Goodness of all Laws Moral and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,
and to judge of them by their
suitableness to the natural Reasons of
Good and Evil: but as for the Practice
and all outward Actions either of Virtue
or Devotion, they are equally governa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the Laws and Constitutions of
Common-wealths; and men may with
the same pretences of Reason challenge
an Exemption from all Humane Laws in
Matters of common Honesty upon the
score of the Freedom of their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
as they plead a liberty from all
Authority in Duties of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
upon the same account; because they
have a freedom of Judgment in both, but
of Practice in neither.</p>
            <p>§ 2. And upon the reasonableness of
this Principle is founded the Duty (or
rather Priviledge) of <hi>Christian Liberty,
viz.</hi> To assert the Freedom of the Mind
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64701:71"/>
of Man, as far as 'tis not inconsistent with
the Government of the World, in that
a sincere and impartial use of our own
Understandings, is the first and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Duty of Humane Nature. Hence
it is, that the Divine Providence is so
highly solicitous not to have it farther
restrained than needs must; and therefore
in all matters of pure Speculation it
leaves the mind of Man entirely free to
judge of the Truth and Falshood of
things, and will not suffer it to be usurp'd
upon by any Authority whatsoever:
And whatsoever Opinion any man enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of things of this Nature, he injures
no man by it, and therefore no man can
have any reason to commence any Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with him for it; Every man here
judges for himself, and not for others,
and matters of meer Opinion having no
reference to the Publick, there is no need
of any Publick Judgment to determine
them. But as for those Actions that are
capable of having any Influence upon the
Publick Good or ill of Mankind, though
they are liable to the Determinations of
the Publick Laws, yet the Law of God
will not suffer them to be determin'd
farther than is requisite to the Ends of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64701:72"/>
Government: And in those very things
in which it has granted the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
a Power over the Practices of men,
it permits them not to exercise any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over their Judgments, but leaves
them utterly free to judge of them as far
as they are Objects of meer Opinion, and
relate not to the Common Interest of
mankind. And hence, though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of our Lawful Superiours may
change Indifferent things into Necessary
Duties, yet they cannot restrain the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of our Minds from judging things
thus determin'd to remain in their own
Nature Indifferent: and the Reason of
our Obligation to do them is not fetcht
from any Antecedent Necessity in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but from the Supervening Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Authority, to which Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in all things Lawful is a Necessary
Duty. So that Christian Liberty, or the
Inward Freedom of our Judgments may
be preserved inviolable under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
of the Civil Magistrate, which
are Outward, and concern only the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not Judgments of men; because
the Outward Determination to one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
rather than another does not
abrogate the Inward Indifferency of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64701:72"/>
thing it self; and the Duty of our Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to the Laws arises not
from any Opinion of the Necessity of the
thing it self, but either from some Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and Changeable Circumstances of
Order and Decency, or from a sense of
the Absolute Indispensableness of the
Duty of Obedience. Therefore the whole
Affair of Christian Liberty relates only
to our Inward Judgment of things; and
provided this be kept inviolate, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not (as to that Concern) what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
are laid upon our Cutward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
In that though the Gospel has
freed our Consciences from the Power of
things, yet it has not from that of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
we are free from the matter,
but not from the Authority of Humane
Laws; and as long as we obey the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of our Superiours with an
Opinion of the Indifferency of the things
themselves, we retain the Power of our
Christian Liberty, and are still free as to
the matter of the Law, though not as to
the Duty of Obedience.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Neither is this Prerogative of
our Christian Liberty so much any new
Favour granted in the Gospel, as the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64701:73"/>
Restauration of the mind of Man to its
Natural Priviledge, by Exempting us
from the Yoke of the Ceremonial Law,
whereby things in themselves indifferent
were tied upon the Conscience with as
indispensable an Obligation, as the Rules
of Essential Goodness &amp; Equity, during
the whole Period of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;
which being Cancell'd by the
Gospel, those Indifferent things, that
had been made necessary by a Divine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Command, return'd to their own
Nature, to be used or omitted only as
occasion should direct. And upon this
Account was it that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he
were so earnest an Assertor of his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Liberty against the Doctrine of the
Necessity of Jewish Ceremonies, never
scrupled to use them, when ever he
thought it serviceable to the Interests of
Christianity; as is apparent in his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
of <hi>Timothy,</hi> to which he would
never have condescended out of Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, and yet did
not in the least scruple to do it for other
Purposes as Prudence and Discretion
should direct him. And though in his
Discourses of Christian Liberty he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
only in Circumcision, Meats and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64701:73"/>
Drinks, and other Ceremonial Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
which were then the Particulars
most in Dispute between the Christians
and the Jews; yet by the clearest Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of Reason the Case is the same as
to the Judicial Law, and all other
things commanded by <hi>Moses,</hi> that were
not either Rules of Eternal Goodness, or
expresly establish'd in the Gospel: This
being its clearest and most important De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
to reprieve Mankind from all the
burdensome and Arbitrary Impositions
of <hi>Moses,</hi> that were scarce capable of any
other Goodness than their being Instances
of Obedience; and to restore us to such a
Religion, as was most suitable to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Humane Nature; and to tye
no other Laws upon us, than such whose
Natural and Intrinsick Goodness should
carry with them their own Eternal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.
And therefore whatsoever our
Superiours impose upon us, whether in
Matters of Religious Worship, or any
other Duties of Morality, it neither is,
nor can be any entrenchment upon our
Christian Liberty, provided it be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
with an Opinion of the Antecedent
Necessity of the thing it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:64701:74"/>
§ 4. Now the Design of what I have
discoursed upon this Article of Christian
Liberty, is not barely to shew the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Impertinency of all those little Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
men force from it against the
Civil Magistrates Jurisdiction over the
outward Concerns of Religion; whereas
this relates entirely to things of a quite
different Nature, and is only concern'd
in the inward Actions of the Mind: but
withal my purpose is mainly, by exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all internal Acts of the Soul from the
Empire of Humane Laws, to shew that
Religion, properly so called, is of all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
the least Obnoxious to the abuse of
Government, in that the whole substance
of Religious Worship is transacted
within the Mind of Man, and dwells
in our Hearts and Thoughts beyond
the reach of Princes; the Soul is its
proper Seat and Temple, and there Men
may worship their God as they please,
without offending their Prince. For
the Essence of Religious Worship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in nothing else but a grateful sense
and temper of Mind towards the Divine
Goodness, and so can reside in those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
only that are capable of being
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64701:74"/>
affected with Gratitude and Veneration:
And as for all that concerns External
Worship, 'tis no part of Religion it self,
but only an <hi>Instrument</hi> to express the
Inward Veneration of the Mind by some
Outward Action or Posture of the Body.
Upon which account it is that the Divine
Wisdom has so little concern'd it self to
prescribe any particular Forms of Divine
Service; for though the Christian Laws
command us by some exteriour Signs to
express our Interiour Piety, yet they
have no where set down any particular
Expressions of Worship and Adoration.
And indeed the Exteriour Significations
of Honour being so changeable accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the variety of Customs and Places,
there could be no particular Forms or
Fashions prescribed: for so some would
have been obliged to signifie their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Sentiments of God by Marks
of Scorn and Dishonour; because those
Fashions and Postures which in some
Places are Indications of Respect, are to
others Signs of Contempt. So mad and
Seditious is the Humour of those Men,
who brand all those Forms of Divine
Service, that are not expresly enjoyn'd in
the Holy Volume, with the odious
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64701:75"/>
Titles of Superstition and Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
and so in one Sentence condemn all
the Churches in the World, seeing there
is not any one that has not Peculiar Rites
and Customs of its own, that were never
prescribed nor practised by our Saviour
or his Apostles. And in all Ages of the
World God has left the management of
his Outward Worship to the Discretion
of Men, unless when to determine some
particular Forms has been useful to some
other purposes.</p>
            <p>§ 5. The Ancientest and most Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
practised way of expressing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship and Adoration, was by
Offering of Sacrifices; those First Ages
of the World conceiving it a proper and
natural way of acknowledging their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Dependence upon, and Gratitude
towards God, by publickly presenting
him with a portion of the Best and most
Precious things they had: and God was
well-pleased with them, not because he
at all delighted in the Blood of Bulls and
Goats, but because they were the <hi>Pledges,</hi>
and <hi>Significations</hi> of a Grateful Mind.
And yet this outward Expression of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship, notwithstanding its Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64701:75"/>
and Antiquity, was only made
choice of by good men as a fit way of
intimating the pious and grateful Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Minds, and cannot in the
least pretend to owe its Original to any
<hi>Divine Institution,</hi> seeing there appears
not any shadow of a Command for it;
and to say it was Commanded, though
'tis no where Recorded, is to take the
Liberty of saying any thing without
Proof or Evidence. That indeed Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
became <hi>Expiatory,</hi> and that the
Life of a Beast should be accepted to
redeem the Life of a Man, depended
purely upon Positive Institution, <hi>Lev. 17.
11. For the life of the Flesh is in the
Blood, and I have given it to you upon the
Altar to make an Atonement for your
Souls; for 'tis the Blood that maketh an
Atonement for the Soul.</hi> Now it was a
Matter of Meer Grace and Favour in
God to exchange the Blood of a Beast
for the Blood of a Man, which was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Forfeited for every Transgression of
that Law, that was Establish'd upon no
less <hi>Sanction</hi> than the Threatning of
Death. In which Commutation of the
Forfeiture was an equal mixture of the
Divine Mercy and Severity, hereby he at
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64701:76"/>
once signified his Hatred to Sin, and his
Compassion to Sinners; in that though
he might have remitted the Offence
without exacting the Penalty, yet to
shew his implacable Hatred against Sin,
and withal the more to affright men from
its Commission, he would never remit
its Guilt without some sort of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
and Expiation. But setting aside
this Positive Institution of Sacrifices and
Consumptive Oblations, their Prime and
Natural Use was only to express the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
of a Grateful Mind, as suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
appears not only in the Religion of
the Ancient Jews, but Heathens too.
Among whom the First and Earliest
Footsteps of the Worship of God appear
in their Harvest Sacrifices and Oblations,
when they presented the Deity with a
Parcel of their <hi>Annual Returns</hi> in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of his Bounty and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
<hi>Crying Harvest-in</hi> was their most
Solemn, and most Ancient Festival, <hi>Arist.
Nicomach. l. 8. c.</hi> 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>The Ancient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
and Festival Meeting appear to
have been at first Instituted upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathering
of their Fruits, such were the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64701:76"/>
Offering of their First-Fruits:</hi> which was
a decent and sutable way of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
their Homage and Gratitude to
their Supreme Lord; and had they not
been directed to a wrong Deity (as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
they were to the <hi>Sun)</hi> they might
have been no less pleasing to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Alms and Devotions:
because God is no respecter of Persons,
but in every Nation he that feareth him,
and worketh Righeousness, is accepted
with him.</p>
            <p>§ 6. In the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Dispensation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
God took special care to prescribe
the particular Rites and Ceremonies of
his Worship, not so much by reason of
the Necessity of the thing it self, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Sottishness and Stupidity of
that Age; in that all the Religions in the
World were lamentably degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the most sordid and Idolatrous Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
and the Jewish Nation were sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishly
addicted to the absurd Customs
of their Neighbours; and therefore the
Divine Wisdom enjoyn'd them the most
contrary Usages, as a Fence to keep
them from passing over to the Religion
of the Gentiles. But when Mankind
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64701:77"/>
was grown up to a riper Understanding,
and could discern that Religion was
something else beside Customs and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
then did God Cancel the Old
Discipline of the Law, and by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> establish'd a more
Manly and Rational Dispensation; In
which as he has been more solicitous to
acquaint us with the Main and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Affairs of Religion, so has he
scarce at all concern'd himself in Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Rites and Significations (having
Instituted only two, <hi>viz.</hi> The two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are distinguish'd from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ceremonies, by their being <hi>Federal</hi>
and peculiarly significative of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
between God and Man, seal'd by
the First, renewed and confirmed by the
Second) but as for all other Rites and
Ceremonies of External Service, he has
left their entire Disposal to the Power
and Discretion of the Church it self,
knowing that as long as Men had Wit
and Reason enough to manage the Civil
Affairs of Common-wealths, they could
not want Prudence to Judge what Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
were conducive to Order
and Decency in Publick Worship. And
if we take a Survey of all the Forms of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64701:77"/>
Divine Service practised in the Christian
Church, there is not any of them can so
much as pretend to be appointed in the
Word of God, but depend on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Civil Power in the same
manner as all Customs and Laws of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Government do. And therefore
to quarrel with those Forms of Publick
Worship, that are established by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
only because they are <hi>Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,</hi>
is at once notorious Schism
and Rebellion: For where a Religion is
Establish'd by the Laws, whoever openly
refuses Obedience, plainly rebels against
the Government, Rebellion being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
nothing else but an open denial of
Obedience to the Civil Power. Nor
can Men of this Principle live Peaceably
in any Church in Christendom, in that
there is not a Church in the World,
that has not peculiar Rites and Customs
and Laws of Government and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
            <p>§ 7. But of this I shall have occasion
to account elsewhere, and shall rather
chuse to observe here, from what I have
discoursed of the Use and Nature of
<hi>Outward Worship,</hi> the Prodigious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64701:78"/>
of that clamour some men
have for so many years kept up against
the Institution of <hi>Significant Ceremonies;</hi>
when 'tis the only Use of Ceremonies, as
well as all other outward Expressions of
Religion, to be significant: In that all
Worship is only an Outward Sign of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Honour, and is indifferently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
either by Words or Actions; for
respect may as well be signified by
Deeds, and Postures, and Visible Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
as by Solemn Expressions: Thus
to approach the <hi>Divine Majesty</hi> with
such Gestures as are wont to betoken Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and Humility, is as proper a
Piece of Worship, as to Celebrate his
Greatness by Solemn Praises: And to
offer Sacrifices and Oblations, was among
the Ancients the same sort of Worship
as to return Thanksgivings, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both equally outward Signs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Love and Gratitude. And therefore
there can be no more Exception against
the Signification of Ceremonies than of
Words, seeing this is the proper Office of
both in the Worship of God.</p>
            <p>And as all Forms, and Ceremonies,
and Outward Actions of External Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
are in a manner equally Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64701:78"/>
so are they equally Arbitrary;
only some happen to be more Universally
Practised, and others to be Confined to
some particular Times and Places:
Kneeling, lying Prostrate, being Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
Lifting up the Hands or Eyes,
are not more naturally Significant of
Worship and Adoration than putting off
the Shoes, bowing the Head, or bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Body; and if some are more
generally used than others, that proceeds
not from their Natural Significancy, but
from Custom and Casual Prescriptions:
and to Bow the Body, when we mention
the Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> is as much a natural
signification of Honour to his Person, as
Kneeling, or being Bare-headed, or lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Hands or Eyes, when we offer
up our Prayers to him. But if all Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Actions become to betoken Honour
by Institution, then whatsoever Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Signs are appointed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
unless they are Customary
Marks of Contempt, and so carry in
them some <hi>Antecedent Vndecency,</hi> are
proper Signs of Worship; for if Actions
are made Significant by Agreement,
those are most so whose signification is
ratified by Publick Consent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:64701:79"/>
§ 8. So that all the Magistrates Power
of instituting Significant Ceremonies,
amounts to no more than a Power of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
what shall or shall not be <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Signs of Honour,</hi> and this certainly
can be no more Usurpation upon the
Consciences of men, than if the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Authority should take upon it self
(as some Princes have done) to define
the Signification of Words. For as
Words do not naturally denote those
things which they are used to represent,
but have their Import Stampt upon
them by consent and Institution, and
and may, if Men would agree to it among
themselves, be made Marks of Things
quite contrary to what they now signifie:
So the same Gestures and Actions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
capable of signifying either
Honour or Contumely; and therefore
that they may have a certain and setled
meaning, 'tis necessary their Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should be Determined: and unless
this be done either by some Positive
Command, or Publick Consent, or some
other way, there can be no such thing
as Publick Worship in the World, in
that its proper End and Usefulness is to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64701:79"/>
express Mens Agreement in giving Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Divine Majesty: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unless the Signs by which this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is signified be Publick and Uniform,
'tis not Publick Worship, because there
is no Publick Signification of Honour.
So far is it from being unlawful for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
to define Significant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in Divine Worship, that it is rather
Necessary; in that unless they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
it would cease to be Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
And when different men worship
God by different Actions, according to
their different Fansies, 'tis not Publick,
but Private Worship; in that they are not
Publick, but Private Signs of Honour.
So that Uniformity in the Outward
Actions of Religious Worship is of the
same Use, as certainty in the Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Words, because otherwise they
were no Publick Expressions of Honour.
And therefore, to sum up the whole
Result of this Discourse: If all Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Actions of the Soul are beyond the
Jurisdiction of Humane Power, if by
them the substance of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
be perform'd, if all Outward
Forms of Worship have no other Use,
than only to be Instruments to express
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64701:80"/>
Inward Religion, and if the Signification
of Actions be of the same Nature with
that of Words; then when the Civil
Magistrate takes upon him to determine
any particular Forms of Outward
Worship, 'tis, after all that hideous and
ridiculous Noise that is raised against
it, of no worse Consequence, than if he
should go about to define the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Words used in the Worship of
God.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Nature of all Actions
Intrinsecally Evil, and their
Exemption from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Humane Laws, against
Mr. Hobs; with a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of his whole Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
of Government.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The Contents.</head>
               <p>NO Magistrate can Command Actions
Internally Evil. The Reason hereof is,
not because Men are in any thing free
from the Supreme Authority in Earth,
but because they are subject to a Superiour
in Heaven. To take off all Obligations
antecedent to Humane Laws, is utterly
to destroy all Government. Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:64701:81"/>
his Hypothesis concerning the Nature
and Original of Government proposed.
Its Absurdity demonstrated from its
Inconsistency with the Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Things. The Principles of
Government are to be Adapted, not to
an Imaginary, but to the Real State of
Nature. This Hypothesis apparently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
either the Being of God, or the
Goodness and Wisdom of Providence.
It irrecoverably destroys the Safety of
all Societies of Mankind in the World.
It leaves us in as miserable Condition
under the State of Government, as
we were in his supposed Natural State
of War. It Enervates all its own
Laws of Nature, by Founding the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their Obligation upon meer
Self-Interest. Which false and absurd
Principle being removed, all that is
Base, or peculiar in the whole Hypothesis,
is utterly Cashier'd.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>§ 1. WHen any thing that is
Apparently and Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secally
Evil is the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an Humane
Law, whether it be of a Civil or
Ecclesiastical Concern, here God is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64701:81"/>
to be obeyed rather than Man: No
Circumstances can alter the Rules of
Prime and Essential Rectitude, their
goodness is Eternal and Unchangeable.
And therefore in all such Actions Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to Humane Laws is so far from
being a Sin, that it becomes an indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
Duty. Where the good or evil of
an Action is determined by the Law of
Nature, no Positive Humane Law can
take off its Morality; because 'tis in it
self repugnant to the principles of right
Reason, &amp; by consequence as unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as that. And therefore if the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magistrate should make a Law
not to believe the Being of God or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
the Truth of the Gospel, the
Immortality of the Soul; that Law can
no more bind, than if a Prince should
command a man to murther his Father,
or to ravish his Mother; because the
<hi>Obligatory Power</hi> of all such Laws is
antecedently rescinded by a stronger and
more Indispensable Obligation. And
thus has every Man a natural right to
be Virtuous, and no Authority whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
can deny him the liberty of acting
Virtuously without being guilty of the
foulest Tyranny and Injustice: Not so
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64701:82"/>
much because Subjects are in any thing
free from the Authority of the Supreme
Power on Earth, as because they are
subject to a Superiour in Heaven; and
they are only then excused from the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of obedience to their Sovereign,
when they cannot give it without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against God. So that it is not
originally any right of their own, that
exempts them from a subjection to the
Sovereign Power in all things; but 'tis
purely Gods right of governing his own
Creatures, that Magistrates then invade,
when they make Edicts to violate or
controul his Laws.</p>
            <p>And those who would take off from
the Consciences of men all obligations
antecedent to those of humane Laws,
instead of making the Power of Princes
supreme, absolute, and uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
they utterly enervate all their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and set their Subjects at perfect
liberty from all their Commands. For
if we once remove all the antecedent
obligations of Conscience and Religion,
men will be no further bound to submit
to their Laws, than only as themselves
shall see convenient; and if they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no other restraint, it will be their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64701:82"/>
wisdom to rebel as oft as it is their
Interest. In that the Laws of Superiours
passing no Obligation upon the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of Subjects, they neither are, nor
can be under any stronger Engagements
to Subjection, than to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Penalties and Inflictions
of the Law; and so by consequence may
despise its Obligation, whenever they
can hope to escape its punishment. Now,
how must this weaken the Power, and
supplant the Thrones of Princes, if every
Subject may despise their Laws, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
their Sovereignty, whenever he
can hope to build his own Fortune upon
their Ruines? How would it expose their
Scepters to the continual Attempts of
Rebels and Usurpers, when every one,
that has strength enough to wrest it out
of his Princes hands, has Right and Title
enough to hold it? What security could
Princes have of their Subjects Loyalty,
that will own their Power, as long as it
shall be their interest; and when it ceases
to be so, call it <hi>Tyranny?</hi> How shall
they ever be secured by any Promises,
Oaths, and Covenants of Allegiance,
that have no other band but self-security,
or hope of Exemption from the Penalties
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64701:83"/>
of the Law? Will not the most sacred
Bonds and Compacts leave them in as
insecure a condition as they found them
in? In that Self-advantage would have
kept their Subjects loyal and obedient
without Oaths, and nothing else will do
it with them; and therefore they can add
no new Obligations to that of Interest:
For if to perform their Covenants be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous,
they are bound to perform
them by the Laws of prudence and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
without the Oath as much as
with it; if disadvantageous, no Oath
can oblige them, in that Interest and
Self-preservation is the only enforcement
of all their Covenants: and therefore
when that Tye happens to cease, their
Obligation becomes Null and Void, and
they may observe them if they please, and
if they please break them.</p>
            <p>§ 2. But the vanity and groundlesness
of this opinion will more fully appear,
by discovering the lamentable Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
on which it stands; and that is a late
wild <hi>Hypothesis</hi> concerning the Nature
and Original of Government, which is
briefly this: That the natural conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mankind is a <hi>State and Posture of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64701:83"/>
War</hi> of every man against every man, in
that all men being born in a condition of
equality, they have all an equal right
to all things; and because all cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
all, hence every man becomes an
Enemy to every man: in which State of
Hostility there is no way for any man to
secure himself so reasonable as <hi>Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that is, by Force or Wiles to master
the persons of all men he can, till he see
no other Power great enough to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
himself; so that there is no remedy
but that in the State of Nature all men
must be obliged to seek and contrive, in
order to their own security, one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Destruction. But because in this
Condition Mankind must for ever groan
under all the miseries and calamities of
War, therefore they have wisely chosen
by mutual consent to enter into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
and Covenants of mutual trust,
in which every man has, in order to his
own Security, been content to relinquish
his natural and unlimited right to every
thing; and hereby they enter into a state
of Peace and Government, in which
every man engages by solemn Oath and
Covenant to submit himself to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Laws in order to his own private
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64701:84"/>
safety. So that, according to this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
there are no Rules of Right or
Wrong antecedent to the Laws of the
Common-wealth, but all men are at
absolute liberty to do as they please; and
how cruel soever they may be to one
another, they can never be injurious,
there being nothing just or unjust but
what is made so by the Laws of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
to which all its Members cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to submit when they enter into
it.</p>
            <p>This Hypothesis, as odde as it is, is
become the Standard of our <hi>Modern Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks;</hi>
by which men, that pretend to
understand the real Laws of Wisdom
and Subtlety, must square their Actions;
and therefore is swallowed down, with as
much greediness as an Article of Faith,
by the Wild and Giddy People of the
Age. And of the reality of it none can
doubt but Fops and raw-brain'd Fellows,
that understand nothing of the World,
or the Complexion of Humane Nature.
Now 'tis but labour in vain to go about
to confute the Phantastick Theory of
things, only by demonstrating the
Groundlesness of the Conceit; it being
the fashion and humour of those men I
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64701:84"/>
have to do with, to embrace any Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
how precarious soever, if it do but
serve the purposes of Baseness and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
and therefore I shall not content
my self with barely proving the weakness
of its Foundation, but shall confute and
shame it too, by shewing it to be palpably
false, absurd, and mischievous from these
ensuing Considerations.</p>
            <p>§ 3. First then the Hypothesis, which
he lays as the Basis of all his Discourse,
is infinitely false and absurd: For what
can be more incongruous, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon the supposal of such a state of
Nature as never was, nor ever shall be;
and is so far from being sutable to the
natural frame of things, that 'tis abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
inconsistent with it? And though
Philosophers are so civil among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(with how much reason I now
determine not) as to allow one another
the Liberty, when they frame Theories
and Hypotheses of things, to suppose
some precarious Principles; yet are they
never so fond as to grant such <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Suppositions,</hi> as are apparently
false and incongruous, and repugnant to
the <hi>Real State</hi> of things: or if any will
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64701:85"/>
take upon them that unwarrantable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Invention, yet however it would
be monstrously impertinent to lay down
their own lamentable Fictions, as the
fundamental Reasons of the Truth, and
reality of things. And yet with this
gross and inexcusable absurdity is this
Hypothesis most notoriously chargeable.
For when it has once supposed (without
ever attempting to prove it) that the
<hi>State of Nature</hi> is a State of War, and
that by Nature all men have a right to all
things, and come into the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Obligations to mutual Justice
and Honesty, it from thence concludes:
That in a bare State of Nature there can
be no right and wrong; That what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
soever men may do to each other,
they can do no injuries; That the first
Reason and Foundation of all Natural
Right is Self-preservation, and that in
pursuance of this Principle men enter
into Societies, bind themselves to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of the Laws of Justice and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Equity by mutual Bonds and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and think themselves engaged to
observe them only in order to self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
So that if we remove this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
this fundamental Falshood, that the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64701:85"/>
state of Nature is a state of War and
Anarchy, all the subsequent Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will immediately appear to be as
Groundless, as they are Unreasonable;
and there will not remain the least sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of Reason to believe private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
the only Reason of right and wrong,
or the first and fundamental Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and this Authors City will appear
to stand upon no firmer Foundation
than a Fable and a Falshood; and his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
so grosly absurd and incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as would be highly blameable in the
contrivance of a Dramatick Plot.</p>
            <p>But if, instead of conforming the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Justice and Government to this
false and imaginary state of the World,
we take a serious view of the true and
real posture of the Nature of things;
the dictates of Reason that must natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
result from thence, will be as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to some of those this Author hath
assign'd, as the Natural State of things
is to this imaginary one: Namely,
that there was a first Cause of Humane
Kind, and that this First Cause is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
endued with Goodness and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and therefore that when he made
Mankind, he design'd their Welfare
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64701:86"/>
and felicity; and by consequence created
them in such a condition, in which they
might acquire it. All men therefore
having by the Divine Appointment a
common Right and Title to Happiness,
which cannot be obtain'd without Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor Society subsist without mutual
Aids of Love and Friendship, because
we are not self-sufficient, but stand in
need of mutual assistances; from hence it
follows, That as every man is obliged to
act for his own good, so also to aim at the
common good of Mankind, because
without this the natural Right that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
individual man has to happiness, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly be obtain'd; so that there
will plainly arise from the Constitution
of Humane Nature an <hi>Essential Iustice,</hi>
that demands of every man Offices of
love and kindness to others as well as to
himself; in that without this that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
welfare and happiness, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or rather that Divine Providence
that made it, design'd for all and every
individual of Mankind, must become
utterly unattainable. And hence the sole
Fountain of all the Mischiefs and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in the World is excess of unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
self-love, and neglect of all other
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64701:86"/>
interests but our own; and all such, as
separate their own Concerns from the
Common Interest, are the profess'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Mankind: and therefore 'tis the
only aim of all the just Laws and wise
Philosophy in the world, to assign rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
allowances between Self-love
and Society. And if all men would be
just, and impartial between themselves
and the Publick, <hi>i. e.</hi> all others, there
would be no use of Laws nor Judges,
this being the only Office of Publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
to balance every mans private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
            <p>Well then, because there is an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity that the Government of the
World must be suited to, and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Natural Condition of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature; hence it is, that it is made
as natural to the Being, as 'tis necessary
to the preservation of Mankind; and that
as we cannot subsist, so neither can we
be born out of Society, he that made us,
having made this our natural Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that we could not possibly come into
the World but under a state of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
all Children being actually as
soon as born under the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of their Parents: and therefore
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64701:87"/>
as Mankind cannot continue without
Propagation, so neither can Propagation
without Government; and to be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is as natural upon being born, as to
be a Man. Now 'tis certain, that that
only can be accounted the State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that was made and design'd by the
Author of Nature (for if it be not suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to that Order and Condition of
things, that he has establish'd, 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural.)
And therefore seeing he did
not create Multitudes of men together
out of each others Power, and in a State
of War and Hostility, but begun the
Race of Humane Kind in a <hi>Single Person,</hi>
by whom the Community of Men was
to be Propagated, that must be the State
of Nature in which it was at first founded,
and by which it is still continued: But if
men will feign such an imaginary State
of Nature as is utterly contradictory to
the Real, and then, upon such an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Frame of Affairs, establish our natural
Rights; 'tis no wonder if they prove
contrary to our Common Interests, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are suited to a contrary State
of things.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Secondly, No man can seriously
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64701:87"/>
embrace this Hypothesis, that does not
firmly believe either (1.) That there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was any Author of Humane Nature,
but that a multitude of men hapned by
chance to arise like <hi>Mushromes</hi> out of the
Earth altogether, who out of diffidence
and jealousie one of another for want of
acquaintance shun'd Society, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
like all other Beasts of Prey into
Dens and secret retirements, where they
lived poor and solitary as <hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Owls,</hi>
and subsisted like <hi>Vermine</hi> by robbing
and filching from one another; till find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this way of living lamentably unsafe
and uneasie, every man being always
upon the guard against every man, and
in continual fear and danger from the
whole Community, they grew weary of
this forlorn and comfortless way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
and thence some that were more
wise, or more cowardly than others,
when they chanced to meet in their
wild rangings after Prey, instead of
belabouring one another with <hi>Snag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,</hi>
and beating out each others brains,
made signs of Parley, and so began to
treat of Terms of mutual Peace and
Assistance, and so by degrees to win
others into their Party, till they hearded
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64701:88"/>
together in small Rendezvouses, like
the little Common-wealths of the savage
<hi>Americans,</hi> which in process of time
grew up into larger Societies, from
whence at length came the different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Governments of the World.
But if this fortuitous Original of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature be too absurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to be asserted, then (2.) It must be
supposed, that there was a first Author
and Creator of Mankind: and if there
were, then whoever believes this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,
must withal believe that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
things so ill, that unless his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
had by chance been more provident
than himself, they must of necessity have
perish'd as soon as they were made; and
therefore that the Well-being of the
World is to be entirely attributed to
mans Wit, and not to Gods Providence,
who sent his Creatures into it in such a
condition as should oblige them to seek
their own mutual ruine and destruction;
so that had they continued in that state
of War he left them in, they must have
lived and died like Gladiators, and have
unavoidably perish'd at one time or other
by one anothers Swords; and therefore
that Mankind owe the comfort of their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64701:88"/>
lives not at all to their Creator, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to themselves; forasmuch as the
very Laws of Nature, whereby, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Hypothesis, the World is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
were not establish'd by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence; but are only so many
Rules of Art, being, as all other
Maximes of Prudence and Policy are,
Inventions of humane Wit, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
man not in the natural state and
posture of War, in which God left him,
but in a preternatural one of his own
contriving. But certainly the Deity
that made us, if we suppose him good,
made us not to be miserable; for so
we must unavoidably have been in a
perpetual state of War: and therefore
to suppose he both made and left us in
that condition, is directly to deny our
Creators goodness. And then if we
suppose him wise, we cannot imagine
he would frame a Creation to destroy it
self; unless we can believe his only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was to sport himself in the folly and
madness of his Creatures, by beholding
them by all the ways of force and
fraud to conspire their own mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
and therefore if the Creation
of man were a product of the Divine
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64701:89"/>
Wisdom or Goodness, his natural State
must have been a condition of Peace, and
not such a State of War that should na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
tend to his misery, ruine, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
destruction.</p>
            <p>§ 5. (3.) This Hypothesis irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
destroys the safety of all Societies
of Mankind in the World: for if perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
safety and private interest be the only
Foundation of all the Laws of Nature
or Principles of Equity, <hi>i. e.</hi> If men
endeavour Peace, and enter into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
of mutual Trust, if they invade
not the Proprieties of others, if they
think themselves obliged to promote the
good of the Society, if they submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Laws of the Common-wealth,
if they practise Justice, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Mercy, and all other Virtues, if
they refrain from Cruelty, Pride, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and all other Vices, only to secure
their own personal safety and interest;
then whenever this Obligation ceases, all
the Ties to Justice and Equity, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
all their Force and Reason from it,
must also cease; and when any single
Person can hope to advance his own
private Interest by the ruine of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64701:89"/>
Publick, it will be lawful for him to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it; and War, Rebellion, and injuries
will be at least as innocent as Faith, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and Obedience; because these are
good only in order to private Interest,
and therefore when those chance to be as
conducive to it, they will then be as just
and lawful. So that this single Principle
does as effectually work the subversion
of all Government, as if men were taught
the most professed Principles of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as, that all Government is Tyranny
and Usurpation; that his Majesties pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Crown is his best Title;
that whoever has wit or strength enough
to wrest his Scepter from him, has right
to hold it. For as men of these and the
like perswasions will never act them, but
when opportunity invites; and will be
obedient to any Government, till they
can destroy it: So will those other rebel,
as soon as they think it their Interest. For
when ever they can hope to mend their
Fortunes by Rebellion, the same obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
that restrain'd them from it, does
now as forcibly invite them to it, that
is self-interest, <hi>i. e.</hi> they cannot but
think Rebellion lawful, as oft as they
think it safe. And there are no Villains
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64701:90"/>
so mad or foolish as to attempt it upon
other grounds. So that, though this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
has assign'd us some not unuseful
Laws of Nature, yet has he effectually
enervated their force and usefulness, by
resolving the reason of their obligation
into self-interest; and so laying the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Principles of all Injustice, as the
only Foundation of all the Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
For as 'tis the Nature and Office
of Justice to maintain the Common
Right of all, and to secure my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
happiness as well as my own; so
the formal obliquity of all Injustice lies
in pursuing of a private Interest without
regard to the Common good of all and
every member of the Society. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if private Interest be the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and enforcement of the Laws of
Nature, men will have no other Motive
to obey their Constitutions, than what
will as strongly oblige to break them;
<hi>i. e.</hi> if men are just and honest for no other
reason than because 'tis their Interest,
then when 'tis their Interest, they may
(and if they are wise will) be unjust and
dishonest. And so men that owne the
Laws of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> this Principle may
be Villains, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of all their restraints;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64701:90"/>
and the most lewd and profligate Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
will, as well as they, be just or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
as it serves their turns. For this
Principle, that engages men to be honest
only as long as they must, will as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
oblige them to be Rogues as soon as
they can.</p>
            <p>§ 6. So that according to this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
Mankind is left in as ill a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
after they have by Pacts and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
united into Societies, and a State of
Peace, as they were in their natural State
of War. For all Covenants of mutual
Trust are (according to its own Rules)
in the State of Nature invalid; because
under that men are under no obligations
of Justice and Honesty to one another,
and have no other measure of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
but their interest; and therefore as
that might invite them in some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to enter into Bonds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
so it may in others to break them.
So that in the State of Government all
their Promises, Oaths, and Contracts
will prove as ineffectual as in the State of
Nature: Partly, because the force of all
Contracts, made in the State of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ariseth from the validity of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64701:91"/>
first Compact, that was made in the State
of Nature; that is, in that state in which
it could have no validity; partly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have no other tye but that of
self-interest, and so can lay no other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
upon us to observe them, than
they might have done before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if Mankind be once supposed in this
natural state of War, they can never be
delivered from it; and after they have
enter'd into Covenants of Peace, they
would remain as much as before in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of War, and be subject to all the
same dangers and miseries, that would
have annoyed them if they had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their natural state. For if Justice
and fidelity be not supposed to be the
Law and Duty of our Natures, no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
are of power enough to bring us
under any obligation to them.</p>
            <p>Now, having thus clearly blown up
the foundations of this Hypothesis, 'twere
but labour in vain to make particular
enquiries into all the flaws and follies
of its Superstructures, seeing they must
of necessity stand and fall together; for
if its subsequent Propositions be cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
deduced from these Fundamental
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64701:91"/>
Principles, all the evidence and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they can pretend to, depends on them;
and therefore the Premisses being once
convicted of falshood, all pretences to
truth in the conclusions must necessarily
vanish. And if any of them happen to
be true and rational, 'tis not by vertue
of these, but other Principles. Thus
though the Laws of Nature, he assigns,
may be useful to the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Happiness of Mankind; yet,
because upon those grounds, on which
he assigns them, they would be no Laws,
that alone is sufficient evidence of the
errour and vanity of his whole Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis;
seeing how good soever they may
be in themselves, yet upon the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and in the Method, in which he
proposes them, they are of no force. In
that self-interest being the only reason
of their obligation, the Interests of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Society come thereby to be no better
secured with, than without them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if they were not in force by vertue
of any Compact, all men would chuse
to act according to them, when they
thought it advantageous; and when they
have the utmost force his Principles can
give them, no man would think they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64701:92"/>
obliged him, when ever he apprehended
them disadvantageous. So that this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Principle of meer self-interest
running through the whole Systeme, and
twisting it self with every branch of his
Morality, it does not only eat out, and
enervate its native life and vigour, but
withal envenoms their natural truth and
soundness with its own malignity. Which
Principle being removed, and that influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it hath on other parts of this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
being prevented, and withal the
Foundation on which it stands ruin'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> his absurd and imaginary <hi>State of
Nature,</hi> we have perhaps cashier'd all
that is either base or peculiar in it, and
restored the true accounts of natural Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and right Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> That all men
have a natural Right to Happiness from
the very design of their creation, that this
cannot be acquired without mutual aids
and friendships; and therefore right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
dictates, that every man should have
some concern for his Neighbour, as well
as himself: because this is made necessary
to the welfare of the World by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
state of things, and by this mutual
exchange of love and kindness men sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
one another in the comforts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life.</p>

               <p>HOw a belief of the Imposture of all
Religions is become the most powerful
and fashionable Argument for the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
of all. Though Religion were
a Cheat, yet because the World cannot be
Govern'd without it; they are the most
mischievous Enemies to Government
that tell the World it is so. Religion is
useful or dangerous in a State, as the
temper of mind it breeds is peaceable
or turbulent. The dread of Invisible
Powers is not of it self sufficient to awe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64701:93"/>
people into subjection, but tends more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
to Tumults and Seditions. This
largely proved by the ungovernableness of
the Principles and Tempers of some Sects.
Fanaticism is as natural to the Common
people, as folly and ignorance; and yet is
more mischievous to Government, than
Vice and Debauchery. How the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
of all Nations and Religions agree in
the same Principles of Sedition. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
different Sects of Religion in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
is only to keep up so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
pretences and occasions of publick
disturbance. The corrupt passions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of men make Toleration infinitely
unsafe. Toleration only cried up by opprest
Parties, because it gives them opportunity
to overturn the settled frame of things. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man that desires indulgence is engaged
by his Principles to endeavour Changes and
Alterations. A bare indulgence of men
in any Religion, different from the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
way of Worship, does but exasperate
them against the State.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:64701:93"/>
§ 1. AND now the Reason, why
I have thus far pursued this
Principle, is, because 'tis
become the most powerful Patron of
the Fanatick Interest; and a Belief of
the indifferency, or rather Imposture
of all Religion, is now made the most
effectual (not to say most fashionable)
Argument for <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi>
For when men have once swallowed
this Principle, That Mankind is free from
all obligations antecedent to the Laws
of the Common-wealth, and that the
Will of the Sovereign Power is the
only measure of Good and Evil; they
proceed suitably to its Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to believe, That no Religion
can obtain the force of a Law, till 'tis
establish'd for such by Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
that the Holy Scriptures were not
Laws to any man, till they were enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Christian Magistrate; that no
man is under any obligation to assent to
their Truth, unless the Governours of
the Common-wealth require it; and
that setting aside their Commands, 'tis
no sin to believe our Blessed Saviour a
villanous and lewd Impostor; and that,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64701:94"/>
if the Sovereign Power would declare
the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to be Canonical Scripture, it
would be as much the Word of God as
the four Gospels. <hi>Leviath.</hi> p. 3. c. 33. <hi>For
if Sovereigns in their own Dominions are
the sole Legislators, then those Books only
are Canonical, that is Law, in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which are established for such by the
Sovereign Authority.</hi> So that all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are in reality nothing but Cheats and
Impostures, and at best but so many
Tales of Imaginary and Invisible Powers,
Publickly allowed and encouraged, to
awe the Common People to Obedience.
<hi>Leviath.</hi> p. 1. c. 12. <hi>Who are betrayed into
it by these four Follies, A false Opinion of
Ghosts and immaterial Substances, that
neither are, nor ever can be; Ignorance
of Second Causes, Devotion towards what
men groundlesly fear; And mistaking
things Casual for Divine Prognosticks.</hi> In
brief, all Religion is nothing but a Cheat
of Policy, and was at first invented by
the Founders and Legislators of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
and by them obtruded
upon the credulous Rabble for the Ends
of Government. And therefore, though
Princes may wisely make use of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of Religion to serve their own turns
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64701:94"/>
upon the silly Multitude, yet 'tis below
their Wisdom to be seriously concern'd
themselves for such Fooleries; so that,
provided their subjects will befool them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with any one Imposture, 'tis not
material which they single out; in that
all Religions equally oblige to the belief
of Invisible Powers, which is all that is
requisite to the Designs of Policy. And
as long as a Prince can keep up any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of Religion in the minds of
his Subjects, 'tis no Policy to disoblige
and exasperate any of them, by interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his Power for one Party more than
another, and by forcing all other Sects
against their own Inclinations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Belief to the Perswasions of
one Faction; but rather to endear them
all to himself, by indulging them their
Liberty in their different Follies: and so
he may with more ease secure his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by abusing all, and yet disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
none.</p>
            <p>§ 2. In answer to this Objection, 'tis
not material to my present Purpose
largely to examine &amp; refute these Wild
and extravagant Pretences, by asserting
the Truth and Divine Authority of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64701:95"/>
Religion, and giving a rational account
of the Grounds and Principles, on which
it stands: only let me observe that this
Discourse lies under no less prejudice
than this, That if any of the Principles
of Religion be true, then is all these mens
Policy false: But waving this too great
advantage, I shall content my self only to
discover of what noisom and pernicious
consequence such Principles are to the
Common-wealth, though it were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that all Religion were nothing but
Imposture. And this I shall do (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reminding the Reader how I have
already prevented this Objection in the
first part of the Discourse, when I shew'd
what good or bad Influence upon the
State mens perswasions about Religion
have) by these four ensuing Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>First, Then methinks his Majesty is
bound to con these men thanks for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to render the truth of Religion
suspected, and to possess mens minds
with apprehensions of its being false;
whereby they effectually rob him of the
best security of his Crown, and strongest
inducements of obedience to his Laws.
There being for certain nothing so
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64701:95"/>
absolutely necessary to the reverence of
Government, the peace of Societies, and
common Interests of mankind, as a sense
of Conscience and Religion: This is the
strongest Bond of Laws, and only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of Government; without it the
most absolute and unlimited Powers in
the World must be for ever miserably
weak and precarious, and lie always at
the mercy of every Subjects passion and
private Interest. For when the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Conscience and Religion are
cashier'd, men can have no higher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
to Loyalty and Obedience,
than the considerations of their own
private Interest and security; and then
wherever these happen to fail, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and advantage invite to disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
men may do as they please: And
when they have power to shake off Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
they have right too; and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
Usurper shall have as fair a Title
to his Crown as the most lawful Prince;
all Government will be founded upon
force and violence, and Kings nothing
but terrible men with long Swords. But
when the ties of Conscience are super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced
upon those of Secular Interest,
this extends the Power of Princes to the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64701:96"/>
hearts of their Subjects, and secures
them as much from the very thoughts,
as attempts of Treason. For nothing so
strongly influences the minds of men, or
so authoritatively commands their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and inclinations, as Religion; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as no fears are (not only to the
considerate part of Mankind, but to the
ruder sort) so vehement as those of Hell,
nor hopes so active as those of Heaven:
and therefore the Commands of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being back'd with such mighty sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they must needs have infinitely more
force to awe or allure the minds of
men to a compliance, than any Secular
Interests. Whereas those men that think
themselves above the Follies of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and either believe or regard not the
evils threatned hereafter (an attainment
to which these our <hi>modern Politicians</hi>
do not blush to pretend, though it be
but an odde piece of Policy openly to
owne and proclaim it) must make their
present Interest the Rule and measure of
all their actions; and can have no other
obligation to obey their lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
in what they command, than they
have to disobey them, <hi>viz.</hi> their own
security and self-preservation. Whereas
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64701:96"/>
if these men lived under the restraints
of Conscience, and the serious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of Religion, and believed
the Laws of their Prince to be bound
upon them by the Laws of God, and
that under the threatnings of everlasting
misery; their Loyalty would be tied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them by all that men can either hope
or fear, and they would have all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
to obedience that the serious
reflections upon a happy or miserable
Eternity could lay upon them. But if
the Principles of Government have so
essential a dependence upon those of
Religion, if nothing be powerful enough
to secure obedience but the hopes and
fears of another life, if all humane
Laws have their main force and efficacy
from the apprehensions of Religion, if
Oaths, Promises, and Covenants, and
whatsoever else whereby Civil Societies
are upheld, are made firm by nothing
but the bonds of Religion; then let Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
judge, how much it is beholden
to those men, who labour to bring it into
Publick Disreputation, and to possess
their Subjects with an opinion of its
falshood: whereby they not only set
them loose from their Authority, but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64701:97"/>
enrage them against it, by perswading
them they are governed by Cheats and
Impostures, and that the Magistrate
builds his Dominion upon their folly
and simplicity, there being nothing more
hateful to Mankind than to be imposed
upon: So that though Religion were a
Cheat, they are apparently the greatest
Enemies to Government, that tell the
World it is so.</p>
            <p>§ 3. But secondly, Nothing more
concerns the Interest of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
than to take care, what particular
Doctrines of Religion are taught with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Dominions; because some are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
advantageous to the ends of
Government, and others as naturally
tending to its disturbance: Some incline
the minds of men to candour, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and ingenuity, and work them
to a gentle and peaceable temper, by
teaching humility, charity, meekness,
and obedience: Now 'tis the Interest of
Princes to cherish and propagate such
Doctrines among their Subjects, that
will make them not only quiet, but use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the Common-wealth. But others
there are that infect the minds of men
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64701:97"/>
with pride, peevishness, malice, spight,
and envy; that incline them to delight
in detracting from Princes, and speaking
reproachfully of Government, and breed
in them such restless and seditious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that 'tis next to an impossibility for
any Prince to please or oblige them.
Now, as for such perverse and arrogant
Sects of men, it certainly concers Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
to suppress them as so many
Routs of Traytors and Rebels.</p>
            <p>Religion then is either useful or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
in a Common-wealth, as the
temper of mind it breeds is peaceable
or turbulent: and as there is nothing
more serviceable to the Interests of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
so there is nothing more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous:
and therefore nothing more
concerns Princes, than to take care what
Doctrines are taught within their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
For seeing Religion has, and will
have the strongest influence upon the
minds of men; when that renders them
averse and troublesom to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
'tis that all the Power nor Policy
in the World can keep them peaceable,
till such perswasions are rooted out of
their minds by severity of Laws and
Penalties. And, as long as men think
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64701:98"/>
themselves obliged, upon pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
to Disobedience and Sedition,
not any Secular threatnings and inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are of force enough to bridle the
<hi>Exorbitances of Conscience.</hi> There is
not any vice so incident to the Common
People as <hi>Superstition,</hi> nor any so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous.
'Tis infinitely evident from
the Histories and Records of all Ages
and Nations, that there is nothing so
vicious or absurd but may pass for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and (what is worse) the more
wild and giddy Conceits of Religion
are ever suckt in by the multitude with
the greatest passion and eagerness; and
there is no one thing in the World so
difficult, as to bring the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to true Notions of God and his
Worship; insomuch that 'tis no Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
to affirm, That Religion <hi>(i. e.</hi> what is
mistaken for it) has been one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Principles of mischief and wickedness
in the World. And if so, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nothing requires so much care and
prudence in the Civil Magistrate, as <hi>its</hi>
due conduct and management. So that
the dread of <hi>Invisible Powers</hi> is of it
self no more serviceable to awe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into subjection, then to drive them
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64701:98"/>
into Tumults and Confusions; and if it
chance to be accompanied (as it easily
may) with tumultuous and seditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
'tis an invincible obligation to
Villany and Rebellion. And therefore
it must needs above all things concern
Princes, to look to the Doctrines and
Articles of mens Belief; seeing 'tis so
great odds that they prove of dangerous
consequence to the publick Peace: and
in that case, the apprehensions of a Deity,
and a World to come, makes their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
almost irresistible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. There are some Sects whose
Principles, and some persons whose
tempers will not suffer them to live
peaceable in any Common-wealth. For
what if some men believe, That if
Princes refuse to reform Religion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
'tis lawful for their <hi>Godly Subjects</hi>
to do it, and that by violence and force
of Arms? What if they believe, That
Princes are but Executioners of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi>
of the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> and that in case
of disobedience to their Spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
they may be Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and by consequence Deposed?
What if they believe, That Dominion
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64701:99"/>
is founded in Grace; and therefore that
all <hi>wicked Kings</hi> forfeit their Crowns,
and that it is in the power of the <hi>People
of God</hi> to bestow them where they
please? And what if others believe, That
to puruse their success in villany and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
is to follow Providence; and that
when the Event of War has deliver'd
up Kings into their Power, then not to
depose or murther them, were to slight
the Guidance of <hi>Gods Providential Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations?</hi>
Are not these, and the like
innocent Propositions (think you)
mightily conducive to the peace and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of Common-wealths? Such
Articles of Faith as these cannot but
make brave and obedient Subjects, and
he must needs be a glorious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prince, where such conceits are the
main ingredients of his Subjects Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Let any man shew me, what
Doctrines could have been more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
contrived to disturb Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than these. And if men would
study on purpose to frame and model a
<hi>Rebellious Faith,</hi> these must have been
their <hi>Fundamental Articles:</hi> and yet 'tis
sufficiently known where they have been
both believed and practised. But further,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64701:99"/>
Is there not a sort of <hi>Melancholy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onists</hi>
in the World, whose very Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
inclines them to Quarrels and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
against the State, and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Publick Affairs? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so malepart as a Splenetick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the inward discontent and uneasiness
of mens own minds maintains it self
upon the faults and miscarriages of
others: and we may observe, how this
humour is ever venting it self in sighs
and complaints for the badness of the
times <hi>(i. e.</hi> in effect of the Government)
and in telling and aggravating little sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that may reflect upon the wisdom
and ability of their Superiours. 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to please their fretful and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
minds; the very delights and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Court shall stir their envy,
and the vanities of the great Ones grieve
and wound their tender Souls. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Princes behave themselves, they can
never win upon the affections of these
people; their very prosperity shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
them, and they are ready upon
all occasions to bring them to <hi>Account</hi> for
their misdemeanours: And if any of the
<hi>Grandees</hi> happen to be discontented, they
have here a Party ready formed for the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64701:100"/>
purpose, to revenge their injury, and
bring <hi>evil Counsellors,</hi> that seduce the
King, <hi>to Iustice.</hi> And 'tis not impossible
but there may be a sort of proud and
haughty men among us (not over-well
affected to Monarchick Government)
who, though they scorn, yet patronize
this humour, as a check to the insolence
and presumption of Princes. Again,
Are there not some whole Sects of men,
all whose Religion is made up of nothing
but passion, rancour, and bitterness?
All whose Devotion is little better than
a male-contentedness, their Piety than a
sanctified fury, and their zeal than a
proud and spightful malice; and who, by
the Genius of their Principles, are
brought infinitely and irrecoverably
under the power of their passions;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Now, nothing imports Governours
so much as to manage mens passions; in
that 'tis these, rather than our appetites,
that disturb the World. A person that
is debaucht and intemperate is indeed
useless to the Common-wealth, but he
that is turbulent and passionate is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.
But then when passion is fired
with religious zeal, nothing can temper
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64701:100"/>
its outragious and Fanatick heats; but
it works the minds of men into rancour
and bitterness, and drives them into all
manner of savage and inhumane practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Princes have never found any thing
so restive and ungovernable, as <hi>Sectarian
Madness;</hi> no malice so spightful and
implacable, as the zeal of a <hi>Godly Party;</hi>
nor any rage so fierce and merciless, as
<hi>sanctified Barbarism.</hi> All the ancient
Tyranny has in some places been out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
by a <hi>thorough-godly Reformation:</hi>
zeal for the Glory of God has often
turn'd whole Nations into Shambles,
fill'd the World with continual Butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Massacres, and flesh'd it self with
slaughters of Myriads of Mankind. And
when men think their passions warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their Religion, how is it possible
it should be otherwise? For this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
them by their greatest hopes
and fears to act them to the highest:
and 'tis easie to imagine what calm and
peaceable things those men must be,
who think it their duty to enforce and
enrage their passions with the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Conscience. And yet alas! How
few are they, who have wisdom enough
to keep their zeal clean from these sowre
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64701:101"/>
and crabbed mixtures? The generality
of men are scarce sensible of their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
wickednesses; and 'tis observable,
That in all Ages, and all Religions of
the world, few people have taken notice
of them beside their Wise men and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.
And even among the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of Christianity it self, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that our Religion has made such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
provisions against all Excesses of
Passion, and establish'd Love, Charity,
Moderation, Patience, Candor, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
as its Prime, and Fundamental
Duties; yet the Spirit of meekness and
humility soon decayed, with its Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Apostolical Professors; and
within a few Centuries of years the
Church was over-run with some Sects of
men, much of the same temper with
some of our <hi>Modern Saints.</hi> So that
even in true and innocent perswasions 'tis
necessary to asswage the distempers and
indiscretions of a forward zeal: The
giddy multitude judge weakly, fancy
strongly, and act passionately; and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
restrain'd by wary and sober Laws,
will drive on so furiously in a good cause,
till they run their Religion into Folly
and Faction, and themselves into tumults
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64701:101"/>
and riotous proceedings. What <hi>Socrates</hi>
once said of Vertue, That when it is not
conducted by prudence, it is but Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and a phantastick thing, is much
more true of Religion; which, when it
wants the guidance and ornament of
this Vertue, may be folly, or madness,
or any thing rather than it self. In
brief, <hi>Fanaticism</hi> is both the greatest, and
the easiest vice that is incident to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
'tis a Weed that thrives in all Soils,
and there is the same <hi>Fanatick Spirit,</hi> that
mixes it self with all the Religions in the
World. And 'tis as natural to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People, as the proud, or ignorant,
or perverse, or factious, or stubborn,
or eager, or passionate: for when ever
any of these vices or follies are twisted
with mens apprehensions of Religion,
they naturally work, and ferment their
minds into a boysterous and tumultuary
zeal. And yet how infinitely difficult it
is to cure the <hi>Common Heard</hi> of these
vices, the Experience of all Ages is too
great a demonstration: so that there is
nothing so apparently necessary, or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
as to govern the vulgar Rout in their
conceptions of Religion; seeing 'tis so
natural for them both to mix and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64701:102"/>
heigthen, yes, and sanctifie their passions
with their Consciences. And from hence
it is, that though the Fanaticks in all
Nations may disagree in the objects and
matters of their Superstition, according
to the different Customs of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and variety of their Educations;
yet as for their tendency to disturbance
and Sedition in the State, 'tis in all
places the same to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses:
And those unquiet Sects, that
have often disturb'd, and sometimes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
whole Kingdoms in <hi>Africa,</hi> if they
had hapned to have been born in <hi>Europe,</hi>
would have done the same here; where
though their Religion might have been
different, yet would their <hi>Genius</hi> have
been the same, as rising from the same
<hi>Conjunction</hi> of Conscience and Passion.
And therefore it cannot but be a wonder
to any man, that is acquainted with the
Experience of former Ages, to see Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
after so many warnings, so
insensible of this mischief: and however
they may think themselves unconcern'd
to restrain the opinions of any dissenting
Sect, as being perhaps but foolish and
inconsiderable in themselves; yet nothing
can more highly concern them than to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64701:102"/>
provide against their inclinations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
generally of a sad and dangerous
consequence to the State. And this at
present may suffice to evince, How much
it concerns Authority to look to the
particular Principles and Inclinations of
every Sect; and to prove, That the
meer Belief of <hi>Invisible Powers,</hi> is so far
from being Religion enough to awe men
to obedience; that unless it be temper'd
with a due sense of vertue, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with special prudence and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it rather tends to make the rude
multitude more head-strong and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Thirdly, To permit different
Sects of Religion in a Common-wealth, is
only to keep up so many pretences and
occasions for <hi>publick Disturbance;</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Religion are ever the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious,
and the less material their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
the more implacable their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred:
as the <hi>Turks</hi> think it more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God, to kill one <hi>Persian</hi> than
seventy Christians. No hinge so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
alienates mens affections, as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of judgment in matters of Religion;
here they cannot disagree, but they must
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64701:103"/>
quarrel too: and when Religion divides
mens minds, no other Common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
can unite them; and where zeal
dissolves friendship, the ties of Nature
are not strong enough to reconcile it.
Every Faction is at open defiance with
every Faction, they are always in a state
and posture of War, and engaged in a
mortal and irreconcileable hatred against
each other. When ever men part Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
every Party must of necessity
esteem the other impious and Heretical;
in that they never divide but with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
that they could not agree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being guilty of some sin or other, as
Blasphemy, or Idolatry, or Superstition,
or Heresie, or the like: For all agree in
this Principle, <hi>That peace ought always
to be preserved, where it can without
offending God, and offering violence to
Conscience:</hi> and therefore they cannot
but look upon one another, as lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Divine Wrath and Displeasure,
and consequently, in a damnable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and then are both Parties engaged,
as they love God, and the Souls of men,
to labour one another ruine. And
when the Party is form'd, and men are
<hi>listed</hi> into it by chance and Education,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64701:103"/>
the distinguishing Opinion of the Party
is to them the most material and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Article of their Belief; and so
they must account of all that either dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owne
or deny it, as of Heathens, Infidels,
and Enemies to the Faith. Besides that,
all men are naturally more zealous about
the Principles in which they differ, than
about those in which they agree. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
whets and sharpens their zeal,
because it endangers the truths they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for; whereas those that are not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
are secure and out of hazard of
being stifled by the adverse Party, that
is concern'd equally with themselves for
their preservation. And hence we see,
by daily Experience, that men, who are
tame and cool enough in the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of Religion, are yet utterly impatient
about their own unlearned and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Wranglings, and lay a greater stress
upon the Speculations of their own Sect,
than upon the Duties of an absolute and
indispensable necessity; only because
those are contradicted by their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
and these are not. Well then,
seeing all dissenting Parties are possess'd
with a furious and passionate zeal to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
their own perswasions, and seeing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64701:104"/>
they are perswaded that their zeal is in
<hi>God's Cause,</hi> and against the Enemies
of <hi>God's Truths;</hi> How vain is it to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
Peace and Settlement in a Common-wealth,
where their Religion keeps men
in a state of War, where zeal is arm'd
against zeal, and Conscience encounters
Conscience, where the Glory of God
and the Salvation of Souls lies at stake,
and where <hi>Curse ye Meroz</hi> is the Word
of both Parties? So that whatsoever
projects fansiful men may propose to
themselves, if we consider the passions
of humane Nature, as long as Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and Competitions in Religion
are kept up, it will be impossible to keep
down mutual hatreds, jealousies, and
animosities; and so many divided
Churches as there are in a State, there
will ever be so many <hi>different Armies,</hi>
who, though they are not always in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
fighting, are always in a disposition
to it.</p>
            <p>Beside, where there are divided Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of Religion in the same Kingdom,
how shall the Prince behave himself to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them? If he go about to ballance
them against one another, this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way to forfeit his Interest in them all;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64701:104"/>
and whilst he seems concern'd for no
Party, no Party will be really concern'd
for him, every one having so much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
for it self, as to think it ought to
enjoy more of his favour and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
than any other. And withal 'tis
an infinite trouble and difficulty to poise
them so equally, but that one Party shall
grow more strong and numerous than the
rest; and then there is no appeasing their
zeal, till it has destroyed and swallowed
up all the weaker Interests. But suppose
he be able to manage them so prudently,
as always to keep the ballance equal; he
does thereby but keep up so many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that are ready form'd to joyn with
any emergent Quarrels of State: and
whenever the <hi>Grandees</hi> fall out, 'tis but
<hi>heading</hi> one of these, and there is an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>
And let men but reflect upon all the
late Civil Wars, and Rebellions of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi>
and then tell me, which way
they could either have been commenced
or continued, had it not been for different
Factions of Religion.</p>
            <p>If he side with one Party, and by his
favour mount it above the rest, that not
only discontents, but combines all the
other dissenting Factions into an united
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64701:105"/>
opposition against his own: and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
their common Interest, to work
and contrive its ruine; its prosperity
does but exasperate the competition of
all its Rivals into rage and indignation:
and as success makes it self more secure
in its settlement, so it makes them more
restless and industrious to overturn it.
No Party can ever be quiet or content as
long as 'tis under any other, but will
ever be heaving and struggling, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
the Power that keeps it down:
and therefore we find that all Dissenters
from the establish'd frame of things are
always assaulting it with open violence,
or undermining it by secret practices,
and will hazard the State, and all, to free
themselves from oppression; and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
they are, as long as they are the
<hi>weaker Party.</hi> And therefore we never
find this way of Toleration put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
under any Government, but where
other Exigences of State required and
kept up a standing Army; and by this
means 'tis not so difficult to prevent the
Broils and Contentions of Zeal: but
this is only a more violent way of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
mens Consciences, and instead
of restraining them by <hi>Laws</hi> &amp; <hi>Penalties,</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:64701:105"/>
it does the same thing with <hi>Forts</hi> and
<hi>Cittadels:</hi> So that unless we are willing
to put our selves to the expence and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of keeping up <hi>standing Forces,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
to dissenting Zealots does but
expose the State to the perpetual squab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Wars of Religion. And we
may as well suppose all men to be wise
and honest, and upon that account can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
all the Laws of Justice and Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as imagine, where there are
divided Factions in Religion, that men
will be temperate and peaceable in the
enjoyment of their own conceits, and
not disturb the publick Peace to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and establish them; when 'tis so
well known from the experience of all
Ages, that nothing has ever been a more
effectual Engine to work popular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
than Changes and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. So that though the State think
it self unconcern'd to restrain mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
and Opinions, yet methinks
they should be a little concern'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Tumults and Disturbances that
naturally arise from their propagation.
And could it be secured, That if all men
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64701:106"/>
were indulged their liberty, they would
use it modestly, and be satisfied with
their own freedom, then (I confess)
Toleration of all Opinions would not be
of so fatal and dangerous consequence;
as if all men were as wise and honest as
<hi>Socrates,</hi> they might, as well as he, be
their own Law, and left entirely to their
own Liberty, as to all the entercourses
and transactions of Humane life. But
alas! this is made infinitely impossible,
from the corrupt Passions and Humours
of Men: All Sects ever were, and ever
will be, fierce and unruly to inlarge their
own Interests, invading or supplanting
whatever opposes their increase, and will
all certainly conspire the Ruine of that
Party that prevails and triumphs over
the rest; every Faction ever apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it its due to be Supreme: and there
will ever be a necessity of <hi>Reformation,</hi>
as long as all Factions are not <hi>uppermost;</hi>
and it will be crime enough in any one
Party, to be superiour to another. So
that if all our dissenting Sectaries were
allowed their entire liberty, nothing can
be expected (especially from people of
their complexion) but that they should
all plot together against the present Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64701:106"/>
of the Church; every <hi>Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
being fully perswaded of its worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
in comparison to it self: for
unless they had apprehended their own
way more excellent, they had never
divided from ours. Beside that 'tis a
fundamental Principle that runs through
all their Sects, That they are bound
under pain of Eternal Damnation to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
their utmost to establish the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God in in its greatest Purity and
Perfection; and withal apprehending
that way now established by Law defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
and superstitious, they cannot but
be bound in Conscience to endeavour its
utter ruine and subversion; which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
when they have once compassed,
they entertaining the same Opinion of
each other as they do of us, they will turn
their Weapons upon themselves, and
with as much Zeal contrive each others
destruction as they did ours: and the
result of all will be, That the Common-wealth
will be eternally torn with inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
Quarrels and Commotions, till it
grow so wise again as to suppress all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
but one; that is, till it return to
that wisdom and Prudence from whence
it parted by <hi>Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:64701:107"/>
And therefore nothing can be more
vulgarly observable, than that though
all Parties, whilst under the Power of a
more prevailing interest, have cried up
Toleration, as the most effectual instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to shake and dissettle the present
frame of things; yet have they no sooner
effected their Design, than they have
immediately put in to scramble for the
Supremacy themselves; which if they
once obtain, they have ever used with
as much rigour and severity upon all
Dissenters, as they ever felt themselves.
So that this Principle of Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
much resembles that of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Goods; for as those men cry up
equality of Estates, as a most reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
piece of Justice, that have but a small
share themselves; yet whenever their
Pretence succeeds, and they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
their own Fortunes, and served
their own turns, they are the first that
shall then cry it down, and oppress their
inferiours with more cruelty than ever
themselves felt whilst in a lower Station;
so do those whose private perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
happen to cross the publick Laws,
easily pretend to Liberty of Conscience.
One must yield; and because their stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64701:107"/>
Zeal scorns to bend to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Authority, these must be
forced to give place to that: So that
when Conscience and Authority happen
to encounter, all the Dispute is, Which
shall have most force in Publick Laws,
whether my own or my Princes opinion?
But how plausibly soever this Notion
may be pleaded by men out of Power,
'tis ever laid aside as soon as ever they
come into it; and the greatest pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to it when oppress'd, are always the
greatest Zealots against it, as soon as it
has mounted themselves into Power, as
well knowing it to be the most effectual
Engine to overturn any settled Frame of
things.</p>
            <p>In brief, 'Tis <hi>Reformation</hi> men would
have, and not <hi>Indulgence;</hi> which they
only seek to gain ground for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their <hi>Mines,</hi> and planting of their
<hi>Engines,</hi> to subvert the established state
of things. For if we demand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would be born with in their
Dissentions from our way of Worship?
They answer, Because they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to it in Conscience, <hi>i. e.</hi> because
they apprehend it sinful; for otherwise
they must think themselves guilty of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64701:108"/>
most intollerable Schism and Rebellion,
to create Factions and Divisions in a
Common-wealth, when they may avoid
it without any violence to their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:
But if they apprehend our way
of Worship upon any account sinful, then
are they plainly obliged in Conscience to
root it out, as displeasing to Almighty
God, and in its stead to plant and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
their own. And now if this be the
Issue of this Principle, let Magistrates
consider how fatal and hazardous altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Religion have ever been to the
Common-wealth. They cannot pluck
a Pin out of the Church, but the State
immediately shakes and totters; and if
they will allow their Subjects the liberty
of changing and innovating in Religion
(as it is apparent from the Premisses they
must, if they allow them their pretences
to liberty of Conscience) they do but
give them advantages for Eternal Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Commotions and Disturbances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Fourthly, A bare Indulgence
of Men in the free exercise of any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
different from the publick profession,
can lay no obligation upon the Party.
Perhaps when the rigour of a Law, under
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64701:108"/>
which they have smarted a while, is at
first relaxed, this indeed they may at
present take for a kindness, because 'tis
really a favour in comparison to their
former Condition; and therefore as long
as the memory of that remains fresh
upon their minds, it may possibly affect
them with some grateful Resentments.
But alas! these affections quickly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
and then what before was <hi>Favour,</hi>
is now become <hi>Iustice;</hi> and their Prince
did but restore them to their just and
lawful rights, when he took off his <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Laws</hi> and <hi>Impositions</hi> from the
Consciences of his best Subjects. While
those unjust Laws were in force, he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
and persecuted the <hi>People of
God;</hi> and therefore when he cancels
them, all the kindness he is guilty of, is
only to repent of his Tyranny and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
which is no favour, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
no Obligation. And (what
is more considerable) all the dissenting
Parties he permits, and does not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
he disobliges. Is this all the
kindness (say they) he can afford the
<hi>Godly,</hi> not to persecute them by Law
and force to their utter ruine? Are we
beholden to him barely for suffering us
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64701:109"/>
to live in our native Soil, and enjoy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our fundamental Priviledges? Is this
all the reward and encouragement we
deserve? Are not we the <hi>praying and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
People of the Nation,</hi> for whose
sakes only the Lord is pleased to stay
among us? And were it not for us,
would he not perfectly forsake and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
it? And is this all our requital, to
be thus slighted, and thus despised, only
for our zeal to God, and serviceableness
to the Publick, by that power and interest
we have in him, to keep him among us;
whilst <hi>vain and useless persons</hi> are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
and encouraged with all places
of Office and Employment? These are
the natural results of the minds of men,
who think themselves scorn'd and disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
especially when flush'd with
any conceit and high opinion of their
own Godliness. And 'tis an eternal
Truth, <hi>That for the godly Party not to
be uppermost, is and ever will be Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
For nothing more certain, than
that all men entertain the best opinion of
their own Party, otherwise they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enrolled themselves in it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the State value them not at as high
a rate as they do themselves, they are
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64701:109"/>
scorn'd and injured, because they have
not that favour and countenance they
deserve. And so unless they have Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
encouragement, as well as indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
they have reason to be discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
because they have not their due.
And if the Prince do not espouse their
Party, he undervalues, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disgusts them; and if he joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to any other (as there is a necessity
of his owning some Profession) he does
not only disoblige, but alienate their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
by embracing an Interest they
both hate and scorn. For, where-ever
there is <hi>difference</hi> of Religion, there is
<hi>opposition</hi> too; because men would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
divide from one another, but upon
grounds of real dislike; and therefore
they are always <hi>contrary</hi> in those Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
that distinguish their Parties.
And this cannot but be a mighty endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Prince to them, when he
neglects and discountenances his best
Subjects, only because they are the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Party (for so every Party is to it self)
to join himself to their profest and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
Enemies. And they will be
wonderfully forward to assist a Patron of
Idolatry and Superstition, or an Enemy
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64701:110"/>
to the power of godliness (for these are
the softest words that different Sects can
afford one another.) And withal I might
adde, That they must needs be much in
love with him, when they have reason to
believe, that they lie perpetually under
his displeasure, and that he looks upon
them as little better than Enemies. So
that if a Prince permit different Parties
and interests of Religion in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
however he carries himself towards
them, he shall have at least all Parties
discontented but one: for if himself be
of any, he displeases all but that; if of
none, he displeases all: And Zealous
and Religious People of all sorts must
needs be wonderfully in love with an
<hi>Atheist;</hi> and there is no remedy, but he
must at least be thought so, if he be not
of any distinct and visible profession.</p>

               <head>The Contents.</head>
               <p>THe Mystery of Puritanism lies in this
Assertion, That nothing ought to
be established in the Worship of God, but
what is expresly commanded in the Word
of God. The Wildness, Novelty, and
unreasonableness of this Principle. It
makes meer Obedience to lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
sinful. It takes away all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Settlement in any Church or
Nation. It is the main pretense of all
pious Villanies. It cancels all Humane
Laws; and makes most of the Divine
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64701:111"/>
Laws useless and impracticable. It
obliges men to be seditious in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the World, in that there is no
Church that has not some Customs and
Vsages peculiar to it self. All that
pretend this Principle do and must act
contrary to it. The exorbitancy of this
Principle makes all yielding and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension
to the men that plead it unsafe
and impolitick. Wherein the perfection
and sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures
consists. Of the Vanity of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
who tell us, That the Civil
Magistrate is to see the Laws of Christ
executed, but to make none of his own.
The dangerous consequents of their way
of arguing, who would prove, That
God ought to have determined all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of his own Worship. 'Tis
scarce possible to determine all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of any outward action, they are
so many and so various. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
has no way to make men of this
perswasion comply with his will, but
by forbidding what he would have
done. The Puritans upbraided with
Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Book of <hi>Ecclesiastical
Politie,</hi> and challeng'd to answer it.
Their Out-cries against Popery, Will-worship,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64701:111"/>
Superstition, adding to the
Law of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> retorted upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The main Objection against the
Magistrates power in Religion proposed,
<hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis possible that he may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
things sinful and superstitious.
This Objection lies as strongly against
all manner of Government. Our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
is after the best way of settling
things, not that possibly might be, but
that really is. Though Ecclesiastical
Iurisdiction may be abused, yet 'tis then
less mischievous than Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The Reason of the necessity of
subjection to the worst of Governours,
because Tyranny is less mischievous than
Rebellion or Anarchy. The Author of
the Book entituled, <hi>Vindiciae contra
Tyrannos,</hi> confuted. That it may, and
often does so happen, that 'tis necessary
to punish men for such perswasions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they have innocently abused
themselves. Actions are punishable by
Humane Laws, not for their sinfulness,
but for their ill Consequence to the
Publick. This applied to the Case of a
well-meaning Conscience.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:64701:112"/>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. ALL things, as well
Sacred as Civil, that
are not already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
as to their
Morality, <hi>i. e.</hi> that
are not made necessary Duties by being
commanded, or sinful Actions by being
forbidden either by the Law of Nature,
or positive Law of God, may be lawfully
determined either way by the Supreme
Authority; and the Conscience of every
subject is tied to yield Obedience to all
such Determinations. This <hi>Assertion</hi> I lay
down to oppose the first and the last and
the great Pretence of Non-conformity,
and wherein (as one observeth) the very
<hi>Mystery of Puritanism</hi> consisteth, <hi>viz.</hi>
That nothing ought to be established in
the Worship of God, but what is authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by some Precept or Example in the
Word of God; that is the complete and
adequate Rule of Worship: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Christian Magistrates are only to see
that executed that Christ has appointed in
Religion, but to bring in nothing of their own;
they are tied up neither to add nor diminish,
neither in the matter nor manner:</hi> So that
whatever they injoin in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64701:112"/>
if it be not expresly warranted by
a Divine Command, how innocent soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it may be in it self, it presently upon
that account loses not only its <hi>Liberty</hi>
but its <hi>Lawfulness;</hi> it being as requisite
to Christian practice, that things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
should still be kept indifferent, as
things necessary be held necessary. This
very Principle is the only Fountain and
Foundation of all Puritanism, from
which it was at first derived, and into
which it is at last resolved. A pretence
so strangely wild and humorsom, that it
is to me an equal wonder, either that
they should be so absurd as seriously to
believe it; or, if they do not, that they
should be so impudent, as thus long and
thus confidently to pretend it, when it
has not the least shadow of Foundation
either from Reason or from Scripture;
and was scarce ever so much as thought
of, till some men having made an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Separation from the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> were forced to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by as unreasonable Pretences. For,
what can be more incredible, than that
things that were before lawful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
should become sinful upon no
other score than their being commanded,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64701:113"/>
               <hi>i. e.</hi> that meer obedience to lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
should make innocent actions
criminal? For the matter of the Law is
supposed of it self indifferent; and
therefore if obedience to the Law be
unlawful, it can be so for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
than because 'tis Obedience. So
that if Christian Liberty be so awkard
a thing (as these men make it) 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but <hi>Christian Rebellion,</hi> 'tis a
Duty that binds men to disobedience,
and forbids things under that formality,
because Authority commands them.
Now what a reproach to the Gospel is
this, that it should be made the only
Plea for Sedition? What a scandal to
Religion, that tenderness of Conscience
should be made the only Principle of
Disobedience; and that nothing should
so much incline men to be refractory to
Authority, as their being conscientious?
What a perverse folly is it to imagine,
That nothing but opposition to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can secure our liberty? And what
a cross-grain'd thing is it, to restrain
things only because they are matters of
liberty; and first to forbid Princes to
command them because they are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and then Subjects to do them only
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64701:113"/>
because they are commanded. But to
expose the absurdity of this Principle by
some more particular considerations.</p>
            <p>§2. First, The follies and mischiefs
that issue from it, are so infinite, that
there can be no setled Frame of things
in the World, that it will not overturn:
and if it be admitted to all intents and
purposes, there can never be an end of
disturbances, and alterations in the
Church; in that there never was, nor
ever can be any <hi>Form of Worship</hi> in the
World, that is to all circumstances pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the World of God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if this Exception be thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to destroy one, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
but it may, as occasion requires,
serve as well to cashier all; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
take away all possibility of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement.
Thus when upon this Principle,
the Disciplinarians separated from the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Independents
upon the same ground separated from
them, the Anabaptists from the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,
the Familists from the Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists,
and the Quakers from the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
and every Faction divided, and
subdivided among themselves into innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64701:114"/>
Sects, and Undersects; and as
long as men act up to it, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
but Innovations must be endless.
If it be urged against Lord-Bishops, 'tis
as severe against <hi>Lay-Presbyters;</hi> if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Musick in Churches, then farewel
singing of Psalms in Rhime; if against
the Cross, why not against sprinkling in
Baptism? and if against Cathedral
Churches, then down go all <hi>Steeple-Houses:</hi>
If against one thing, then
against every thing; and there is nothing
in the exteriour parts of Religion, but
the two Sacraments, that can possibly
escape its impeachment. All the pious
Villanies, that have ever disturbed the
Christian World, have shelter'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this grand Maxime, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> is the only Law-maker to his
Church; and whoever takes upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to prescribe any thing in Religion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades
his Kingly Office. The <hi>Gnosticks</hi> of
old so abused this pretence to justifie any
seditious and licentious practices, that
they made Heathen Princes look upon
Christianity as an Enemy to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> of late have so
vex'd and embroil'd Christendom with
the same Principle, that Christian Princes
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64701:114"/>
themselves begin to be of the same
perswasion. 'Tis become the only Patron
and Pretext of Sedition: and when any
Subjects have a mind to set themselves
free from the Laws of their Prince, they
can never want this pretence to warrant
their disobedience. Seeing there is no
Nation in the World that has not divers
Laws, that are not recorded by the four
<hi>Evangelists;</hi> and therefore if all humane
Institutions intrench upon our Saviours
Kingly Prerogative, they are, and ever
must be, provided with matters of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
to disturb Government, and justifie
Rebellion.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Secondly, Nay further this fond
pretence, if made use of to all the ends,
for which it might as wisely serve, would
cancel all humane Laws, and make most
of the divine Laws useless; which have
only described the general Lines of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but left their particular determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Wisdom of humane Laws.
Now the Laws of God cannot be put in
practice, but in particular Cases and
Circumstances, these cannot be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
but by the Laws of man; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if he can command nothing, but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64701:115"/>
what is already prescribed to us in the
Word of God, he can have no power to
see the Divine Laws put in Execution.
For where are described all the Rules of
Justice and Honesty? Where are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
all doubts and questions of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Where are decided all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of Right and Wrong? Where are
recorded all the Laws of Government
and Policy? Why therefore should hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Authority be allowed to interpose
in these great affairs, and yet be denied it
in the Customs of Churches and Rules
of Decency? There is no possible reason
to be assign'd but their own humour and
fond opinion, they are resolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, and that is Argument enough,
for 'tis unanswerable. How comes this
Proposition to be now limited to matters
of meer Religion, but only because this
serves their turn; for otherwise, Why
are not the Holy Scriptures as perfect a
Rule of Civil, as of Ecclesiastical Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
Why should they not be as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
a <hi>System</hi> of Ethicks, as they are a
<hi>Canon</hi> of Worship? Why do not these
men require from the Scriptures express
Commands for every Action they do in
common life? How dare they take any
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64701:115"/>
Physick, but what is prescribed in the
Word of God? How dare they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
a Suit at Law, without <hi>Warranty</hi>
from Scripture? How dare they do any
natural action, without particular advice
and direction of Holy Writ?</p>
            <p>§ 4. Thirdly, But as foolish as this
Opinion is, its mischief equals its folly;
for 'tis impossible but that these Sons
of strife and singularity must have been
troublesom and seditious in all
Churches and Common-wealths. Had
they lived under the Jewish Church,
why then, Where has <hi>Moses</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Feast of <hi>Purim,</hi> the Feast of the
Dedication, the Fasts of the fourth, the
fifth, the seventh, and the tenth months:
What Warrant for the building of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues?</hi>
and what Command for that
significant Ceremony of wearing sack-cloth
and ashes, in token of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
If in the primitive Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
why then, where did our Saviour
appoint the <hi>Love-Feasts?</hi> Where has he
instituted the <hi>Kiss of Charity?</hi> Where
has he commanded the observations of
<hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>Easter?</hi> Where the <hi>Lords-Day
Sabbath?</hi> and, where all their other
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64701:116"/>
Commemorative Festivals? <hi>Vide Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull.
de Coronâ, c.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Will they retreat to the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Churches, they will there meet with not
only all the same, but many more Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
and superstitious Ceremonies
to offend their tender Consciences, and
will find themselves subject to the same
Discipline and Government, saving that
their Superintendents want the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi>
Honours and Revenues of the
English Bishops, partly through the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
of the Country, partly through
the injury of Sacriledge, but mainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Church Revenues are in the
possession of Romish Bishops? Will
they to <hi>France,</hi> there, notwithstanding
the unsetled state of the Protestants of
that Nation, through want of the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Civil Power, they shall
meet with their Liturgies, and establisht
Forms of Prayer, and Change of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
for Divine Service, as well as at
home? If they will to <hi>Geneva,</hi> there
Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Common-Prayer-Book is
as much imposed, as the Liturgy of the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> there they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
the use of Wafer-Cakes, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of Godfathers, and Godmothers,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64701:116"/>
bidding of Prayer, proper Psalms not
only for days, but for hours of the day,
with divers other Rites and Ceremonies,
that are no where recorded in the Word
of God. In a word, What Church in
the World can affirm these were the only
Customs of the Apostolical Age, and
that the Primitive Church never used
more or less than these? So that these
men of scruple, that renounce Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> must
do the same with all Churches in the
World; in that there is not any one
Church in Christendom, whose Laws
and Customs are not apparently liable
either to the same, or as great exceptions.
Now Magistrates must needs be obligd to
deal wonderful gently with such tender
Consciences as these, that are acted by
such nice and unhappy Principles, as must
force them to be troublesom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable
in any Common-wealth in the
World. Nay, what is more notorious
than all this, these men have all along, in
pursuit of this Principle, run directly
counter to their own practices and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions.
For, not to puzzle them to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
in which of the Gospels is injoyn'd
the form of <hi>Publick Penance</hi> in the Kirk
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64701:117"/>
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or to find out the <hi>Stool of
Repentance</hi> either among the works of
<hi>Bezaleel,</hi> or the Furniture of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
We read indeed of Beesoms, and
Flesh-forks, and Pots, and Shovels, and
Candlesticks, but not one syllable of
Joynt-stools. Let them tell me, What
Precept or Example they have in the
Holy Scriptures for singing Psalms in
Meeter? Where has our Saviour or his
Apostles enjoyn'd a <hi>Directory</hi> for publick
Worship? And that which themselves
imposed, What Divine Authority can it
challenge, beside that of an <hi>Ordinance</hi>
of Lords and Commons? What Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in the Word of God can they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
for the significant Form of swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(by laying their hand upon the Bible)
which yet they never scrupled? What
Scripture Command have they for the
three <hi>significant Ceremonies</hi> of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the whole Congregation should take it
(1.) Uncovered, (2.) Standing, (3.) with
their right hand lift up bare. Now,
What a prodigious piece of impudence
was this, that when they had not only
written so many Books with so much
vehemence against three innocent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64701:117"/>
of the Church, only because
they were significant, but had also invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Nation in a civil War (in a great
measure) for their removal, and had
arm'd themselves and their Party against
their Sovereign with this <hi>Holy League</hi> of
Rebellion, that even then they should
impose three others, so grosly and so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
liable to all their own Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
What clearer evidence can we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
have, That it is not Conscience, but
humour and peevishness that dictates
their scruples? And, What instance have
we, in any Nation of the World, of any
Schism and Faction so unreasonably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
and continued? The Rebellion of
<hi>Corah</hi> indeed may resemble, but nothing
can equal it.</p>
            <p>And from hence we may discover, how
vain a thing it is to make Proposals and
Condescensions to such unreasonable
men, when 'tis so impossible to satisfie
all their demands; and suppose we
should yield and deliver up to their zeal,
those harmless Ceremonies, they have so
long worried with so much fury and
impatience; it would only cherish them
in their restless and ungovernable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions:
For whilst their peevish tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64701:118"/>
are acted by this exorbitant Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Affairs of Religion can never be
so setled, as to take away all occasions
and pretences of Quarrel; in that there
never can be any Circumstances of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship, against which this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
may not as rationally be urged (and
'tis impossible to perform Religious
Worship without some Circumstance or
other: and if all men make not use of
it against all particulars, 'tis because
they are humoursom as well as sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and so allow one thing upon the
same Principle they disavow another:
For certainly otherwise it were impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that any men should, when they pray,
refuse to wear a Surplice; and yet when
they swear, (which is but another sort of
Divine Worship) never scruple to kiss
the Gospel. So that whoever seriously
imbibes this perswasion, and upon that
account withdraws himself from the
Communion of the Church, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
not the consequences of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
if it does not lead him down to the
lowest folly of <hi>Quakerism,</hi> which after
divers gradual exorbitances of other
less extravagant Sects, was but the last
and utmost improvement of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64701:118"/>
And therefore, whilst men are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
with such a restless and untoward
perswasion, What can be more apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vain, than to talk of <hi>Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
or to hope for any possibility of
quiet and setlement, till Authority
shall see it necessary (as it will first or
last) to scourge them into better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and wiser opinions? So that we
see the weight of the Controversie lies
not so much in the particular matters in
debate, as in the Principles upon which
'tis managed; and for this very reason,
though we are not so fond as to believe
the Constitutions of the Church unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
yet we deem it apparently absurd,
to forego any of her establish'd Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
out of compliance with these mens
unreasonable demands: which as it
would be coarsly impolitick upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other accounts, so mainly by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up her Laws, and by consequence
submitting her Authority to such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as must be eternal and invincible
hindrances of Peace and Setlement.
This, let them consider whom it most
concerns.</p>
            <p>§ 5. Fourthly, As for their Principle
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64701:119"/>
of the perfection and sufficiency of the
Holy Scriptures, 'tis undeniably certain
as to the fundamental Truths, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Duties of Christian Religion;
but when this Rule, that is suited only to
things necessary, is as confidently appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to things accessory, it lays in the minds
of men impregnable Principles of Folly
and Superstition: For confounding them
in their different apprehensions between
the substantial Duties, and external
Circumstances of Religion; and making
them of equal value and necessity, it
makes the doing, or not doing of a
thing, necessary to procure the Divine
acceptance, which God himself has not
made so; and places a Religion in things
that are not religious, and possesseth
the minds of men with false and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
fears of God: wherein consisteth the
very Essence and Formality of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whereas were they duly instructed
in the great difference between things
absolutely necessary, and things meerly
decent, and circumstantial; this would
not only preserve them in the right No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of good and evil, but also keep
up the Purity of Religion, Decency of
Worship, and due Reverence of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64701:119"/>
And therefore when these men
would punctually tye up the Magistrate
to add nothing to the Worship of God,
but what is enjoyn'd in the Word of God,
if their meaning be of new Articles of
Belief, 'tis notoriously impertinent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
to this no Civil Magistrate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends;
But if their meaning be, that the
Magistrate has no Authority to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the particular circumstances of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that are left undetermined by the
Divine Law, 'tis then indeed to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
but as notoriously false; in that we
are certainly bound to obey him in all
things lawful, and every thing is so, that is
not made unlawful by some prohibition;
for things become evil not upon the
score of their being not commanded, but
upon that of their being forbidden; and
what the Scripture forbids not, it allows;
and what it allows, is not unlawful; and
what is not unlawful, may lawfully be
done: and therefore it must needs be our
Duty to conform to all circumstances of
Worship, that are determined by lawful
Authority, if they are not antecedently
forbidden by the Law of God, though
they are not commanded. Things that
are not determined remain indifferent;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64701:120"/>
what is indifferent is lawful, and what is
lawful the Magistrate may lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and if it be sinful to obey him in
these things, 'tis so to obey him at all;
for all things are either lawful or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
'tis a sin to obey him in things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
and if it be so in things lawful too,
then is all obedience sinful.</p>
            <p>§ 6. Fifthly, When they tell us, That
the Civil Magistrate is indeed to see to
the execution of the Laws of Christ, but
to make none of his own: 'tis a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
without a difference; for if he may
provide for the execution of the Laws
of Religion, then may he make Laws
that they shall be executed; this being
the most proper and effectual means to
promote their execution: so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more vain than to deny the
Civil Magistrate a power of making
Laws in Religion, and yet to allow him
an Authority to see the Laws of Religion
executed; because that is so apparently
implyed in this, in that whoever has a
power to see that Laws be executed,
cannot be without a power to command
their execution: Especially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the particular Nature of the Laws
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64701:120"/>
of Christ, that they have only determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the substance and Morality of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship, and therefore must needs
have left the ordering of its circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the power and wisdom of lawful
Authority; &amp; whatever they determine
about them, is but in order to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Laws of God; in that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they enjoyn cannot be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
without being clothed with some
particular circumstances, and reduced to
some particular Cases. Thus when the
Holy Apostle sets us down a general
Rule, that all things be done in order
and decency, without determining what
the things are that are conducive to it,
the determination of this Rule when 'tis
reduced to practice, must be entirely left
to the Government of the Church, that
must judge what things are decent and
orderly; and what Laws it establishes in
order to it, though they are but further
pursuances of the Apostolical Precept,
yet are they new and distinct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
by themselves, and injoyn some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that the Scripture no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
So that the Divine Laws being
general, and general Laws not being to
be put in Execution, but in particular
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64701:121"/>
Cases and Instances, he that has Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to look to the Execution of these
general Laws, must withal be vested
with a Power to determine with what
particular Instances, Cases, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
they shall be put in Practice and
Execution.</p>
            <p>And here when they tell us, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand with the Love and Wisdom of
God, not to take order himself for all
things that immediately concern his own
Worship and Kingdom; and that if <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> has not determined all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Rites and Circumstances of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he has discharged his office with less
wisdom and fidelity than <hi>Moses;</hi> who
ordered every thing appertaining to the
Worship of God, even as far as the
<hi>Pins</hi> and <hi>Nails</hi> of the Tabernacle, with
divers others the like idle and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
reasonings: One would think
that men who argue at this rate, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
at least discovered in the Holy
Scriptures a complete Form of Religious
Worship, as to all particular Rites and
Ceremonies of an eternal, universal,
and unchangeable obligation; and
therefore till they can believe this them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and prove it to others, instead of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64701:121"/>
returning solemn Answers to such baffled
and intolerable Impertinencies, I shall
only advise them, to consider the unlucky
consequents of their way of arguing,
when instead of producing a particular
Form of Publick Worship, prescribed
by God himself, they with their wonted
modesty prove he ought to have done it;
and that unless he has done it, he has
been defective in his Care &amp; Providence
over his Church: For what can the Issue
of this be, but that God is chargeable
with want of Wisdom or Goodness, or
with some other Defect, even by certain
and infallible Experience? For, if he has
not determined every particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Worship, then he must stand
charged with all the absurdities, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
against their being left undetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and therefore if no such prescribed
form can be produced, (as 'tis infinitely
certain none ever can) then let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
what follows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So unhappy a thing is
it, when men will needs be disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Experience; whose Evidence is so
powerful and forcible upon the minds of
men, that Demonstration it self is not
strong enough to cope with it: How
much less the weak and puny Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64701:122"/>
wherewith these men assault
it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Sixthly, There is no particular
Action but what is capable of a strange
and unaccountable variety of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
nor any part of outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
but may be done after a thousand
different Modes and Fashions; in that as
every action is clothed with natural and
emergent Circumstances, so is every Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
with its Circumstances, every
one of which may be modified in sundry
ways and manners. And therefore, in this
infinite variety of things, the Laws of
God prescribe only the general Lines of
Duty, and rarely descend to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Determinations, but leave them to
be determined by Prudence and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by Choice, and Custom, by Laws,
and Prescriptions, and by all those ways
by which Humane Affairs are governed
and transacted. Thus for example, The
Divine Law has made Charity a standing
and eternal Duty, but has left its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
way of expression undetermined, and
uncommanded: and 'tis indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be done by building of Colledges,
or Churches, or Hospitals; by repairing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64701:122"/>
of Bridges, or Rivers, or High-ways; by
redeeming of Slaves and Prisoners; by
hospitality to the Poor, or Provision
for Orphans; or by any other way of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or Private Bounty: and when a man's
own thoughts have determined his own
choice to one or more of these Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
even that is vested with a strange
number of Accidents and Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which must of necessity be left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to the conduct of his own Reason
and Discretion. And the case is the same,
as in all other Duties of Moral Virtue;
so in that of religious gratitude, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship, this Duty it self is of a
natural and essential necessity; but yet
may and must be performed with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
variety of Dresses, Customs
and ways of Expression, that are left ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
free and undetermined in Scripture:
any of which may be decently used, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they do not make debasing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of God, wherein consists the
proper folly of Idolatry and Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And all the advantages of Order
and Solemnity, wherewith Religion may
be prudently adorned, are not only
lawful, but decent, although they are
not warranted by any Precept in the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64701:123"/>
Word of God; that neither has, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can determine all particular Modes
and Circumstances of Worship, they
are so various, and so changeable. And
men may, with as much reason, search
the holy Records for the Methods of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Proceedings</hi> in our Common Law
Courts, as for particular <hi>Rubricks</hi> and
<hi>Prescriptions</hi> of all outward Forms and
Circumstances of Publick Worship: So
that what these men demand is so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that, considering the nature of
things, 'tis impossible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. And this may suffice to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the unparallel'd follies and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
of this Principle. Which being all
I intend at present, I suppose it needless
to engage in any further Scholastick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes,
about the nature of <hi>indifferent
Actions,</hi> and some other less material
Controversies that depend upon this;
partly because this Principle on which
alone they stand, being removed, they
become utterly groundless, and so by its
Confutation are sufficiently confuted;
and partly because all this has been so
often, so fully, and so infinitely performed
already. And of all the Controversies
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64701:123"/>
that have ever been started in the world,
it will be hard to find any that have been
more fairly pursued and satisfactorily
decided, than this of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
against its <hi>Puritan</hi> Adversaries; that
has all along been nothing else but a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
between Rational Learning, and
Unreasonable Zeal. And it has been no
less an unhappiness, than it was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension
in the Defenders of our
Church; that they have been forced to
waste their time and their parts, in baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
the idle Cavils of a few hot-headed
and Brain-sick People. And there is scarce
a greater Instance of the unreasonableness
of Mankind, than these mens Folly, in
persisting so obstinately in their old and
pitiful Clamours, after they have been
so convincingly answered, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively
confuted. And indeed how
is it possible to satisfie such unreasonable
men, when their greatest Exception
against the Constitutions of the Church
has ever been no other than, That they
were the Churches Constitutions? Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that if Authority should think
good out of compliance with their
cross Demands, to command what they
now think necessary, that must then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64701:124"/>
to their Principles, become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful:
because (forsooth) where they
take away the liberty of an Action, they
destroy its lawfulness. Now what pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
could have betrayed men into so
absurd a Perswasion, but a stubborn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to be refractory to all Authority,
and to be subject to nothing but their
own insolent <hi>Humours?</hi> And as long as
they lie under the power of this Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that they are obliged in Conscience
to act contrary to whatever their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
command them in the Worship of
God, the Magistrate has no other way left
to <hi>decoy</hi> them into Obedience, but by
forbidding what he would have them
do, and commanding what he would
have them forbear; and then if he will
accept to be obeyed by disobedience, he
shall find them (good men) the most obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Subjects in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. But to return to what I was
saying, instead of troubling my self with
any further Confutation of so baffled a
Cause, I shall rather chuse to do it
more briefly, and yet perhaps more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
by uybraiding them with
their shameful Overthrows, and daring
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64701:124"/>
them but to look those Enemies in the
face, that have so lamentably cowed
them by so many absolute Triumphs and
Victories: And, not to mention divers
other Learned and Excellent Persons, I
shall only single out that famous Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
of our Church, Mr. <hi>Hooker;</hi> upon
him let them try their Courage (though
by so safe a Challenge I do but give proof
of my own Cowardise.) How long has
his incomparable Book of <hi>Ecclesiastical
Polity</hi> bid shameful defiance to the whole
Party, and yet never found any so hardy
as to venture upon an Encounter? Now
this Author being confessedly a Person
of so much Learning, Candour, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Ingenuity, and withal so
highly prized, and insisted upon by the
regular and obedient Sons of the
Church, that they have in a manner cast
the issue of the whole Cause upon his
performance: What is the Reason he
was never vouchsafed so much as the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of a just Reply? 'Tis apparent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
both by their Writings, and their
Actions, that they have not wanted Zeal;
and therefore that he has escaped so long
free from all contradiction, 'tis not for
want of good will, but ability; not
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64701:125"/>
because they would not, but because
they were convinced they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
him. So that the Book it self is as
full and demonstrative a Confutation
of their Cause, as the matters contained in
it; <hi>i. e.</hi> 'tis Unanswerable, (and I know
nothing can do it more effectually, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
perhaps a Reply to it) and shall live
an eternal shame and reproach to their
Cause, when that is dead; and would
probably have been buried in utter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness,
were it not for this Trophy
of success against them: And therefore,
until they can at least pretend to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
some satisfactory Answer to that
Discourse, they prove nothing but their
own impudence; whilst they continually
pelt us with their <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> and such
little Exceptions, that have been so long
since so shamefully and demonstratively
baffled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. And whereas they are wont, in
order to the making their Principles look
more plausibly, to stuff their Discourses
with frequent and tragical Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against Popery, Will-worship, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I cannot perswade my
self, 'tis worth the labour to wipe off such
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64701:125"/>
idle reproaches, by solemnly discoursing
these matters; both because this has
been so frequently and fully performed
already, and because, though these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
have been made use of to affright
silly People; yet few, if any of their
<hi>Ring-leaders</hi> are still so fond either to
own this Charge against us, or to plead
it in their own Justification. Only I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but observe of all these and the like
Pretences, that we need not any stronger
Arguments against themselves, than their
own Objections against us. For if in this
Case there be any <hi>Superstition,</hi> 'tis they
that are guilty of it: For this Vice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
not so much in the nature of things,
as in the apprehensions of men, when
their minds are possessed with weak and
unworthy conceits of God. Now he
that conforms to the received Customs
and Ceremonies of a Church, does it
not so much upon the account of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
value of the things themselves,
as out of a sense of the necessity of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and of the Duty of Obedience:
whereas he that scrupulously refuses to
Use and Practise them, takes a wrong
estimate of the Divine Wisdom and
Goodness, and imagines that God judges
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64701:126"/>
his Creatures by nice and pettish Laws,
and lays a greater stress upon a doubtful
or indifferent Ceremony, than upon the
great Duty of Obedience, and the peace
and tranquillity of the Church. So that
the Principles upon which we proceed,
are no other, than, That, as the Divine
Law has prescribed the <hi>Substantial Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of Religion; so it has left its Modes
and Circumstances undetermined: but
because every action must be done some
way or other, and be vested with some
Circumstances or other; and because
the generality of men are not so apt to
be abused with fantastick and ridiculous
conceits in any thing, as in matters of
Religion; therefore we think it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for the prevention of all the follies &amp;
indecencies, that ignorance and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
Zeal would introduce into the
Worship of God, That the Publick
Laws should determine some Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Order and Decency; which
have at least this <hi>Advantage,</hi> that they
provide against the mischiefs of Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Confusion: and therefore we
place no antecedent necessity in any of
the particular Rites and Ceremonies of
our Church, but only think it highly
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64701:126"/>
convenient, if not absolutely necessary,
that some be prescribed; that there is an
handsomness and beauty in these that are
prescribed: and therefore, because 'tis
necessary that some be determined, and
because these are, rather than divers
others, already settled, we think they
have an indispensable necessity superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
upon them, consequent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of Authority. No man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
That we cannot serve God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably
without a <hi>Surplice;</hi> but yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis but requisite that Publick
Worship should be performed with
beauty and solemnity; and because the
use of this <hi>Vestment</hi> is but handsom and
beautiful, and prevents slovenliness and
indecency, 'tis but agreeable that it
should be injoin'd, as any other decent
Habit might have been: and when this
is singled out by Authority, it then
becomes consequentially necessary:
Whereas those, who forbid things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
as sinful, and lay obligations
upon mens Consciences, to abstain from
what is innocent, and make that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
not to be done, which God has left
at liberty, and made lawful to be
done; usurp upon mens Consciences,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64701:127"/>
by imposing Fetters on them, where
God has left them free, and become
guilty of the most palpable piece of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
by teaching their own Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions
for Doctrines; and so making it a
necessary Duty, and part of Divine
Worship, to abstain from what God has
no where forbidden; and making it a
mortal and damnable Sin, to do what is
innocent; and supposing that God will,
or at least justly may, inflict eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon men, for making their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to him, rather in a cleanly White
Vestment, than in a Taylors Cloak, or
perhaps in Mechanical <hi>Querpo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. II.</hi> And then as for their out-cry
against <hi>Will-worship,</hi> 'tis the very same
with that against Superstition; for 'tis
one sort of it, and is criminal no farther
than 'tis superstitious. Now when they
exclaim against Superstition, they mean
only that part of it that consists in Will-worship,
and when against Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
'tis only as 'tis a Branch of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition:
So that these two impertinent
Clamours signifie but the same thing
under different Denominations, and so
amount but to one. But however this is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64701:127"/>
'tis certain, that <hi>Will-worship</hi> consists in
nothing else than in mens making their
own fancies and inventions necessary
parts of Religion, whereby they make
that requisite to procure the Divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
that God has no where requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and 'tis the same thing whether
this be done by Injunctions or Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
and they that affirm the doing or
not doing of an Action which God has
no where either commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to be necessary Duties, are equally
guilty of this Crime: And therefore if
these men make it necessary to forbear
what God has no where forbidden, they
teach their own fancies for Doctrines,
and impose something as a part of the
service of God, on their own, and other
mens Consciences, that the Law of God
has not imposed; and withal so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
mis-represent the Divine Wisdom
and Goodness, as to labour to make the
world believe, That God has such an
abhorrency to a thing so innocent as a
<hi>White Garment,</hi> That, to worship him
in it, is sufficient to bring us under his
everlasting Wrath and Displeasure; for
every thing that is sinful, is as well in
their, as our, esteem mortal &amp; damnable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:64701:128"/>
But then, as for our own parts, they
cannot be more apparently guilty of this
piece of folly, then we are clear and
innocent from its very suspicion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all Rituals, and Ceremonies, and
Postures, and manners of performing
the outward Expressions of Devotion,
are not in their own nature capable of
being parts of Religion; and therefore
unless we used and imposed them as
such, 'tis lamentably precarious to
charge the determination of them with
Will-worship; because that consists in
making those things Parts of Religion,
that God has not made so. So that
when the Church expresly declares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this use of them, and only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
them as meer Circumstances of
Religious Worship, 'tis apparent that it
cannot by imposing them, make any
additions to the Worship of God, but
only provides, That what God has requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
be performed in a decent and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. And then as for <hi>Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
Why should we suffer them so far to
invade ours, as to renounce those things
as criminal, which we believe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent?
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64701:128"/>
And if things indifferent when
injoin'd lose not only their liberty, but
their lawfulness; then why not when
forbidden, and that by an incompetent
Authority? when our Superiours im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Rules of Decency, and Law of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
they do not infringe our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Liberty; because they do not abolish
the indifferency of things themselves,
wherein alone it consisteth: and though
they become thereby necessary Duties,
'tis not from the nature and necessity of
the thing it self, but from the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Obedience, or some emergent
Reasons of Order and Decency: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
nothing can be more plain, than that
these men do not only abridge our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
but also lay insolent confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the Supreme Power, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
things indifferent so absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
that they will not allow the just
Commands of lawful Authority suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make them cease to be sinful.
How oft, and how plainly have they
been told, that, when Authority injoins
things left indifferent, and undetermined
by the Word of God, 'tis so far from
incroaching upon our Christian Liberty,
that it rather confirms it? In that this
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64701:129"/>
supposes that the things themselves may,
or may not be either done or enjoined,
according to the dictates of Prudence
and Discretion; but when they are once
determined by publick Laws, though
the matter of the Law be indifferent, yet
Obedience to it is not. Whereas when
they will not permit their Governours to
injoin these things, and if they do, will
not obey their injunctions, do they not
apparently intrench upon our Liberty,
by making what Christ has left indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
necessary; and, under pretences of
asserting their Christian Liberty, take
upon them to confine the rights of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
But to all this, as evident as it
is, nothing can make them attend; but
they still <hi>deafly</hi> proceed in their old Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:
which is too clear an Argument,
that 'tis not Reason that dictates their
Exceptions, but humour, prejudice, and
peevishness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. And then as for their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
against adding to the Law of
God, to be short, I appeal to the Reason
of all mankind, whether any men in the
World are more notoriously guilty of
unwarrantable Additions than these,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64701:129"/>
who forbid those things as sinful, and
consequently under pain of Damnation,
which the Law of God has no where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden?
What is it to teach the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of men for Doctrines, but
to teach those things to be the Law of
God that are not so? And, What can
more charge the Divine Law of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
than to teach that a man may
perform all that it has commanded, and
yet perish for not doing something, that
it has not commanded? And so do they,
who make it necessary not to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that God has left indifferent.
Whereas nothing can be more Unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than to tax the Church of making
Additions to the Law of God, because
all her Laws are imposed, not as Laws
of God, but as Laws of men, and so
are not more liable to this Charge than
<hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Institutes, and <hi>Littleton</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures.</p>
            <p>And then in the last place, as for their
noise against Popery, (a term, that, as
well as some other angry words, signifies
any thing that some men dislike) I shall
say no more, than, that we have most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to raise this out-cry, when they take
upon themselves (as well as the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64701:130"/>
at <hi>Rome)</hi> to controul the Laws of
the <hi>Secular Powers.</hi> And what do they,
but set up a Pope in every mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
whilst they vest it with a Power
of countermanding the <hi>Decrees of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</hi>
These things cannot but appear with
an undeniable evidence to any man, that
is not invincibly either ignorant, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or both: and therefore 'tis time they
should, at least for shame, if they will
not for Conscience, cease to disturb the
Church with Clamour, and Exceptions
so miserably impertinent, that I blush for
having thus far pursued them with a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Confutation. And therefore leaving
them and their impertinencies together,
(for I despair of ever seeing these old
and dear Acquaintances parted) I shall
now address my self to clear off one
more material and more plausible Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and so conclude this particular.
And 'tis this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. 'Tis possible, the Magistrate
may be deceived in his Determinations,
and establish a Worship that is in its
own nature sinful and superstitious; in
which case (if what I contend for be
true) all his Subjects must either be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64701:130"/>
or Idolaters: if they obey, they
sin against God; if they disobey, they sin
against their Sovereign. This is the
last Issue of all that is objected in this
Controversie, and the only Argument
that gives gloss and colour to all their
other <hi>trifling pretences:</hi> And yet 'tis no
more than what may be as fairly objected
against all Government of Moral and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Affairs; for there 'tis as possible,
that the Supreme Power may be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in its Judgment of good and evil;
and yet no man will deny the Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Princes, because they are fallible,
and may perhaps abuse it. And yet in this
alone lies all the strength of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against their Ecclesiastical Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because forsooth, 'tis possible they
may erre, and manage it to evil purposes.
But whatever force it carries in it, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strikes at the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> than
my Assertion, and charges that of being
defective in making sufficient Provisions
for the due Government of mankind, in
that it has not set over us infallible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Governours: For unless all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
be guided by an unerring Spirit,
'tis possible they may act against the ends
of their Institution; and if this be a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64701:131"/>
sufficient Objection against their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
it must of necessity overthrow the
Power of all fallible Judicatures, and
make Governours as incompetent Judges
in matters of Morality and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of right and wrong, as in Articles
of Faith and Religion. And therefore our
Enquiry is, to find out the best way of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the world, that the state of things is
capable of: If indeed mankind were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
this Controversie were at an
end; but seeing that all men are liable
to Errors and Mistakes, and seeing there
is an absolute necessity of a Supreme
Power in all Publick Affairs, our Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(I say) is, What is the most prudent,
and expedient way of setling them; not
that possibly might be, but that really is?
And this (as I have already sufficiently
proved) is, to devolve their management
on the Supreme Civil Power; which
though it may be imperfect and liable to
Errors and Mistakes, yet 'tis the least so,
and is a much better way to attain Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace and Tranquillity, than if they
were entirely left to the ignorance and
folly of every private man, which must
of necessity be pregnant with all manner
of Mischiefs and Confusions. So that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64701:131"/>
this method, I have assign'd, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
the best way of Government
of all Ecclesiastical, as well as Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
is not to be rejected, because 'tis lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to some inconveniences; but rather
to be embraced above all others, because
'tis liable to incomparably the fewest.
And if it so happen, that some private
persons suffer wrong from this method of
proceeding, yet this private injury has
an ample Compensation from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
benefit that arises from it; and
when it so falls out that either the whole
Society, or one individual must suffer,
'tis easie to determine, that better one
honest man perish, than a million. The
inconveniences of a bad Government are
inconsiderable, in comparison to Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
and Confusion; and the evils, that
fall upon particular men from its unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or irregular Administration, are vastly
too little to weigh against the necessity of
its institution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. And upon this Principle stands
the necessity of subjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to all Authority, in that, though its
ill management may happen to bring
many and great inconveniences upon the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64701:132"/>
Publick; yet they cannot equal the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
of that Confusion which must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
arise, if Subjects are warranted
to disobey, or resist Government, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they shall apprehend 'tis ill admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred.
Perhaps never any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was so good, as to be administred
with exact Justice and Equity, nor any
Governour so wise, as not to be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with faults and miscarriages; and
therefore if upon every quarrel every
wise or honest man can pick against the
Laws of the Common-wealth, he may
lawfully withdraw his obedience, What
can follow but a certain and unavoidable
dissolution of Government, when every
man will be commanded by nothing, but
his own Perswasions, that is himself?
And upon this account 'tis that the Law
of God has tied upon us such an absolute
and indispensable subjection to Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which though it may be mischievous,
yet 'tis less so than disobedience: and
the world must be govern'd, as it can be,
by Men, and not as it might be, by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
The management indeed of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affairs is generally bad enough, but
'tis as well as can probably be expected,
if we consider the weaknesses and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64701:132"/>
of humane Nature: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must bear it as well as we can:
because if we go about to alter any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Setlement, we must almost of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
make it worse: And all the effects
of such attempts have seldom ended in
any thing else but perpetual Confusions,
till things have at length resetled in the
same, or as bad, (if not a worse) condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than they were in before. The mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Tyranny are less, than those of
Anarchy; and therefore 'tis better to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the unreasonable Impositions of
<hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Caligula,</hi> than to hazard the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the State, and consequently
all the Calamities of War and Confusion,
by denying our subjection to Tyrants.
And there never was any lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
so bad, whose Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were not more conducive to the
preservation of the Common Good, than
his Oppression was to subvert it: and 'tis
wisely eligible to suffer a less Evil, rather
than lose a greater good. 'Tis a known,
and a wise saying of <hi>Tacitus; Bonos Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes
voto expetere debemus, qualescunque
pati; &amp; quomodo sterilitatem, aut nimios
imbres, &amp; caetera Naturae mala, sic luxum
&amp; avaritiam dominantium tolerare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:64701:133"/>
And this, in one word, is not only a
satisfactory Answer, but an ample Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of that Pestilent Book, <hi>(Vindiciae
contra Tyrannos)</hi> the scope whereof is,
only to invite Subjects to rebel against
Tyrannical Government, by representing
the evils of Tyranny: which though they
were as great, as he supposes them to be;
yet they are abundantly less than those
that follow upon Rebellion, as himself
and his Party were sufficiently taught by
the <hi>Event.</hi> And for one Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
he can instance in, that has gain'd
by Rebellion; 'tis easie to produce an
hundred that it has hazarded, if not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ruined. And therefore this Author
(not to mention <hi>Mariana,</hi> and <hi>Buchanan,</hi>
and others) has perform'd nothing in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of his Cause, by displaying the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of a <hi>Tyrannical Power,</hi> unless he
had withal evinced them to be more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous
than those of War and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
There is nothing in this World,
that depends upon the freedom of man's
will, can be so securely establish'd, as
not to be liable to sad inconveniences;
and therefore that Constitution of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
is most eligible, that is liable to
the fewest. And upon this score, I say,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64701:133"/>
it is that the Divine Law has so severely
injoin'd us to submit to the worst of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours;
because notwithstanding that
Tyranny is an oppressing burden of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life, yet 'tis less intolerable than a
state of War and Confusion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. But to speak more expresly to
the particular matter in debate, 'Tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
the world must be govern'd; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
it cannot be without Religion, &amp;
Religion, as harmless and peaceable as it
is in it self, yet when mixt with the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and Passions of men, it does not
usually inspire them with overmuch gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
and goodness of Nature; and
therefore 'tis necessary that it submit to
the same Authority, that commands over
all the other affections of the mind of
man. And we may as well suppose all
men just and honest, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
cancel all the Laws of Equity, as
suppose them wise and sober in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Conceits, and upon that score
take off all restraints from the excesses
and enormities of Zeal. 'Tis therefore
as necessary to the preservation of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace, that men should be govern'd
in matters of Religion, as in all other
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64701:134"/>
common Affairs of Humane life. And as
for all the inconveniences that may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from it, they are no other, than
what belong to all manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and such as are, and must be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
as long as mankind is endued
with liberty of Will; for so long he
cannot be intrusted with any Power, how
good soever, that he may not abuse. And
therefore for men to go about to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the <hi>Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction</hi> of the
Civil Magistrate, because he may abuse
it to evil and irreligious ends, by esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
Idolatry, instead of the true
Worship of God; (in which case 'tis
pity that good men should be exposed to
ruine, only for preserving a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science)
'Tis just as reasonable as if they
should cashier all manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and set men free from all Oaths
and Obligations of Allegiance; because
'tis possible some Usurper may gain the
Supreme Power, and then force his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to abjure all their former Oaths to
their lawful Sovereign; and 'tis pity that
men of the gallantest, and most honest
Principles, should be fined, decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
hanged, banish'd, and Murdered
only for their loyalty to their Prince.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64701:134"/>
And thus will the <hi>Parallel</hi> run equal in
all Cases between the Civil and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Authority of the Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
both may be, and often are lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
abused; and therefore if that be
reason enough to abolish one, 'tis so to
abolish both: so that the whole result of
all amounts only to this Enquiry, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it would not be a politick course to
take away all Government, because all
Government may be abused?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. Though this be a sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to the Objection, yet it will not be
altogether impertinent or unnecessary to
abet it with this one consideration more.
That it may, and often does so happen,
that 'tis necessary to punish men for such
Perswasions into which they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
innocently abused themselves: for
'tis easily possible for well-meaning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
through ignorance and inadvertency
to be betrayed into such unhappy
Errors, as may tend to the Publick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance,
which though it be not so
much their Crime as Infelicity, yet is
there no remedy but it must expose
them to the Correction of the Publick
Rods and Axes. Magistrates are to take
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64701:135"/>
care of the Common-wealth, and not of
every particular mans concerns: And
the end of all their Laws is to provide
for the welfare of the Publick, that is
their Charge, and that they must secure;
and if any harmless and well-meaning
man make himself obnoxious to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
of the Law, that is a misfortune
they cannot prevent, and therefore must
deal with him, as they do with all other
Offenders; that is, pity, and punish him.
Private interest must yield to Publick
Good, and therefore, when they cannot
stand together, and there is no remedy
but one must suffer, 'tis better certainly
that one, or a few, should perish than
the whole Community. Neither is it
possible that any Laws should be so wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
contrived, but that some innocent
Persons may sometimes fall under their
Penalties; yet, because 'tis more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the Publick Welfare, that now
and then a guiltless person should suffer,
than that all the guilty should escape;
in that the former injures but one, the
latter all: Therefore is it necessary to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
all Societies by Laws, and Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
without regard to the ill fortune
that may befal a few single persons, which
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64701:135"/>
can hardly be avoided whilst the Laws
are in force: and yet 'tis necessary that
either the same, or some other in their
stead be establish'd, that will be liable
to the same inconvenience. Besides, 'tis
not unworthy Observation, that it is not
so properly the end of Government to
punish Enormities, as to prevent Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances;
and when they bring Malefactors
to Justice (as we term it) they do not so
much inflict a Punishment upon the
Crime, (for that belongs peculiarly to
the cognizance of another Tribunal) as
provide for the welfare of the Common-wealth,
by cutting off such Persons as
are Pests and Enemies to it, and by the
example of their Punishment deter
others from the like Practices. And
therefore there are some sins, of which
Governours take not so much notice, that
are more hainous in themselves, and in
the sight of God, than others that they
punish with <hi>Capital Inflictions;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not in their own nature so
destructive of the ends of Government,
and the good of <hi>Publick Societies.</hi> So
that actions being punishable by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws, not according to the nature
of the Crime, but of their ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64701:136"/>
to the Publick, when any thing
that is otherwise even innocent, is in
this regard injurious, it as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
Authority to give it check by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Laws and Punishments, as any
the foulest Immoralities. Temporal
Punishments then are inflicted upon such
persons that are turbulent against pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
Rules of Publick Worship, upon
the same account, as they are against
those that offend against all other Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Edicts of Government: they are
both equally intended, to secure the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace and Interest of the Society;
and when either of them are violated,
they equally tend to its disturbance: and
therefore as mens actings against the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Laws of a Common-wealth are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the Judgment of its Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
for the same reason are all their
Offences against its Ecclesiastical Laws
liable to the censure of the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
So that the matter debated, in its
last result, is not so much a question of
Religion, as of Policy; not so much of
what is necessary to faith, as to the quiet
and preservation of a Common-wealth;
and 'tis possible a man may be a good
Christian, and yet his Opinion be into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64701:136"/>
upon the score of its being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the Preservation of the
Publick Peace, and the necessary ends
of Government. For 'tis easily imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
how an honest and well-meaning man
may, through meer ignorance, fall into
such Errours, which though God will
pardon, yet Governours must punish:
His integrity may expiate the Crime,
but cannot prevent the Mischief of his
Errour. Nay so easie is it for men to
deserve to be punished for their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that there is no Nation in the
world, in which (were Government
rightly understood and duly managed)
mistakes and abuses of Religion would
not supply the <hi>Gallies</hi> with vastly greater
numbers than Villany.</p>

asham'd of the silliness of the

People, think to shelter themselves, by
flying to the pretence of Scandal. Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
is any thing that occasions the sin
of another, and is not in it self deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately
Good or Evil. All Scandal is
equally taken, but not equally Criminal.
Men are to govern themselves, in this
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64701:137"/>
Affair, by their own prudence and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
Of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s contrary beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
towards the Iews, and Gentiles,
to avoid their contrary Scandal. The
reason of the seeming Contradiction, in
this point, between his Epistles to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Galatians.</hi> The proper
obligations of Scandal are extended only
to indifferent things. The Cases, in
which it is concern'd, are not capable of
being determined by setled Laws and
Constitutions. How scandalously these
men prevaricate with the World in
their pretence of Scandal, that may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
their refusal of Conformity, but
gives no account of their Separation.
Of their scrupling to renounce the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
this is no reason to drive them
from Divine Service into Conventicles.
How shamefully these men juggle with
the World, and impose upon their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.
If they would but perswade
their Proselytes to be of their own minds,
it would end all our differences. They
first lead the people into the Scandal,
and then make this the formal reason
why they must follow them. If the
peoples scruples are groundless, then to
comply with them, is to keep them in a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64701:138"/>
sinful disobedience. A further account
of their shameful prevarication. The
ridiculousness of the peoples pretending
it concerning themselves, that they are
scandalized. By their avoiding private
Offences, they run into publick Scandals.
They scandalize their own weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
most of all, by complying with
them. Old and inveterate Scandals are
not to be complyed with, but opposed:
and such are those of the Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.
The Commands of Authority
and the Obligations of Obedience infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely

all the pretences of Scandal.</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.<seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the former
Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> that
no man may with a

any thing in the
Worship of God,
that is not warranted by some Precept or
Precedent in the Word of God, be rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the peoples minds, as the first and
fundamental Principle of the <hi>Puritan Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;</hi>
yet their Leaders seem to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of their own folly: and being
driven from this, and all their other little
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64701:138"/>
holds and shelters, they have at length
thought it the safest and the wisest course
to flie to the pretence of Scandal. This is
their <hi>Fort Royal,</hi> in which they have at last
secured and entrench'd themselves. As
for their own parts (they tell us) they are
not so fond as to believe, That the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are so
superstitious, and Antichristian, and that
themselves might lawfully use them, were
it not that there are great numbers of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
but weak Christians that apprehend
them to be sinful; and for this reason they
dare not conform to our Ceremonial
Constitutions, for fear of ensnaring and
scandalizing weak Consciences; which is,
in the Apostles account of it, no less than
<hi>spiritual murther.</hi> And whatever is due to
Authority, the Souls of men are too
high a Tribute. None can be more ready,
than themselves, to submit to all lawful
Commands; but here they desire to be
excused, when they cannot obey but at
the price of Souls. 'Tis a dreadful
Doom, that our Saviour has denounced
against those, who offend any of his <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ones, i. e.</hi> Babes and Weaklings in
Christianity: And therefore, though
they would not stick to hazard their own
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64701:139"/>
lives in obedience to Authority, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can oblige them to be so cruel, and
so uncharitable, as to destroy any for
whom Christ died; which is certainly
done by casting snares and scandals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their weak Brethren. This is the
last refuge of the Leaders of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore I cannot but think
my self obliged to examine its strength
and reasonableness; and I doubt not, but
to make it appear as vain and frivolous,
as all their other Cavils, and shuffling
Pretences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Scandal then is a word of a
large and ambiguous signification, and
the thing it imports is not determinately
either good or evil, but is sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and sometimes criminal, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the different nature of those things
from whence it arises, or of those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
wherewith it is attended;
for in the full and proper extent of the
word, 'tis any thing (whether good, or
evil, or indifferent) that occasions the
fall or sin of another. Now if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Scandal, or that which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
anothers sin, be in it self good and
vertuous, this casual event is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64701:139"/>
to reflect any charge or disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon it; and therefore 'tis in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
frequently attributed to the best of
things, to the Cross of Christ, to Christ
himself, and to the Grace of God. If it
be a thing in it self criminal, though it
be chiefly blameable upon its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
yet this usually aggravates and
enhances the original guilt of the action.
But lastly, if it be a thing indifferent, and
a matter of Christian liberty, then is it
either faultless, or chargeable, according
to its different Cases and Circumstances,
as Christian prudence and discretion
shall determine, so various and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
a thing not being capable to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by any fix'd and setled measures.
Some are scandalized out of weakness,
and some out of peevishness; some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
due information of their mistake,
and some after it; some because they do
not, and some because they will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.
All which, with infinite other
Circumstances, men ought to consider
in the exercise of their Christian liberty,
and suitably to guide themselves by the
same Rules of Wisdom and Charity,
that determine them in all the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of humane life. For the action it
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64701:140"/>
self is only the remote occasion, and not
the immediate cause of the scandal; in
that, being in its own nature indifferent,
and by consequence innocent, it cannot
be directly and from it self productive of
any criminal effect: and therefore, its
being abused and perverted to purposes
and opportunities of sin, is purely acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental.
And the proper and immediate
cause of every mans falling, is something
within himself: 'Tis either folly, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
or ignorance, or wilfulness, too
little understanding, or too much passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that betray some men into sin by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of other mens actions. So that the
Schools distinction of scandal into <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi>
or that which is taken, and <hi>active</hi>
or that which is given, is apparently false
and impertinent, and is the main thing
that has perplexed and intricated all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of this Article: Because Scandal,
properly so called, is never given, but
when it is taken; as being only an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of offence taken by one manfrom the
actions of another. Now if his taking
offence, where it was not given, proceeds
from weakness and ignorance, then is
his case pitiable, and a good-natur'd man
will out of tenderness and charity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64701:140"/>
such things, as he seizes on to abuse
to his own destruction: For all the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of Scandal proceed purely from
that extraordinary height of Charity and
tenderness of good Nature, that is so
signally recommended in the Gospel;
which will oblige us to forbear any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that we may lawfully omit, when we
know it will prove an occasion of sin
and mischief to some well-meaning, but
less knowing Christians. But if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from humour, or pride, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
or any other vicious Principle,
then is the man to be treated as a peevish
and stubborn person; and no man is
bound to part with his own freedom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Neighbour is froward and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous:
and if he be resolved to fall,
there is no reason I should forego the use
of my liberty, because he is resolved to
make that his stumbling-block. So that
we see all Scandal is equally taken, but
not equally criminal: in that, some take
it only because they are weak, and some
because they are peevish; according to
which different cases we are to behave
our selves, with a different demeanour in
this affair.</p>

               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:64701:141"/>
§ 3. And for this we have variety of
Examples in the practice of the Apostles,
whose actions were liable to the opposite
Scandals of Jews and Gentiles. If they
complyed with the Jews in their rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Observation of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Rites,
this was a Scandal to the Gentiles, by
leading them into a false and mischievous
opinion of their necessity: If they did
not comply, then that proved a Scandal
to those <hi>Iews,</hi> that were not as yet fully
instructed in the right nature, and extent
of their Christian liberty, and the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law; and so would
be tempted to fall back from that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that inclin'd men to a scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two extremes they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to walk with great prudence and
wariness, inclining sometimes to one,
and sometimes to the other; as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
most beneficial to the ends &amp;
Interests of Christianity. Thus though
St. <hi>Paul</hi> condescended to the Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Timothy,</hi> to humour and gratifie
the Jews, who could not be so suddenly
wrought off from the prejudices, and
strong impressions of their Education,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64701:141"/>
and therefore were for a time indulged
to the practice of their ancient Rites and
Customs; Yet, when he was among the
Gentiles, he would not be perswaded to
yield so far to the Jewish obstinacy, as to
suffer the Circumcision of <hi>Titus,</hi> but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it with his utmost zeal and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence;
because this would in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
have frustrated the success of all his
labour in propagating the Gospel among
forein Nations; if he who had before so
vehemently asserted their Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and instructed them in their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
from this Ceremony, should now
seem inconsistent with himself, by acting
directly contrary to his former Doctrine,
and bringing men into a subjection to the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> after himself had so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
declared its being revers'd and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated.
For what else could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
expected, than that his <hi>Gentile
Proselytes</hi> being discouraged, partly by
his prevarication, and partly by the
weight of that <hi>Noke,</hi> to which they
foresaw, or at least suspected, they must
submit, should be strongly tempted to
an utter <hi>Apostacy?</hi> And therefore, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weighing with himself, that the scandal
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64701:142"/>
was less dangerous in angring the Jews,
than in hazarding the Gentiles, he chose
rather to leave them to their own pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness,
than to hazard the revolt of
these, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>§ 4. And this is the true reason (as
some learned men have observed) of this
great Apostles different deportment, in
this particular, towards the Churches of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Galatia;</hi> because in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church there lived no small number of
natural Jews, who, when they were first
converted to Christianity, were not so
well instructed in the abrogation of the
<hi>Mosaick</hi> Law. The Method, whereby the
Apostles invited them at first to embrace
the Christian Faith, was barely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of its Evidence and Divine
Authority; without taking any notice,
whether their old Religion were thereby
abrogated, or continued: For had they
at the first attempt dealt roundly with
them in that particular, that had been so
far from winning their assent, that it had
been absolutely the most effectual way to
affright them from the Gospel. And
from hence it came to pass, that there
were dispersed among them so many Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64701:142"/>
Christians, who, though they
were sufficiently instructed in the positive
Articles of the Christian Faith; yet not
being so throughly informed as to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuating
of those legal observances,
they were as firmly wedded to them, as
if they had still continued in the Jewish
Religion: Therefore does the Apostle
advise, That these weak and uninstructed
Converts should be tenderly treated; and
exhorts the more knowing Christians, for
a while, to comply with their weakness
and simplicity; till time, and better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
should wear off their old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
and at length bring them to a
better understanding of their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>But then, as for the <hi>Galatians,</hi> when
they hapned to fall into the same error,
he thought not fit to treat them with the
same tenderness and Civility: But rather
chides and lashes them out of their
childish folly; because (as St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
observes) at their first Conversion
they had been competently instructed in
the extent of their Christian liberty, and
had already disclaimed all their Jewish
perswasions; and therefore, for them to
relapse into the Errours of <hi>Iudaism,</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:64701:143"/>
could not proceed from weakness, and
want of instruction, but from lightness
and giddiness of mind: a vanity that
deserved to be upbraided with as much
briskness and vehemence of Satyr, as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> has us'd in that Epistle. And upon
this account arose the Quarrel between
him and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had
not carried himself so prudently in the
use of his Christian liberty, as he might
have done; their Controversie was not
about an Article of Faith, or a prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
Duty of Religion, but purely about
an occasional and changeable matter of
prudence. But to pass by this, and divers
other particular cases, to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in the Writings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whose
practice in this affair is the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon his Doctrine: the result of
what I have discoursed from him evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
amounts to these two consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
(1.) That the proper obligations
of Scandal are extended only to matters
of an indifferent and arbitrary Nature.
Those things that are absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
we are bound to do, whether they
offend any man or no; and those that are
absolutely unlawful, we are bound to
forbear, upon the score of stronger obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64701:143"/>
than those of Scandal: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its proper Scene must lie in things
that are not determinately good or evil.
(2.) That the cases, in which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
are not capable of being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
by any unalterable Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions;
and that we have no other
Rules for the Government of our actions
in reference to it, but those of common
prudence and discretion. And now, from
this more general account may we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
with more clearness and security,
to some more close and particular consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
that immediately relate to
this affair, as 'tis pleaded by some men
in justification of their present Schism.</p>
            <p>§ 5. First, And here in the first place
let me desire them, to consider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
&amp; scandalously they prevaricate
with the World, in their management
of this Apology, in that the Pretence is
too narrow a Covering for their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.
For however it may serve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
their refusal of Conformity in the
Exercise of their Publick and Ministerial
Function, which they must renounce,
though to the ruine of their Families, to
please the Brethren; yet how will this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64701:144"/>
account for all the other disorders and
irregularities of their separations? What
has this to do with their private Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Conventicles, against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of publick Authority? They
plead it only to justifie themselves in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down their Ministry, and not to keep
them from being present at our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in a private capacity: (as they
sometimes are.) Why therefore should
they keep up such an apparent Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by gathering people into distinct
Meetings of their own, when they might
without any criminal Scandal to their
Brethren, or violence to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
be constant at our Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
When themselves were (or at least
thought they were) in power, they did
not think so slightly of unnecessary Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
but provided against their very
appearances and possibilities: Why
therefore should they now make so light
of exposing the Church to all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
that naturally follow, upon
making Parties and Divisions? If there
were nothing but Scandal in the case,
they would live quietly and conformably
in a private condition, though this might
possibly restrain them from doing so in a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64701:144"/>
publick Office. And one would think
that such nice and tender-natur'd peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that will undo themselves to please
their Neighbours, should be wonderfully
tender of giving needless offence to their
Governours.</p>
            <p>And, whatever other pretences they
make to excuse their Non-conformity,
nothing can justifie their Separation, but
the unlawfulness of being present at our
Congregations. For what, if they scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to renounce the Covenant; is this
any reason, why they should gather peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into Conventicles, keep their private
Meetings in time of publick Service, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
the Laws and Constitutions of the
Common-wealth, and encourage their
Followers in a down-right Schism and
Separation? It would be a pretty way of
arguing, to hear one of them plead: I
cannot renounce the Covenant, therefore
I must keep a Conventicle; and yet this
is their method of acting. And therefore
they can never clear themselves of some
odd suspicions, unless they would frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and openly declare their opinion of
our <hi>Service:</hi> If they think it unlawful,
then let them own, and profess, and plead
it; if lawful, then let them justifie
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64701:145"/>
themselves, in that, when lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
requires them, and the people, to
keep up a just and lawful Communion
with the Church, yet they should not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
keep up so wide a Schism,
by gathering people out of publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
into private Meetings. And
could their credulous Disciples be but
made sensible, how coarsly they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon by their Leaders, and how
lamentably they juggle and dissemble
with the World, they would then more
abhor them for their <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> than
they now admire them for their Saint-like
and demure pretences. For if they
would perswade them to do what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would not scruple in their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
<hi>(i. e.</hi> to be of their own
mind) this Schism would quickly be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Church setled. The only
reason (say most of them) why they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
their Ministry was, That they durst
not abjure the Covenant; dispense with
them for this, and they are Conformists.
But if that be the only thing they scruple,
then, Why are they not regular and
conformable in all other Particulars,
against which they can pretend no such
Exceptions? And what does renouncing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64701:145"/>
the Covenant concern the people? And
therefore how shall that excuse, or justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
them in their Separation? This thing
has no relation to the Divine Service, and
therefore, however it may restrain men
from something else, 'tis no motive to
drive them from that. Now what can be
more apparent, than that these men are
resolved to comply with, and encourage,
the people in a wicked and rebellious
Schism (for so it must be, if it be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and unwarrantable) by herding them
into Conventicles for their own private
ends, and that in spight of Authority?
Whereas had they any true sense of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and ingenuity, they would labor
to dispossess the people of their mistakes,
and to reconcile them to a fair and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
opinion of the Church, when she
requires nothing of them, but what they
themselves are convinced in Conscience,
is lawful and innocent. For, if they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
the Peace of the Church, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Authority, and the setlement
of the Nation before their own selfish
ends, instead of keeping up Divisions (as
'tis evident they do by their Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles)
they would be as zealous, as he
that is most so, to remove the grounds
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64701:146"/>
of Schism and Faction, and to reunite
their Party to the Church, by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to an orderly and peaceable
Conformity. Which if it be innocent
(as themselves believe it is) it must, in the
present Circumstances of Affairs, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
if it be any mans Duty to be
peaceable in the Church, and obedient
to lawful Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. Secondly, How came the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be scandalized? by whom were
they betrayed, and affrighted into their
mistakes? Who buzzed their scruples,
and jealousies into their heads? And,
Who taught them to call our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
Popish, Superstitious, and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?
What other inducement have they
to dislike the Churches Constitutions,
but meerly the example of their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
Their practice is the only Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the peoples opinion; and when
their flocks straggle from <hi>our</hi> Churches,
'tis only to follow <hi>their</hi> Pastors: They
first lead the people into an Errour, and
then this must be an Apology for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to follow them. And thus, whilst
they dance in a Circle, 'tis no wonder, if
at the same time, their Preachers follow
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64701:146"/>
their people, and the people follow their
Preachers. And therefore if the <hi>Godly
Ministers,</hi> who dare not conform for
fear of scandalizing the weak Brethren,
would but venture to do it, the weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
would cease to be scandalized. So
that these men first lay the stumbling-block
in the peoples way, and then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it scares silly and timorous Souls,
this serves for a pretence to startle, &amp; be
astonish'd at it themselves, and withal to
increase the childish fears of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
by their own seeming &amp; counterfeit
horror. Now with what a shameless Brow
do these men prevaricate with publick
Authority? They have deceived the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into a publick Errour, and then will
not undeceive them for fear of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure:
And when they have possess'd
their minds with unworthy scruples, and
jealousies against the commands of their
Superiors, then must this weakness of
the people be made the <hi>Formal Excuse</hi>
of their own disobedience. And by this
Artifice they prostitute the Reverence of
all Government to the fortuitous humor
and peevishness of their own Disciples;
and so by making the publick Laws sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64701:147"/>
to the pleasure of those whom they
govern, they put it in their own power
to enact, or repeal them as they please;
and no Law shall have any force to bind
the Subject without their approbation:
Because 'tis in their own power, when
they please, to work prejudices, in the
people against it; and therefore, if their
being offended be sufficient to take off
their obligation, 'tis, or 'tis not a Law,
only as themselves shall think good. And
thus they first govern the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
&amp; then sooth and flatter their pride,
by inveigling them into a conceit, that
they are govern'd by them, and by this
stratagem they govern all.</p>
            <p>But however, from whomsoever these
good people learn'd their idle &amp; imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
scruples, the offence they have taken
against the Customs and Prescriptions
of the Church, is either just and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
or it is not: If the former, then they
have rational grounds for their dislike &amp;
separation; and if they have, then these
men that think themselves bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with them, even against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Authority, ought to plead
those Reasons, and not meerly Scandal,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64701:147"/>
to justifie their disobedience; because
they must carry in them an obligation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
to that of Scandal; in that they
are supposed sufficient to warrant and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize
it; and therefore 'tis not that, but
the grounds, on which their dislike is
founded, that are to be pleaded in their
defence and justification. But if the latter,
then is their dislike groundless, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable:
And if so, 'tis easie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
that they ought rather to undeceive
them, by discovering their mistake, than
to encourage them in their sinful disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
(for so it must be, if it be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less)
by compliance with them. And by
this means they will fairly discharge
themselves from all danger of any crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
offence. For however scandal ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
taken (and so it is always, because
there is never any reason to be offended
at an indifferent thing) may possibly lay
a restraint upon my liberty, till I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the person of his Error, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed
those ill consequences he would
draw from my example; and when I
have so done, I have prevented the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Scandal, which always supposes
errour, weakness, or mistake of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64701:148"/>
and therefore when the Errour is
discovered, and the weakness removed,
so is the scandal too: And if he shall still
pretend to be scandalized, 'tis not because
he is weak, but peevish; and if after
this I comply with them, and that against
the commands of my lawful Superiors, I
shall disobey Authority, only, because
my Neighbour is unreasonable, <hi>i. e.</hi> for
no reason at all. And this further disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
how shamelesly these men shuffle
and prevaricate with the world; in that
when most of them have declared, in
their private Discourses, that they are
not so fond as to imagine our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
unlawful, or <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and
when their Grandees and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
have profess'd to publick Authority
in <hi>Solemn Conferences,</hi> that they scruple
not these things upon their own account,
but only for fear of giving offence to
some well-meaning people that were
unhappily possess'd with some odd and
groundless jealousies against them. For
if so, Then why are not these good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that follow them, better informed?
Why do they not instruct them in the
truth, and disabuse them out of their
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64701:148"/>
false and absurd conceits? Why do
they connive at their pride and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption?
Or at least, Why do they not
more smartly reprove them, for their
rashness to censure the actions of their
Neighbours, to condemn, and revile the
Wisdom of their Superiors, and to
scorn the Knowledge of their Spiritual
Instructors? Why do they not chide
them out of their malepart, peevish, and
impatient confidence, and, by convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them at least of the possibility of
their being deceived, reduce them to a
more humble and governable temper?
Why do they not teach them in plain
terms that the establish'd way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is lawful, and innocent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they ought not to forsake it, to
the disturbance of the Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Authority? If they would but
make it part of their business to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the people, how easily would all
their stragling Followers return into the
Communion of the Church? But they
dare not let them know their Errours,
lest they should forfeit both their Party,
and their Reputation: And therefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of that, they rather confirm them in
their mistakes, and in their own defence,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64701:149"/>
are forced to perswade them, that they
ought to be scandalized. Insomuch, that
it is not unusual to hear the foolish people
pretend it concerning themselves, and to
tell you that your action is a Scandal to
them: By which they mean, either that it
leads them into sin, or that it makes them
angry. If the former, that is a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
contradiction; for if they know how
the snare and temptation is laid, then
they know how to escape it; my action
does not force them into the sin, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
invites them to it, through their own
mistake and folly: And therefore if they
have discovered, by what mistake they
are likely to be betray'd, they know how
to provide against the danger: For, if
they know their duty in the case, how can
they plead Scandal, when that supposes
ignorance? And however I behave my
self, they know what they have to do
themselves: If they do not, How can
they say of themselves, that they are
scandalized; when by so saying they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
they are not? For that implies a
knowledge how to do their duty, and
avoid the danger. If the latter, <hi>i. e.</hi> that
they are angry, then all their meaning is,
that I must part with my liberty, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64701:149"/>
disobey my Superiors to please them;
that their saucy humour must give me
Law; that I must be their Slave, because
they are proud, and insolent; and that
they must gain a power over me, because
they are forward to censure mine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Thirdly, We encounter Scandal
with Scandal, and let the guilt of all be
discharged upon that side that occasions
the most and the greatest offences: Now
all the mischief they can pretend to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
in the present constitution of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
upon their compliance with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
reaches no farther than the weak
Brethren of their own Party; whereas
by their refractory disobedience they
give offence not only to them, but to all,
both to the Jew, and to the Gentile, and
to the Church of God. And, not to insist
upon the advantages they give to Atheism
and Popery, let me only mind them, that
if the accidental offence of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of some well-meaning, but less
knowing Christians, of a private capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
pass a sufficient obligation upon
Conscience, to restrain it from any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in it self lawful; of how much more
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64701:150"/>
force must that scandal be, that is given
to publick Authority, by denying obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to its lawful commands, and by
consequence infringing its just power in
things not forbidden by any divine Law?
Now if the Rites and Ceremonies of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> were in themselves
apparently evil, then their repugnancy
to the Law of God were sufficient Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
both against their practice, and
their imposition; and their scandal to
weak and ignorant Christians were of
small force, in comparison to their intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
and unalterable unlawfulness: But,
because this is not pretended in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case, What a shameful scandal and
reproach to Religion is it, to neglect the
necessary duty of Obedience, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to lawful Authority, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of complyance with the weak and
groundless scruples of some private
men? 'Tis certainly past dispute, that
the reasonable offence of some weaker
Brethren cannot so strongly oblige our
Consciences, as the indispensable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of obeying our lawful Superiors.
And it is a shame to demand, Whether
the Judgment of a lawful Magistrate
have not more force and power over
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64701:150"/>
Conscience, than the Judgment of every
private Christian: If not, then may the
Laws of Authority be cancell'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd
by the folly and ignorance of
those that are subject to them; for meer
scandal arises only from the folly and
ignorance of the persons offended. For
if there be any just and wise occasion of
dislike, the action becomes primarily
unlawful, not because 'tis scandalous, but
because 'tis antecedently evil; whereas
meer and proper scandal is only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in things in themselves indifferent:
So that in this case all the difficulty is,
Whether is the greater scandal, to do an
indifferent thing, when a private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
dislikes it; or not to do it, when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority enjoyns it? And certainly
it can be no Controversie, Whether it
be a fouler reproach to Religion, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
a Christian Magistrate in a thing
lawful and indifferent, than to offend a
private Christian. And I may safely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the Judgment of all wise and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
men, Whether the intolerable way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
of some nice and squeamish
Consciences to the commands of just
Authority, be not a fouler and more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
scandal to Religion, than a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64701:151"/>
and humble compliance with them,
though in things not so apparently useful
and necessary?</p>
            <p>And then, as for their own weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
of whom they seem so exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tender, they can no way more scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
them, than by complying with them:
By which they are tempted and betray'd
into the greatest and most mischievous
enormities; for thereby they encourage
their folly, feed and cherish their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
fancies, confirm them in a
false opinion of the unlawfulness of their
Superiors commands, and so lead them
directly into the sins of unwarrantable
Schism and Disobedience. How many
feeble and deluded Souls are enticed,
by the reputation of their example,
to violate the commands of Authority,
and that, when themselves are not
convinced of their unlawfulness, and so
entangle themselves in a complicated sin,
by disobeying their lawful Superiors,
and that with a doubtful and unsatisfied
Conscience? They cannot be ignorant,
that the greatest part of their zealous
Disciples are offended at the Laws and
Constitutions of the Church, for no
other reason, than because they see their
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64701:151"/>
godly Ministers to slight them; and
therefore, unless their example be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to rescind the lawful Commands
of their Governors, they give them the
most criminal Scandal, by inviting them
to the most criminal disobedience. So
that all circumstances fairly considered,
the avoiding of offences will prove the
most effectual inducement to Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
For this would take away the very
Grounds and Foundations of Scandal,
remove all our differences, prevent
much trouble and more sin, cure all our
Schisms, Quarrels, and Divisions, banish
our mutual Jealousies, Censures, and
Animosities, and establish the Nation in
a firm and lasting Peace. In brief, the
only cause of all our troubles and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances,
is, the inflexible perversness
of about an hundred proud, ignorant,
and seditious Preachers; against whom,
if the severity of the Laws were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
levelled, How easie would it be in
some competent time to reduce the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to a quiet and peaceable temper, and
to make all our present Schisms (that
may otherwise prove eternal) expire
with, or before, the present Age? The
want, or neglect, of which method, is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64701:152"/>
the only thing, that has given them so
much strength, &amp; so long a continuance.</p>
            <p>§ 8. Fourthly, No man is bound to
take notice of, or give place to old and
inveterate scandals, but rather ought, in
defence of his Christian liberty, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them with a publick defiance, and
to shame those that pretend them out of
their confidence. For the only ground
of compliance and condescension in
these Cases, is tenderness and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to some mens infirmities; and as long
as I have reason to think this the only
cause of their being scandalized, so long
am I bound by charity and good nature
to condescend to their weaknesses, and
no longer: For after they have had a
competent time and means of better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
I have reason enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
that 'tis not ignorance, that is the
gound of their taking offence, but pride
or peevishness, or something worse. So
that all that is to be done in this case, is
to disabuse the weak by rectifying his
judgment, removing his scruples, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the innocence of my action, clearing
it of all sinister suspicions, and protesting
against all those abuses, he would put
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64701:152"/>
upon the lawful use of my Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
And when I have so done, I have
cleared my self from all his ill-natured
jealousies and surmises, and discharged
all the offices and obligations of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And if, after all this, my offended
Neighbor shall still persevere in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
mis-interpretation of my actions,
and pretend, that they still gaul and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare
his tender Conscience; the man is
peevish and refractory, and only makes
use of this precarious pretence, to justifie
his uncharitable censures of my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
liberty; and then am I so far from
being under any obligation to comply
with the peevishness and insolence of his
humour, that I am strongly bound to
thwart and oppose it. For otherwise I
should but betray my Christian liberty
to the Tyranny of his wilful and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ignorance, and give superstitious
folly the advantage and Authority of
Prescription. For if that prevail in the
practice of the World, and I must yield
and condescend to it, because 'tis stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
and obstinate, it must, in process
of time, gain the reputation of being
the custom and received opinion of the
<hi>Church;</hi> and when it can plead that,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64701:153"/>
then it becomes necessary: Inveterate
Errours are ever sacred and venerable,
and what prescription warrants, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
imposes: Custom ever did, and
ever will rule and preside in the practices
of men, because 'tis popular; and being
ever attended with a numerous train of
Followers, it grows proud and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and is not ashamed to upbraid free
reason with singularity and Innovation.
So that all I could gain, by an absolute
resignation of my own liberty to another
mans folly, would be only to give him
a plausible pretence to claim a right of
command and dominion over me, and
to make my self subject to his humour
by my own civility. And thus, though
the Jews were in the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
for a time permitted the Rites
and Customs of their Nation; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
when the Nature of the Christian
Religion was, or might be, better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
the Church did not think it owed
them so much civility: And if the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians had not given check to
their stubborn perswasions, they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them Authority; and, by too long a
compliance, would have vouched and
abetted their Errours, and adopted Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64701:153"/>
into Christianity; and Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
not only might, but of necessity must
have been conveyed down to us from
age to age, by as firm and uninterrupted
a Tradition as Baptism.</p>
            <p>And this shews us, how way-ward
and unreasonable those men are, who
still persevere to object Scandal against
the Churches Constitutions, after she has
so often protested against this Exception
by so many solemn Declarations. When
at first it was pretended, it might perhaps
for a while excuse, or alleviate their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience;
but after Authority has so
sufficiently satisfied their scruples, and
removed their suspicions, and so amply
cleared the innocence of its own intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if men will still continue jealous
and quarrelsom, they may thank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
if they smart for their own presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and folly. And Princes have no
reason to abridge themselves in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their lawful Power, only, because
some of their Subjects will not learn to
be modest and ingenuous. And if his
Majesty should think good to condescend
so far to these mens peevishness, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
his Laws against them out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with them, this would but feed
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64701:154"/>
and cherish their insolence, and only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them to proceed (if that be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
to more unreasonable demands;
for upon the same reason they insist upon
these, they may, when they are granted
them, go on to make new remonstrances,
<hi>i. e.</hi> upon no reason at all. And beside,
this would but give the countenance of
Authority to their scruples and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
pretences, and leave the Church
of <hi>England</hi> under all those Calumnies
to Posterity, with which themselves or
their followers labour to charge it, and
oblige future Ages to admire and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
these peevish and seditious persons
as the <hi>Founders</hi> of a more godly and
thorow Reformation. Not to mention
how much Princes have ever gain'd by
their concessions to the demands of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick
Zealots, they may easily embolden,
but hardly satisfie them; and if they yield
up but one Jewel of their Imperial Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
to their importunity, 'tis not usual
for them to rest, till they have gain'd
Crown and all, and perhaps the head that
wears it too; for there is no end of the
madness of unreasonable men. How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
would the world be, if wise men were
but wise enough to be instructed by the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64701:154"/>
Mistress of Fools? But every Age lives
as much at all adventure as if it were the
first, without any regard to the warnings
and experiences of all former Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. Fifthly, The Commands of
Authority, and the Obligations of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
infinitely outweigh, and utterly
evacuate all the pretences of scandal. For
the matters wherein scandal is concern'd
are only things indifferent; but nothing
that is not antecedently sinful remains so,
after the commands of lawful Authority
are superinduced upon it; these change
things indifferent, <hi>as to their Nature,</hi> into
necessary Duties, <hi>as to their Vse;</hi> and
therefore place them beyond the reach
of the obligations of scandal, that may in
many cases extend to the restraint of our
Liberty, but never to the prejudice and
hinderance of our Duty; so that no Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
how offensive soever, unless it be
upon some other account faulty, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being made Criminal upon the
score of scandal; the obligations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are but accidental and occasional,
whereas those of Obedience are of a
prime, absolute, and eternal necessity.
Princes are Gods Deputies, and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64701:155"/>
here on earth, he vests them with
their power, and by his own Law binds
us to obey theirs; and though their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
pass no <hi>direct Obligation</hi> upon the
Consciences of men, yet the Divine
laws directly and immediately bind their
Consciences to obey them; and God has
annex'd the same Penalties to Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their Laws, as to his own: So that
obedience to all the lawful Commands
of our Superiours is one part of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God, because our obligation to
it is tied upon us by his own immediate
Command: aud therefore if the duty
of avoiding scandal, that is of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with my neighbours weakness,
be sufficient to excuse that of Obedience
to Authority, 'tis so too to take off the
immediate Obligations of God himself:
So that when these two, the publick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of a lawful Superiour, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Offence of an honest Neighbour
countermand each other, if the latter
prevail, then may it forbid what God has
made a necessary Duty, and oblige us to
disobey him out of Compliance with
the folly and ignorance of men. How
few are there of the Divine Laws more
severe and peremptory, than those that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64701:155"/>
command Obedience to Authority? And
therefore if we may decline this duty on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to avoid scandal, Why not any? Why
not all? This then is our Duty, and must
be done; and as for all its casual and
equivocal events, no mans Conscience is
concern'd to provide against them. And
if other men will be offended because I
do my Duty, that is their fault and not
mine; and better be the occasion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans sin, than the Author of mine
own. No mans folly or ignorance can
cancel my obligations to God, or God's
Vicegerent; and in all cases where there
is any competition between scandal and
a Command of God, or any other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Authority, there is no other difficulty
to be resolved, than, whether I shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
God, or displease my foolish Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?
And 'tis (one would think) past
all dispute, that when any thing is posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
determin'd as a matter of Duty,
the obligations to Obedience in that
particular are not, for that very reason,
left to any man's Choice and Prudence
(as all matters of Scandal are) but it
must become in all Cases and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
whatsoever, a Duty of a precise
absolute, and indispensable Necessity,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64701:156"/>
And certainly God had made but odd
provision for the Government of the
World, if he should allow one Subject,
for the pleasure of another, to derogate
from the Authority of lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
and permit them the liberty to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
the Commands of Governours, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than displease one another: for this
must unavoidably end in an utter disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of all Government, &amp; devolve the
Supremacy entirely upon every private
man, that either has or can pretend to
have a weak and a tender Conscience. For
if scandal to weak and tender Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
be of sufficient force to rescind the
obligatory Power of the Commands of
Authority, then whoever either has, or
can pretend to a weak Conscience, gains
thereby an absolute Sovereignty over all
his Superiours, and vests himself with a
power to dispense with or evacuate their
Commands. So that in the issue of all,
this pretence puts it in the power of any
peevish or malevolent person to cancel all
the Decrees of Princes, and make his
own humour the Rule of all their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Laws of Government, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Superior to his own Superiours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by being ignorant or peevish. How is it
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64701:156"/>
possible to make Authority more cheap
and contemptible (if men would study
to weaken and disgrace it) than by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
its Commands of less force, than
the folly or perverseness of every arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Mechanick? And what can be more
destructive of all manner of Government
than to make all the Rules of Order and
Discipline less sacred, than the whimsies
of every phantastick Zealot? In brief,
the peace and quiet of honest men is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be mighty well secured, when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
shall be thought the product
of a more exact and tender Conscience;
When to pick quarrels with the Laws,
and make scruple of obeying them shall
be made the specifick Character of the
<hi>Godly Party;</hi> and when giddy and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Zeal shall not only excuse, but
hallow Disobedience; when every one,
that has pride enough to fancy himself a
<hi>Child of God,</hi> shall have Licence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
Authority and do as he list. What
an irresistible temptation is this to proud
and zealous Enthusiasts, to affect being
troublesome to Government, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to all the Laws of Discipline,
when it shall pass for the result of a more
extraordinary tenderness of Conscience?
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64701:157"/>
What encouragement could men have
to obey their Superiours, when to dispute
and dislike their Laws shall be thought
to proceed from a greater holiness and a
more exact integrity? And what a resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
inducement is this to all proud and
phantastick Zealots to remonstrate to the
Wisdom of Authority, if thereby they
may gain the Renown and Glory of a
more <hi>conspicuous godliness?</hi> If men
would but consider the natural Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of this, and the like Pretences,
they could not but see how fatally and
unavoidably they lead to Anarchy, and
an utter dissolution of all Government.
Which mischief (as is notoriously appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the Premisses) all the World
can never prevent, if the <hi>scandal</hi> of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men may ever dispence with the
Obligation of Publick Laws.</p>

               <p>THis pretence is but an after-game of
Conscience. 'Tis a certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
dissolution of Government.
'Tis a superannuated Pretence, and is
become its own Confutation. Old Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
proceed not from Tenderness, but
Stubborness of Conscience. This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
shewn in their scruple of
kneeling at the Communion. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
their Scruples out of Pride and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64701:158"/>
Vain-glory. Tenderness of Conscience
is so far from being the reason of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
that it lays upon us the
strongest Obligations to Obedience. A
Tender Conscience is ever of a yielding
and pliable temper. When 'tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
'tis nothing but humour or inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and is usually hardy enough not
to scruple the greatest Villanies. The
Commands of Publick Authority abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
all doubts and scruples, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
all irresolution of Conscience.
The matter of all scruples is too small to
weigh against the Sin and Mischief of
Disobedience. The Apostles Apology,
<hi>viz. We ought to obey God rather
than men,</hi> holds only in matters of
great and apparent Duty, but not in
doubtful and disputable Cases. Nothing
more easie than to raise scruples. No
Law can escape them, this particularly
shewn in our own Laws. When two
Obligations interfere, the greater al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
cancels the less. Hence 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any man to be reduced into a
necessity of Sinning. Obedience to
Publick Authority is one of the greatest
and most indispensable Duties of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
because most necessary to their
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64701:158"/>
well-being. To act against our own scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
out of obedience to Authority, is an
eminent instance of virtue. In cases of
a Publick Concern, men are to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
not by their own private, but by
the publick Iudgment. In these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the Commands of Publick Authority
are the Supreme Rules of Conscience.
There is a vast difference between Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Authority of Conscience. The
Puritans tenderness of Conscience is
one of the rankest sort of Heresies.
Wherefore 'tis absolutely necessary for
Authority to command things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE last refuge for
<hi>Godly Disobedience</hi>
is the pretence of a
poubtful, scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
&amp; unsatisfied
conscience; for (say
they) though we cannot positively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Ceremonial Constitutions of
the Church, as things in themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
yet unlawful they are to us, whose
Consciences are not sufficiently satisfied
concerning them; because whatsoever is
done with a doubting Conscience, <hi>i. e.</hi>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:64701:159"/>
without Faith, or a full perswasion of
mind, is done against it: according to that
clear and unquestionable Maxim of St.
<hi>Paul, Whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this precarious pretence, as well as
that of scandal, is but an after-game of
Conscience; they first resolved to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
our Constitutions, and then 'tis an
easie matter to want satisfaction about
them; and when mens Arguments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon their Wills, 'tis in their own
power only to repeal them, and all the
Reason in the world can never cure will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and artificial Scruples. However, if
the obligation of Laws must yield to that
of a weak and tender Conscience, how
impregnably is every man, that has a
mind to disobey, arm'd against all the
Commands of his Superiours? No Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
shall be able to govern him, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than himself pleases, and if he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the Law, he is sufficiently excused
from all obligations to Obedience; and
no Laws shall ever be able to oblige any
man, that either has, or can pretend to a
weak Conscience: for seeing no man
can discern the reality of mens pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
'tis all one to the Concernments of
Government, whether the tenderness
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64701:159"/>
of Conscience, that men plead to excuse
their disobedience, be serious or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit:
For, whether it be so, or so, 'tis
directly contrary to all the ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of Government. And if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
for a sufficient excuse to disobey,
'tis an effectual and incurable dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the force of Laws, and makes
them obligatory then only when every
man pleases; and he that will may obey,
and he that will not may chuse; seeing 'tis
so easie for any man, that has no inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Law, to claim the inviolable
Priviledge of a <hi>tender Conscience:</hi> So
that to make <hi>Proviso</hi>'s for tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
is to <hi>abate</hi> the whole Law; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it gives every man liberty to exempt
himself, and if he dislike the Law, he is
under no Obligation to obey it. But
suppose this pretence to be serious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
design or disguise, is it fit the Laws
of the Common-wealth should ask leave
of every Ignorant, and Well-meaning
man, whether they shall be Laws or
no? A weak Conscience is the product
of a weak Understanding; and he is a
very subtil man, that can find the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between a tender Head, and a
tender Conscience: and therefore if
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64701:160"/>
Princes must consult their Subjects Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
in all their Laws, this would
make all the Wisdom of Government
submit to the power of folly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
And when any person pleads
weakness or tenderness of Conscience
against the obligation of any Law, his
meaning is, that he is not of the same
Judgment and Opinion with his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
and 'tis wise, and handsom, and
becoming the <hi>Grandeur</hi> or Authority in
all its Laws, to comply with the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
apprehensions of every honest and
illiterate Peasant; who if he be not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in their determinations, may
cancel their obligations as to himself, and
if they offer to force this honest man to
submission, they invade the sacred and
inviolable liberty of a tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
So full of <hi>Anarchy</hi> are all these
mens pretences. And therefore Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
must look to the Publick, and let
tender Consciences look to themselves.
Laws must be of an unyielding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible
temper, and not such soft and
easie things, as to bend to every mans
humour, that they ought to command.
And unless Government be managed by
some setled Principles, it must for ever
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64701:160"/>
remain weak and unfixed: Princes must
not be diffident in their Rules, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims
of Policy; but as they must set
down some to themselves, so they must
act up roundly to them. For all Changes
of the Publick Laws and Methods of
Policy sadly weaken, if they do not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unsettle the Common-wealth; in
that <hi>Prescription</hi> is, at least in the practice
of the World, the greatest strength and
security of Government: 'tis indeed the
Fountain of Authority, and the thing
that vests Princes with their Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
and no Power, what right or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
soever it may plead, can ever be firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
establish'd, till it can plead the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and Authority of Prescription: And
therefore if Princes will be resolute (and
if they will Govern, so they must be)
they may easily make the most stubborn
Consciences bend to their Commands;
but if they will not, they must submit
themselves, and their Power, to all the
follies and passions of their Subjects.
For there are no conceits so extravagant,
or so pernicious, that may not pass for
Principles of Conscience. In brief, there
is nothing so ungovernable as a tender
Conscience, or so restive and inflexible as
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:64701:161"/>
folly or wickedness, when hardned with
Religion: and therefore instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
complyed with, they must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
with a more peremptory and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yielding
rigour, than naked and unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
Villany; else will they quickly
discover themselves to be pregnant with
greater and more fatal dangers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. This stale pretence comes
now too late, and is so ancient, that 'tis
long since superannuated: old Doubts
and scruples are like old scandals worn
out of date by time and experience: They
are the natural products of ignorance,
weakness is their Parent, and folly their
Nurse; and if they improve not into
Confidence, they never survive their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,</hi>
but of themselves vanish and
dissolve into nothing: And therefore this
pretence having out-lived it self, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
its own Answer and Confutation:
Because men ought not, nay, they cannot
remain so long under <hi>Vncertainties;</hi> and
'tis impossible but they should before this
time be competently determined, as to
the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the
things themselves: For if in so long a
time they have not been able to discover
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64701:161"/>
that sinfulness in them they suspected, that
is sufficient evidence of their being <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;</hi>
because their scruples have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
them to be so throughly sifted and
examined: And if after all that hot and
vehement contention, that has been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
about them, it appears not yet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are criminal and chargeable, (for
if it does, then the doubt ceases, and the
certainty, not the suspition of sin is to
be objected) that is presumption enough
for any modest and sober man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
their innocence; and still to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the scruple, is folly and peevishness,
and then the <hi>Conscience</hi> is not doubtful,
but obstinate and peremptory: The man
is resolved to cherish his scruple, and
persist in his folly; and if he will not be
satisfied, it is not because he is weak and
timorous, but because he is stubborn
and dis-ingenuous. And then he pretends
Conscience only to vouch his humour,
and his insolence, <hi>i. e.</hi> he is a villain and
an hypocrite; and is so far from deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pity, especially from Authority, that
no offenders can more need or provoke
their severity; in that, such men resolve
to tire out their Governors by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible
stubbornness, and to affront
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64701:162"/>
their Laws with trifles and contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Exceptions.</p>
            <p>At the first setlement of a Church or
new Religion, then indeed mens old fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
prejudices, and weaknesses, ought
to be charitably considered; and they
are not to be forced into new Customs
and Usages, by too much rigor and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity;
but ought to be gently and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
treated, till time and better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
may wear off their scruples, and
little exceptions. And this was the
case of the <hi>Iews</hi> in the first Ages of
Christianity, who were at first indulged
in their weak and trifling conceits;
because then they might reasonably be
presumed to arise from a pitiable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and dissetlement of Conscience:
But as soon as the Abrogation of the
<hi>Mosaick</hi> Institution was fully declared
and acknowledged in the Church, they
were brought under the common yoke
of Discipline, and were not permitted
to plead their Doubts and Scruples
against publick Laws and Constitutions.
And this too is our present case, men
labour to support an old Schism by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn
scruples and jealousies, and will
persevere in their doubts, because they
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64701:162"/>
are resolved never to be satisfied; for
otherwise it were impossible, that after
so much time, and so much satisfaction,
they could still remain unresolved. And
if whole Armies of Reason have not been
sufficient to chase away all their little and
imaginary fears: Yet methinks so long
time, and so much experience might be
sufficient to convince them, that they are
but shadows, and illusions of their own
<hi>melancholy Fancies;</hi> for had they been
real and substantial things, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
they should ever have escaped the
discovery of so long and so severe a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny.
But, if nor time, nor reason can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuse
them, it is not their ignorance, but
their obstinacy that is invincible. Thus
<hi>v. g.</hi> when to kneel at the <hi>Communion,</hi>
is in it self an handsom and decent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in that this Sacrament is the most
solemn piece of gratitude, or worship
in the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and a peculiar
acknowledgment of our vast and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
obligations to our <hi>Redeemer;</hi>
and therefore to be performed with the
profoundest Reverence and Humility:
And when these men themselves are not
only ready to observe, but also to enjoyn
the same posture in their ordinary
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64701:163"/>
Prayers, and other less solemn expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Devotion; and when the power
of the Church has actually determined
and required this reverent posture, to
stamp a peculiar sacredness and solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon this Duty, no man can possibly
now scruple its practice without affected
contempt, and wilful disobedience;
because they cannot but be convinced
(unless they are resolved against it) of
the vanity and dis-ingenuity of their old
pretence: Namely, lest they should be
interpreted to give religious Worship to
the <hi>Elements,</hi> and by lying prostrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in giving Divine
Worship to a sensless piece of matter.
For when they plead this excuse for their
disobedience, they cannot but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to themselves, that by it they do
not only despise, but slander and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Laws, that they out-face and
traduce Authority, and would force
their Governours to believe and confess
that they favour what they expresly
abhor; seeing the very same Law that
enjoyns this Ceremony, provides so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
against this abuse, and declares so
industriously, That it is so far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64701:163"/>
any reverence to the <hi>Creatures</hi>
themselves, that it abhors it; but only
requires it, as it is used in all other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
addresses to Heaven. And, if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this, men will dread it as
a piece of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> because (forsooth)
it has been, or may be abused to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
I say no more, than that if such
thin and frivolous scruples may out-weigh
the Laws, and evacuate our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
to obedience, there are none in
the World that are not as apparently
liable to as dis-ingenuous surmises; and
they may as rationally forbear looking
up towards Heaven in their prayers, lest
they should worship the Clouds, or the
Sun, Moon, and Stars. But the truth of
it is, some men study for impertinent
scruples, to ensnare themselves, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to raise great doubts from little
reasons, and cannot be satisfied, because
they will not; they have enslaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to their follies, and boared their
ears to their scruples, and are resolved
to grow old in a voluntary bondage to
trifles and fooleries. Now it is necessary
for people of this humour to streighten
the Laws, till they have made them too
severe and rigorous to be obeyed, to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64701:164"/>
draw their knot, till it becomes trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
and uneasie; to put them upon the
Wrack, and stretch them beyond, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
their own intention by rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
cases, by harsh and unkind
Interpretations, and by far-fetch'd and
disingenuous suspicions; and, under the
shelter of such <hi>precarious pretences</hi> as
no Law can possibly avoid, they refuse
the <hi>Liberty</hi> that is given them to obey
the Laws, only that they may take the
<hi>Licence</hi> to disobey them. In brief, the
main Mystery of all this niceness (though
themselves have not wit enough to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
its first causes) is, for the most part,
nothing but a little pride and vain-glory:
It is a glorious thing to suffer for a <hi>tender
Conscience,</hi> and therefore it is easie and
natural for some people to affect some
little scruples against the Commands of
Authority, thereby to make themselves
obnoxious to some little Penalties; and
then what <hi>godly men</hi> are they that are so
ready to be punished for a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
How do such men hug and nurse
their dear scruple? All the reason, and
all the perswasion in the World shall
never be able to wrest it from them. It is
their <hi>Ephod</hi> and their <hi>Teraphim,</hi> the only
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64701:164"/>
mark of their Godliness, and symbol of
their Religion; and if you rob them of
that, you <hi>take away their gods: And what
have they more?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. If my Conscience be really
weak and tender, What can become it
more than humble obedience and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Authority? Weakness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
always proceeds in some measure
from want of wit; and therefore to make
this the pretence of disobedience, is
in effect to say, I will controul the
wisdom of my Superiours, because I
have little or none my self. Certainly,
where persons have any serious sense of
their own ignorance, they can scarce
have a stronger obligation to obedience:
And they can never be so confident in any
action, as when they obey; because then
they have the Publick Wisdom to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
them, and their own Folly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
them: That is, they follow the
best guide men are capable of, in their
Circumstances. And a Subject that is
<hi>Conscious</hi> of his own weakness, when
he resigns up himself to the Wisdom of
his Superiours, in matters doubtful
and disputable, is in effect governed by
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64701:165"/>
the best and safest Dictates of his own
Conscience; which, unless it be hardned
with pride and insolence, cannot but
perswade him, that he ought to presume
them more competent Judges of the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and expediency of Publick Laws,
whose work and office it is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them, than himself, who is wholly
ignorant of the management and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
of <hi>Publick Affairs.</hi> This is the
most common Principle of humane life,
and all men practise by it in all their
concerns, but those of Religion. And
that is the reason it has ever been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
with so many follies and fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies,
because silly people will not submit
their Consciences to any thing but their
own <hi>giddy Imaginations:</hi> Whereas, if
they would but condescend to the same
Rules of Government in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as they do in all their other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
obedience to Authority might be
secured without any violence to Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
seeing no Conscience, that is acted
by wise and sober perswasions, will
ever be stiff in doubtful and uncertain
Cases, against the determinations of the
Publick Wisdom: Because such men
being sensible how unable they are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64701:165"/>
themselves, they know they can
never act more safely, than when they are
governed by their Superiors: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they cannot pretend to trust con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
enough to their own conduct,
how can they proceed upon wiser and
more reasonable grounds, than by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
themselves to the <hi>Publick Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi>
In which, though possibly they
might be misguided, yet they may secure
themselves, that, God who values inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
more than subtilty, will pardon
their weakness, and reward their meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and humility. But for a man to plead
weakness of Conscience for disobedience
to Government, is just as if a Child in
<hi>Minority</hi> should reject the advice of his
<hi>Guardians,</hi> because he has not wit enough
to know, when he is well advised; or as
if a <hi>Fool</hi> should refuse to be governed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he has not reason enough to discern
when he is well managed; or as if a <hi>Blind
Man</hi> should not trust to the conduct of a
Guide, because he is not able to judge
when he is <hi>misled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Humility and Condescension are the
most proper duties of weakness and
ignorance, and meekness, and simplicity
the only ornaments of a tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:64701:166"/>
And one would think that men,
whose confidence exceeds not their wit,
should be strangely wary of censuring
the wisdom of Authority. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is but a very odd pretence to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Conscience, when it appears in
nothing but being too strong for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that man that pretends to it,
does not seriously believe himself, if he
presumes he is wise enough to govern his
Governors: And so does every one, that
thinks the perswasions of his own mind
of sufficient force to cancel the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their commands. It is an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
piece of modesty for one, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to weakness of Conscience, when
his Prince requires his obedience to give
him counsel, to advise him how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the Kingdom, to blame and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Laws, and to tell him how this
and the other might be mended. And,
What can be more fulsom, than to see
men, under pretences of great strictness
and severity of Conscience, to cherish
stubbornness and vanity, and to endure
neither Laws nor Superiours, because
they are proud enough to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more <hi>Holy</hi> than their Neighbours?
What a malapert and insolent piece of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64701:166"/>
pride is it, for every <hi>Prating Gossip</hi> and
illiterate Mechanick (that can mark
themselves with some distinctive names
and Characters of Godliness) to scoff
and jibe at the wisdom of publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to affront the Laws and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of a Church, to pity and disdain
the lamentable ignorance of <hi>Learned
Men,</hi> and to Libel all sorts of people
that are not of their own <hi>Rendez-vous</hi>
(especially their Superiors) with slanders
and idle stories? What strange effects
are these of a diffident and timorous
Conscience? A Conscience that knows
it self to be acted by certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Principles, how could it be more
head-strong and confident? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if we compare these mens practices
with their pretences, What can be more
evident, than that it is not <hi>Tenderness</hi> of
Conscience that emboldens them to fall
out with all the World, but pride, and
vanity, and insolence? For nothing else
could possibly drive them on with so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
a sail, against so strong and so
united a torrent. For a Conscience, that
is only weak and tender, is of a yielding
and pliable temper, it is soft and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
modest, and teachable, apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64701:167"/>
with the Commands of its Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
and easily capable of all impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
tending to Peace and Charity; but
when it is stubborn and confident in its
own apprehensions, then it is not tender,
but hardy and humoursom: And, as
<hi>queasie</hi> as it is in reference to its Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Commands, it is usually strong
enough to digest Rebellion and Villany;
and whilst it rises against a poor innocent
Ceremony, it is scarce ever stirred with
Schism, Faction, and Cruelty. Now to
permit these men their liberty, who
mistake insolence for tenderness of
Conscience, (than which nothing more
easie, or more natural for people, that
are both proud and simple) is to suffer
ignorance to ride in <hi>Triumph,</hi> because
it is proud and confident; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
zealous Idiots in their folly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they threaten Authority, to be
peevish and scrupulous to their Laws,
and to infest their Government with a
<hi>sullen and cross-grain'd Godliness</hi> (an
Artifice not much unlike the tricks of
some froward Children) and therefore
such untoward and <hi>humoursom Saints</hi>
must be lashed out of their sullenness (as
Children are) into compliance and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64701:167"/>
better manners; otherwise they will be
an eternal annoyance to all Government,
with the childish and whining pretences
of a <hi>weak and crasie Conscience.</hi> In
brief, I appeal to all mankind (that
have but any tolerable conception of the
nature and design of Religion) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not much more becoming the
temper of a <hi>Christian Spirit,</hi> to comply
with the commands of their Superiors,
that are not apparently sinful, in order
to the Peace and Setlement of the
Church, than to disturb its quiet by a
stubborn and peremptory adherence to
our own Doubts and Scruples? For,
What is there in <hi>Christianity</hi> of greater
importance, than the vertues of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
peaceableness, and humility? And
in what can these great duties more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
themselves, than in the offices and
civilities of <hi>humble Obedience;</hi> that
contains in it all that is most amiable,
and most useful in the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
'Tis modesty, 'tis meekness, 'tis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
'tis love, 'tis peacebleness, 'tis
ingenuity; 'Tis a duty so pregnant with
Vertue in it self, and of such absolute
necessity to the happiness of mankind,
That there is scarce anything can come in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:64701:168"/>
competition with it, whose obligation it
will not at the first appearance utterly
cancel and evacuate, (as I shall more fully
demonstrate in the ensuing Propositions.)
In the mean while we see, what is to be
done in the case of tender Consciences:
If they are acted by calm and peaceable
Principles, they will not <hi>desire</hi> liberty;
if they are not, they will not <hi>deserve</hi> it.
For, if they are humble and modest,
they will chuse to submit to the will of
their Superiors, rather than, by thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, do what in themselves lies to
discompose the publick Peace. And
therefore if they will rather venture to
embroil the Common-wealth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
Authority, than forego their own
<hi>peremptory Determinations,</hi> and make
their Superiors comply and bend to their
confidence; it is because they are cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally
bold and imperious in their own
conceits, and are of a temper too stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
insolent, and presumptuous to be
endured in any Society of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Doubts and Scruples are so
far from being sufficient <hi>Warranty</hi> of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
that they are outweighed by
the <hi>Obligations</hi> of the Law: For if I
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64701:168"/>
doubt concerning the injustice of my
action, I must also of necessity doubt
of the injustice of my disobedience;
and unless I am absolutely certain that
the Law is evil, I am sure disobedience
to it is: And therefore I am always as
forcibly bound to obey a scrupled Law,
for fear of the sin of disobedience, as to
disobey it, for fear it commands an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
evil: So that a doubting Conscience
must always at least as much fright us
from disobeying, as from obeying any
<hi>Humane Law.</hi> Though indeed, if we
would speak properly, the commands
of Authority perfectly determine, and
evacuate all doubtfulness and irresolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Conscience: For, if it before
hung in suspence concerning the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the action, and unresolved, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were good or evil, as not having
competent reason to incline to one side
rather than to the other; yet when Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
casts its commands into the Scale
(if in some mens Consciences they weigh
any thing) they cannot but add weight
more than enough to determine the
Judgment, and incline the Balance. For
if the Reasons on both sides were equal
before, than thet side that gains this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64701:169"/>
has most reason now. So that
Laws do not force us to obey them with
a doubting Conscience, but remove our
doubts at the same time they require
our obedience; because they destroy the
equal probability of the two opinions,
and determine the Conscience to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of acting, by directing it to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the safest and most probable perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
In that no practice or opinion,
that is capable of doubt or uncertainty,
can be of equal importance with the
prime Duties of obedience and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and the matter of all doubts and
scruples is ever of too small and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a consequence to be laid in the
<hi>Balance</hi> against the great and weighty
mischiefs of disobedience. If indeed the
commands of Authority enjoyned any
thing absolutely and apparently evil, and
against the great and unalterable Rules
of truth and goodness, in such exigents
<hi>Da veniam Imperator</hi> would be a fair and
civil excuse: But matters of a less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
will not pay the charges of a
persecution, it is not worth the while to
suffer for little things; and that man has
but the just reward of his own folly, that
would suffer <hi>Martyrdom</hi> in the cause of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:64701:169"/>
an indifferent Ceremony, or for the truth
of a <hi>Metaphysical Notion.</hi> And the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
of <hi>Optatus</hi> to the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who
were so forward to cast away their lives
in defence of their little Schism,
was smart and severe.<note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Nulli di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
est, nega Deum; nulli di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
est, incende Testamentum; nulli di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
est, aut thus pone, aut Basilicas dirue.
Istae enim res solent Martyria generare.</hi>
Matters, wherein the Being of Religion,
and the Truth of Christianity, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
concerned, were worth the dying
for, and would quit the costs of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but no indifferent Rites or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
were of value enough to pay for
the lives of men: And the Zealots of the
<hi>Pars Donati,</hi> who were so ambitious to
suffer Imprisonment, Confiscation of
Goods, Banishment, and Death it self,
out of a pertinacious resolution against
some established customs and usages of
the Church, could never be rewarded
in any other Heaven, but the <hi>Paradise</hi> of
Fools. Things that are essentially evil,
no change or variety of Circumstances
can make good; and therefore no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of any Superior can ever warrant
or legitimate their practice: But then
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64701:170"/>
these are always matters of the greatest
and most weighty importance, and of an
apparent and palpable obliquity, such
as Blasphemy, Murther, Injustice, Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Ingratitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are so clearly
and intrinsically evil, that no end, how
good or great soever, can ever carry with
it goodness enough to abate or evacuate
their <hi>Malice.</hi> But as for all matters, that are
not so apparently good or evil, but are
capable of doubt and uncertainty, their
Morality is of so small importance, that
it can never stand in competition with
the obligations and conveniences of the
great Duty of obedience. And thus when
the Apostles were forbidden by the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
<hi>Sanhedrim</hi> to Preach the Name of
<hi>Iesus, Acts</hi> 5. 29. they desired to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
upon no other account but of
an express command from God himself,
in a matter of great importance, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
necessity. Our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi>
coming into the World with a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from its Supream Governour to
make Laws, and the <hi>Holy Apostles</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an infallible assurance of his Divine
Authority from his great, manifest, and
undeniable Miracles (the most certain
and unquestionable credentials that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64701:170"/>
can send to the Sons of Men) they
could not but lie under an indispensable
obligation to give assent to his Message,
and obedience to his Commands; and
that out of duty to the <hi>Supream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
of the Universe; from whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
Laws, no other Authority
can ever derogate, because it is all of an
inferiour nature. But to apply this Rule,
which the <hi>Apostles</hi> never made use of,
but in a case of certain, absolute, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
injustice, to matters of a small,
doubtful, and uncertain nature, is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
inconsistent with the quiet of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and infinitely distant from the
intention of the Apostles. Their Plea
was in a case of great, evident, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
necessity: But what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
is that for my disobedience, when
I only fear, or fancy the Law to be unjust?
Which, if it were so, is not of moment
enough to weigh against the mischiefs
and enormities, that follow upon disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
And therefore in all doubtful and
less considerable cases, that side, on
which obedience stands, must ever carry
it; and no man that is either wise or
good, will ever trouble his Governours,
with nice and curious disputes; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64701:171"/>
of the Law stifles all scruples,
and trifling objections. And thus where
there was no apparent repugnancy to the
Law of God, we find none more compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and conformable in all other things
than the Apostles, freely using any Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> or <hi>Iewish Church,</hi>
that were not expresly cancelled by some
Divine Prohibition.</p>
            <p>But further, this their Apology is as
forcible a Plea in concerns of Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and common honesty, as in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion; it holds equally in
both, in cases of a certain and essential
injustice, and fails equally in both, in
doubtful and less material cases; and was
as fairly urged by that famous Lawyer
<hi>Papinian,</hi> who upon this account, when
the <hi>Emperor</hi> commanded him to defend
and justifie the lawfulness of <hi>Parricide,</hi>
chose rather to die, than to Patronize
so monstrous a villany: Here the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
was great and palpable. But in
matters more doubtful and less material,
where the case is nice and curious,
and not capable of any great Interest, or
great reason, there Obedience out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs
and evacuates all Doubts, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
and suspicions: And what wise
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64701:171"/>
or honest man will offend, or provoke his
Superiours upon thin pretences, and for
little regards? And if every man, that
can raise doubts and scruples, and nice
Exceptions against a Law, shall therefore
set himself free from its obligation; then
farewel all Peace, and all Government.
For what more easie to any man, that
understands the Fundamental Grounds
and Reasons of <hi>Moral Equity,</hi> than to
pick more material quarrels against the
Civil Laws of any Common-wealth, than
our Adversaries can pretend to against
our <hi>Ecclesiastical Constitutions?</hi> And
now, shall a Philosopher be excused from
obedience to the Laws of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
because he thinks himself able to
make exceptions to their Prudence and
Convenience, and to prove them not so
useful to the Publick, nor so agreeable
to the Fundamental Rules of natural
Justice and Equity, as himself could
have contrived? What if I am really
perswaded, that I can raise much more
considerable objections against <hi>Littletons
Tenures,</hi> than ever these men have, or
shall be able to produce against our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
Constitutions? Though it be
easie to be mistaken in my conceit, yet
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64701:172"/>
whether I am, or am not, it is all one, if
I am confident. And now it would be
mightily conducive to the interests of
Justice and Publick Peace for me, and all
others of my <hi>Fond Perswasion</hi> in this
particular, to make Remonstrances to
the Laws of the Land, to Petition the
King and Parliament; to leave us, at the
liberty of our own Conscience and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
to follow the <hi>best Light,</hi> God has
given us, for the setlement of our own
estates; because we think we can do it
more exactly according to the Laws of
<hi>Natural Iustice,</hi> than if we are tied up to
the positive Laws of the Land. Thus
that groundless and arbitrary maxim of
the Law, <hi>That inheritances may lineally
descend, but not lineally ascend,</hi> whereby
the Father is made uncapable of being
immediate Heir to the Son, would be
thought by a <hi>Philosopher</hi> prejudicial to
one of the most equal and most ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Laws of Nature, <hi>viz. The gratitude
of Children to Parents;</hi> which this Law
seems in a great measure to hinder, by
alienating those things from them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are best able to express it. What
if I have been happy in a loving and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Father, that has been strangely soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64701:172"/>
to leave me furnished with all the
comforts and conveniences of life, that
declined not to forego any share of his
own ease and happiness to procure mine,
that has spent the greatest part of his care
and industry to bless me, according to
the proportion of his abilities, with a
good fortune, and a good education;
and has, perhaps out of an over-tender
solicitude for my welfare, reduc'd himself
to great streights and exigences: How
monstrous &amp; unnatural must the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of this Law appear to me, that,
when the bounty of Providence has blest
me with a fortune answerable to the <hi>good
old Mans</hi> desires and endeavours, if I
should happen to be cut off before him
by an <hi>untimely death,</hi> all that, whereby
I am able to recompence his <hi>Fatherly
tenderness,</hi> should in the common and
ordinary course of Law be conveyed
from him to another person; the stream
of whose affections was confined to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Channel, and who, being much
concerned for his own Family, could in
all probability be but little concerned for
me? What an unnatural and unjust Law
is this that designs, as far as it can, to
cut off the streams of our natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64701:173"/>
and disposes of our possessions
contrary to the very first tendencies, and
obligations of Nature? So easie a thing
is it to talk <hi>little Plausibilities</hi> against any
Laws, whose obligation is positive, and
not of a prime and absolute necessity:
And yet down-right Rebellion it would
be, if I, or any man else, should refuse
subjection to these and the like Laws, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these, &amp; the like pretences. And thus,
we see, is the case all the way equal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Laws Civil, and Laws Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
In all matters greatly and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
wicked, the nature of the action
out-weighs the duty of Obedience; but
in all cases less certain and less material,
the duty of Obedience out-weighs the
nature of the action. And this may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to shew, from the <hi>Subject Matters</hi> of
all doubts and scruples, That they are not
of consideration great enough to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the commands of Authority.
And this leads me from the matter of a
scrupulous Conscience, to consider its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. As the objects of a scrupulous
Conscience are of too mean importance,
to weigh against the mischiefs of Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64701:173"/>
so are its obligations too weak,
to prevail against the commands of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority. For when two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
obligations happen to encounter,
the greater ever cancels the less; because
if all good be eligible, then so are all the
degrees of goodness too: And therefore
to that side on which the greater good
stands, our duty must ever incline; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we despise all those degrees of
goodness, it contains in it above the
other. For in all the Rules of Goodness
there is great inequality and variety of
degrees, some are prescribed for their
own native excellency &amp; usefulness, and
others purely for their subserviency to
these: Now when a greater &amp; a lesser vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
happen to clash, as it frequently falls
out in the transaction of Humane Affairs,
there the less always gives place to the
greater, because it is good only in order to
it; and therefore where its subordination
ceases, there its goodness ceases, and by
consequence its obligation. For no subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
or instrumental dutys are absolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded or commended, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
good or evil by their <hi>Accidental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;</hi>
their goodness is not intrinsick, but
depends upon the goodness of their end,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64701:174"/>
and their being directed to a good end,
(if they are not intrinsically evil) makes
them virtuous; because their Morality
is entirely relative and changeable, and
so alters its colours of good and evil,
by its several aspects and postures to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and different ends: And therefore
they never carry any <hi>Obligation</hi> in them,
when they interfere with higher &amp; more
useful Duties. And hence it comes to
pass, that it is absolutely impossible for
any man to be reduced into a necessity of
sinning; because, though two inferiour
and subordinate Duties may sometimes
happen to be inconsistent with each other
or with some duty of an absolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
goodness; yet the nature of
things is so handsomly contrived, that
it is utterly impossible that things should
ever happen so crosly, as to make two
essential and indispensable Duties stand
at mutual opposit on: And therefore no
man can ever be forc'd to act against one,
out of compliance with the other: And
if there be any contrariety between a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and instrumental Duty, there the
case is plain, that the greater evacuates
the less; if between two instrumental
Duties, it can scarce so fall out, but that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64701:174"/>
some emergent circumstances shall make
one of them the more necessary; but if
they are both equally eligible, there is
no difficulty; and a man may do as he
pleases. It is indeed possible for any man,
by his own voluntary choice to entangle
himself in this sad perplexity; but there
is no culpable Error that is unavoidable,
and every sinfully erroneous Conscience
is voluntary and vincible: And if men
will not part with their sinful Errors, it is
not because they cannot, but because they
will not avoid them. And if they resolve
to abuse themselves, no wonder, if their
sin be unavoidable; but then the necessity
is the effect of their own choice: And so
all sin is inevitable, when the peremptory
determination of the will, has made it
necessary. But as for the nature of all
the Laws of Goodness in themselves,
they are so wisely contrived, that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
impossible any circumstances
should ever fall out so awkardly, as to
make one sin the only way to escape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
or a necessary passage to a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Duty. Now to apply this general
Rule of Conscience to our particular
case, there is not any Precept in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
set down in more positive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64701:175"/>
expressions, or urged with more
vehement motives and perswasions, than
obedience to Government; because
there are but few, if any, Duties of a
weightier and more important necessity
than this: And for this reason is it, that
God has injoined it with such an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and unrestrained severity, thereby to
intimate that nothing can restrain the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversality
of its obligatory power, but
evident &amp; unquestionable disobedience
to himself. The duty of Obedience is
the original and Fundamental Law of
<hi>Humane Societies,</hi> and the only advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that distinguishes Government from
Anarchy. This takes away all dissentions,
by reducing every mans private will and
judgment to the determination of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority:</hi> Whereas, without it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
single person is his own Governour,
and no man else has any power or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over his actions, <hi>i. e.</hi> He is out of
the state of Government, and Society.
And for this reason is obedience, and
condescension to the wisdom of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority, one of the most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and indispensable duties of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as being so indispensably necessary
to the peace and preservation of Humane
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:64701:175"/>
Societies. Now a Conscience, that will
not stand to the Decrees and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of its Governors, subverts the very
Foundations of all Civil Society, that
subsists upon no other principle, but mens
submitting their own judgments to the
decisions of Authority, in order to the
publick peace and setlement; without
which there must of necessity be eternal
disorders and confusions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
where the Dictates of a private
Conscience happen to thwart the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of the publick Laws, they, in
that case, lose their binding power; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
if in that case they should oblige,
it would unavoidably involve all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in perpetual tumults and disorders.
Whereas the main end of all Divine, as
well as Humane Laws, is the prosperity
and preservation of Humane Society: So
that where any thing tends to the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Government, and undermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Humane happiness, though in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circumstances it were virtuous, yet
in this it becomes criminal, as destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thing of greater goodness than it
self. And hence, though a doubtful and
scrupulous Conscience should oblige in
all other cases, yet, when its commands
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:64701:176"/>
run counter to the commands of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
there its obligatory power immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ceases; because to act against it,
is useful to vastly more noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
purposes, than to comply with it:
In that every man that thwarts and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeys
the Laws of the Common-wealth,
does his part to disturb its Publick Peace,
that is maintained by nothing else but
obedience and submission to its Laws.
Now this is manifestly a bigger mischief
and inconvenience, than the foregoing of
any doubts and scruples can amount to:
And therefore, unless Authority impose
upon me something that carries with it
more evil and mischief, than there is
convenience in the peace and happiness
of the whole Society, I am indispensably
bound to yield obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
And though I scrupulously fear
lest the Magistrates injunctions should
be superstitious, yet, because I am not
sure they are so, and because a little ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity
in the external expressions of
<hi>Divine Worship</hi> carries with it less mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
and enormity, than the disturbance
of the Peace of Kingdoms, I am abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
obliged to lay aside my doubt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than disobey the Law; because to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64701:176"/>
preserve it, naturally tends to vast mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
and confusion; whereas the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
of my acting against it, is but
doubtful; and though it were certain,
yet it is small and comparatively incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.
And therefore to act against the
inclinations of our own doubts and
scruples, is so far from being criminal,
that it is an eminent instance of Virtue,
and implies in it, besides its subserviency
to the welfare of mankind, the great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Modesty, Peaceableness, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
And as for, what some are forward
enough to object, that this is, <hi>To do evil,
that good may come of it;</hi> it is a vain and
frivolous exception, and prevented in
what I have already discoursed; in that
that Rule is concerned only in things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and essentially evil, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
no case can alter, no circumstance
can extenuate, and no end can sanctifie:
But things that are only subserviently
good or evil, derive all their Virtue from
the greater Virtue they wait upon; and
therefore where a meaner, or an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
duty stands in competition with
an essential Virtue, its contrariety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
its goodness; and instead of being
less virtuous, becomes altogether sinful;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64701:177"/>
for though it have abstractedly some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of goodness, yet when it chances
to oppose any duty, that has more, and
more excellent degrees, it becomes evil
and unreasonable, by as many degrees as
that excels it. And one would think this
case should be past dispute, as to the
matters of our present Controversie, that
are of so vast a distance and disproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
forasmuch as obedience is a virtue
of so absolute necessity, and so diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
usefulness; whereas the goodness of
those little things, they oppose to it, is
so small, that it is confessedly scarce dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable;
and their Consciences, as nice
and curious as they are, not able to
determine positively, whether they are
good or evil: And therefore, what a
prodigious madness is it, to weigh such
trifling and contemptible things against
the vast mischiefs and inconveniences of
disobedience? The voice of the publick
Laws cannot but drown the uncertain
whispers of a <hi>tender Conscience;</hi> all
its scruples are hushed and silenced by
the commands of Authority: It dares
not whimper, when that forbids; and the
nod of a Prince aws it into silence and
submission. But if they dare to murmur,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:64701:177"/>
and their proud stomachs will swell
against the rebukes of their Superiors,
then there is no remedy but the rod and
correction: They must be chastised out of
their peevishness, and lashed into obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
In a word, though Religion so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consults the interests of Common-wealths,
and is the greatest instrument of
the peace &amp; happiness of Kingdoms; yet
so monstrously has it been abused by the
folly of some, and wickedness of others,
that nothing in the world has been the
mother of more mischief to Government.
The main cause of which has been mens
not observing the due scale and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of duties, and that, in case of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition,
the greater always destroys the
less: For hence have they opposed the
Laws, and by consequence the peace of
the Society, for an Opinion, or a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
or a subordinate instrumental du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
whereas, had they soberly considered
the important necessity of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
they would scarce have found any
duty of moment enough to weigh against
it. For seeing almost all virtues are injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us in order to the felicity of man, and
seeing there is nothing more conducive to
it, than that which tends to the Publick
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:64701:178"/>
weal and good of all; and seeing this
is the design, and natural tendency of
the Publick Laws, and our obedience to
them; that had need be hugely, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and absolutely evil, that cancels their
obligation, and dispences with our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and not a Form, or a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or an outward expression, or any
other instrumental part of Religion. But
some menthink it better to be disputative
than peaceable; and that there is more
godliness in being captious and talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
than in being humble and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
It is a pleasure to them to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
to Authority, they beat about,
and search into every little corner, for
doubts &amp; exceptions against their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
And how do they <hi>triumph,</hi>
when they can but start a scruple? They
labour to stumble at Atoms, to boggle
at straws and shadows; and cherish their
scruples till they become as big as they
are unreasonable, and lay so much stress
upon them, as to make them out-weigh
the greatest and most weighty things of
the Law. And it is prodigiously strange
(and yet as common too) to consider
how most men, who pretend (and that
perhaps sincerely) to great tenderness of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:64701:178"/>
Conscience, and scruple postures and
innocent ceremonies, are so hardy as to
digest the most wicked and most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
villanies: They can dispence
with spightfulness, malice, disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
schism, and disturbance of the
Publick Peace, and all, to nourish a
weak and an impotent scruple; and in
pursuit of any little conceit, they will
run themselves into the greatest and most
palpable enormities; and will cherish it,
till it weighs down the peace of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and Fundamental Principles of
common honesty. Find me a man that
is obstinately scrupulous, and I will
shew you one that is incurably seditious;
and whoever will prefer his scruples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the great duties of obedience,
peace, quietness, and humility, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoid being often betrayed into
tumults and seditions. But if we will
resolve to be <hi>tender</hi> of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the great, undoubted, and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
commands of the Gospel; that
will defend our Consciences against the
vexation of scruples, and little inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies,
protect the publick from all the
disturbances of a peevish and wayward
godliness, and secure our acceptance
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64701:179"/>
with God, without being so punctual
and exact in the Offerings of Mint and
Cummin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. In cases and disputes of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
concern, private men are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>sui Iuris,</hi> they have no power over
their own actions, they are not to be
directed by their own judgments, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by their own wills; but by the
commands and determinations of the
Publick Conscience. And if there be any
sin in the command, he that imposed it,
shall answer for it; and not I, whose
whole Duty it is to obey: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Authority will warrant my
obedience, my obedience will hallow, or
at least excuse my action, and so secure
me from sin, if not from error; because I
follow the best guide, and most probable
direction I am capable of: And though I
may mistake, my integrity shall preserve
my innocence. And in all doubtful and
disputable cases it is better to erre with
<hi>Authority,</hi> than be in the right against
it; not only, because the danger of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
error (and so it is, if it be disputable)
is out-weighed by the importance of the
great duty of obedience, that is more
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64701:179"/>
serviceable to the main ends of Religion,
than a more nice and exact way of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in opposition to Government; but
also, because they are to be supposed the
fittest Judges of what tends to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good, whose business it is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
Publick Affairs: And therefore
in all such matters, their commands
are the supream Rule of Conscience, as
being more competent Judges of Publick
Concerns, than mens own private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions;
and so must have a Superior
Authority over them, and bind them to
yield and submit to their determinations.
And, if we take away this <hi>Condescension</hi>
of our Private Consciences to Publick
Authority, we immediately dissolve all
Government; for in case of dissention,
unless we submit our perswasions to their
commands, their commands must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to our perswasions. And then, let
any man tell me, Wherein consists the
power of Princes, when it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled
by every Subjects opinion? and
what can follow, but perfect disorder and
confusion, when every man will be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by nothing but his own conceits?
And if Subjects may be allowed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
the prudence and convenience of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:64701:180"/>
all Laws, Government would be but a
weak and helpless thing, and Princes
would command at the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their Subjects. And, therefore
people are never curious in their excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against any Publick Laws, unless
in matters of Religion; and, in that case
they study for Reasons to disobey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it gratifies their pride &amp; vanity, to
seem more knowing than their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
in that part of wisdom, that they
think most valuable. Self-conceit and
Spiritual Pride are strange Temptations
to Disobedience; and, were there not
something of this in it, men would find
out other commands more liable to
their exceptions. For how seldom is it,
that any Wars are commenced upon just
and warrantable grounds? And yet, how
few are they, that take upon them to
judge their lawfulness? All men here
think their Princes command a sufficient
warrant to serve him, and satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this, that, in case the cause
prove to be unjust, the fault liesentirely
upon him that commands, and not at
all on him who has nothing to do but
obey. And if it were otherwise, that no
Subject were bound to take up Arms till
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:64701:180"/>
himself had approved the justness of the
cause, Commonwealths must be bravely
secured, and their safety must lie at the
mercy of every humorsome and pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Fellow. And yet to this piece of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
do men tempt themselves, when
they affect to be thought more godly
than their Neighbors. It is a gallant thing
to understand Religion better than their
Superiors, and to pity their ignorance in
the great Mysteries of the Gospel, and
by seeming to compassionate their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to despise their Authority. But if
Princes will suffer themselves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd
by the pride and insolence of these
contentious Zealots, they do but tempt
them to slight both their persons, and
their Government; and if they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be checked in their Laws Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and Government of the Church,
by every <hi>Systematical Theologue,</hi> (and
most, not to say the best, of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
are little better) they may as
well bear, to see themselves affronted in
their Laws Civil, and Government of the
State by every <hi>Village-Attorney,</hi> and
<hi>Solicitor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, all men that are in a state
of Government are bound, in all matters
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:64701:181"/>
doubtful and disputable, to submit the
dictates of Private Conscience to the
determinations of Publick Authority.
Nor does this oblige any man to act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the dictates of his own Conscience,
but only, by altering the case, alters his
perswasions, <hi>i.e.</hi> though every man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
absolutely, and by himself, be
bound to follow his own private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet when he is considered as the
member of a Society, then must be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd,
then he must of necessity be bound
to submit his own private thoughts to
publick determinations. And it is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
of every mans Conscience, that is
not turbulent and seditious, that it ought
in all things that are not of a great &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
necessity, whatever its own private
judgment of them is, to acquiesce in the
determinations of its Governors, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to publick peace and unity. For unless
this be done, there can be nothing but
eternal disorders and confusions in the
Church; in that it is utterly impossible
that all men should have the same appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of things, and (considering the
tempers and passions of mankind) as
impossible, that they should not pursue
their differences and controversies with
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64701:181"/>
too much heat &amp; vehemence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unless whatever their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and apprehensions be, they are
bound in all such cases to acquiesce in the
decisions and determinations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of the Church, or Common-wealth,
in order to its peace and setle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there can be no possible way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
endless squabbles and confusions.
And unless this be a fundamental Rule &amp;
dictate of every mans Conscience, that as
he is bound in all doubtful cases to follow
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the best <hi>result</hi> of his
own private perswasions, where he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has, nor is obliged to have, any
other guide or rule of his actions; so he
is bound to forego them all (provided
his plain and necessary duty be secured)
out of obedience to Authority, and in
order to the due Government of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
there never can be any peace or
setlement in any Church or Common-wealth
in the world. And every Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that is not thus perswaded, is upon
that account to be reckoned as seditious
and unpeaceable, and so to be treated
accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. He that with an implicite Faith
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64701:182"/>
and confidence, resigns up his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to any Superior on earth in all things,
is a <hi>Fool;</hi> and he is as great a Fool, (to
say no worse) that will do it in nothing:
For as all men are immediately subject
to God alone, in matters of indispensable
duty, (that are not at all concern'd in our
present dispute) so are they, in all other
things, to condescend to the Decrees and
determinations of their lawful Superiors.
Neither is this, to put men upon that
supream Folly of renouncing the use
and guidance of their own Reasons out
of obedience to any mans infallibility.
For by <hi>Reason</hi> we mean nothing but, the
mind of man making use of the wisest
and most prudential methods, to guid
it self in all its actions; and therefore
it is not confined to any sort of Maxims
and Principles in Philosophy, but it
extends it self to any knowledge that
may be gained by Prudence, Experience,
and Observation. And hence right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
when it is imploy'd about the actions
of men, is nothing else but Prudence and
Discretion: Now the Reason of any
wise and sober man will tell him, that it
is most Prudent, Discreet, and Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
to forego his own private perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:64701:182"/>
in things doubtful and disputable,
out of obedience to his lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;
because, without this the World
can never be governed. And supposing
mens judgments and understandings to
be never so much above the <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>
of all Humane Authority, and that no
man can be bound to submit his Reason
to any thing but the Commands of God;
yet every man ows at least so much civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to the will of his Prince, and the
peace of his Country, as to bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to a compliance and submission to
the Publick Judgment, rather than to
disturb the Publick Peace, for the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of his own Fancy and Opinion.
Which is no enslaving of his Reason to
any mans usurpation over his Faith and
Conscience, but only a bringing it to a
modest compliance, in order to the
common interests of Humane Society:
And if it be not a duty of subjection, yet
it is one of peaceableness; and if it be not
grounded upon our obligations to the
Authority it self, yet it is most clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from an higher Obligation, that all
men are under, to advance the welfare
of mankind, and more particularly of
that Society they live in, that is antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:64701:183"/>
to those of Government, which is
instituted only in order to the common
good: And therefore, though our duty
in such cases could not be deduced
from our obligation to any humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
yet it clearly arises from that
duty of Charity we owe to our <hi>Fellow
Creatures.</hi> And though we are not to
submit our <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> to any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Power, yet we are to the first and
Fundamental Laws of Charity: which
being one of the greatest duties of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
it is but reasonable to forego all
more private and inferior obligations,
when they stand in competition with it.
And thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> notwithstanding he
declaimed with so much vehemence
against the observation of the Judaical
Rites and Ceremonies, never scrupled to
use them, as oft as it was serviceable to
the advancement of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and by consequence the good of
mankind. And all I would perswade men
to, is only that they would do as much
out of duty, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did out of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
that as he complied with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of the Jews, retaining his
own private judgment to himself, for
the greater advantage of Religion; so
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64701:183"/>
they would, whatever their own perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are of some things not clearly and
absolutely sinful, comply with the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of their Governours, when it
is conducive to the nobler ends of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace and Tranquillity: A thing in
it self so good and so necessary, that there
are very few actions, that it will not
render virtuous, whatever they are in
themselves, whenever they happen to be
useful and instrumental to its attainment.
And therefore in all matters (that are no
indispensable duties of Religion) he, that
acts cross to the commands of Authority,
has no sense either of the great ends of
Order and Government, or great duties
of Humanity, Modest, Peaceableness,
Meekness, and Civility, <hi>i. e.</hi> He is a
proud and factious person; and has no
other motive so to do, but the pleasure
of being peevish and disobedient.</p>
            <p>In fine, there is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
the former consists in the Freedom
of a mans own judgment, and of this no
Magistrate can deprive us, in that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tie up any mans understanding from
judging of things as himself pleaseth:
But as for the latter, that consists in the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64701:184"/>
power over mens outward actions, and
this, as far as it concerns all publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
every man does, and of necessity
must pass away to the Rulers of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
he lives in: Because (though I have
said it often enough already, yet too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
I cannot say it, in that it is the main
Key of the Controversie, and yet but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
if at all regarded by our Adversaries)
the very nature of Government consists
in nothing else but a power of command
over mens actions; and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
all men grant it away to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
they live not under Government,
but in a state of <hi>Anarchy:</hi> Every man
will be Prince and Monarch to himself,
and as free from all commands, as if he
lived out of all Society; seeing only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
shall have any real Dominion over
his own actions, and his Governours
shall not have power to command him
any thing, but what himself first thinks
fit to do: And I hope I need not to prove,
that this is a plain dissolution of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
So that when men will be the
absolute Masters of their own actions, it is
not the freedom of Conscience, but its
power and sovereignty, for which they
contend; they will endure none to rule
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:64701:184"/>
over them but themselves, and force
Princes to submit their Laws to their
saucy and imperious humour: And it is
this they mean by their pretence to a
tender Conscience, <hi>i. e.</hi> A Conscience
that scruples to be subject to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that will in spight of all Publick
Laws be entirely at its own Liberty, that
will not submit it self to any Rule but its
own private perswasions, that affects to
be nice and squeamish against all the
commands of its Superiours, and loves
to censure them upon the lightest and
most slender presumptions, and that will
not yield up any thing of its own phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
humour to its Princes will, or the
Churches Peace, <hi>i. e.</hi> in effect, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of their Consciences (for which,
forsooth, they must be born with) consists
in nothing else but their being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most <hi>Notorious Hereticks.</hi> For
the rankest sort of Heresie is nothing but
the product of a peevish and contentious
Spirit; and an Heretick is one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in Quarrels and Factions; whence
<hi>Erasmus</hi> renders S. <hi>Pauls</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Sectarum Author,</hi> a man that loves to be
the Leader of a Party: It is peevishness
and obstinacy of will that turns small
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64701:185"/>
Errors into great Heresies. Pride and
Passion, and whatsoever can make an
opinion vicious, are its Fundamental In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,
and give it its essential Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
This vice lies not so much in the
Opinions, as in the tempers of men, it is
a stubborn and refractory disposition of
mind, or a peremptoriness in a mans own
conceptions; and therefore it is by Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> reckon'd among the Fruits of the
Flesh, as being a kind of brutish peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that is directly opposed to that leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and yieldingness of mind, that is one
of the choicest Fruits of the Spirit;
whence he advises not to confute, but to
admonish such an one, <hi>i. e.</hi> That is quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsome
and boisterous for every trifle,
and every fancy, because through Pride
and Perversness he is uncapable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
and therefore can only be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised,
and not disputed into Sobriety. Or
(to use the phrase of Saint <hi>Paul)</hi> he is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a fellow that is troublesome
and contentious, especially about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Rites and Usages of the Church.
And such a malapert <hi>Non-Conformist</hi> he
supposes disputing in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
that their Women ought, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their received Custom, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64701:185"/>
at <hi>Divine Service:</hi> But he takes
him up with this short and peremptory
answer, <hi>If any man seem to be contentious,
we have no such custom, neither the Churches
of God, i. e.</hi> In things neither morally
good nor evil (as few external Rites are)
the practice of the Church is the warrant
of their lawfulness, and reason of their
decency; and that is satisfaction enough
to any sober and peaceable mind: And
he that shall refractorily persist to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
it, must be treated as a disturber of
the Peace, <hi>i. e.</hi> pitied and punished, as
are all other turbulent and seditious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
When mens Consciences are so
squeamish or so humorsome, as that they
will rise against the Customs and Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Church they live in, she must
scourge them into order, and chastise
them, not so much for their fond perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as for their troublesome peevishness.
And this use of the <hi>Churches Rods</hi> and
<hi>Censures,</hi> is so absolutely necessary, that
it is the only effectual way to preserve her
from Factions and Contentions; not only
because upon this sort of men softer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
can make no impressions, but also
because, if we remove the limits and
boundaries of Discipline, there will be
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64701:186"/>
no end of the follies and frenzies of brain-sick
People: And when they are once
let loose, who then can set bounds to
the wildnesses of <hi>Godly Madness?</hi> For
this we have too clear a proof in the fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
practices of our Modern Sectaries,
who, when they had inflamed their little
Zeal against the Ceremonial Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Church, ran themselves into
all manner of wild and extravagant
gestures: They measured the <hi>simplicity</hi>
of Christs Worship by its opposition to
all the Rules of <hi>Decency;</hi> all Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Order were unwarrantable Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Traditions of Men; all Custom
was <hi>Superstition,</hi> and all Discipline was
<hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Antichristian.</hi> Novelty, how
uncouth and fantastick soever, was their
only Rule of Decency; and every Sect
distinguished it self from all others, by
some affected and new-fangled singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>And from hence it is, that it is so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary, that Governors injoin
matters of no great moment, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in themselves, thereby to avoid
the evils that would naturally attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their being not injoined; so that, when
they are determined, though perhaps
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64701:186"/>
they are not of any great use to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
in themselves, yet they have
at least this considerable usefulness, as
to prevent many great mischiefs, that
would probably follow from their being
not determined: And therefore the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of all such Laws is to be valued, not
so much by the nature of the things that
the Law commands, as by the mischiefs
and evil effects, that it prevents or redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And thus the main decency of Order
and Uniformity in Divine Worship lies
not so properly in the positive use of the
Rites themselves, as in the prevention of
all the indecencies of Confusion; which
could never be avoided, if there were
not some peculiar Rites positively deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
So that the Law we see may be
absolutely necessary, when the thing it
commands is but meerly indifferent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some things necessary cannot be
obtained, but by some things indifferent:
As in our present case, there is an absolute
necessity there should be Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
in Publick Worship, but Order
and Decency there cannot be without
the determination of some indifferent &amp;
particular Circumstances; because, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man were left to his own fancy and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:64701:187"/>
humor, there could be no remedy against
eternal Follies and Confusions: So that
it is in general necessary that some cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
be determined, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
no one particular circumstance can
be necessary; yet when any one is singled
out by Authority, it gains as absolute a
necessity, as if it were so antecedently;
because though the thing it self be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
yet the Order and Decency of
Publick Worship is not: Which yet can
never be provided for, but by determining
either this or some other Ceremony as
perfectly indifferent and arbitrary. And
now upon the result of these particulars,
I leave it first to Publick Authority to
consider, whether it be not a wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wise piece of good nature, to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
&amp; indulgent to these <hi>poor tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences?</hi>
And then. I leave it to all the
World to judge, Whether ever any
Church or Nation in the World has been
so wofully disturbed upon such slender
and frivolous pretences as ours?</p>
            <p>And thus have I at length finished what
I designed and undertook, <hi>i. e.</hi> I have
proved the absolute necessity of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mens Consciences and Perswasions in
Matters of Religion, &amp; the unavoidable
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64701:187"/>
dangers of tolerating, or keeping up
Religious Differences; have shewn, that
there is not the least possibility of setling
a Nation, but by Uniformity in Religious
Worship; that Religion may, and must
be governed by the same Rules, as all
other Affairs &amp; Transactions of Humane
life; and that nothing can do it but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Laws, nor they neither, unless se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
executed. And so I submit it to
the consideration of Publick Authority,
and am but little doubtful of the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of all that are friends to Peace and
Government. But whatever the event
may prove to others, it is not a little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
that I reap to my self, in reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon that Candor and Integrity, I
have used through the whole Discourse:
In that, as I have freely and impartially
represented the most serious result of
mine own thoughts; so withal have I
been not a little solicitous, not to baulk
any thing material in the Controversie;
have encountred all their most weighty
and considerable Objections, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
all manner of escapes and subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges,
and have not waved any thing,
because it was too hard to be answered;
though some things I have, because too
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64701:188"/>
easie. And upon review of the whole,
I have confidence (perhaps it may be
boldness) enough to challenge the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if he will but be as ingenuous as he
ought, to be as severe as he will; and in
defiance to all Enemies of Peace and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
of what Name or Sect soever,
to conclude all in the words of <hi>Pilate</hi> to
the turbulent <hi>Iews, What I have written,
I have written.</hi>
