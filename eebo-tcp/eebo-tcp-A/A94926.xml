         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

RELATION
Of the whole matters concerning the proceedings
of ſeveral Councels of War, againſt <hi>W. Tompſon,</hi> a free Commoner
of <hi>England,</hi> which may ſerve for a refutation to a ſcandalous paper,
entituled,
The Vindication of Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and Commiſſary
General <hi>Ireton,</hi> and the late proceedings againſt the ſaid <hi>William Tompſon</hi>
at White-hall, where he remains priſoner; now publiſhed

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ree Commoners of <hi>England,</hi> I ſtand condemned to die, and
may in probability in ſhort time appear in the preſence of
that juſt and impartiall God, who knows the ſecrets of all
hearts, to give an account of the truth of all my actions, and
real intentions. And I deſire his mercy no otherwiſe, then
according to the truth of this relation, and therefore I rip up
my own infirmities, becauſe I aim at the truth, rather then juſtification. To
undeceive thoſe whom partial and untrue diſcoveries may have beguiled into
a belief: not nothing ſhort of death, can ſatisfie thoſe unparallel'd wicked
actions of late laid to my charge. Therefore I ſhall begin with the diſcovery
of my folly about <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, 1647. I was at the <hi>Oſtrich</hi> Inne (not in the
night, as is falſly ſuggeſted) in <hi>Colebrook,</hi> by invitation of my Landlord,
where with one M <hi>Cole</hi> I plaid at Tables for two pints of wine: And having
plaid for the ſame wine, we did agree to play five games at Tick-tack for
five ſhillings, which he wonne, and received of me; and then we agreed to
play another game, as before: In the middle of which game M. <hi>Cole</hi> plaid
foul; upon which I took up the ſtakes, and after ſome diſcourſe he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
his errour; I returned his ſtake to him again, and he promiſing to
play forth the game, I laid down a twenty ſhilling piece of my own, which
he immediately took up, and affirmed he had five ſhillings in the ſaid piece
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125646:2"/>
(I reaſoning with him) he called the Vintner, and told him he had five
ſhillings in the ſaid piece, which the ſaid Vintner affirmed, though he was
ignorant of the whole matter, upon which occaſion we begun the quarrel,
but I by force wreſted my piece out of his hand, though they were both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me. Then the Miſtres of the houſe with other ſervants, came preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the room, where we were, which alſo fell upon me, ſo that I was
much abuſed, and thrown down there, being ſo many upon me; I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
I was conſtrained to kick, and uſe ſuch means I could to free my ſelf,
as I ſay upon the ground, which the Authour of the <hi>Vindication</hi> was pleaſed
to call kicking the Miſtres of the houſe on the face, which I am altogether
ignorant of, when I was free, and being enraged, and in the heat of my
bloud (I confeſſe) fetcht my Rapier, my man, and one of my fellow-ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to aſſiſt me, and went to the ſaid Inne, and asked for the Vintner, and
the ſaid <hi>Cole,</hi> at which time paſſion being on both ſides more prevalent then
reaſon, I drew my Rapier, and there were ſome blows on both ſides, and I
thinke ſome few drops of bloud was drawn, and one of them ſhewing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſcratch or prick, as if with a pin, out of which came a drop of bloud or
two; and it was alleadged by them, that I laid fellony to their charges, and
that they had taken twenty pound from me; but I preſently anſwered, That
I rather ſaid, or at leaſt intended twenty ſhillings, and never declared it to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
be any more: Which paſſion being over, I have here laid open for truths
ſake my extream folly, which I doe not ſo much as in a thought juſtifie, but
condemn, as the evil conſequence of ſo bad exp<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nce of time. But to go on
with my Relation, both parties thought themſelves abuſed, and by a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
I brought them before a Juſtice of peace nigh <hi>Colebrook,</hi> before it was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

both ſides, and upon the whole matter did finde cauſe to move the parties on both ſides,
to agree the buſineſſe amongſt themſelves, and they are agreed. Accordingly in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

Lieutenant <hi>Savage,</hi> as a Diſſenter at <hi>New-market</hi> from the engagement of the

the buſineſ freſh upon the ſtage, and went himſelf to the houſe to enquire of
it, and though in my hearing the parties in the houſe, declared they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
before a Juſtice of Peace, yet he it may be fearing the want<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſuch an
opportunity to caſt me out, procured a relation of the buſines, and himſelf
complained of it to a Councel of Warre, conſiſting of ſome of the Officers
of that Regiment. At which Councel I did declare being examined of the

Swallow</hi> Major, being preſident of the Councel, did a little enlarge himſelf in
expreſſing the great favour towards me in conſideration of that experience,
which they had of my good ſervice to the Parliament and Kingdom: then a
paper was read, to which I was required to ſet my hand, which was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of a Scandall to the houſe, which after I had peruſed, I told
them, though the difference was ended before, yet if this might put a full
period to the matter, I was willing to ſubſcribe it. The Major anſwered,
the buſineſſe was ended, upon conſideration whereof, I ſet my hand to it:
And being thus ſurprized, then the Major ſaid in theſe words, M. <hi>Tompſon,</hi>

            <p>There was a Rendezvous the next Tueſday following at <hi>Ripply</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> at
which Rendezvous there was a Muſter, but the Marſhall having no order,
brought me not thither, but I was put forth the Muſter Roll, and another
Muſtered in my place: and my man in actuall ſervice in the Troop, was alſo
denied the Muſter, though there were ſome arguments uſed by the Troop in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125646:3"/>
my behalf to be Muſtered, yet it could not be granted; yet though they deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me the priviledge of a Soldier, I was continued in the Marſhals hands,
ſome ſixteen or ſeventeen daies; after which time the Marſhall received an
order to diſmiſſe me, under the Majors hand; upon the receipt of this order,
I went to the Troop, and lookt upon my ſelf in the condition of a Soldier,
till the ſentence was executed upon me: but having ſome diſcourſe with the
Major, my Captain, and other Officers about it, they told me I was caſhiered
the Rendezvous aforeſaid; then I demanded a reaſon of my impriſonment,
ſince that time, they not being able to give me any reaſon, knowing that they
had either wrong'd me in not Muſtering me as a Soldier, or elſe in keeping
me in priſon, not being in the condition of a Soldier; Yet they manifeſted
much bitterneſſe in their hearts againſt me, by menacing words; and withall,

               </gap>ſſe of the Regiment: yet I told them I ſhould look upon my ſelf
in the condition of a Soldier, untill their own ſentence was executed upon
me; in which time I received an order from my Captain, to depart the
Quarters of his Troop: but I returned him anſwer, untill ſuch time as the
ſentence was executed, I ſhould look upon my ſelf in the condition of a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
and ſo ſubſcribe my ſelf to be under his command, to doe my duty in my
place: So I continued in the Quarters of the Troop, untill ſuch time as there
was a Rendezvous at <hi>Odium,</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> the Colonell being there, ſome of
the Troop moved him concerning my buſines, after much debate, alleadging
ſome things in my own behalf, <hi>viz.</hi> The teſtation under the Juſtices hand, and
the Generals own order made at <hi>Northampton,</hi> and my impriſonment by them,
and denying to muſter me: The Colonell told me, I might appeal to the
Councell of Warre, at the Head-Quarters, if I conceived the Regimentall
Councell had done me any wrong: I anſwered, I thought that remedy would
be worſe then the diſeaſe, being that I muſt accuſe the whole Councel, I could
expect little remedy there: ſo with other arguments, did preſſe him earneſtly
to take it into his ſerious conſideration; after al which diſcourſe, the Colonel
drew forth the Troop, and read a Letter that came from the Generall, in the
behalf of Lieutenant <hi>Savage</hi> before mentioned, to be re-admitted into the
Troop: but the Troop d<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

that in caſe they would accept of the Lieutenant, they ſhould have
<hi>Tompſon</hi> to be their Corporall as formerly; in all which time I ſpake not a

               <hi>The Vindication, &amp;c.</hi> Therfore you may ſee my offence was not in it ſelf
unpardonable, in caſe the Troop would have accepted of the ſaid Lieutenant,
but the Troop preſſing to have a legall triall for both, and ſaid that was all
they deſired. The Colonell being offended with the Troop that they would
not accept of his proffer, went from them, but withall promiſed a legall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

but a queſtion was asked him, how I ſhould doe for Quarters in the
mean time? The Colonell ordered I ſhould Quarter with the Troop, but he
departing the Field, the Major with other Officers of the Regiment, called me
unto them in the head of the Regiment, and commanded me to diſmount, I
replied my Horſe was my own, and if he pleaſed he might pull me down, but
he went on and cauſed the ſentence of caſhierment to be executed in the head
of the Regiment; after the execution whereof, I did not eſteem my ſelf (nor
of right was) a Soldier of the Army. Yet conceiving my ſelf extreamly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
in my reputation, I did declare in the head of the Regiment my inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
to the Liberty and Freedomes of <hi>England,</hi> and theirs and my fidelity to
the Army, not as is ſcandalouſly ſuggeſted, to perſwade the Soldiers to reſiſt
their Officers, I not ſpeaking any thing to that effect, but to clear my ſelf of
that ſeeming guilt, which caſhierment might have caſt upon me.</p>
            <p>After this being no Souldier, I repaired to my own ordinary occaſions,
leaving the Army within three or four daies at the moſt: But I dare ſpeak
in the face of the World, That I challenged not the exerciſe of my Office af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that time; being after this for ſundry weeks about my own bu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ineſſe, as a

difference concerning the Engagements for the Peoples Freedomes, and I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confeſſe, an abſolute diſſatisfaction in me of the ruling part of the Army,
which conſtrained me to act contrary to their proceedings; and I went down
to Colonell <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> Regiment, when they were in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and carried
with me the Agreement of the People, and ſome other papers, and declared in
the head of that Regiment (not as Merſenary Soldiers, but as free-born Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen)
to Colonell <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and the reſt of the Officers and Soldiers
my full diſlike of the preſent actions then in the Army, and finding an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the ſaid Colonell and his Officers, I more particularly applyed my
ſelfe to the Souldiers and Agitators, as having a Letter directed unto them
from ſome free-men of <hi>England,</hi> which was read in the head of the Regiment,
but Colonell <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and his Officers, did endeavour to diſſwade the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
from hearkening unto any thing that ſhould be ſpoken, though never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
for the preſervation of themſelves and the Kingdome, for that onely
was purely and ſimply my end in whatſoever I delivered unto them, yet did

not appear amongſt them as an Ad<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

our diſcourſe it was queſtioned, what I was, and from whence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I came, It was
anſwered by ſome that did know me well, That I did belong to Colonell
<hi>Whalies</hi> Regiment, and this was the ſumme of what paſt concerning that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
to my beſt remembrance. Then after the Rendezvous at <hi>Kingſton,</hi> I
came to Captain <hi>Pitchford,</hi> and deſired of him a Certificate for the time, how
long I had been under his command, but his anſwer was he could not untill
he ſpake with the Colonell, ſo he appointed me the next day to waite upon
him, which I did accordingly, and at <hi>Kingſton</hi> we met with the Colonel, but
when he ſee me, all that he ſaid unto me, was only this, He commit thee, with
ſome other menacing words, and would not admit me to ſpeake one word
for my ſelfe; The Marſhall not being in town, he gave expreſſe command to

their pay, which he hath received for them; who lives now at the Star in
<hi>Cheap-ſide)</hi> and his Cornet forthwith to carry me to <hi>Windſor,</hi> to the Marſhall
Generall, which was accordingly done that night without any warrant, or
expreſſing any cauſe: within four or five daies the Colonell with ſome other
Officers gave in Depoſitions againſt me, which to this day I never ſee; out of
which <hi>Henry Wealey</hi> Judge-Advocate, Brother to Colonell <hi>Whale,</hi> drew up a
charge againſt me, under this notion, <hi>Articles exhibited againſt</hi> William Tomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>now or lately Corporall in Captain</hi> Pitchfords <hi>Troop, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Councell of War was called, where Commiſſary Generall <hi>Ireton</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
for the tryall of my cauſe? Unto which Articles, I returned an anſwer,
being no member of the Army, from the place where I lived, declaring my
ſelfe to be a free Commoner of <hi>England,</hi> and no Souldier, according to the
Sentence of the Regimentall Counſell againſt me: and further I declared,
That they had no legall power of queſtioning me for any regall or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Crime whatſoever; And I appeale unto the civill Law as my legall and
compedent Judge: I manifeſted my ſelfe to be ready to anſwer any charge
that ſhall be lawfully fyled againſt me, according to the juſtice of the ſame
Law. But after much Interrogation to prove me a Souldier, at laſt it was put
to the vote in that Counſell, but was carried in the negative, That I was no
Souldier; yet I was continued in the Marſhals cuſtody ſtill as priſoner, but
when they could not proſecute againſt me under the notion of a Souldier,
they drew up another Charge againſt me, under the Notion of a Spie,
and a ſeditious perſon, fomenting diſtractions in the Army; unto which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
an anſwer, ſomething ſutable to my anſwer to their firſt Charge: and
withall declaring, that I conceiving thoſe Articles were more envious then
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125646:4"/>
good, or proceeding from a ſound and Chriſtian judgement, and withall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
reparation for my unjuſt impriſonment: at this Councell, Lieut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> was Preſident, The whole buſineſſe was fully ſcand and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
with redoubled queſtions of interrogatories, but I keeping cloſe to my
firſt principle, they ceaſe to paſſe any ſentence at all upon me, but only refer
the buſineſſe to the Generall, under the notion of their great favour and love
towards me, by my Colonels means and others in the Councell, who ſpake
much in my behalf: their advice to me was, That there was no way for me,
but to caſt my ſelf down at the Generals feet by way of Petition, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
my errour in appealing to the Civill Power for the triall of my cauſe,
And the Judge-Advocate Sir <hi>Hardres Waller,</hi> with others, told me if they
ſhould refer me to the Parliament, it would be my ruine, but I having much
diſcourſe with moſt of the Officers at the Head-Quarters, and could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no ſatisfaction in my conſcience, I could not petition: So I went to the
General, and deſired to know his Excellencies pleaſure concerning my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement,
but he giving me no full anſwer, I went to the Lieutenant General,
declaring the whole nature of the buſineſſe unto him, who at that time ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much to be affected with my relation, and appointed me to wait upon him
the next day, which I did accordingly, but he told me he could doe nothing
in my buſineſſe, ſo I askt him leave for two or three daies to ſupply my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
which he granted me, I promiſing to returne again as priſoner;
which accordingly I did, and was with the Judge-Advocate, and the Marſhals
deputy; and there rendred up my ſelf as before a priſoner, and lay two nights
in the ſame bed with my fellow priſoner; in which time, I delivered incloſed
in a letter to Maſter <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> the Generals Secretary to be delivered
to his Excellency, my plea and proteſt againſt the proceedings of his
Councel of Warre againſt mee. In which I gave his Excellency to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
therein, that I acknowledge in them no juriſdiction over me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a free Commoner, and that I would uſe all means, I could for my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<note n="a" place="margin">Which ſaid plea and proteſt is ſince printed, &amp; alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52. pages of Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Iohn Lilburns</hi> late book, called, <hi>The peoples Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>

him with what I heard: after much diſcourſe I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him, he then was ſo farre from impriſoning me, that
he was pleaſed to promiſe me many courteſies concerning my
Arrears and other things, and appointed me to that end to wait upon him

at ſome other time, which accordingly I did. And likewiſe ſeverall times
met the Marſhal General, and had ſome diſcourſe with him, and told him, I

connfdent alſo, that Commiſſary General <hi>Ireton</hi> was not ignorant of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus publike for many weeks together about <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-hall, where I
ſpake with Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwell</hi> two or three times, who was ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
ready to ſerve me, according to his former expreſſions, but upon the
26. of <hi>February,</hi> I being about my lawfull occaſions at the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

me; and leaving me in the cu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tody of the afore-ſaid Guard, commanded an
Enſign with a file of Musketeers, who by violence and force of Arms, carried
me priſoner to <hi>White-hall,</hi> without producing or alleadging any thing againſt
me, but the bare Command of Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> where I was
continued in the Marſhal Generals cuſtody, till <hi>Febr.</hi> 1. before any thing was
laid to my Charge: upon which day I was called before a Councel of War
in <hi>White-hall,</hi> where the General was preſent, with ſeverall other of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Officers, I being called into the Councel, I demeaned my ſelf with all
civillity and reſpect, as they were Gentlemen, but withall declared, that I
could not in the leaſt ſubmit unto them, as a Court having power to take
Cognizance of any reall or ſuppoſed crime that could be laid to my charge,
being by their own Votes no Member of the Army; but I declared, That
if they had any thing to lay to my Charge, the ordinary Courts of Juſtice
were all open and free, where I ſhould be ready to anſwer what could be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
objected againſt me: but they not regarding what I ſaid in this nature,
went on to proceed againſt me, according to Marſhall law, though it is now
a time of Peace. They asked me ſeveral Queſtions concerning my letter
and my plea, which at <hi>Windſor</hi> was delivered to the General, and whether I
would own it or no? I declared, I did own it as my Act, and give it in, as
my ultimate reſolution; but Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> asked me, if I
was a Gentleman free Commoner, which I took as a jeer, and asked him, if
that the word free Commoner was become a deriſion amongſt them that did
pretend to be a Court of Juſtice? Upon which he called me a mutinous fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and began to make an Apology for himſelf, concerning taking me from

time he ſee me ſince I had run from <hi>Windſor;</hi> but I going to make an anſwer
to what he ſpake, he bid me hold my tongue: The Iudge-Advocate began to
reade my Proteſt, ſo at preſent I was deprived to give him an anſwer; but
when the Judge-Advocate had made an end of reading, I told him of his
great miſtake, as is before mentioned, concerning his firſt time of his meeting
with me, then he told me, I was not ſo good as my word, in not keeping on
my Hat according to my proteſt, I anſwered there was no time paſt, but that
I might perform my promiſe in that particular: then turning to the Generall
told him, I had nothing more to declare unto them then what I had already
ſaid, ſo I ſhould humbly take my leave.</p>
            <p>So going towards the door, I put on my hat, but <hi>Richard Laurence</hi> Marſhall
Generall, in the preſence of his Excellency and the Councell, ſtruck me a box
on the eare, and alſo ſtruck off my hat, and laid violent hands upon me; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which I manifeſted my ſelfe more reſolvedly, declaring them to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
deſtroyers of the Lawes and liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo were become the
greateſt Apoſtates in the World; for they had declared to preſerve the Lawes
and liberties as aforeſaid, in all their Engagements and Remonſtrances, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
to the view of the Kingdome, upon which I threw <hi>Magna-charta</hi> and the
<hi>Petition of Right</hi> upon the Table before them, then preſently Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<hi>Cromwell</hi> commanded I ſhould be taken away and laid in Irons, and I
was preſently forced into a little room nearby, where I continued with a
guard upon me; but within ſome few hours I was called to come into the
Court but I denyed to go, ſaying, That I could not be ſo much a traitor to my
own and the Kingdoms liberties, as to betray them into the hands of tyrants;
and further I ſaid, My legs ſhould not be ſo much ſerviceable to my body as to
carry me: But notwithſtanding this, the Marſhals men told me, If I would
not goe, they muſt carry me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo I being not able to reſiſt their power by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their ſtrength, I reſolved to manifeſt my integrity to my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<hi>Freedom</hi> by being meerly <hi>paſſive</hi> in their hands, whereupon I ſet me down,
and they carried me by the legs and armes before the Generall, and as they
brought me, ſo I lay: then Commiſſary Generall <hi>Ireton</hi> begun to aske me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
queſtions; but I replyed, I ſcorn'd to anſwer him in the leaſt to betray
my liberty as aforeſaid; and withall declared, I was meerly in their hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were ſtronger then I, even in the ſame nature of Theeves and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers:
But he continued in asking me queſtions as I lay upon the floor, I
ſtoping my ears, &amp; deni'd to hear them, they carried me back in the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as they brought me in; after ſome two or three hours, I was cal'd in again
to go hear my ſentence, but I being paſſive, they, carried me in as before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned;
but the General then was gone, I was commanded to ſtand up, but I told
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125646:7"/>
them, That I was unwilling my legs ſhould bear me to ſtand before them: but
by force I was holden up, then I ſtopt my eares, they commanded my hands
ſhould be pulled from my ears, then I ſaid unto them, They might murder
me if they would, for I was in their power. And I further ſaid I ſcorn'd their
mercy, and deſpiſed their cruelty, for it was all one to me to die by a ſword,
bullet, or halter from them, as from a common enemy; while I was thus
ſpeaking, the Judge-Advocate read three Articles of War, the firſt was, That
no man ſhall utter any words of ſedition or uproare, upon pain of death. The
ſecond was, That no man ſhould ſtay above three daies in the Army, except he
was actually liſted in ſome Troop or Company, upon pain of death. The
third was, That no man ſhall contemne the Court when they are ſitting in
Court of Juſtice, upon pain of death: he further ſaid, The Councel had found
me guilty of thoſe three Articles, and I muſt die for it, and the Councell had
done me ſo much favour, as I ſhould be ſhot to death. I anſwered in theſe
words, Be it known unto you that I ſcorn to beg favour at your hands, or to
petition for my life, I ſaid my bloud would be required at their hands; then
the Lieutenant Generall asked me, by whom, I ſaid ſurely the Righteous God
will revenge the guilt of innocent bloud: but then they expreſſed their great
ſorrow for me, I anſwered, I did not value their ſorrow, but wiſht them to be
ſorrow for themſelves, and be carefull to keep their heads on their ſhoulders;
and withall I ſaid unto them, That the God whom I ſerved, would make me
able and alſo willing to be caſt into the hotteſt fiery-furnace, that they could
provide for me, rather then I ſhould ſtoop or kneel in the leaſt, unto that
Image which they endeavour to ſet up; thereby to betray the Liberties and
Freedomes of my deareſt Country, in the hands of Tyrants and oppreſſors;
Then Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> commanded that I ſhould be kept cloſe
priſoner, and that I ſhould not be admitted to have either pen, inke or paper;
which was accordingly obeyed. The Marſhal-General gave command that I
ſhould be caſt into the low priſon, and to be laid in Irons. Yet they have not
allowed one farthing of maintenance ſince the time of my firſt impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thus curteous Reader I have given you a clear and impartiall relation of
the ſubſtance of all that ever was objected or alleadged againſt me, from the
beginning untill this preſent day; in which I have not in the leaſt endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to clear my ſelf from the fruits of infirmity or paſſion. But as for the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
fixed upon me in the later end of that paper, called, <hi>The Vindication,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
my communicating of other mens goods and doing what I will, I
conceived ariſeth from my own folly in the quarrel, at the firſt ſpoken of; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
my life may not be meaſured by one ſimple action; for ſuch contentious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125646:7"/>
as aforeſaid, are certainly rather from paſſion, then ſolid reaſon, and yet I
might probably live: if one without ſin or folly were to throw the firſt ſtone
at me, I have not in the leaſt endeavoured to throw dirt upon any, but give
a clear and full relation of the whole buſineſſe, though in many particulars
againſt my ſelf; for which if I have deſerved puniſhment, I deſire to ſuffer it
in a lawfull way. If any ſhall queſtion the truth of this relation, I deſire my
life ſhould depend upon no ſurer foundation, then the truth hereof.</p>
