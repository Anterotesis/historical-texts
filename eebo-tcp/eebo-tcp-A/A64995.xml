            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>OVr Saviour sent an Epistle
from heaven to the Church of
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> wherein he reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her because she had left her first love,
and threatneth the Removal of her
Candlestick, that he would take away
her light, if she did not recover her
Love. By the same hand at the same
time he sent another Epistle to the
Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> wherein he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
her Lukewarmness, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
because she was neither hot nor
cold, he would spue her out of his
mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4, 5. &amp; 3. 15, 16.
And are Christians in <hi>England</hi> under
no such sin, in no such danger? when
some scoff at the flames of love to
Christ, like dogs that bark at the
Moon so far above them; when the
most nominal Christians are wholly
strangers to this Love, whatever their
notional knowledge be; the former
<pb facs="tcp:43848:3"/>
looking upon it as but a fancy, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having it onely in the Theory: and
when amongst those Christians who
love Christ in sincerity, there are so
few that know what it is to Love
Christ with fervour and ardency:
when there is so General a decay of
Love to Christ in the Land, Lord what
is like to become of <hi>England?</hi> Have
we not provoked the Lord to take away
our Candlestick, to suffer the worse
than <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkenes to over spread
us again, and cover our Light, because
it shineth with such cold beams, because
the Light of Knowledge in the head is
accompanied with so little warmth of
Love to Christ in the hearts of most
Christians? Every one will fetch water
to quench fire in a general confl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
&amp; surely there is need in a day of
such General decay of Love to Christ,
that some should fetch fire, fire from
heaven, &amp; use bellows too, Arguments
I mean, to enkindle and blow up the
spark of Love to Christ, which seems
<pb facs="tcp:43848:3"/>
so ready to expire. Reader, The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
discourse concerning the True
Christians Love of the unseen Christ,
is not finely spun, and curiously woven
with neatnesses of wit and language;
it is not flourished and set off with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Metaphors, Hyperbolies, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical
Elegancies, or Poetical Fancies
and fragments; it is not adorned and
fringed with the specious show of many
Marginal Quotations, excerpted out
of divers Authors; The discourse is
plain, but the Author hath endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that it might be warm, his design be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more to advance his Master than
Himself in thy esteem; and if he have
less of thy praise, so his Lord may have
more of thy love, his great end is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
The chief part of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
concerning the love of Christ
is Application, and about two thirds
of it Exhortation (there being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in this knowing age more need of
excitation than information) where
thou hast variety of arguments &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb facs="tcp:43848:4"/>
to stir up and provoke unto the
love of Christ, together with divers
directions how to attain this love in
the truth and strength of it, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the strength of love to Christ should
evidence it self. There is also an appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix
added for further encouragement
unto the love of Christ, concerning
Christs manifestation of himself unto
such as love him. The whole discourse
is practical, nothing in it controversal;
not only Protestants, but Papists too
will verbally acknowledge the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Christians have to love
Christ, and none will oppose this that
are true Christians, none but Turks,
Infidels and Devils are professedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. That this little Book may be
blessed by the Lord to be a means to
warm and inflame thine heart with
love to the unseen Christ, is the earnest
prayer of</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t very much in our love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ. Without Love unto
Christ, we are as much without Spiritual
Life, as a Carkass when the Soul is fled
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43848:5"/>
from it, is without Natural Life. Faith
without Love to Christ, is a dead Faith;
and a Christian without Love to Christ, is
a dead Christian; dead in Sins and Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes.
Without Love to Christ, we
may have the Name of Christians, but we
are wholly without the Nature: we may
have the Form of Godliness, but are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without the Power. <hi>Give me thine Heart,</hi>
is the language of God to all the Chrildren
of Men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 26. And <hi>Give me thy
Love,</hi> is the language of Christ unto all his
Disciples.</p>
            <p>Christ knoweth the command and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which Love to him, in the Truth and
Strength of it, hath: How it will Engage
all the other Affections of his Disciples for
Him; that if he have their Love, their
Desires will be chiefly after Him; their
Delights will be chiefly in Him, their
Hopes and Expectations will be chiefly
from Him; their Hatred, Fear, Grief, Anger,
will be carried forth chiefly unto Sin, as
it is Offensive unto Him. He knows that
Love will Engage and Employ, for him
all the Powers and Faculties of their Souls;
their Thoughts will be brought into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
and Obedience unto Him; their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
will be employed in Seeking
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43848:5"/>
and Finding out his Truths; their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
will be Receptacles to retain them;
their Conscience will be ready to Accuse
and Excuse as his Faithfull Deputies; their
Wills will Choose and Refuse according to
his Direction and Revealed Pleasure. All
their Senses and the Members of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
will be his Servants: their Eyes will
See for him, their Ears will Hear for him,
their Tongues will Speak for him, their
Hands will Work for him, their Feet will
Walk for him: All their Gifts and T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lents
will be at his Devotion and Service. If
he have their Love, they will be ready to
Do for him what he requireth; they will
be ready to Suffer for him, whatever he
calleth them unto: If they have much Love
to him, they will not think much of Deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves; taking up his Cross and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him wherever he leadeth them, love
to Christ then being so Essential unto true
Christianity, so earnestly look'd for by our
Lord and Master, so Powerfully Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Soul and over the whole Man, so
Greatly Influential on Duty; I have made
choice of this subject of <hi>Love to Christ,</hi> to
Treat on; and my chief Endeavor herein
shall be to Excite and Provoke Christians
unto the Lively and Vigorous Exercise of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43848:6"/>
this Grace of Love unto the Lord Jesus
Christ; of which Incentives, there is a Great
and Universal need.</p>
            <p>The Epistle wherein my Text lyeth,
was written by <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle of the
Circumcision, and is directed to the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
scattered throughout <hi>Pontus, Galatia,
Cappadocia, Asia</hi> and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thynia,</hi> as in the
first <hi>v.</hi> of this Chapter. By these Strangers
we are to understand the scattered <hi>Iews,</hi>
who were Strangers in these several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
where they did Inhabit. We read in
the 2d of the <hi>Acts</hi> that there came up many
of these <hi>Iews,</hi> from these and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
unto <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to Worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in
the temple hearing the Apostles speak with
divers Tongues, which were of use in the
divers places where they did live, and that
without Instruction from Man, but as the
Spirit gave them utterance; they were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
and Confounded: and afterward
hearing <hi>Peter</hi> preach, through the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Power of the Spirit, three thousand
of them were Converted by one Sermon
unto the Christian Faith, and added to the
Christian Church. When the Feast of
Pentecost was over, these Converted <hi>Iews</hi>
returned into their Countries where their
several Dwellings, Families and Callings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43848:6"/>
were: which Countries being Heathenish
and Idolatrous, no doubt but there they
met with Opposition and Suffering upon
the account of the Christian Religion which
they became Zealous Professors of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what they endured from their own
Countreymen, or Unconverted I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ws who
hated Christianity more than the Heathens
did. The Apostle doth seem to have a
respect unto these in this Epistle, wherein
he doth encourage them under their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for the sake of Christ by many Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
Arguments. In the 2d <hi>v.</hi> he wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that Grace and Peace might be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in them and towards them, and then
though their Sufferings did abound, their
Consolations would abound much more.
In the 3d 4th and 5th <hi>ver.</hi> He blesseth God
for his abundant Mercy towards them in
begetting them unto a lively Hope of the
glorious and never fading Heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which was reserved for them through
Gods Infinite Grace, and unto which they
were reserved and kept through Faith by
Gods infinite power. In the 6th and 7th
<hi>verses,</hi> he telleth them, however they
were in heaviness through manifold Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that is Afflictions, which are the
Worlds left-hand Temptations; yet he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43848:7"/>
giveth them to understand that these afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they were but for a season; weeping
may endure for a night, but joy cometh
in the morning; they were but needful to
humble them, to purifie them, to crucifie
them to the world, to make them conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their head the Lord Jesus Christ,
and that they were for the tryal of their
faith, that the truth of it might appear both
to themselves and others, and that the
worth of it might appear how much more
precious than Gold when it is tryed in the
Fire, which carrying them thorow their
sufferings, might be found both to their
own praise and their Masters honour, at
the appearing of Jesus Christ: and then
the Apostle doth take occasion in the text
to speak of their Love which they did bear
unto this Jesus Christ, and of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
and glorious joy, which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
from believing in him although they
had no sight of him, which no trouble or
affliction could overwhelm or hinder.
<hi>Whom having not seen ye love, in whom
though now ye see him not, yet believing ye
rejoyce with joy unspeakable and full of
Glory.</hi> Hence observe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That it is the Property and duty
of true Christians to Love Iesus Christ
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43848:7"/>
whom they have never seen. Whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not seen ye Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That true Christians do Believe
in an unseen Christ. In whom though
now ye see Him not, yet believing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. That true Christians do or may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in Believing with unspeakable and
glorious joy. In whom, though now ye
see him not, yet Believing ye rejoice with
Ioy unspeakable and full of Glory.</p>

               <p>1. Concerning true Christians whose
property it is to love Jesus Christ whom
they have never seen, <hi>whom having not
seen yee love, ye love,</hi> that is, ye who are
true Christians, who are so in reality as
well as profession; and of these true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
that do love Christ, the Apostle doth
give a description in the 2d. <hi>ver.</hi> where he
calls them, <hi>Elect according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
of God the Father, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience,
and sprinkling of the blood of Iesus Christ.</hi>
True Christians are Elect according to the
foreknowledge of God the Father, they are
such whom God according to the Councel
of his own will, according to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and grace, did choose from all Eternity
to be a holy and peculiar people to himself,
to glorifie him here on Earth, and that they
might be glorifyed by him hereafter in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And this election doth evidence it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43848:8"/>
self in the Sanctification of the Spirit, true
Christians are sanctified being separated
and set apart from the rest of the world, for
Gods use and service: God hath sealed them
for himself, and hereby distinguished them
from all others, the Motto of which seal
is this, <hi>Holiness unto the Lord.</hi> See a descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them in this respect, 2 Tim. 2. 21.
<hi>If any man purge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall be a vessel unto Honour, sanctifyed
and meet for the Masters use, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto every good work:</hi> they are purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the defilement of sin, which doth
pollute and dishonor them, they are ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
unto honour, like those of Silver and
Gold in a great house, which are adorned
with Pearls and precious stones; they are
adorned with all sanctifying graces, which
are of more worth than the richest Jewels;
and hereby they are both beautiful in
Gods eye, and they are made meet for
Gods use, being hereby prepared and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
unto every good work. This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
prays for in the behalf of the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,
1 Thess. 5. 23. And the very God
of peace sanctifie you wholly, and I pray
God your whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body
be preserved blamelesse unto the coming of
our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> True Christians
are sanctifyed wholly, in their whole man,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43848:9"/>
though they be not sanctified thorowly:
they are sanctified in every part, though
they are not sanctified in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
Their whole Spirit is sanctified that
is the higher faculties of the soul, namely
the understanding and the will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
are enlightned by the Spirit
unto a Spiritual discerning both of good
and evil, beyond what any natural man
doth o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n unto; their wills are
bowed, or rather rectified, and made
straight, being enclined unto God and his
Law. Their Souls are sanctified in the
inferior faculties, in all the affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
both to the concupiscible and the
irrascible appetite; their liking affections
of love, desire, delight and hope are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and Christ and things above;
their disliking affections of hatred, fear,
grief and anger are towards sin. Their
bodies also are sanctifyed being made
members of Christ, and instruments of
Righteousness; their eyes, ears, tongues,
hands, feet and every part being devoted
to God and made use of for his glory;
Thus true Christians are sanctified by the
spirit. And they are sanctified unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the graces which are wrought by the
spirit in their hearts, do appear in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of their lives; the course of their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43848:9"/>
lives in a course of obedience unto the laws
of Christ: they are sanctified unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and they are sanctified unto sprinkling
of the blood of Jesus Christ; God hath set
them apart to be sprinkled with the blood

               <p>Secondly COncerning the object of true
Christians Love, and that is
Jesus Christ whom they have never seen.
This Jesus Christ whom they love is the
Eternal Son of God, the second Person in
the glorious Trinity, who in time assumed
our Humane Nature, clothed himself with
our mortal Flesh, lived like a servant in a
mean condition, died like a malefactor the
cursed Death of the Cross, and all for
our sakes, for our sins, rose again the third
day for our Justification, ascended up into
heaven after forty days, and there is set
down at the right hand of the throne of the
Majesty on high, to make intercession for
us, and to make preparation there for our
reception, into the glorious Mansions and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43848:10"/>
Eternal Habitations, which are in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house. He is called Jesus from the
Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which signifieth <hi>to
save</hi> because <hi>he saveth his people from their
sins, Matth.</hi> 1. 21. He is called Christ
from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
to anoint, he being anointed by the
Father with the Spirit and with Power, to
be Mediator between God and Man, to
be the great Prophet, and Priest, and King,
of the Church. This Jesus Christ Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
have not seen with the eye of sense;
indeed some Christians in the primitive
times, as the Apostles who were of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and other disciples who conversed
with him frequently, did see Christ with
the eye of sense, but it was in his state of
Humiliation, when he was here upon the
Earth, not in his state of Exaltation, now
he is in Heaven; yet some have seen Christ
after his Ascention namely <hi>Paul</hi> at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and <hi>Stephen</hi> the Proto Martyr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he dyed; but none have had a
perfect sight with bodily eyes of the
Glory which is upon Christ's body, the
lustre of which is so great that none can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it in this state of weakness and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and live. But whatever sight some
Christians have had formerly, no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
now have a sight of Christ's Person;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43848:10"/>
they have heard of him with the hearing of
the Ear, but they have not seen him with
the seeing of the Eye; they have seen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
of Christ in the Sacrament,
but they have never seen his Person that is
represented; they have seen his Image
upon their Fellow-Christians, but they
have not seen the original from whom this
Image hath been drawn. Some Christians
have been in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and seen the place
where the Lord lived; and at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
and seen the place where the Lord dyed;
and Visited the place of his Sepulchre
where the Lord for a time did lye: and
they have seen the Mount whence the Lord
Ascended; but no Christians now alive
have been in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi>
which is above, to see where the Lord now
is in his Glory. It is this Jesus Christ whom
Christians have not seen, that is the Object
of their Love.</p>

               <head>Section III.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, Concerning the Love which
True Christians do bear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this unseen Christ. Love is the going
forth of the Heart unto the Object Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and the Love which True Christians
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43848:11"/>
do bear unto Jesus Christ, is a Grace
wrought by the Spirit in their hearts,
whereby upon discovery and believing
Apprehensions of Christs infinite Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Excellency, his Matchless Love
Grace and Mercy; their Hearts do go
forth towards him in Earnest desires after
Union to him, and Communion with him,
wherein they take chief Complacency;
and this accompanied with a yeilding and
dedication of themselves unto his will and
service.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Love of Christians unto Christ,
is a Grace wrought in their Hearts by the
Spirit.</hi> It is a Flower most Sweet and
Fragrant, but there is no Seed of it in the
Nature of any Man since the Fall, it is
planted in the Soul by the Spirit of God.
Love to Christ is a Divine Spark, that
comes down from above; a fire which is
kindled by the breath of the Lord, whose
Ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce is Love.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The Ground of this Love to Christ, is
the discovery and believing Apprehensions
of Christs Lovelinesse and Love.</hi> There
must be first a discovery of Christ as a suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Object for Love, and not a bare No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this, but believing apprehensions
of it, that Christ is Infinitely lovely, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatively
Excellent; and that his love is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43848:11"/>
Matchless and Transcendent towards the
Children of Men, that there is a Treasury
in him, and a Storehouse of all Graces,
and the most Needfull and Rich Supplies;
otherwise there will be no going forth of
the Heart in love unto him.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The Actings of Christians love to
Christ, is in their desires after Vnion unto,
and Communion with Christ.</hi> It is the
Nature of love to desire Union to the
Object beloved; especially of this love
to Christ: and this Union being attained,
the desires are after Communion with
Christ, Converse and Fellowship with
him; no Converse is so desirable as with
the Persons whom we most dearly love:
and this Communion being attained, there
is chief Complacency therein, the Soul
doth sweetly rest and repose it self in
Christ, and rejoyceth in his presence and
love.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The Concomitant of this Love which
True Christians have unto Christ, is a yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and dedication of themselves unto his
will and Service.</hi> Lovers do give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto those whom they love; this
accompanieth the Marriage Union: and
such as love Christ, they are Espoused and
joyned unto Christ; and they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto Christ to be his, and wholly at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43848:12"/>
his dispose, as the Wife giveth her self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the dispose of her Husband.</p>

            <div n="4" type="section">
               <head>Section IV.</head>
               <p>Fourthly, THe Fourth thing is to shew,
that it is the Property of all
true Christians, to Love this unseen Christ.
True Christians are differenced and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,
not only from all Heathens and
Infidels, but also from all bare Nominall
Christians, by their Love to Jesus Christ.
It is the Property of Covetous Persons to
love Worldly Wealth and Riches: It is
the Property of Ambitious Persons, to
love Worldly Honour and Dignities: It
is the Property of Voluptuous Persons, to
love Sensual Pleasures and Delights: And
it is the Property of True Christians to
Love Jesus Christ whom they have never
seen. None but such as are True
Christians do Love Christ, and all those
that are True Christians do love him.
The Loveliness of Christ doth appear not
to the Eye of Sense, but to the Eye of Faith;
they that do not see him with this Eye,
they cannot love him; and they that do see
him with this Eye, they cannot choose but
love him. Such as do not love Christ, it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43848:12"/>
is not because Christ wants Beauty, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are blind. Now all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
have this Eye of Faith, to discern
Christ's Excellencies; and none but True
Christians have this Eye; the Essence of
Christianity doth consist in Believing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Reason makes us Men, but Faith makes
us True Christians. It being therefore
the property of True Christians to believe,
it is their property also to love this Unseen
Christ.</p>

               <head>Section V.</head>
               <p>Fifthly, THe Fifth thing is to shew, that
it is the Duty of all True
Christians to love this unseen Christ. This
will appear if you look into <hi>John 21. 15.
16, 17. Peter</hi> was one of the boldest and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardest
of all Christs disciples, but he had
been withal too self-confident, which was
the introduction unto and laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for his fall and thrice shameful denial
of his Master; a look from his Lord put
him in remembrance, and brought him to
Repentance with bitter weeping for his
sin so soon as it was committed. After our
Saviour was risen from the dead, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
unto <hi>Peter</hi> with other of his disciples
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43848:13"/>
and in this place he asketh the same questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the same words three times, <hi>Simon
Son of Ionas, lovest thou me?</hi> Whereby
as he doth tacitly upbraid him for his great
sin in his three times denyal of him (which
had there not been a defect in his love, he
would never have done) so he doth also
give a signification that love to himself is
the great duty, and the great thing which
he doth look for in all his disciples.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>Section. VI.</head>
               <p>THe 6th. thing is to shew how Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ought to Love this unseen Christ.</p>
               <p>1. Christians ought to love Christ with
Sincerity of Love, <hi>Eph. 6. 24. Grace be
with all them that Love our Lord Iesus
Christ in Sincerity.</hi> It was the great sin
of <hi>Iudah, Ier.</hi> 3. 10. That <hi>she turned not
to the Lord with her whole heart, but feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly:</hi>
so it is a great sin to love Christ with
a feigned and hypocritical love; the love
of Christians to Christ ought to be sincere
in regard of the habit &amp; inward workings
of it, they must love him not only in show,
word, and outward profession, but their
love must be cordial in the heart and so
a love indeed and in truth: and the love of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43848:13"/>
Christians to Christ must be sincere in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the object of it, they must love
Christ for himself and not chiefly for what
they get by him; to love Christ only for
Temporal gain is hypocritical love, to love
Christ cheifly for other gain is not so spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
but to love Christ for his own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
and perfections is most sincere and
generous, this sincerity of love to Christ is
every ones duty.</p>
               <p>2. Christians ought to love Christ with
Supremacy of love, they must place him in
the highest seat of their hearts; he is a
Great King, and he looks for the Throne,
and that all Creatures should be placed
beneath him, and stand at his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool:
Math. 10. 37. <hi>He that loveth Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or Mother more than mee, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Me; he that loveth Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more than Me, is not Worthy of Me.</hi>
They are the words of our Saviour:
Christians may love Father and Mother,
the Law of God and Nature doth require
it; they may love Husband and Wife,
the Word of God enjoyneth the Husband
to love his Wife as his own Body, and as
Christ loved the Church; they may love
Sons, Daughters, Brethren, Sisters, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
Friends, yea Enemies, and they
ought to do it; yet all must be with a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43848:14"/>
love, but they must love Christ
with their chief love; otherwise they are
not worthy to stand in the Relation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples.</p>
               <p>3. Christians ought to love Christ with
Ardency of Love: Luk. 24. 32. <hi>And they
said one to another, did not our Hearts
burn within us, while he talked with us by
the Way, and while he opened to us the
Scriptures?</hi> This burning love Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled
in the heart of his Disciples, and
this burning love Christ requireth of all
Christians; <hi>Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 8. 6, 7. Love is strong
as Death, the coals thereof are coals of Fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
which hath a vehement Flame. Many
Waters cannot quench Love, neither can
the Floods drown it.</hi> Such a strong vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ardent flaming love Christians should
have unto Jesus Christ, which all the waters
of Affliction may not be able to quench,
which no Flouds of Temptations or Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
may be able to drown and ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm.
Therefore</p>
               <p>4. Christians ought to love Christ with
Constancy of Love. Having begun to
love him, they ought to continue to love
him, and to love him unto the end; as they
ought to be constant in their Obedience,
and to persevere in their other Graces; so
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43848:14"/>
they ought to be constant and to persevere
in this Grace of love to Christ.</p>

               <head>SECT. VII.</head>
               <p>Seventhly, THE Seventh thing is to
shew, why true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
do Love Christ, whom they have never
seen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rea.</hi> 1. True Christians do love Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Need which they have of him.
Men do love their Necessary Food, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which their Bodies would starve with
Hunger: Men do love their Necessary
Raiment and Habitations, without which
in Winter Seasons their Bodies would
starve with Cold. Men do love their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Friends, upon whom (under God)
they have their Dependance, and from
whom they have all their Subsistence:
But no Thing in the World, or Friend in
the World, is so Needful to the Body,
as the Lord Jesus Christ is unto the Soul:
and as the Excellencies of the Soul, are far
beyond the Excellencies of the Body; so
the Necessities of the Soul, are far beyond
the Necessities of the Body: which Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
can be answered by none but Jesus
Christ; and therefore True Christians do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43848:15"/>
love him. At first Conversion when they
were convinced of Sin, awakened out of
their carnal security, O what Need had
they, and did they see they had of Christ!
they perceived themselves to be lost, and
that it was Christ only that could save
them; they felt the Wounds of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and it was Christ only that could
Heal them; they feared the Wrath of a
Sin-revenging God, and it was Christ
only that could Deliver them. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
Reconciliation and Salvation,
which they had by Christ, did lay the first
Foundation of a most endeared love unto
Christ; And st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll they perceive a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
need of Christ, to procure daily
pardon for them, and to convey dayly
supplyes of Grace unto them. They have
Need of Christ, when they are Dark to
Enlighten them; when they are Dead to
Quicken them; when they are Streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to Enlarge them; when they are
Weak, to Strengthen them; when they
are Sad, to Comfort them; when they are
Tempted, to Succour them; when they
are Fallen, to Raise them; when they are
in Doubts, to Resolve them; when they
are under Fears, to Encourage them;
when they Stagger, to Establish them;
when they Wander, to Restore them.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43848:15"/>
Christ, and None but Christ, can do all
this, and more than this for them: and
therefore because of the need and useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, true Christians do love him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rea.</hi> 2, True Christians do love an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
Christ, because of the Loveliness of
Christ; which Loveliness though it be not
and cannot here be seen by the Eye of the
Body, yet it is evident unto the Eye of
Faith: see the Description which is given
of Christ the Beloved, by his Spouse the
Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 9. The Daughters of

Spouse, <hi>What is thy Beloved more than

my Friend O Daughters of Ierusalem.</hi>
The Spouse is here acknowledged to be
the Fairest amongst Women, and not only
by the Daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but her
Beloved, who had a more curious eye, doth
both commend her loveliness and admire
it: <hi>ch. 6. 4, 5. Thou art beautiful O my Love
as</hi> Tirzah, <hi>comely as Ierusalem: Turn away
thine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yes from me, for they have overcome
me,</hi> and <hi>ver. 10. VVho is this that looketh
forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon,
clear as the Sun, and Terrible as an Army
with Banners?</hi> But what beauty is there
then in the Beloved? if the Church be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
beyond all other of the Children of
men, how beautiful is Jesus Christ from
whom the Church doth derive all its come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness?
He is said to be <hi>White and Ruddy,</hi>
that shews the beauty of his Face; and his
Countenance is said to be <hi>as Lebanon, and
like the lofty Cedars thereof,</hi> that shews
the Majesty of his Face. His <hi>Mouth</hi> is
said to be <hi>most Sweet;</hi> and sweet it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
in regard of the Gracious words
which proceed from it; no Doctrine so
sweet as Christ's Doctrine, no Precepts
so sweet as Christs Precepts, no Promises
so sweet as Christs Promises. But to sum
up all Excellencies and Perfections in a
word he is said to be <hi>altogether Lovely,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:43848:16"/>
there is no Person or Thing in the World
that is most lovely, which can properly be
called altogether lovely: Many defects
may be found in the most amiable persons,
and much insufficiency may be found in the
most desirable things; but Christ is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lovely; unlovely in no respect, there
being no Spot or Blemish, no Defect or
Imperfection to be found in him: and he
is lovely in every respect, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
and Transcendent amiableness
in Christs person in every regard. In the
person of Christ the Humane Nature and
the Divine Nature are in Conjunction, he
is most lovely in regard of both. His
Humane Nature is compounded of Body
and Soul. His Body is most Beautiful, a most
Glorious Beauty and lustre is put upon it:
whatever it were in his state of humiliation,
be sure it hath a Glorious Beauty now in
his state of Exaltation. It is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
a Glorious Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. If the Face
of <hi>Moses</hi> did shine with resplendent Glory,
after his conversing Forty dayes with God
in Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> which was Below; how
doth the Body of Christ shine, which hath
been above Sixteen hundred years in
Mount <hi>Sion</hi> which is Above? I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that Christs Body is the most
Beautifull of all Visible Creatures. But
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43848:17"/>
the Beauty of Christs Soul doth Excel:
No creature whatever, hath such shining
Excellencies as are in the Soul of Christ,
All the Excellencies that are, or ever were
in any creature, are like a Feather laid in
the Ballance with the exceeding weight of
his Glorious Excellencies and Perfections.
Christ Excelled the most Excellent Men
that ever lived, as to Spiritual Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
when he was here upon the Earth:
He Excelled <hi>Moses</hi> in Meekness, <hi>Solomon</hi>
in Wisdom, <hi>Iob</hi> in Patience; and how
much doth he Excel now he is in Heaven?
He Excelleth not only the Spirits of just
men made Perfect, but also the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Holy Angels that never sinned.
If any creatures have Wisdom, it is but a
Beam, Christ is the Sun; If they have
Goodness, it is but a drop, in Christ is the
Ocean; If they have Holiness, it is but a
Spark or dark shaddow, Christ is the
Brightness of his Fathers Glory: If they
have the Spirit, they have it but In some
measure, the Spirit is given to Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Measure <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 34. Christ is most
lovely in his Manhood, so nearly united unto
his Godhead; and how lovely is he in his
Godhead? as God he is Equall in all Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Excellencies with the Father. Christs
Godhead implyeth Excellency of Being,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43848:17"/>
he calleth himself <hi>I am, Ioh.</hi> 8. 28. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of Glory, therefore called <hi>the Lord
of Glory, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 8. and <hi>King of Glory,</hi>
Psal. 24. 7. <hi>Lift up your heads O yee Gates,
and be ye lift up, ye Everlasting Doors,
and the King of Glory shall come in.</hi> This
is Interpreted by some, to be spoken of
Christs Ascension, and the Angels and
Saints making way for his Triumphant
Entrance, and Possession of his Heavenly
Pallace. Many Descriptions are given in
the new Testament, of this lovely Person;
I shall mention only one, <hi>Col. 1. 15, 16,
17, 18, 19. Who is the Image of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
God, the First-born of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
For by him were all things created
that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth,
Visible and Invisible, whether they be
Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities,
or Powers: all things were made by him
and for him. And he is before all things,
and by him all things consist. And he is
the Head of the Body, the Church: who
is the beginning, the First-born from the
Dead, that in all things he might have the
Preeminence. For it pleased the Father, that
in him all fulness should dwell.</hi> If we read,
believe and consider this great Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ, we must needs see and say,
that Christ is most Excellent and Amiable,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43848:18"/>
and that no beloved is like to the Beloved
of true Christians: therefore it is that true
Christians do love Christ, because of his
loveliness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rea.</hi> 3. True Christians do love Christ,
because of His love. His love which he
doth bear to them. He loves them with a
First love, and with a Free love; He loves
them with a tender and compassionate love,
with an active or doing love, with a passive
or suffering love: His love is Infinite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Bounds or Limits; it is Superlative
without comparison; Transcendent beyond
comprehension; Everlasting without
change, and which will have no end or
conclusion. He lov'd them when they
were polluted in their sins, and washt
them with his own blood; he loved them
when they were Naked in their Souls,
and clothed them with the Robes of his
Righteousness; He loves them in their
sickness and sorrows, and is their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter;
He loves them in their wants and
Straits, and is their Benefactor, He loves
them in Life, and is the Life of their Souls;
He loves them at Death, and is the Stay
of their Hearts; And he loves them after
Death, and will be their Portion for ever.
There is great Reason that true Christians
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43848:18"/>
should love Christ, because of his loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and there is further reason that they
should love him, because of his love, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when both are incomparable, both
are incomprehensible. I shall further speak
(God willing) unto both these with other
reasons, under the motives in the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to excite Christians to the love of
Christ.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1. FOR Information hence learn,
that there are but few true
Christians in the world, because there are so
few that love this <hi>unseen Christ.</hi> There are
many Christians in Name, few Christians
in deed and in truth. The time hath been
when openly to profess the Name of a
Christian, did argue true love unto Jesus
Christ; I mean in the Primitive times,
when Christians were Persecuted by the
Heathens, as in the Ten first dreadful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
under the Heathen Emperours;
when the world was watered with Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
blood, then especially at some times and
in some yea most places, whoever openly
acknowledged themselves to be Christians
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43848:19"/>
they exposed themselves unto Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Racks, Tortures, Burnings and
the most cruel deaths; It was the Truth
and Strength of Love unto Jesus Christ,
which carried them thorow such great suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
as many did in those dayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
for the sake of Jesus Christ: But now
there are Multitudes of bare nominal
Christians, they call themselves Christians
being baptized in Christ's name, but they
are altogether without love to Christ,
whose Name they bare: Surely there are
but few, not only in the Christian World,
but even in <hi>England</hi> (where Christianity
is to be found in as great purity as in any
place) that love Jesus Christ in sincerity.
No grossely ignorant persons do truly love
Christ; such as don't know Christ, they
can't love him; <hi>ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> there
is no desire after, nor love unto an unknown
thing: An unknown evil cannot be hated,
and an unknown good cannot be loved. No
grossely Erroneous persons, do truely love
Christ; such as do not receive Christ's
Truths, they cannot love Christ's Person:
Joh. 14. 23. <hi>If any man love me he will
keep my words.</hi> The words of Christ do
include, not only the words of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
but also the words of his Doctrine;
Such as erre grossely, I mean in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43848:19"/>
Truths of Christianity, they are no
friends to Christ, but his Enemies, so far
are they from true love unto him. No
grossely wicked persons, do truly love
Christ; such as profane persons, who
Blaspheme the name of God in their hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Oaths; the love of Christ doth teach
an Holy Awe and Reverence of Gods
Name; such are Persecuters of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for Righteousness sake. How can they
love the Head, that hate the Members?
Christ accounteth himself to be persecuted,
in the perseution of his Members; <hi>Act. 9. 4.
Saul, Saul, why persecut est thou me,</hi> and v. 5.
<hi>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:</hi> and surely
persecutors of Christ do not love Christ.
Such are Scoffers at Religion, who deride
Holiness and mock at the name of a Saint
or Godly person, whereby they evidently
shew their contempt of the Holiness of
Christ, from whom the Saints derive all
theirs; and how can they love Christ that
do contemne him and his Image. No un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
persons do truly love Christ,
whether they be so in regard of distributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
justice, or in regard of commutative
justice; whether they be unrighteous in
Execution of judgement, in distribution of
Rewards or Punishments, &amp; whether they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43848:20"/>
be unrighteous in their Traffick and Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;
Christ strictly requireth justice and
Righteousness, and how can they love
him, that do not keep this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
No Covetous persons do truly
love Christ; the Apostle saith, 1 Joh. 2.
15. <hi>If any man love the world, the love of
the Father is not in him.</hi> And I may say
that if any man love the world, (that is,
with his chief love) the love of the Son is
not in him; the love cannot be chiefly set
upon things below here on Earth, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ who is above in Heaven. No
Licentious persons do truly love Christ:
no Drunkards, Adulterers, or any that
indulge themselves in unlawful delights;
the love of Christ doth teach us to deny
such Lusts, and to Mortifie them. No
meer civil persons that are unconverted,
no Hypocrites that have a forme of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but are without the power of it, do
truly love Christ: the former may be
loving and courteous unto men, but they
have no love to Christ; the latter may Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
love to Christ, and Seem to love him,
but they do not really love him. In a word
none who are under the reigning power of
any sin, do truly love Christ: The Reign
of sin is in the heart, and this is inconsistent
with the love of Christ in the Heart. Now
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43848:20"/>
let us separate all these forementioned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
from the rest; Grossely Ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
grossely erroneous persons, grossely
wicked persons, the Profane, the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
of Gods people, the Scoffers at
Religion, all Unrighteous persons, all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Persons, Drunkards, Adulterers,
and all Licentious Persons; meer Civil
persons, Hypocrites, and all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the reigning power of sin, and how
few will there be left that do truly love
Christ! and by Consequence there will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
but very few that are true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. FOR Examination. Here you
may know whether you are
true Christians by the Tryall of your love
unto Jesus Christ. Examine your selves
therefore, whether you love Jesus Christ
whom you have never seen; the most in
the world do love truly those persons and
things only which they have seen; but
can you say that you sincerely and chiefly,
do love Jesus Christ whom you have not
seen? the love of the most doth arise from
the notice which the Eye doth give of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43848:21"/>
Objects beloved; but doth your love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
from the notice which the Ear hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
by the word, of the Amiableness which
here is in Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> How may we know whether we
have true love to Iesus Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> You may know the truth of your
love to Jesus Christ, 1 By your desires
after Christs presence. 2 By your prizing
and frequenting those wayes wherein
Christ is to be found, and seeking him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
3 By your love of Christs image.
4 By your Obedience to Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>By your desires after Christs Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;</hi>
wherever there is a great love to any
person, there is a desire after the presence
of that person: do you sincerely and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desire Christs presence? there is a
twofold presence of Christ, His gracious
presence here, and his Glorious presence
at the last day.</p>
               <p>1. There is Christs Gracious presence
here, Joh. 14. 18. <hi>I will not leave you
comfortless, I will come unto you.</hi> You
desire that such Friends and Relations
would come unto you, but do you desire
chiefly that Christ would come unto you?
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43848:21"/>
Christ cometh to his Disciples in a way of
gracious communication, in a way of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Manifestation, and in a way of
sweet Consolation which doth result from
both.</p>
               <p>1 Do you desire that Christ would come
unto you in a way of Gracious communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?
are your desires after communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Spiritual Light from Christ to teach
and guide you; of Spiritual Life from
Christ to quicken and encourage you, of
Spiritual Strength from Christ, to support
you under Burdens, and Enable you unto
Duties? do you earnestly desire commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
of all kinds, and further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of grace out of that fullness of Grace
which is in Christ? do you Hunger and
Thirst after Christs Righteousness, not
only that it may be imputed to you for
your Justification, but also that it may be
more and more imparted unto you for your
further Sanctification, that you might be
brought and hereby wrought into a more
perfect conformity and likeness unto Jesus
Christ: this is an Evidence of true love.</p>
               <p>2 Do you desire that Christ would come
unto you in a way of Gracious Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Joh. 14. 21. <hi>He that loveth me,
shall be loved of my Father, and I will love
him, and will manifest my self unto him.</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:43848:22"/>
Do you Earnestly desire the fulfilling of
this promise? that Christ would discover
to you more of the loveliness of his person,
and of the love of his Heart? are you
grieved when your beloved doth withdraw
himself? when the curtain is drawn, and
a cloud doth interpose between you and
this Sun of Righteousness; when he Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and Veileth his Face from you? and
do you long after Christs returns, and the
Discoveries of himself unto you? <hi>Come
Lord Iesus, Come quickly; Be as a Roe
or young Hart, upon the Mountains of
Spices; Leap over the Mountains, and
Skip over the Hills, and make haste unto my
Soul, which is sick of Love for thee in thy
Absence from me: O that I might see thy
Face which is so Fair! that I might hear
thy Voice which is so Sweet! that I might
feel thy Presence which is so Refreshing!
O that I might behold thy Heart-ravishing
Smiles! Say Lord that I am thine, and
thou art mine; that thou hast loved me, and
given thy self for me; that thy love to me was
from Everlasting, and that it is Vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
Are these or such like, the breathings of
your Souls? Such are the breathings of
love to Christ.</p>
               <p>3 Do you desire that Christ would
come unto you in a way of sweet consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:43848:22"/>
which doth result from this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
and Manifestation? are you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
after the Oil of Gladness, which
Christ is Anointed withal? that he would
give you of the Unction of the Spirit, not
only to Sanctifie you, but also to comfort
you? do you desire that your Hearts
might be filled with Spiritual joyes, the
joyes of the Holy Ghost, which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
and full of Glory? do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the comforts which Christ doth give,
beyond all the comforts which the World
and the Flesh can give? the comforts which
come in at the door of Faith, beyond all
the comforts that come in at the door of
Sense; those joyes which are in Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all joyes that can be found in the most
sweet and desireable creature-enjoyment?
this evidenceth true love to Christ. Thus do
you desire Christs Gracious presence.</p>
               <p>2. And do you desire also Christs glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
presence at the Last day? When he
promiseth, <hi>Surely I come quickly,</hi> can your
hearts make answer as <hi>Rev. 22. 20. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
even so come Lord Iesus?</hi> are you
glad you live so near the End of the World,
that the Lord is at hand, that the coming
of the Lord draweth nearer and nearer
every day? can you lift up your heads
with joy, when you look towards the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43848:23"/>
place where the Lord Jesus Christ is, at
<hi>the right hand of the Throne of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
on High;</hi> and think with comfort,
that <hi>yet a little while, and he that shall
come will come, and will not now tarry
much longer;</hi> that within a while <hi>Christ
will descend from Heaven with a shout,</hi> the
Lord with the <hi>Sound of the Trumpet,</hi> and
that your Eyes shall <hi>see him in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Glory and Majesty?</hi> Do you
look and long for the day of Christ's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
appearance from heaven, when you
shall be awakened out of your Graves
(where you may take a short sleep before)
and be gathered together by the Angels,
and be caught up in the clouds, and there
(in shining Garments of Immortality on
your Bodies and of Christs unspotted
Righteousness in your Souls) be brought
with Shoutings and Acclamations of Joy
and Triumph into his Presence, who will
then acquit you Graciously from all Sin and
Punishment, own you openly for his
Faithful Servants, crown you Gloriously
before the whole World, and receive you
to Live and Reign with him to all Eternity?
Have you such desires as these? If some
of you say, you are afraid of Christs Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
appearance, lest then you should be
rejected because you fear you are not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43848:23"/>
and prepared; yet can you say also
from your Hearts, that you Desire above
all things that you may be ready, that you
Endeavour to make ready, that it is your
Grief you are no more ready, and that if
you were ready, and were assured of your
Interest in Christ, you could desire that
Christ would come immediately; and that
you desire no greater Happiness and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
than to live with Christ in Glory;
and that you account the Presence of Christ
in Heaven to be the Happiness of Heaven?
These are Evidences of true desires after
Christ's Glorious presence, and of sincere
love to Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You may know your love
to Christ, by your Prizing and Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those wayes wherein Christ is to be
found, and seeking him therein. Such
are the wayes of his Ordinances both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and private. Christ's way is in his
Sanctuary, and in his Ordinances he may
be found; do you give your attendance
unto Ordinances, Publick prayer, the
Preaching of the word, the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper? and do you prize
these Ordinances because of the Stamp of
Christ's Institution upon them, because of
Christ's presence in them, and because they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43848:24"/>
are a meanes of bringing you and Christ
together? and when you are under Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
do you diligently seek after Christ
in Ordinances? Don't you rest in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
and carnall part of Ordinances, in
meeting with Gods People there? or do
you design, desire and endeavor after some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more inward and Spiritual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
sweet, that you meet with
Christ there, that you may have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with the Father and the Son therein?
and upon this account can you say as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
How amiable are thy Tabernacles O
Lord!</hi> and <hi>A day in thy Courts is better
than a Thousand,</hi> Psal. 84. 1, And, <hi>One
thing have I desired of the Lord, that will
I seek after, that I may dwell in the House
of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire
in his Temple;</hi> Psal. 27. 4. Do you also
seek after Christ in your Families, and in
your Closets? do you seek him in secret
prayer and meditation? your love to Christ
doth express it self in your desires; your
desires do shew themselves in your seeking
after Christ in his wayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you may know your love to
Christ, by your love of Christ's Image:
there is the Image of Christ on his Word,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43848:24"/>
and there is the Image of Christ on his
People.</p>
               <p>1. Do you love the Image of Christ on
his Word? as <hi>Caesar's</hi> Coin did bear <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar's</hi>
Image and Superscription, so the
Word of the Scriptures, which is the
Word of Christ, doth bear Christ's Image
and Superscription. Do you love the
Scriptures because of Christ's Image which
is upon them? do you love the Word of
Doctrine in the Scripture, because of
the Image of Christs Truth and Wisdom
upon it? do you love the Word of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
in the Scriptures, because of the
Image of Christ's Holiness upon it? do
you love the Word of Threatnings in the
Scriptures, because of the Image of Christ's
Righteousness upon it? do you love the
Word of Promises in the Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Image of Christ's Goodness,
Grace and Love upon it? You have
Christ's Word in your Bibles, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
sounding in your Ears, but doth
the Word of Christ dwell in your Hearts?
you receive Christs word in the Light of it,
do you receive his Word in the Love
of it?</p>
               <p>2. Do you love Christ's Image on his
People? If you love not your Brother
whom you have seen, how can you love
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43848:25"/>
your Lord whom you have not seen? All
Christ's Disciples do bear Christ's Image;
if you love the Original you will love the
Picture, although it be but imperfectly
drawn; If you love the perfect Goodness
and Holiness which is in Christ, you will
love the Goodness and Holiness which you
see in the Saints, although they have it but
in an imperfect Measure: do you love
Christ's Disciples <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and that because of
Christ's Image, although they differ from
you in some opinions which are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You may know your love to
Christ, by your Obedience unto his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
Joh. 14. 15. <hi>If you love me
keep my Commandements;</hi> and <hi>ver. 21.
He that hath my Commandements and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them, he it is that loveth me.</hi> You
Have Christ's Commandements, do you
Keep them? you Know them, do you
Practice them? your Love to Christ is
known by your Obedience unto Christ.
If Christ be your Beloved, he is also your
Lord; if you have true affection for him,
you yeild Subjection unto him: If you
Love Christ, you are carefull to Please
Christ; you are not the Servants of the
Flesh, to take care to please the Flesh;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43848:25"/>
but you are the servants of Christ, to
take care above all persons and all thing
to please Christ; if you love Christ you
are fearful of giving just occasion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
unto men, but above all you are
fearful of displeasing and offending your
Lord. Do you labour so to walk that
you may please Christ in the way of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and universal obedience? are you
hearty in your obedience unto Christ?
have you a respect to all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
is it your greif that you fall short
in your obedience unto Christ? if you
can say in the presence of the Lord, and
your hearts do not give your tongues the
lye, that you don't live and allow your
selves in the practice of any known sin
which Christ forbiddeth, nor in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of any known duty which Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,
this is a sure evidence of true
love to Jesus Christ. Thus for the tryal
of your love unto Christ.</p>

not seen Christ, yet have you not heard
of him? and have you not heard enough to

Christ. What do you think? is there
such a person as Jesus Christ, or is there
not? have you no Bibles? and if you
have, have you not read therein the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
concerning Jesus Christ? and what
do you think of that History, is it true
or is it false? do you think the Gospel to
be a cunningly devised fable? are not the
Scriptures which contain this Gospel, the

their divine original to any that

there is nothing more true) how is it that
you have no love unto him? do not the

the most excellent and amiable person?
and yet do you not love him? can you

to cloth your naked souls with the robes
of His Righteousness, and to give the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Riches of Grace to you, the least

the riches of the Earth? can you love
Riches and not love Christ in whom there

you love honours, and not love Christ by
whom you may have the highest digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

from the reach of the worst of Enemies,

you; the torments of Hell will be intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
by any, but they will be most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
by Gospel-sinners; the fire of
Hell will burn upon you the most fiercely,
and the scourge of Conscience will lash
you the most furiously. Consider this all
yee that have no love to Christ, otherwise
when he cometh to judgment he will tear
you to pieces and there will be none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
you: if you have not the sweet fire

here, you will be thrown into the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fire of Hell which will burn you Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly.</p>
               <p>2. This reproves such of you as have
some love, but it is very little love to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ; you that love Christ, is not
your love very small, not only in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
with the love to you, but also in
comparison with the love which some
Christians have attained unto? how
strong was the love of the Apostles unto
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43848:28"/>
Christ when they left all and followed
him! especially after the resurrection of
Christ and his Ascention into Heaven,
when the Holy Ghost was sent down and
sat in the likeness of fiery tongues upon
them: O! what a fire of love unto Christ was
there then enkindled within them. Hence
that bold profession which they make of
Christ before the chief Priests and Elders,
<hi>Act.</hi> 4. Hence their rejoycing that they
were counted worthy to suffer shame for
the name of Christ, when they were beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
for their owning and preaching of him.
<hi>Act.</hi> 5. 41. The love of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>
was great unto Christ, and the love of
<hi>Paul</hi> was not inferiour unto the love of the
chiefest Apostles; hence it was that he
took such pains to preach the Gospel in so
many parts of the world even from <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
&amp; round about unto <hi>Illyricum, Rom.</hi>
15. 19. See also how he approves himself
to be a Minister of Christ, and giveth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of his strong love to his Master, 2
<hi>Cor. 11. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. Are they
Ministers of Christ? I speak as a fool, I am
more; in labours more abundant, in stripes
above measure, in prisons more frequent, in
Deaths oft: of the Iews five times
received I forty stripes save one: Thrice
was I beaten with rods; once was I stoned,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43848:29"/>

in perils by the Heathen, in perils
in the City, in perils in the Wilderness, in
perils in the Sea, in perils among false bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
in weariness and painfulness, in
watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in
fastings often, in cold and nakedness. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those things which are without, that
which cometh upon me daily, the care of all
the Churches; who is weak and I am not
weak? who is offended and I burn not?</hi> and
chap. 12. 10. <hi>I take pleasure in infirmities,
in reproaches, in necessities, in persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in distresses for Christs sake.</hi> The
ground of all which was the love of Christ
which did constrain him, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14.
he had such a love to Christ that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
<hi>Phillip. 1. 21. To me to live is
Christ, and to dye is gain.</hi> Christ was
his life, and his life was wholy at Christs
devotion.</p>
               <p>But where is such love now to be
found? I might speak also of the love of
some ancient Fathers, <hi>Ignatius, Polycarp,
Ierome</hi> and others: take one instance in
<hi>Ierome,</hi> who thus expresseth his love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, <hi>If my Father were weeping on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43848:29"/>
his Knees before me, my Mother Hanging
on my Neck behind me, my Brethren Sist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Kinsfolk Howling on every side, to
retain me in a Sinfull course; I would
sling my Mother to the Ground, run over
my Father, despise all my Kindred, and
tread them under my Feet, that I might run
unto Christ.</hi> How little is your love in
comparison with the love of those Famous
Hero's, I mean those eminent Martyrs,
who have despised the Flames, and endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such Racking and Torturing Deaths,
for the love which they have born unto
Jesus Christ; the fire of their Love burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stronger within them, than the fire
without them in which their Bodies were
consumed? Is not your love also small
in comparison with the love of our late
Reformers, which fired them with such
courage and resolution, as to withstand a
whole world of Antichristian Fury and
Opposition? Is your love comparable to
that of many Eminent Divines, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christians of our own Nation, of the
Age immediately going before, who are
now asleep in their Graves; but how few
are there come up in their Rooms? It is
observed, and it is greatly to be Lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that there is of late years, a great
decay in the Power of Godliness, amongst
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43848:30"/>
those that are Sincere; and is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the great Decay of love, even in
true Christians unto Jesus Christ? are
not you Dwarfs in comparison with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
are not you Babes in Christ, and
Weaklings in your love to Christ? Is it
not evident, that you have but little love
to Christ, when he is but little in your
Thoughts and Meditations? the Thoughts
are the Handmaids of the Love; where
the Love is strong and ardent, there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thoughts will be attending upon it:
but will not your Hearts tell you, that
your Thoughts of Christ are very few?
you can think often of your Food, but how
little do your Thoughts seed upon Christ,
who is the Bread of Life? You can often
think of your Rayment, but how little
do you think of the Robes of Christ's
Righteousness? You can think often of
your Earthly Friends, but how little do
you think of Jesus Christ, your Friend in
Heaven? Objects of Sense are often not
only in your Eyes, but also in your
Thoughts; but how little is Christ enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in your Thoughts, who is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Faith? Moreover, doth it not
argue little Love to Christ, that you speak
so little of him and for him, in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
one with another? If you had much
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43848:30"/>
Love to Christ, would not this Love
breath forth more in your Discourses?
You can readily speak of your selves, and
do often either Directly or Obliquely
commend your selves, which discovers
your great Self-love; how little do you
commend your Lord and Master, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll
his excellencies with your lips? and
doth not this evidence that you have but
little love to him in your hearts? You
can readily discourse of News and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Occurrences (which is lawfull and
needfull, so that due limits be observed)
but when you leave Christ quite out of
your Discourse, it shews that you have
not abundance of Love to him, because
out of the abundance of the Heart the
Mouth will speak. Such as have much
love to the World, will speak of their
Riches; such as have much love to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
will be often speaking of that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
such as love their Friends much,
will be often speaking and commending
of them, when they are in company;
and when you speak but little of Christ,
it is a sign that you love him but little.
Doth not the little Zeal which you have
for Christs Honour in the World, argue
that you have but little Love to him?
where is your activity for Christ to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43848:31"/>
his Interest amongst those Relations
and Friends, that you have acquaintance
with? do you labour all you can, to bring
others into the wayes of God, and into
acquaintance with Christ? Besides, will
not your little secret Devotion, argue
your little Affection unto Christ? will
not your closets or other retiring places
witness how little you are in secret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and converse with Christ there? Brief
and Straitned prayer in secret, doth argue
a Heart Straitned in love to Jesus Christ.
Doth not your Backwardness to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of this Love to Christ, shew the
weakness of your love? how slow of
Heart are you to the Love of Christ? how
hard to be perswaded? you need not be
perswaded to Love your Wives, if they
be Kind and Helpful; you need not be
perswaded to Love your children, if they
be Pretty and Hopefull; you need not be
perswaded to Love your Friends, if they
be Friendly and Faithful: and yet what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
attractives of Love, the most strong
of any, be in Jesus Christ, you are back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to this Love.</p>
               <p>Need I say more to convince you, that
you have but little Love to Christ? will
not your own Conscience from these clear
Evidences sufficiently witness the thing?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43848:31"/>
And now Christians think what a Sin, what
a Shame, what a Folly it is, that you
should have so little Love unto Jesus
Christ: If it be so great a Sin for such as
are Strangers unto Christ, to have no
Love at all to him, that it brings them
under the most Dreadful curse; surely
it cannot be a small Sin, that you (who are
his true Disciples) should have but little
Love unto him; is it not very displeasing
to the Father, that you should have but
little Love to his Son? if he do not hate
you because of your Relation unto Christ;
yet, is he not angry with you, for the
Lukewarmness of your Affection unto
Christ? which Sin is Aggravated by the
nearness of your Relation. Is it not
Dishonourable unto Christ, that you
should have so little Love to him? don't
you in Effect say, there is no great worth
or Amiableness in him, when you have
no great Love unto him? are you not
hereby ingrateful unto Christ, beyond
what can be perallell'd by any ingratitude
unto the most obliging Earthly Friend?
Is it not your shame, that you should
have so little Love to Christ, when he doth
so much deserve your Love? Besides the
Infinite Excellencies and Perfections
which are in his person; doth not his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43848:32"/>
Kindness unto you, call for (not
only the Truth, but also) the Strength
of your Love? Think what he hath Done
for you; think what he hath Suffered for
you; think what he hath Purchased for
you; think what he hath Promised to
you; think what he hath Laid out for
you; think what he hath Laid up for
you; and yet to have but little Love to
Christ? yet to make such poor Returns!
Moreover, is it not your Folly to have
but little Love to Christ? Don't you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
bereave your selves, or debarre your
selves of such peace as passeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
of such sweetness and comfort
both in the strength of your love, and in
the sense of His Love, as is inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
is not Injury and Mischeif unto your
selves, the consequent of your little Love
unto Christ? must you not draw on Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
in the wayes of God, as <hi>Pharoah</hi>
when his chariot-wheels were taken off?
Love to Christ is like wheels, in your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Christ, and like Oil to the wheels,
which makes you ready unto any good
work which he doth call you unto; but
when you have but little Love unto Christ,
you must needs be more slow in your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
more sluggish in Christ's service;
you will not, you cannot take that pains
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43848:32"/>
in the work of the Lord, and be so Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as you might and should be for your
Master's Glory.</p>
               <p>To Conclude, if you have but little love
to Christ, you will be apt to faint in the
day of Adversity, to shrink when you
are called to take up his Cross and suffer
for his sake: lesser sufferings will discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you, greater sufferings will affrighten
and amaze you, and you will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of turning fearful Apostates in time
of great Tryals; there is need of great
Love to christ, as well as great Faith, to
carry you thorow sufferings with courage
that you may persevere unto the end.</p>

of Jesus Christ, whom you
have never seen, this is the Use chiefly
designed in the choice of this subject, and
which I shall most largely insist upon. In
the Prosecution of it, I shall give some
Motives, and then some Directions.</p>
               <p>The Motives to Induce and Excite you
unto the Love of this unseen Christ, may
be drawn 1. From the consideration of
what Christ is. 2. From the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43848:33"/>
of Christ's Love. 3. From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of Christ's Benefits. 4. From
the consideration of that Love which
Christians have, and should have unto
Christ.</p>
               <p>The first sort of Motives may be drawn
from the consideration of what Christ is,
and that 1 What he is in Himself. 2
What he is to the Father. 3 What he
is unto true Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Consider What Christ is in
Himself.</p>
               <p>In generall, He is the most amiable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and the most sutable Object for your
Love. If you ask of the dayes which are
past, which were before you, since the
day that God created Man upon the
Earth; if you seek from one side of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto the other; if you make enquiry
into all the parts of the Earth, you will
never find that either there ever was or is
to be found any person so lovely, so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
and so every way deserving your
Love, as the Lord Jesus Christ: there is
a Matchless, Transcendent, and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Beauty and Excellency in him.
How passionately are some Foolish Men
in Love with the externall beauty which
they see in some Women: the exact Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43848:33"/>
of parts, and comely Proportion
of the body; the Amiable Features and
Lovely Mixtures of colours in the Face,
the Beauty of the Eyes, in their Spirit
their Quick and Graceful motions, and
Amorous Glances; How doth this Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
the Hearts of some fond Lovers! al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the most Beautiful body in the
World, is no better than painted clay,
dirt and corruption, enclosed in a Fair
Skin, which sickness will cause to look
pale and Wan, Death will quite Marr
and Spoil. But the Amiableness and
Beauty of Christ is more Transcendent and
Permanent, and therefore a more fit Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for your Love. Christ is Fairer than
the Children of Men; he is all Fair with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Spot, altogether Lovely without
any Blemish or Deformity. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
spoken of the Glorious Beauty which
is in Christ's Glorified Body, the most
Lovely of any Visible creature which
God hath made; and also of the Shining
Excellencies which are in Christ's Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Soul, so nearly joyned to the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
could we suppose all the Loveliness
that ever was seen, or found in the most
lovely persons that ever lived, to meet in
one person; how Lovely would that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be! yet such, though never so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendent,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43848:34"/>
Beauty, would be but a dark
Shaddow, compared with the Brightness
of Christ's most Beautifull Person. Can
you Love the imperfect Beauty which
you see in Creatures, and will you not
Love the perfect Beauty which there is in
Christ? can you Love a Fading Beauty
which soon Withereth like the Flower,
and will you not Love Christ, whose
Beauty never Decays, but alwayes doth
abide more Fresh than Beauty in the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Youth? can you be soon Affected
with Beautiful Objects which are before
the Eye of your Sense, and will you not
be Affected with this far more Beautiful
Object, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is so
clearly discernable by the Eye of Faith?
If the Eye of your Faith were open and
clear, to look upon the Transcendent Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
which is in Christ, you could not
chuse but Love him: could you see the
Glances of his Eye, and the Sweet Smiles
of his Lovely Face, as some have seen,
your Hearts would be Overcome and
Ravished with Love, and filled with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacies
of Joy and Ineffable Delight.</p>

to attract and draw forth your Love; I
shall instance in these six.</hi> 1. His Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43848:34"/>
and Authority. 2. His Holiness and
Purity. 3. His Wisdom and Omnisciency.
4. His Truth and Fidelity. 5. His Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and All-sufficiency. 6. His Kindness
and Mercy.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Consider Christ's Greatness and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
Aquila non capit muscas, <hi>The
Eagle doth not pursue after Flies:</hi> Great
Souls are not Affected, except it be with
Great Things; there is none so Great as
Jesus Christ; He is most Great in Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and Dignity, He is most Great in
Power and Authority. Excellency of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
doth greatly engage the Love, and
command the Hearts as well as the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Subjects: and those Princes
that have the greatest Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are the Darlings of the people, when
they dont abuse their place by Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and Cruelty, by Usurpation and
Tyranny. If Power be managed with
Clemency, and Authority with Kindness
towards those that are under command;
so highly do Princes advance themselves
hereby in the Esteem and Love of their
people, that they will be ready to spend
their Estates, and venture their Lives in
their Service. Christ is the Prince of the
Kings of the Earth, he is clothed with the
Highest Honour, Arrayed with the most
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43848:35"/>
Excellent Majesty, Decked with the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Power, and invested with the Greatest
Authority. He is the King and Lord of
Glory, He is Exalted to Higher Dignity
than the greatest Potentate that ever lived
upon the Earth; yea he is advanced above
all Thrones and Dominions, and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
and Powers, of the Glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
which are in Heaven; <hi>All Power is
given to him in Heaven and Earth,</hi> Mat.
28. 18. He doth what he will in Heaven
the Angels are at his Beck, and Execute
his Will, go and come at his Command;
and he hath Power on Earth; He is the
Head of the Church, and Head over all
unto the Church; he can Restrain his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and conquer them, and bring
them under his Feet at his Pleasure; And
whatever severity he doth shew some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in Executing his Judgments, and
taking Vengeance on the Wicked, he
doth never abuse his Power by Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
He is most Just towards the
worst, and punisheth them here lesse than
their iniquities do deserve. But what
kindness and clemency doth he shew to
his own subjects and people? and will
not you have a great love to so great a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
should not the consideration of the
high dignity of your Lord, raise your love
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43848:35"/>
of him unto a great heighth? when Christ
hath such Authority, shall he not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
your hearts? when Christ is invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with such power that he can defend
you against the rage and cruelty of your
most powerful and malicious adversaries,
will you not love greatly such a Person,
as well as trust confidently under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of his Government?</p>
               <p>2. Consider Christs Holiness and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
some great Persons who abound in
Wealth and Honour, who have some
kind of amiable natural qualities, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
accomplishments which might
render them very useful in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
yet through their wickedness and
debauchery, their filthiness and impurity,
their impious and vicious lives, they stain
all their other excellencies, and render
themselves the objects of contempt and
scorn, unto those who otherwise would
bear great respect and love to them.</p>
               <p>But Christ is most amiable for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Purity; he was holy in his birth;
although born of a sinful woman, yet he
was born without sin; when he lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
impure sinners he kept his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from all stains and spots, his heart
and life were free from all pollutions, and
never was he guilty of the least transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43848:36"/>
either in action or the least inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
O what an excellent Person was
Christ when here upon the Earth! how
glorious in holiness, what bright beams
of perfect purity and exact innocency did
Christ scatter in those dark places of the
Earth where he lived, and amongst those
dark sullied sinners with whom he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse!
how then doth Christ shine in
holiness, now he is entred into the Holy
of Holies, which is above; and there doth
coverse with none but such as are Holy?
I know because of Christs Holiness and
Purity, he is the object of the hatred and
enmity of the wicked and ungodly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ is an enemy unto their darling
and beloved lusts, they have an enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christs Person: when he was here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
he telleth his brethren, John 7. 7. <hi>The
World hateth me, because I testifie of it, that
the works thereof are evil,</hi> and the hatred of
the world doth still abide upon the same
account; Christ doth reprove the world
of sin, and this the world cannot endure
and away with; the beams of Christs Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
doe offend their Sore Eyes, his
holy precepts do offend their carnal
hearts; yet notwithstanding this, he is
a most sutable object for the love of Saints
upon the account of his Holiness: such as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43848:36"/>
are truely judicious will love them most
who are best, and such are really the best
Men and Women in the world, as are
most holy; if you are Christ's disciples
indeed, you love holiness where ever you
see it, and can you love the imperfect
holiness which is in Gods people, and
will you not love Christ who is perfectly,
Infinitely holy himself, and the spring of
all that holiness, which is to be found in
any of the Children of Men? if there be
such a wonderful lustre in the derived ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of some, that it makes them to shine
as lights in a dark World, what a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
transcendent lustre is there in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
holiness which is in Christ! which as
it is matter of great admiration, so it calls
for great affection, <hi>Psal. 119. 140. Thy
word is very pure, therefore thy Servant
loveth it.</hi> Christ is the Word, not the
written Word, but the Essential Word,
and he is very pure, therefore you should
love him.</p>
               <p>3. Consider Christ's Wisdome and
Omnisciency. Wisdom doth make the
face to shine; Learning doth advance
some very highly in esteem; such as know
most, if their morals be sutable to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals,
are most admired by those
that understand what true worth is; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43848:37"/>
if there be spiritual Wisdome in
conjunction with natural and acquired, if
there be much Grace in the heart as well
as much Knowledge in the head, how
worthy are such to be beloved? <hi>Daniel</hi>
was a man of great learning and wisdome,
skill'd in all the learning of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>
which was not sinful and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bolical; and
besides this he was endued with divine
wisdome by the teachings of the Holy
Spirit; the Angel told this <hi>Daniel</hi> more
than once or twice, that he was <hi>a Man
greatly beloved;</hi> he was greatly beloved
by the Lord of Heaven, greatly beloved
by his Prince on Earth, and greatly belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his people, and by all, except some
few that envied his prosperity and favor
<hi>Daniels</hi> Wisdom did render him so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
amiable; How then should
Christ be beloved because of his Wisdom
and Knowledge! the wisdom of Christ
is far beyond the Wisdome of <hi>Daniel,</hi> or
the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> who was wiser
than <hi>Daniel;</hi> these men had Wisdome
which made them famous and esteemed
in their day, but Christ is Wisdome, the
Wisdome of the Father; they were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of wisdome, but Christ is the Father
and Fountain of wisdome; they had some
jewels of wisdome, but the treasures of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43848:37"/>
wisdome are hid and laid up in Christ, <hi>Col.</hi>
2. 3. they had learning and knowledge,
but their knowledge was Ignorance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the knowledge of Christ, the
greatest part of the things which they
knew, being but the least part of the things
which they knew not; they knew some
things, but Christ is omniscient and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all things; they knew many secrets of
nature, but Christ knoweth the secrets of
Heaven, the mind of God, and nothing is
hid from him. How greatly beloved then
should Christ belif you are wise you will, if
you would be wise you must love Christ
who is so Infinitely wise himself, and who
alone can make you truly wise.</p>
               <p>4. Consider Christs Truth and Fidelity,
Truth and Faithfulness are very rare in our
dayes, when Falshood and Deceit do so
much abound; what was said of old, <hi>Isa.
59.</hi> 14. 15. Truth faileth and falleth in the
Street, the same may be said now; and
therefore such as are True without Guile,
Faithful without Deceit, are worthy of
great esteem and Love. But what Love
should you give unto Christ, who is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
True, but Truth it self; who is most
Faithful in all his undertakings and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and never deceived any that put
their trust in him, who is often better than
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43848:38"/>
his word, never worse? you will love a
true and faithful Friend, and will you not
love a true and faithful Christ, the best
Friend of the children of Men? as Christs
faithfulness should encourage your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him, so it should endear your love
unto him.</p>
               <p>5. Consider Christs fulness and All suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.
Such as have large and plentiful
Estates, are greatly beloved by the poor
and indigent, if they find them also to have
large Hearts and open Hands ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
unto their wants and necessities;
none have such fulness and plenty as the
Lord Jesus Christ, and none so willing to
communicate of his fulness unto the wants
of such as are poor in Spirit, and sensible of
their need, <hi>Col. 1. 19. It hath pleased
the Father that in him all fulness should
dwell.</hi> There is not only Plenty in him,
but fulness: not the fulness of the cistern,
but the fulness of the Fountain; not the
fulness only of sufficiency for himself, but
the fulness of redundancy for his people;
not some fulness for some things, but all
fulness for all things that are good; not
fulness for some time and to continue but
for a while, but all fulness doth dwell in
him, and abide for all his people through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Generations; and this not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43848:38"/>
upon the pleasure of men whose
minds may alter, but it hath pleased the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it dependeth upon the pleasure of
the Father who is always the same, and
whose good will to his people is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
There is a twofold fulness in Christ
for his people here; besides his fulness of
Glory which hath a reference to Eternity.
There is a fulness of Merit, and a fulness
of Spirit, 1. A fulness of Merit, in that full
and perfect Righteousness which he hath
wrought out for them, and which he doth
impute unto them for their Justification.
2. There is a fulness of Spirit in Christ, the
Spirit being given unto him without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
which he doth impart and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
unto them, for their Sanctification
and Consolation. Christians you are emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Christ is full; you are poor, Christ is
rich; you are indigent, Christ is All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
and will not you love Christ, who is
able to do for you, beyond what you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ask or think, and is as willing as he is
able to supply all your Spiritual necessities?
will you not love Christ who is an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
&amp; Everflowing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ountain of Good,
who hath inexhaustible treasures of Graces
and Comforts in him, which are set open
before you, and unto you, and every day
you may freely come and fetch such jewels
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43848:39"/>
out of this Treasury, as are of higher
worth and greater use than any Earthly
Riches in the greatest Plenty and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance?</p>
               <p>6. Consider Christs kindness and mercy.
All the kindness of Men is unkindness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the kindness of Christ, all the
Mercies of Men are Cruelty, compared
with the Mercies of Christ. He is all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
all bowels, all compassion, all pity,
all grace, all mercy to miserable lost man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
I shall not enlarge here because this
will fall under the second head of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
taken from the consideration of
Christs Love. And if you add the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and mercy of Christ to all his other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
and perfections, surely he will
appear to have incomparably the greatest
attractives in him for Love, unto any that
have not a very thick veil of unbelief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Eyes to hide him from their
view.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Consider what Christ is to
the Father. 1. He is most nearly related
to him. 2. He is most dearly beloved by
him.</p>
               <p>1. Christ is most nearly Related, and
with all most perfectly like unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
All the Creatures are related to God
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43848:39"/>
as their Maker, but Gods Children are
more nearly related; the Saints are nearly
related to God, who are his Children by
Adoption and Regeneration; the Angels
are more nearly related to God who are
his Sons by Creation, and never were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from him by sin; but the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is most nearly related unto God
who is his Son by Eternal Generation:
thus Christ is the only Begotten Son of
God, and doth bear his Image most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
being the brightness of his Fathers
Glory, and the express Image of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
This near Relation of Christ, and his
likeness to the Father doth call for your
strongest love; if you have reason to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Father, on the same account you
have reason to honour the Son; if you
have reason to love the Father, you have
the same reason to love the Son. You
will love the Sons of Princes, and will you
not love the Son of God? you will love
your own Children who bear your Own
Image, and will not you love Christ who
is the express Image of God? we read of
Christ, <hi>Phil. 2. 6. Who being in the form
of God, thought it no Robbery to be equal
with God.</hi> Christ (without Robbery or
Derogation unto God) is equal with God
in all Glorious Excellencies and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43848:40"/>
and therefore your highest and
strongest love is his due, and without rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
you cannot withhold it from him.</p>
               <p>2. Christ is most dearly beloved by the
Father, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 17. For he received
from God the Father, Honour and Glory,
when there came such a voice to him, from
the Excellent Glory: This is my beloved
Son in Whom I am well pleased,</hi> he then
that is wort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of the Fathers love, surely
is worthy of yours; he that is cheifly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
by the Father should chiefly be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
by you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Consider what Christ is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all true Christians; if you be such,
Christ is your Shepherd, he feedeth you
in green Pastures, he hath laid down his
life for his Sheep, and will you not love
such a Shepherd? he is your Captain who
hath conquered all your Enemies for you,
and leadeth you on to take the spoils, and
will you not love such a leader? He is your
Prophet, who teacheth you the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things that ever were taught, the
highest mysteries, the most Glorious
Truths, which are of the greatest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to know and believe; and he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you in the most excellent way by his
word and Spirit, opening your understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43848:40"/>
as well as his Truths, giving you light
and an eye to discern this light; and will
you not love such a teacher? He is your
High-Priest who hath made satisfaction for
you, and withall maketh intercession for
you, to reconcile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ou unto God and his
intercession is incessant and prevalent, and
will you not love such an Advocate? He is
your King who ruleth you most powerfully
and righteously, most Wisely and Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and will you not love such a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
He is your Benefactor the most
kind and bountiful, and no gifts are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
unto his gifts, and will you not
love such a friend? He is your Brother,
and if he be not a shamed to own you for
his Bretheren and Sisters, will it not be a
shame if you should withhold from him
your hearts? He is your Husband, and
you are joyned to him by the Spirit and
Faith in such Bonds as cannot be broken,
and will not you embrace him in the arms
of your dearest love? He is your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
who rescued and delivered you
from Sin and Sathan, from Death and
Wrath: He hath redeemed you by price,
the price of his blood, and hath he not then
given the greatest price for your Love?
he hath redeemed you also by conquest,
and shall he not make a conquest of your
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43848:41"/>
hearts? Surely you are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of these relations if you do not
present Christ with your most endeared
and choisest Affections. Thus far the
Motives drawn from the Consideration of
what Christ is.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="section">
               <head>SECT. XII.</head>
               <p>THe 2d. sort of Motives to excite your
Love to Christ, may be drawn from
the consideration of Christs love unto
true Christians. If you are Christians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Christ loveth you, 1. with the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Love. 2. With the Truest Love.
3. With the Strongest Love. 4. With
the surest Love.</p>
               <p>1. Consider that Christ Loveth you
with the Freest Love: There are many
motives and attractives for your Love to
Christ, but Christs love to you is most
free; nothing in your selves to draw and
engage his love, except deformity and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to him, except filthiness which he
loatheth, and wickedness which his soul
hateth be motives. There is no man in
the world that loveth you but he find<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th or
fancyeth some loveliness in you, something
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43848:41"/>
to be a motive to draw his love to you;
witt is a motive to some, wealth to others,
beauty to some, strength to others, near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to some, dear love to others, liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to some, service to others; greatness to
some, goodness to others; likeness whether
it be in good or evil is a motive to the love
of the most; But Christs first love to you, is
altogether free, that which is a motive to
men and induceth their love to you is no
motive to incline the Love of Christ: the
sin which you brought into the world with
you, and the many sins which since you
came into the world have been committed
by you, are enough to shut out all motives
of Love in Christ, unto whom all sin is so
odious and abominable. Whatever mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
induced Christ to love you, it was not
drawn from your selves, but it was drawn
from his own bowels. And will not this free
love of Christ incline you to love him?
Doth he love you most freely, and will
not you love him most dearly? Did Christ
love you without any motive to draw his
love? and will not you love Christ in whom
there are so many motives to draw your
love? Did Christ begin to love, and will not
you make a return? Did Christ love you
under your deformity, and will not you
love him in whom there is such perfect
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43848:42"/>
beauty? If you now have any spiritual
beauty, it is through the comeliness which
Christ hath put upon you, but Christs first
love was free, which is Matter of the
greatest admiration, and should be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
unto the greatest Affection.</p>
               <p>2. Consider that Christ loveth you with
the Truest love: There is little true love in
the world, you have many that truly hate
you, few that truly love you: and there
is much dissimulation in the pretended love
and affection of some; all that Flatter you
do not truly love you; love in shew and
outward appearance, in good words and
fair speeches is common, but love in deed
and in truth, that evidenceth it self in real
offices of Love, where there is the greatest
need, this is rarely to be found. <hi>Iob</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth,
<hi>Iob 6. 15, 16, 17. My brethren
have dealt deceitfully like a brook, and as
the stream of brooks they pass away; which
are blackish by reason of the ice, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the snow is hid; what time they wax
warm they vanish, when it is hot they are
consumed out of their place.</hi> In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of <hi>Iob</hi> he had many friends, and
their love and friendship did seem to have
some strength and consistency, like the ice
upon the brook; but when heat of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43848:42"/>
and calamity came upon <hi>Iob,</hi> then the
love of his friends did melt and vanish
away like ice and snow before the warm
beams of the Sun: the Love of the most
is selfish, for their own ends, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when their love is not like to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial,
but rather create trouble and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to themselves, it cometh to nothing.
True Christianity doth teach another kind
of Love, and those that are powerfully Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
have a true love, which is ready to
shew it self most in an Adverse estate. But
none do or can love you with such a true
love as Jesus <hi>Christ;</hi> there is no flattery
or dissimulation in his Love, his love is not
in the least counterfeit, it is not in the least
selfish and for his own ends; he doth not
love you to Receive good from you, but
that he might Do good unto you: He love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you not onely in Prosperity, but chiefly
He doth evidence his love in Affliction and
adversity. He is a present help in the time
of trouble, and then doth give the most
tender demonstrations of his Love; he is
touched with the feeling of your infirmities
when you are tempted, and sympathizeth
with you in your sorrows when you are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted;
He shewes his Love in visiting you
under your troubles, in supporting you,
in relieving you, and in delivering you, Oh!
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43848:43"/>
what Love should you have unto the Lord
Jesus <hi>Christ,</hi> who Loveth you with such
a True love?</p>
               <p>3. Consider th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t <hi>Christ</hi> Loveth you
with the Strongest Love. His love is more
strong than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Death, more ardent than the
Fire, which hath a most vehement Flame.
The strength of Christs Love to you doth
shew it self in the activity of his Love, in
his Doing for you; and this will appear in
three things, 1. In what he hath done for
you, 2. In what he is doing for you. 3. In
what he will do for you.</p>
               <p>1. The strength and activity of Christs
Love to you, doth shew it self in what
Christ hath done for you; I shall briefly
name some particulars. 1. It was the
strong Love of Christ which brought him
down from heaven for you, to assume your
Nature, what manner of love was this
that God should become man! that Spirit
should become flesh, that he who made the
world should be born of a mean Virgin,
and all for your sakes! 2. It was the love of
Christ which made him to fullfil all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
for you; He yielded perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Law both Moral and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial,
that you might have the benefit of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43848:43"/>
it. It was the Love of Christ which made
him submit himself to the temptations of
the Devil for you, that he, suffering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tempted, might be able to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
you when you are tempted. 4. It
was the Love of Christ which made him
endure the contradictions of sinners for
you; he bore many affronts, contumelies,
envyings and blasphemies of wicked men,
that he might give you an example how to
carry your selves under the like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
5. It was the Love of Christ
which made him lay down his Life for
you, <hi>Ioh. 15. 13, 14. Greater love hath
no man than this, that a man lay down his
life for his friend: ye are my friends.</hi> That
such a person as Christ, so excellent, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
should undergo death, and such a
death as that of the Cross, so disgraceful,
so painful; that he should submit to such
Ignominy, and endure such Agony, such
tearings in his flesh, such pressures in his
spirit, and that with such resolution and
willingness, with such submission and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and that for such as you, although
now his friends, yet whilst in a state of
Nature strangers and enemies; here was
Love stronger than death! Oh the height!
Oh the depth of this Love! There are
such dimensions in this love of Christ, as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43848:44"/>
the longest line of your most extended
thoughts and imaginations can never be
able to reach and measure. 6. It was the
Love of Christ which raised him again
from the dead for you, <hi>Rom. 4. 25. Who
was delivered for our offences, and raised
again for our justification.</hi> 7. It was the
Love of Christ which carryed him up from
earth to heaven, where he was before for
you, <hi>Ioh. 16. 7. Nevertheless I tell you
the truth, it is expedient for you that I go
away; for if I go not away the Comforter
will not come unto you; but if I depart I
will send him unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The strength and activity of Christs
Love to you doth shew it self in what he is
Doing for you. 1. He is interceding for
you at the right hand of God; <hi>Rom. 8. 34.
Who is he that condemneth? it is Christ
that died, yea rather that is risen again, who
is even at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us.</hi> It is through Love
that Christ doth plead for you in Heaven,
that your persons may be accepted, your
sins pardoned, your prayers answered, and
that the Holy Ghost may be sent down to
you to teach sanctifie and comfort you.
2. He is preparing a place for you, <hi>Ioh.
14. 2. In my fathers house there are many
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43848:44"/>
Mansions, if it were not so I would have
told you, I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> It
is through love that Christ as your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
is for you entred into the glorious
Palace that is above, to take possession of
it for you, and to prepare places there for
your reception.</p>
               <p>3. The strength and activity of Christ's
love to you doth shew it self in what he
will do for you. 1. He will keep you in
his hand that none shall pluck you thence,
<hi>Ioh. 10. 28. They shall never perish, neither
shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</hi>
Because you are received into the arms of
his love, therefore you shall be kept by
the hand of his power, and therefore you
shall never either finally or totally fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
2. Christ will make all things work
together for your good, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. And
we know that All things work together for
good to them that love God.</hi> Christ hath
an endeared love to all you that love God,
your love being the fruit of his; and when
Men and Devils conspire together to do
you mischief, Christs love will turn it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your spiritual advantage. 3. Christ
will stand by you in trouble and at death,
<hi>Iohn 14. 18. I will not leave you comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
I will come unto you.</hi> When affliction
doth arise, especially if it be for his sake &amp;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43848:45"/>
you are bereaved of all outward Comforts,
Christ will not leave you comfortless, when
friends fail, and flesh fails, and Heart fail,
yea and life fails, Christ will not fail, but
will stand by and strengthen you, and be a
light to you in your darkest hours, a stay
to your Spirits when they are ready to sink
within you. 4. After death Christ will
take care of your Souls, he will not suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them to wander they know not whither,
he will not suffer the Devil to seize on
them as his prey, but he will send his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to conduct and convey them into the
heavenly paradise, that where he is there
they may be also, <hi>Luk. 16. 22. And it
came to passe that the Beggar died and was
carryed by the Angels into</hi> Abrahams <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
2 Cor. 5. 8. We are confident, I say,
and willing rather to be absent from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and present with the Lord.</hi> 5. Christ
will raise up your Bodies at the last day,
if your Bodies should be consumed by Fire,
or drowned in the Water, or rot in the
Earth, whatever becometh of them, the
Lord Jesus at his second glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
will find them and raise them, and
transform them into the likeness of his most
glorious body, <hi>Iohn 6. 40. And this is
the Fathers will which hath sent me, that
every one which seeth the Son and Believeth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43848:45"/>
on him may have Everlasting Life; and I
will raise him up at the last day, Phillip. 3.
20. 21. For our Conversation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
from whence we look for the Saviour,
the Lord Iesus Christ; who shall change
our vile Body, that it may be fashioned like
unto his glorious Body.</hi> 6. Christ will
send forth his Angels to gather you into the
society of the Elect that have lived in all
Ages and all Parts of the World, and to
convey you into his presence, to meet him
in the Air when he cometh to Judge the
World, <hi>Math. 24. 31. And he shall send
his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet,
and they shall gather together his Elect
from the four Winds, from one end of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto the other,</hi> 1 Thess. 4. 16. 17. <hi>For
the Lord himself shall descend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with a shout, with the voice of the
Archangel, and with the trump of God,
and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then
we which are alive and remain shall be
caught up together with them in the Clouds,
to meet the Lord in the Air.</hi> 7. Christ
will own you, and crown you, and admit
you into the Kingdom of Heaven, which
he hath prepared for you. Math. 25. 34.
<hi>Then shall the King say unto them on his
right hand, Come ye Blessed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
inherit the Kingdome prepared for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43848:46"/>
you from the Foundation of the World.</hi>
Here is strong and active love indeed! and
shall not the consideration of this love of
Christ raise and highten your love unto
him? shall it not provoke and excite you
unto activity of love, unto the lively and
most vigorous exercise thereof? hath
Christ united himself to your nature? and
shall not your Hearts be united to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
hath he fulfilled all Righteousness for
you? and will not you fulfill his command
of Love? hath he endured such temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
contradictions and sufferings upon
your account and given himself to dye for
you? and will not you give your Hearts
unto him? hath he risen from the dead,
and Ascended into Heaven for you? and
will not your Affections arise from the
Earth and Ascend into Heaven, where Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is? Doth he plead in Heaven
with the Father for you? and will not you
hearken to his pleadings, by his Word and
Spirit with you for your love? is he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
a glorious Mansion for you in his
Fathers house? and will not you prepare
a place for him and entertain him in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
room of your chiefest Affections? doth
and will he keep you in his hand? and
will not you embrace him in your bosoms?
will he make all things work together for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43848:46"/>
your good? and will not your Affections
work towards him? will he stand by you
in trouble and at Death? and will not this
put life into your love? will he send his
Angels to convey your souls into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
when separated from our Bodies?
and shall not your Hearts get to him and
lodge with him before? will he raise up
your Bodies at the last day? and will not the
hopes of this raise up your Affections?
shall you be caught up in the clouds to
meet the Lord in the Air, &amp; will Christ there
own and crown you? and will not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
fore-thoughts of this ravish your
Hearts with love to Christ, and transport
you with unspeakable joy? the strength
of Christ's love to you methinks should
engage your love for him, not only in the
the Truth of it, but also in the strength of
it.</p>
               <p>4. Consider that Christ loveth you with
the surest love. Some Friends may love
you a while with some kind of strength and
ardency, but such differences may arise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you, as shall soon weaken and cool
their love, and of Friends they shall prove
strangers, yea become Enemies unto you:
or if their love doth abide, it is not sure,
because they may not abide; if their Love

dye not whilst they live, They may soon
dye, and then their love is at an end: but
the love of the Lord Jesus Christ unto you
is the most Sure love: if he begin to love
you he will continue to love you; if he love
you once he will love you to the end or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without end; the love of Christ is not
subject to mutations and changes like unto
ours; if you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in your love, he will not fail
in his love, and though you offend him,
he is not irreconcileable; he may indeed
upon unkindness on your side withdraw the
manifestations of his love for a while, but
he will never wholly remove his love from
you, the love of Christ admits of no chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
knows no ending. Christians, what
motives can you find in any person, or any
thing in the world which you have seen,
comparable to those which you have in this
Lord Jesus Christ, though you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen him; He is a Person most amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in himself, his Greatness, his Holiness,
his Wisdome, his Faithfulness, his Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
his Kindness do make him shine with
an admirable lustre; his Relation to the
Father, and the love which the Father doth
bear to him, his Relation unto you, being
your Shepherd, your Captain, your
Teacher, your Advocate, your Soveraign,
your Benefactor, your Brother, your
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43848:48"/>
Husband, your Redeemer, all these do
commend him to your love, but when
matchlesse beauty and lovliness do meet
in a person that doth bear matchless love
to you, when this most amiable Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
doth love you with such a free love,
such a cordial love, such a strong and
active love, such a sure and constant love;
when his love is incomparable, surpassing
all other love, and incomprehensible sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
all knowledge. O with what acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
ardour and constancy, should you love
so suitable an object!</p>

               <p>THe third sort of motives to excite your
love unto Christ, may be drawn from
the consideration of Christs Benefits. If
you are true Christians you have 1. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Light from Christ. 2. Spiritual Life
from him. 3. The Pardon of sin from
him. 4. The Robes of Righteousness
from him. 5. The Peace of Conscience
from him. 6. The Joyes of the Holy
Ghost from him. 7. The Riches of Grace
from him. 8. The Dignity of Children
from him. 9. The Spirit of Prayer from
him. 10. Title to the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43848:49"/>
with the first Fruits and fore-tastes of
it from him here, and shall be put into the
possession of it by him hereafter.</p>
               <p>1. You have Spiritual light from Christ;
Christ is the Sun from whom all the beams
of this light do come: time was when you
were not only in the dark, but darkness;
but Jesus Christ did enlighten you, <hi>Eph.
5. 8. For ye were sometimes darkness, but
now are yee light in the Lord; walk as
Children of the light:</hi> it is Christ that hath
turned you from darkness to light, that
hath translated you out of darkness into his
marvellous light, he hath caused a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
light to shine into your minds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath discovered to you the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things of the Law, that thereby you
might discern the odious nature of Sin;
and whereby he hath discovered to you the
wonderful mysteries of the Gospel, that
thereby you might discern the excellency
of Gospel-priviledges, and the exceeding
Riches of Gods Grace and Kindness
through Jesus Christ. Christ hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your Eyes to see the chiefest evil, that
you might be delivered from it, and the
chiefest, good and happiness that you might
attain unto it. And doth not this light which
you have from Christ call for your love?
If the man that was born blind, and was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43848:49"/>
of his natural darkness by Christ, did
love Christ for this favour, so as boldly
to plead for him before the Pharisees,
though he were for it cast out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
as you may read in <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. How
much more reason have you to love Christ,
who hath cured you of your Spiritual dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
which had it continued, you would
have gone blindfold to Hell, where there
it blackness of darkness for ever?</p>
               <p>2. You have Spiritual life from Christ;
you were Spiritually dead, and Christ
hath quickned you, <hi>Eph. 2. 1. You hath
he quickned who were dead in sins and tres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>passes.</hi>
We read that Christ raised <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
from the dead after he had been buried
four dayes, <hi>Iohn 11. Lazarus</hi> did love
Christ before, but no doubt this Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of him so wonderfully did endear
his love to Christ exceedingly; and shall
not Christs raising you up from your Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
death, raise your Hearts unto a great
height of love to Christ! you will greatly
love one that is instrumental to save your
natural life, when in great hazard and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
especially if he should do it by ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his own; and will you not greatly
love Christ who hath given you Spiritual
life, which is far more excellent than the
life of Nature; and when he dyed that you
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43848:50"/>
might live, and when if you had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
this Spiritual life from him, you
could not have escaped eternal Death?</p>
               <p>3. You have the pardon of sin from
Christ; this Christ hath purchased for
you, and the purchase hath cost him dear,
even his blood which was of more worth
than the treasures, were there so many,
of ten thousand worlds; this Christ hath
sued out for you by his intercession at the
right hand of God. Whilst you were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the guilt of sin you were bound over
by the Justice of God to suffer the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Eternal Fire; but being pardoned
your obligation to future punishment is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, and you are no more lyable to
wrath to come, and the vengeance of Hell,
than if you had never si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n'd. And will
you not love the Lord Jesus Christ, who
hath procured for you so great a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
we read of one that had much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
her, and she loved much, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47.
and have not you had much forgiven?
have not your sins been very numerous,
and very heinous? and hath Christ obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the pardon of them all? and will not
you love Christ much?</p>
               <p>4. You have the Robes of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from Christ: you are born naked of
Original Righteousness, and you could
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43848:50"/>
not work out any actual Righteousness
for your selves that might cover your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
whatever you wrought your
selves it was rags that could not cover
you, and it was filthy rags which did
pollute and defile you. Christ hath given
you the Robes of his perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to cover and adorn you withall, and
therein you are accepted as perfectly
Righteous in the sight of God. O how
should we love the Lord Jesus for this
Garment; if your Bodies were naked
and one should give you clothes to cover
you, especially if they were rich clothes,
you would love such a person; and will
you not love the Lord Jesus Christ who
hath given you a garment to cover your
Souls, and that a very rich one, even the
Robes of his most pure and unspotted
Righteousness which by Faith is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you?</p>
               <p>5. You have peace of Conscience from
Christ. This is that peace which the
Scripture telleth us <hi>passeth all understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Phil.</hi> 4. 7. It passeth all understanding
to know the worth of it; such as have this
peace would not leave it upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
they would part with Estate or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
or Life rather than part with their
peace; and those which have it no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

now do slight and neglect it, yet if they
be awakened by the sides of the Grave,
and when they are come to the confines of
Eternity, then they would value this
peace, and would give all the world (were
it at their dispose) for it. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of peace you have from Jesus Christ, he
hath purchased it for you, the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your peace was upon him, and
he hath promised and bequeathed it in his
last will and Testament unto you, <hi>Iohn
14. 27. My Peace I leave with you, my
Peace I give unto you.</hi> In his reconciling
you unto God he hath laid a Foundation
for this peace in all you that are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;

                  </gap> your love to Christ may be
drawn from the consideration of that love
which Christians have or shou'd have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; and here consider, 1. The Duty.
2. The Priviledge. 3. The Honour.
4. The Wisdom. 5. The Excellency.
6. The Necessity. 7. The Usefulness.
8. The Delightfulness. 9. The Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of this love to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>1. Consider it is your Duty to love
Christ; if it be your Duty to have a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection unto Parents &amp; Children, it
is much more your Duty to have spiritual
affections unto Christ; If it be your duty to
have conjugal affection unto your Earthly
Husband and Wife; it is a greater duty to
have conjugal love unto this your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Husband. If it be your Duty to love
Brethren, Sisters and Kindred, that love
you, it is a greater Duty to love Jesus
Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t, who loves you above all Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
if it be your Duty to love your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
it is much more your Duty to
love Christ who is your best Friend. It
is the will of your Heavenly Father that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43848:54"/>
you should love Christ; the Devil
would have you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate him, but God
would have you love him, and whether
it be most reason that you should obey the
Will of God or the Will of the Devil,
judge ye. It is the Will of Christ that
you should love him; the will of the flesh
is against this love, but whose will ought
you to comply withall? you are not
debters to the Flesh that you should obey
it's command, neither are you Debters to
any Creatures to give them your choicest
affections, but you are debtors unto Christ
to give him your chief love: Christ hath
most right to your love, and will you not
give to Christ his due? if you are bound
to give men their due, are you not much
more bound to give unto Christ his due?
Christs due is your best, and have you
any thing better than your Hearts to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
him withall? will Christ accept of
any thing at your hands, should you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
from him your Hearts? had you
Thousands of Rams, and ten Thousand
Rivers of Oyle to offer to him, had you
all the Treasures of the Earth at your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and should lay it down all at his feet,
it would be all slighted and disregarded by
him, if you give away yours Hearts from
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:43848:54"/>
2. Consider it is your Priviledge that
you may love Christ, that Christ will
give you leave to do it, and kindly accept
of your Love. Should Beggars fall in
love with Princes in order to the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
Union, both their Persons and Love
would be rejected with scorn, anger and
disdain: There is a far greater distance
between you and Jesus Christ, than there
is between the highest Prince and the
meanest Beggar; and yet the Lord Jesus
Christ doth give you leave to love him
with a Spiritually conjugal love, in orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to the nearest Spiritual Union and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction;
and notwithstanding his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and your meaness, he is not ashamed
to give entertainment unto your Love;
although you are so mean as Creatures,
&amp; have been so vile as Sinners, yet he doht
not scorn and disdain you, but both Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Love may find ready acceptance
with him. It is your duty to love Christ
because he commands you, and it is your
Priviledge that you may love Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he allows you to do it.</p>
               <p>3. Consider it is your Honour to Love
Christ. The real Honour of any is not
the Noble Blood which runs in their veins
the high lineage from whence they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scened,
the great Titles with which they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43848:55"/>
are Invested, or the most eminent Earthly
dignities unto which they are advanced:
The Heathen could say, <hi>Et Genus et Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avos,

voco;</hi> our stock and noble Ancestors, and
what we have not done or deserved our
selves, we can hardly call our own. And
<hi>Virtus sola &amp; unica Nobilitas:</hi> Vertue is
the only true Nobility. And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
telleth us, that <hi>the vilest Men are
exalted, Psal.</hi> 12. 8. and <hi>that the most high
ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, aud giveth
it to whomsoever he will, and sette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Nobles by their Vices and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesses
may render themselves more
vile then the Earth under their Feet, more
base than the mire in the Streets. The
Word of God accounteth only them to be
truly Honourable, that are truly Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and this Grace of Love to Jesus
Christ doth put a great Honour and lustre
upon all those that have it. There is no
greater and higher object for your love
than the Lord Jesus Christ, a person of so
great eminency and excellency: the Love
of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t doth enoble the Heart, and none
in the world have such truely great and
generous Souls, as those who have the
graeatest love to him. According to the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43848:55"/>
Spirit, so is the Man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se or
honourable; and according to the chief
love, so is the Spirit; if your Heart do
chiefly love any inferiour things, as all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blunary
things are, hereby you are deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and dishonoured; if your Heart
chiefly love Christ who is a Superior good
and superlatively amiable, hereby you
are dignified and become truly honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
We read of Hope (that is the
Grace of Hope) that <hi>it maketh not asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Rom.</hi> 5. 5. And the same may be said
of this Grace of Love to Jesus Christ, it
maketh not ashamed. The most in the
World do love those things which one
time or other will make them a shamed;
the covetous will be ashamed of their love
of Riches, and the voluptuous will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of their Love of Pleasures, and the
Ambitious will be a shamed of their love
of Honours; disappointment of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and true contentment will make all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of their inordinate Creature-love,
especially when they come to reap the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fruit of their Sin in their Everlasting
punishment. <hi>Rom. 16. 21. What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ruit
had you then in those things whereof you are
now ashamed, for the end of those things
is Death.</hi> But the love of Christ maketh
not ashamed, it is no matter of dishonor
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43848:56"/>
and therefore neither is nor will be matter
of shame for any to love Jesus Christ with
the greatest Strength and Ardency: if the
wicked do despise and scorn Gods people,
upon the account of this love, their scorns
are their reall Glory, as on the contrary
their esteem of any upon the account of
sin, is a reall shame and dishonour.</p>
               <p>4. Consider, It is your Wisdom to love
Christ. <hi>Deut. 4. 6. Keep therefore and
Do them, for this is your Wisdom and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in the sight of the Nations,
which shall hear these Statutes, and say
surely this great Nation is a Wise and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
People.</hi> None have such
Wisdom and Understanding as those who
have and keep this Statute and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ndment
to love the Lord Jesus Christ,
<hi>Psal. 111. 10. The fear of the Lord is the
beginning of Wisdom, a good Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
have all they that do his Commandments</hi>
T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e fear of the Lord and the love of Christ
are always in conjunction, or rather the
former doth include the latter; this is the
beginning and cheif part of Wisdom, and
those have the greatest Understandings,
who have the strongest Affections to the
Lord Jesus Christ. The love of Christ is
the most reasonable and therefore the most
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43848:56"/>
wise love. That love is most reasonable,
which is chiefly carryed forth towards
that object which is most suitable and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
most Amiable; none so suitable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
an object as the Lord Jesus Christ,
as appears in what hath been already said
concerning Christs Person, Christs Love,
and Christs Benefits. Such as love other
persons or things with a cheif love, they are
mistaken in the objects of their love, they
apprehend more excellency and desirable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in them, than really is in them, and
so their love is a foolish love and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
there being nothing really wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it, nothing really amiable in the
cheif place beneath and besides Christ.
Such as make choice of Christ for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their chief love, they make the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
choice, there are really those excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in him which they apprehend, and
beyond what they can possibly apprehend
and conceive. They are fools that are
slow of Heart to love Christ, and they are
most wise that are most forward unto this
love. It is your Wisdom to love Christ
cheifly, and to love Christ ardently,
such Wisdom as will make your faces
shine in the Eyes of good men, and which
will put a lustre upon your Spirits in the
Eyes of God? True Wisdom doth not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43848:57"/>
consist in the invention of curious and
quaint Notions, in the framing sound and
rational Deductions, in uttering the sense
of the mind in neat and florid Expressions;
but the cheif Wisdom doth lie in the right
placing of the Affections, and none have
attained so high a pitch of true Spiritual
Wisdom, as those that have attained the
highest pitch of love to Jesus Christ. It is
matter of great wonder, when there is
the greatest reason and the strongest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the love of Christ, that Men of
the greatest Parts and Learning, who have
heard of Christ, do not readily fall in love
with him, and attain higher degrees of this
love, than others of a more inferior ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity:
But the Scripture must be fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Math. 11. 25. I thank thee O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Lord of Heaven and Earth, because
thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and revealed them unto babes.</hi> Such
of you as are but Babes in worldly Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and humane Learning, as have but
mean natural parts, and no improvement
by education, yet if you love the Lord
Jesus Christ above all persons and things
in the World, you are far more Wise
than the greatest Schollars that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:43848:57"/>
5. Consider the excellency of this Love
unto Jesus Christ; as the Knowledge of
Christ is the most excellent knowledge,
<hi>Phillipians 3. 8. Yea doubtless I count all
things but loss, for the Excellency of the
Knowledge of Christ Iesus my Lord:</hi> So
the Love of Christ is the most excellent
love. It is a love of the most excellent
object, the Lord Jesus who is so Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
it is a love of the most Excellent ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
it cometh down from Heaven, it is
wrought by the Spirit of God; it is a love
that renders them most excellent that have
it. The wicked that are without this love,
are like dross; the Righteous that have it
are like Gold; the wicked that hate Christ,
are like dirt; the Righteous that love him
are like Jewels; other loves do darken
and defile, the love of Christ doth brighten
the Spirit and renders Men truly illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and the excellent of the Earth.</p>
               <p>6. Consider the Necessity of this love
unto Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>1. The love of Christ is universally
necessary: some of you have need to do
this thing, and others of you have need to
do that; but all of you have the greatest
need to love Christ: some of you have need
of this Friend, and to love him, that you
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43848:58"/>
may keep him, and others of you have
need of another Friend, one Friend; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serve the necessities of all; but all of
you have need of Christ for your Friend:
he is the only Friend that can serve all your
necessities, and you have need to love him
above all Friends; it is necessary that you
who are poor should love Christ, who
have but few or no Friends; and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that you who are rich should love
Christ who have many Friends; Christ
being a Friend instead of all to them that
have none, and better than all to them
that have the most.</p>
               <p>2. The love of Christ is absolutely and
indispensably necessary: it is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that you should climb up into a high
seat of dignity and honour; but it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary that your Affections
should climb up and ascend to Jesus Christ
who is above; it is not necessary that
you should abound in wealth, that you
should have full bags, and full coffers, and
much riches in your houses, but it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary that you should have
the Riches of this Grace of love to Jesus
Christ in your Hearts. Food is not so
necessary to satisfie your hunger, clothes
are not so necessary to cover you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

houses are not so necessary to shelte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you from the injury of the Weather; the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bodies, as this love to Jesus Christ
is necessary to your Souls. You may be
poor and in the lowest condition here on
Earth, and yet be truly happy whilst you
live, and Eternally happy in the other
world, if you have this love, to Jesus
Christ; but without this love whatever
your Riches, and Honours, and Friends,
your Earthly delights and enjoyments be
though never so desirable, never so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
yet you are miserable, and shall be,
miserable. You may love other Persons
and Things in the world subordinately,
but you must love Jesus Christ cheifly, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
you are under the curse both of
the Law and Gospel, and you cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
the vengeance of Hell.</p>
               <p>7. Consider the Usefulness of this love
unto Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>1. The love of Christ is useful in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
to ballast the Heart, that it be not
overset with the full gales of a flourishing
condition: it is of use to moderate the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to lawful things; and it is of use to
keep the Heart from unlawful and sinful
loves; if Christ have not your Hearts, some
base and foolish lusts will have them,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43848:59"/>
which will wound your Consciences with
guilt, and peirce your Hearts thorow
with many sorrows.</p>
               <p>2. The love of Christ is useful in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
to bear up the Heart from sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and being overwhelmed with the
Winds and Waves of Trouble and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
it is of use to establish the Heart
from being extraordinarily moved in the
most Stormy times: not only Faith but
Love too is of a fixing nature to keep
from amazing fears of evil tidings, and
the greatest perils; and of a strengthning
Nature to stay and support the Spirit and
keep off pressing Griefs and despondencies
in the darkest and most doleful days.</p>
               <p>3. The love of Christ is useful to
quicken and excite unto duty, this makes
the yoke of Christ easie, and will enable
you to draw cheerfully therein; this
makes the burden of du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y (so accounted
by the most,) to be no burden in esteem;
if you have much love unto Christ you
will account duty to be your priviledge,
and the Service of Christ to be freedome,
and none of his commands will be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
but all of them joyous unto you; if
you have much love unto Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, your
Hearts will be ensiamed hereby with zeal
for your Masters Glory, and you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43848:59"/>
think you can do too much for
him.</p>
               <p>4. The love of Christ is useful to arm
you against Temptations. If Faith be a
Shield, Love to Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t is a Brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the sharpest Darts which the Devil
can throw at you; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ove to Christ doth
Garrison your Hearts against this Enemy,
and is a strong defence against any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which the Devil may make in his
Temptations to draw you to sin: how
can I do this evil and offend my dear Lord,
will be the answer of love to repel temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to sin, whatever alluring proffers
they be accompanied withal. Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will have no force to prevail over you,
if this love of Christ be strong within
you.</p>
               <p>5. The love of Christ is useful to fit
you for the cross and the greatest sufferings
which you may be called unto for the sake
of Christ. If you have great love to Christ,
you will be ready to suffer for Christ with
patience and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest
cross will seem light, disgrace and
shame will be accounted honour, losses
will be esteemed gains, pains, pleasures,
or at least priviledges: prisons will seem
Pallaces, and death will be accounted
life. O how have some run to the stake
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43848:60"/>
and embraced the Flames of Fire kindled
to burn them, when they have felt the
fire of love to Christ burning strongly
within them! thus this love is usefull in
Life.</p>
               <p>6. The love of Christ is useful at death.
This love in its strength will put a beauty
upon the Aspect of death, which seems so
grim and terrible unto the most. If you
have much love to Christ, you will look
upon death as Christs messenger sent for
you to bring you out of the dark Prison of
of the World and the Body, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
you into the Mansions of Glory,
where your dear Lord is, and you will
not be unwilling to leave the World that
you may live with Christ.</p>
               <p>8. Consider the sweetness of this love
unto Christ. If there be sweetness in the
love of the Members, there is much more
sweetness in the love of the head; if
there be delight and comfort in the love
of Christs disciples for their Masters sake,
there is much more delight and comfort
in the love of Christ himself the Master
for his own sake; the Apostle telleth us
of comfort in love, <hi>Phillip.</hi> 2. 1. that is in
the love one of another, but the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the love of Christ are far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
there are no such sweet motions of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43848:60"/>
Heart, as those of the strong and fervent
outgoings of it in its love to Christ, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when Christ doth draw near and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
his love unto the Soul. Christ, doth
rejoice in his love unto his Disciples, and
they may rejoice in their love to him, and
this joy in the love of Christ is a full joy:
<hi>Iohn 15. 11. These things have I spoken
unto you that my joy may remain in you, and
that your joy may be full:</hi> in the former
verse Christ speaketh of his love to them,
and here of his joy in them they were the
objects of his joy as they were the objects
of his love, and according to the measure
and strength of their love to Christ, so is
the fulness of their joy in Christ. <hi>Cant. 4.
9. Thou hast ravished my heart, my Sister
my Spouse, thou hast ravished my Heart
with one of thine Eyes, with one chain of
thy neck:</hi> they are the words of Christ the
Beloved, unto his Spouse the Church,
expressing the ravishing delight which he
found in her Looks of Faith, or glances of
Love, and the chain of Graces which she
was adorned withall. How then may
your Hearts be ravished with unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
delight in looking upon Christs most
amiable face, and in the fervent actings
of your love unto him? when a glance of
his Eye, a smile, a beam from his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43848:61"/>
doth enkindle a fire in the breast,
and this fire of love to Christ doth burn
and flame; O how sweet is this flame,
beyond what tongue is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.</p>
               <p>9 And lastly, Consider the Attainable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this love to Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of knowing him, so your hearts are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

of you may be. Here you are capable,

now the means of Grace, and as of other
Graces, so of this Grace of love to Christ,
in the diligent use of the means you may
attain there unto. Thus I have done with
the Motives to excite you unto the love of
Christ.</p>

               <p>THe second thing propounded in the
Prosecution of the use of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was to give Directions, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
will be of two sorts. 1. How
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43848:61"/>
to attain this love to Christ. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to show this love to Christ. First,
How to attain this love to Christ, and
here I shall, 1. Direct you how you may
attain this love to Christ in the truth of
it, where you are wholly without it. 2.
Direct you how to attain much of this
love to Christ, where you have it but in
a low degree and weak measure. The
first directions then shall be, how you that
are Graceless, and Christless, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t this love to Christ, may at-this
love to Christ.</p>
               <p>1. If you would attain this love unto
Jesus Christ whom you have never seen,
you must get a thorow pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>swasion that
there is such a Person a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Jesus Christ, and
that he is such a Person indeed, as the
Scriptures have revealed him to be. The
reason why Heathens and Infidels are
without love to Christ is because they
have never heard of him, and the reason
why many nominal Christians that have
heard of Christ are without love to him,
is because they are not really perswaded
that there is or ever was such a person as
Jesus Christ in the World. If you
would attain this love you must give firm
assent to this Truth (which is the greatest
of all, and the very pillar &amp; foundation of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43848:62"/>
the whole Christian Religion) that Christ
really is, and that the History of him is
no cunningly devised Fable. If you have
reason to beleive that there was such a
a Person as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that
there was such person as <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi>
both which lived before Christs time;
you have more reason to believe that there
was and is such a Person as Jesus Christ:
you have only Prophane history for the
former, but you have Sacred history for
the latter; you have only the writings of
men to testifie the one, but you have the
word of God in the Holy Scripture to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the other. You have as much reason
to beleive the history of the Gospel as to
beleive any other history, and you have
more reason to believe the history of the
Gospel than to believe any other history.
I shall suggest one reason amongst many
that might be mentioned. The History of
the Gospel was written by unlearned Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shermen,
and it was beleived by as lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ned
men as any in the world, in and near the
time of their writing, which belief some
of them sealed with their blood, which
they would never have done had they
found any reason to suspect the truth of
this history, which (had there been any
reason of suspition) they might easily have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43848:62"/>
found out in those times when such a grand
Fable as this (had it been a Fable) could
not possibly have gained credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongst
wise and inquisitive men; especially when
it would have been their greatest worldly
Interest, the preservation of their Estates
and Lives, to have disbelieved and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned
it. If, beside the Apostles, all the
learned Fathers (whose Works are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
amongst us, who lived near the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
times, and some of whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suffered
Martyrdom for Christ's sake) did see rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe that there was such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as Christ, surely you have reason to
believe, and no solid reason to discredit the
report of him in the History of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
And when you have attained a firm
Assent unto this, get a full perswasion that
Jesus Christ is such a person as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
do record and testifie him to be. Be
perswaded of his Amiableness, his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
his Holiness, his Wisdom, his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
his Fulness, his Kindness, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
he stands in to the Father, his onely
begotten and dearly beloved Son; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
he standeth in to his People, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in his Offices of <hi>Prophet, Priest,</hi>
and <hi>King,</hi> as I have set him forth in the
Motives to stirre up Love; acquaint your
selves with the History of his Birth so

Works so Powerfull, of his Doctrine so
Heavenly, of his Sufferings so Great, of
his Death so Painfull and yet so Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
of his Resurrection, Ascension, Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Intercession at the right hand of
God, so needfull for us, as you have this
History upon record in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
the assent to this in your Minds,
will be a preparative for the attaining
of true Love to Jesus Christ in your
Hearts.</p>
               <p>2. If you would attain true Love unto
Jesus Christ, you must get <hi>Conviction
of Sin,</hi> and a <hi>sense</hi> of your Need of
Christ. The prevailing love and liking
of Sin is inconsistent with true love unto
Jesus Christ; such as love Christ do hate
Sin, and such as love sin have an Enmity
against Christ: Whilest your hearts goe
after your Covetousness, or your Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness,
or are set upon any other Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
your hearts cannot be set upon
Christ; Before you can love Christ, your
hearts must be taken off from sin. Get
therefore a conviction of Sin as the greatest
Evil in the world. Be perswaded what an
evil thing and a bitter it is, to transgress
Gods Law, and thereby to affront the
highest Majesty, the great King of Glory.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43848:63"/>
Look into the Word and Law of God, and
see what is there required, what is there
forbidden, and then look back upon your
Lives, or look into the Register of your
Consciences, that you may find out what
your sins of Omission and Commission have
been. Take a view of your transgressions
of the Law, and of your disobedience also
unto the Gospel; and as you are guilty
before God, so labour for a clear sight and
deep sense of your Guilt, how you are
under the Curse for your Disobedience,
how you are liable to ruine and eternal
destruction for your sins. Look upon sin as
the most mischievous thing in the world; if
there be any evil in any temporal calamities
which ever did befall any of the children
of men, yea if there be any evil in future
miseries, in the extremity and eternity of
Hells Plagues and Punishments, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that there is far more evil in sin
which is the cause of all. Think how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
you are whilest under the Guilt and
Reigning power of sin, that the Worm is
not so vile, that the Toad is not so full of
deadly Poyson, that the filth of the Earth
is not comparable unto the filth of your
sins. Think how base and disingenuous
you have been, how monstrously ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to your Maker and Benefactor, what
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43848:64"/>
Traytors and Rebels you have been to
your Supream King and Soveraign. Think
what peril and danger continually you are
in of Death and Hell, how weak the thred
of Life is which ties Soul and Body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which may be suddenly cut when
you are least aware, when you are most
secure; and then if you be found in a
Christless state, your Souls will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
immediately unto a place of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diless
and eternal misery. Be perswaded
that you are undone irrecoverably, unless
the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> do help you, that
you are lost for ever unless the Lord Jesus
Christ do save you, that you cannot escape
the dreadful Vengeance of God, but must
be tormented most horri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
amongst the Devils and the damned
in Hell, unless the Lord Jesus Christ do
deliver you from the Wrath which is to
come. The sight and sense of sin, your
miserable condition thereby, and of your
indispensable need of Christ, will make
way for your Love of him. If any of
you were in debt many thousand pounds
unto a severe Creditor, and had not one
penny to discharge it, and you were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by him to be thrown into Prison,
where you must lie and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

die, without hopes of relief or release,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43848:64"/>
except you could make payment of the
debt: And if you should hear of such a
Rich man that were willing and did proffer
to be your Surety, and to pay all for you;
surely you would have an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndeared Love
to such a friend and Benefactor: Your sins
are Debts beyond the vastest summe of
Money that ever was ow'd or pay'd, and
you are not able to pay one farthing, to
give the least satisfaction unto God, unto
whom you are indebted; and God is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
and strictly just, and without full
satisfaction to his Justice, he will throw
you into a worse Prison than the most nasty
dolesom Prison on Earth, I mean into the
Prison of Hell, where you must lie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least relief, or any hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease:
The Lord Jesus Christ proffers to
be your Surety, to pay off all for you, and
to give you a full discharge; were you sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
what a Debt Sin is, and what a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Hell is, surely it would work your
hearts unto an endeared Love of such a
Friend and Surety, who alone can keep
you out of this dolesome dreadfull Prison,
into which without him you will certainly
and may suddenly be thrown. If any of
you were sick of a Death-threatning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
and you had made use of many
Physicians, but none could do you good;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43848:65"/>
and if you should hear of one Physician
who could assuredly and would readily and
freely cure your Disease, and save your
Life; surely you would thankfully make
use of this Physician, and his kindness
would exceedingly engage your Love:
Sin is the Souls sickness, you are sick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
death, Sin when it is finished will bring
forth Death, not only Temporal but Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
It is the Lord Jesus Christ onely that
can cure you of this deadly Sickness, that
can remove your Sin, and thereby deliver
you from this Death of Deaths; Get a
sense of the dangerous sickness of Sin, and
you will prize and use and love the Lord
Jesus Christ, who is the onely Physician
of value in this case. If any of you were
guilty of Murder, or Theft, or High
Treason, or any other heinous breach of
the Law of the Land, for which you were
apprehended, arraigned, accused, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to be Hanged or Burned, or to a
more tormenting Death than either; and
if you should hear of a Prince at Court
that had begg'd the Pardon of such Crimes,
for such Malefactors, and had obtained,
and he should send to you to signifie his
willingness to do the like for you; surely
you would thankfully accept of such a
proffer, and would love this Prince as
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43848:65"/>
your life, who should thus preserve you
from Death: You are all Guilty of high
Treason and Rebellion against the King
of Heaven, in your breach of his Law, and
you are condemned by this Law, not to
be hanged for it, or beheaded, but to be
burn'd for it, to be burn'd in the Fire of
Hell, which is unquenchable; The Lord
Jesus Christ is the Prince of Glory, a
Friend in the Court of Heaven, who hath
procured a Pardon for many such male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
and sendeth to you to signifie his
willingness to procure your Pardon, if you
will make use of him; Surely, if you have
a sense of your Crime and Danger, you
will apply your selves unto Christ to save
you, and you will not withhold your Love
from such a one as should shew you such
unparallel'd Favour.</p>
               <p>3. If you would attain true Love unto
Christ, you must get an Interest in Christ,
you must lay hold on Christ by Faith, that
you may be united to him, and related to
him; It is Faith that works Love, to them
that believe Christ is precious, but by
Unbelievers he is sleighted, and cannot
be beloved; without Union to Christ you
will have no affection to Christ; the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Love is layd in the Relation to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43848:66"/>
the Beloved, and this Union to and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in Christ, it is only by Faith: If then
you would embrace Christ in the arms of
your Love, you must first lay hold on
Christ, and receive him by the hand of
Faith. Whatever Motives and Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
of Love there be in Jesus Christ,
they will be none to you without this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and Relation; Christ is a Person
most beautifull, most lovely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d amiable,
but he will not be so in your eyes, so long
as you are without the eye of Faith; he
is great and powerfull, but so much the
worse for you, because without Interest
in him, his power is engaged against you:
he is pure and holy, and whilest in your
sins you are therefore the more odious in
his sight; he is wise and knoweth all
things, therefore is privy to all your sins;
he is most true, and therefore will fulfill
his threatnings against such as go on still
in their trespasses; he is full, but you
without interest in his Person have no share
in his fulness; he is kind, but it is to those
that are related to him, but what is this
to you that are Unbelievers? he is a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
to his Sheep, but you are Goats;
he is a Captain to his Souldiers, but you
are Enemies; he is a Teacher to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but you are the Devils Scholars; he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43848:66"/>
is a Gracious Soveragin, but it is to his
Subjects, you are rebells; He is a Priest to
his People, having made satisfaction and
doth make intercession for them; but you
trample his blood under his feet. He is a
Friend and Benefactor to his People, but
you are Strangers; he is a Brother, and a
Husband to his People, but you stand in
none of these Relations; he is a Redeemer
to his People but your are Slaves and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
               <p>The light which he gives is most sweet,
but you are darkness; the life which he
imparts is most excellent, but you are dead
in sins and trespasses; he gives pardon of
sin, but you are under guilt; he gives
Peace of Conscience, but your Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are still wounded and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in danger of Eternal woes; the Robes of
his Righteousness are most Rich, but you
are naked; the Riches of his Grace are
inestimable, but you are still poor; the
dignity of being made the Sons of God is
most admirable, but you are Children of
the Devil; he gives accesse unto God in
Prayer, but you are still at a distance; he
gives a Title to the Kingdom of Heaven,
but if you continue in your present state,
you will be shut at last out of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43848:67"/>
which is above, and be thrust down
into the Prison of Hell which is below.
What then are all these motives to draw
forth love to Christ unto you, that have no
interest in Christ? it is Union and Relation
unto Christ, and interest in him by Faith,
which puts life into these motives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they
may indeed attract love; O then be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
without further delay to endeavor
after this interest in Christ; you must have
it, or you are lost irrecoverably, you will
be miserable Eternally; and you may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this interest, others have attain'd it,
as mean, and as vile as your selves; and
you are called unto Christ, O be perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then to come unto Christ, and joyn your
selves by Faith unto him, that you may
have interest in Christ and in all his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.
If you ask me what this Faith is that
gives an interest in Christ, what it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
I answer out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. that it
is to receive Christ. <hi>But to as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him to them gave he Power to become
the Sons of God, even to them that Believe
in his Name.</hi> Be perswaded then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christ and accept of him upon the
terms of the Gospel. Receive and take
hold of Christ by the hand of Faith. And
that you may do this, 1. You must let go
your hold of sin, if your hugg sin in your
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43848:67"/>
bosom, if you harbour base Lusts in your
Hearts, you cannot receive and give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to Christ there: you must thrust
sin out, if you would let Christ in. 2.
You must let go your hold on the World;
I don't say you must let it go out of your
hands, and throw away the estates which
God hath given, except it be to part with
some proportion in a way of Mercy and
Charity, and except you be called to leave
all rather than to forgo Christ or any of his
Truths; but you must let the World go
out of your Hearts, the World must not
sit upon the Throne of your Hearts, that
seat must be reserved for Christ, cheif love
and inordinate love to the world and things
in the world must be taken off. 3. You
must let go hold of self; your own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and all self-confidences must be
parted with, you must be humbled and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
of your selves, if you would be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the receiving of Jesus Christ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of that fulness which there is in him.
And then, 1. Receive Jesus Christ as your
High-Priest to reconcile you unto God,
trusting alone in his Merits and Mediation,
2. Receive Jesus Christ as your Prophet
to instruct and lead you in all Truth by his
Word and Spirit. 3. Receive Jesus Christ
as your Soveraign Lord and King to Rule.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43848:68"/>
you. 4. Receive Jesus Christ as your
Captain to tread down your Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
under your feet. 5. Receive Jesus
Christ in all his Relations of Shepherd,
Friend, Brother, and especially in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of an Husband, and joyn your selves
to him, and make over your selves to him,
dedicating and devoting your selves to
him, and giving up your selves to be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
guarded, provided for, and governed
by him. This is to receive Christ, and
this is to Believe, this gives Union and
Relation, and interest in the Lord Jesus,
and if you do thus joyn your selves to
Christ by Faith; you will quickly feel
love to Christ to spring forth, to work and
act, and that vigorously; and to bring
forth such fruit in the life as shall evidently
shew, that love to Christ is rooted in the
Heart.</p>
               <p>4. If you would attain Truth of love to
Jesus Christ, be diligent in the use of all
those means which God hath appointed for
the working of it, I shall instance only in
two means.</p>
               <p>1. Be diligent in Hearing the Word
Preached; as Faith cometh by Hearing,
so love to Christ is wrought by the same
means, <hi>Hear and your Souls shall live,</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:43848:68"/>
saith the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 3. and I may
say, hear that your Hearts may love, that
where the Eye cannot, the Ears may affect
the Heart with love to the Lord Jesus.
Whilst <hi>Lydia</hi> was hearing <hi>Paul</hi> Preach,
her Heart was opened, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 14. and
whilst you are hearing Ministers Preach of
Christ, your Hearts may be opened to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, and to embrace him in the arms
of your dearest love, See <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 15.
<hi>As I began to speak the Holy Ghost fell on
them, as on us at the beginning;</hi> whilst
<hi>Peter</hi> was Preaching and the Gentiles were
hearing, the Holy Ghost was sent down
from Heaven and fell upon upon; and so
whilst you are hearing the Word, God
may give forth of his Spirit to work this
Grace of love to Jesus Christ in your
Hearts.</p>
               <p>2. Be diligent and earnest in Prayer unto
God for this love, confess and bewail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him your want of this love, tell him
you deserve a double <hi>Anathema,</hi> because
you do not love Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and withall tell
him you cannot of your selves love him,
that you can as easily lift a Mountain to
Heaven, as lift up your hearts unto Christ;
but desire that he would draw up your love
to Christ by his Spirit. Beg of him that
he would put out the fire of Lust, and all
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43848:69"/>
inordinate creature-love, and that be would
enkindle a fire of love in you to this most
lovely Jesus, which no corruption in your
Hearts may be able extinguish. And in
your Prayers present your Hearts to the
Lord Jesus, offer them up freely to him,
and desire that he would accept of them,
that he would take hold of them, and take
possession of them and erect his Throne in
them, and an Everlasting habitation for
himself.</p>

               <p>HAving given directions how you may
attain the Truth of love to Christ
where you are without it, I come now to
give directions how you may attain much
of this love to Christ, where you have it
but in a low degree and weak measure.
Would you attain much love to Christ?</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Be much in Contemplation of Christ;
consider often what motives there are of
love in him, presse them upon your Spirits
and labour to awaken and rouze up your
Hearts unto the vigorous exercise of this
love. Spend time in secret retirement, and
there think, and think again, of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Excellencies and Perfections which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43848:69"/>
are in Christ's Person, how wonderfull
and matchless his love is, what heigths in
it that cannot be reached, what depths in it
that cannot be fathomed, what other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
which cannot be comprehended:
Meditate often of his benefits, how incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
his love-tokens be: and whilst you
you are musing, you may feel the fire
burning; whilst you are looking you may
feel your Hearts leaping; whilst you are
taking a view of him, ere you are aware,
your Hearts like the Chariots of</hi> Amina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab,
may run to him: O the ravishments
of love! the transports of Soul! which
some Believers have found in their retired
thoughts and views of Christ. Get often
into the Mount of Divine Contemplation,
and there look upwards unto Heaven, and
think with your selves. Yonder, Yonder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the shining Sun is the more Glorious Son
of Righteousness; there at the right hand of
the Throne of God, is my beloved Iesus the
Son of God seated, and though he be so high
above me both in place and dignity, yet he
thinketh upon me, and pleadeth for me, and
many a gift hath he thence &amp; sent by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
conveyed unto me, and I can ask nothing
of the Father in his name, but, if it be really
for my good, I have it by his means. O
dear Iesus, how lovely art thou in thy self,

slow, slow of Heart to love this dear and
sweet Iesus? awake O my Soul! awake
from thy dulness and stupidity? shake off

the deceitful Riches, the glozing
Pleasures, that are here below: bid adieu
to them, and leave them to those that place

find a room to dispose of it self, and not only a
lodging like that of a wayfaring man for a

and to take up it's Eternal abode; let thy

there where thy Heart hath
been long before. Why dost thou hang down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
O my Soul? why dost thou bend so
much to the Earth and Earthly things?
what is there here below that is not beneath
thee, and altogether unworthy of thy Love?
how empty, and vain, and thorny are these
things? don't wast thy time, weary thy self
for very vanity, don't prick and wound thy
self with these things any more. What
aileth thee O my Soul, that thou art so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the Love of Christ? is it because
thou canst not see Christ with the Eyes of
thy Body? thou shalt see him with those
Eyes hereafter, when he comes in his Glory,
&amp; thy body is raised and repaired, and sitted
to bear such a sight; thou can'st not see the

love upon Iesus Christ and those things

Right hand of God. <hi>Such retired Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
of Christ, and Soliloquies and

the promotion of your love unto Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Would you have much love to Christ?
Be much in Reading and Studying the
Scriptures. The Scriptures are a Glasse
in which Christ may be seen, he cannot
be seen Face to Face in this World, this is
the happiness of the Triumphant Church in
Heaven, not of the Militant Church upon
the Earth; what may here be discerned of
Christ, it is in the glass of the Scriptures and
Gospel-Ordinances: this is that glass spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. We all with open face
beholding as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n a glass the Glory of the
Lord, are changed into the same image
from Glory to Glory.</hi> Christ is the Glory
of the Lord, the brightness of his Fathers
Glory? would you have much love to him,
be often looking, veiwing and beholding
of him in the glass of the Scriptures, by
much beholding of him, you may be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
more and more into the likeness of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43848:72"/>
his Holiness, and into the likeness of his
Love, which is Glory begun. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have the Image of Christ engraven
upon them; the Image of the Father is
upon the Son, and the Image of the Son
is upon the Scriptures; there you may see
the Picture of Christ, the Beauty of Christ,
at least some lineaments are there drawn
by the hand of God, although not fully
and to the life, I mean such you will see
in him when you come to behold him face
to face in Heaven; yet his Beauty is drawn
in such proportions and with such sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
as you are now capable of behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Would you have much love unto
Christ whom you have never seen? look
much upon his Picture and Image in the
Scriptures. The Scriptures are Christs
Love letters. In the second and third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Revelations,</hi> Christ doth send Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Epistles to the Seven <hi>Asian</hi> Churches;
there are many Epistles and Love-letters
as it were in the Scriptures, especially in
the New Testament, wherein Christ doth
give most kind expressions of most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared
Love unto his People. Read much
and study Christ's Love letters, especially
those parts of the Scriptures wherein Christ
doth express most of his kindness and love.
See how kindly Christ doth express him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43848:73"/>
                  <hi>Ioh. 14. v. 1, 2, 3, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19,

21, 22, 23, 24. Chap. 20. v.</hi> 17. Read
often and consider such places. Let the
Word of Christ dwell richly in you, and
his will feed and maintain your love to
Christ, this is a means to have Christ dwell
in your hearts, not onely by Faith, but
also by most endeared Love.</p>
               <p>3. Would you have much Love to
Christ? be much in <hi>Prayer</hi> unto God for
this Love. <hi>Eph. 6. 23. Peace be unto the
Brethren and love with Faith from God
the Father.</hi> Not onely Peace is from God,
who is called the God of Peace, and Faith
from God, who works it by his Almighty
power; but alos Love is from God, who
is the God of Love; he circumciseth the
heart to love himself, and to love his Son.
This love of Christ is a Grace of the Spirit,
which God doth freely give and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
work, the Beginnings of it, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of it, all the Measures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of it are from him; If you would
attain high measures of love to Christ, you
must apply your selves unto God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and therein diligently seek to him for it.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43848:73"/>
If you would have much love to Christ in
your hearts, you must be often at the
Throne of Grace upon your Knees; and
there humbly acknowledge, if not the
want, yet the weakness of your love to
Christ, bewail your Sins which do damp
your Affections, and earnestly request that
he would work your hearts unto a strong
love; be importunate in Prayer for this,
follow God day by day with the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
plead with him for it, fill your
mouths with Arguments, and fill your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
with Faith and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Tell him, whatever lovelinesse and love
there be in Christ, whatever attractives to
draw forth your love, yet of your selves
you are utterly unable to put forth the
least motion of true affection unto Christ.
Tell him, that this love to Christ, though
it be your Duty, yet it is his Gift, that
you ought to act it, but this you cannot
do, unless he works it. Tell him how
easily he can enkindle this Fire of Love
to Christ in your bosoms, and blow it up
into a flame. Tell him, he hath bid you
to ask and you shall have, and whatever
you ask according to his will he heareth,
and that it is his will you should love
Christ not onely truely but also strongly.
Tell him, you desire much love to Christ,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43848:74"/>
and that these desires do come from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and therefore earnestly desire the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of them. Tell him, if you do not
love Christ much, you shall be apt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love
the Creature, which will be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to him, therefore request that you
may have such a love to Christ as may
overpower all other love, and keep your
hearts from all Inordinacy of affections
to any thing beneath and besides the Lord
Jesus Christ. Plead how much it will be
for his Glory, that you should have much
love unto Christ, that hereby you shall
be enabled to honour him the more in the
world. Plead how much it will be for
your good; tell him, if you asked Corn
and Wine and Oyl; if you asked Wealth
and Honours, and Creature-delights in
abundance, they might be a snare to you,
and for your hurt; but a strong love to
Christ is needfull and usefull, and be sure
will be for your good; urge his Promise
of <hi>Circumcising the heart to love him,</hi> and
plead his Faithfulness; and if you be thus
importunate in Prayer for much love to
Christ, and will not be denyed, you shall
not be denyed.</p>
               <p>4. Would you have much Love to
Christ, get much Faith. Faith worketh
Love both to the Father and to the Son;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43848:74"/>
According to the measure of your Faith,
so will the measure of your Love be: Such
as are without any Faith, are without any
Love; such as have but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeble faith,
have but a weak love; and such as have
the strongest faith, have the strongest love.
The strongest faith giveth the clearest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Christs infinite Excellencies and
Perfections; It is not the eye of Sense
which doth discern Christ, neither is it the
eye of Reason which doth discern him;
whatever discoveries we have of Christ,
it is by Revelation, and this is discernable
onely by Faith. Faith is the Evidence of
things not seen, and the unseen Christ is
evident by Faith to be the most excellent
Person, and the most sutable Object of
love, and the more evident the Object
of love is, the stronger will the love be.
Moreover, Faith is not onely the Eye of
the Soul to discern Christ, but also the
Hand of the Soul, not onely to take hold
on him, but also to receive from him of
his Fulness Grace for Grace, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
more of this Grace of love to
him. Our Communion with Christ is by
Faith; the more intimate acquaintance
and fellowship we have with those whom
we love, the more endeared will be our
love; the strongest Faith brings us unto
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43848:75"/>
the greatest intimacy, fellowship and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
with Christ, and therefore it is
a means of the strongest Love. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
then to get a strong Faith, and to
live daily in the powerfull exercise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
the more you live by Faith, the more
you will dwell in the Love of Christ.</p>
               <p>5. Would you have much Love unto
Christ? labour for much of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

There must be not onely the Glass of the
Scriptures, and the Eye of Faith, but also
the Light of the Spirit, that you may have
a clear discerning of this lovely Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;
Labour for much of the Operation
of the Spirit; the Spirit is like Wind to
blow up the Sparks of Love in your hearts
into a flame. Labour for the inhabitation
of the Spirit, and that the Promise may
be made good to you which Christ giveth
to his Disciples. <hi>Ioh. 14. 16, 17. And I will
pray the Father, and he shall give you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Comforter, that he may abide with
you for ever; even the Spirit of Truth,
whom the World cannot receive, because it
seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but
ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and
shall be in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:43848:75"/>
6. Would you have much Love unto
Christ? labour for clear Evidences of his
Love unto you; the apprehensions of
Christ's Loveliness may excite to some
love, but the full well grounded perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Christs love to you, will above
all heighten your love to Christ. Doubts
of Christ's love do cause fears, and fears
do contract the heart, and therefore are
opposite to love, which is the expansion
and enlargement of the heart; perfect
love casteth out fear, the more love, the
less fear, and the more doubts and fears
the less love. Such as doubt much of
Christs love to them, they may love Christ
truely, but they cannot love Christ strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
You will love a less lovely person that
loves you, more than a more lovely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that hates you; the love of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
beloved is a most amiable Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and strong attractive, yea one of the
greatest Incentives and Inducements unto
love. Get then a perswasion of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
love to you of this Infinitely lovely
person, that you may be able to say with
<hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>Who loved me, and gave
himself for me.</hi> Look diligently into the
Word of God, and find out the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
there of those that are Beloved by
Christ; and then look narrowly into your
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43848:76"/>
selves, and see whether your face will
not answer that face in the Looking glass
of the Scriptures; see whether you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find the lineaments of the New Man
within you, whether you have not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
a gracious change; Is there not
Light where there was Darkness? Is there
not Life where there was Death? Is there
not Love where there was Hatred? Is
there not the Law of God written, where
the Law of Sin did command all? Is not
the Biass of your Wills and Hearts God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and Christ-ward, and Heaven-ward?
which heretofore was onely Sin-ward and
Earth-ward and Hell-ward? Pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
unto God, that he would give you
a full assurance, that if you are indeed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
called, if you are indeed united
and related unto Jesus Christ, you may
know it, and no longer doubt thereof. In
a word, seek diligently after the Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Christ's Love in all the wayes of
his Ordinances; rest not in the out-side
of Ordinances, but seek after Christ in
Ordinances, follow him from Sabbath to
Sabbath, from Ordinance to Ordinance,
and always be looking for him, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards him, till he turn about and
look upon you, and give you a gracious
smile; seek and wait for that Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43848:76"/>
of himself which he hath promised to
hem that love him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21. Wait
for his Mission of the Holy Ghost from
Heaven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. to shed abroad the
sense of his Love into your hearts, <hi>Rom.
5.</hi> 5. and if you did know assuredly and
had a sense hereof given unto you by the
Spirit of Christ, O the Joyes which then
you would have in him! O the love which
then you would have to him! As your
Joyes would be unspeakable, so your
Love would be unspeakable too; such a
warmth of heart and burning of love to
Christ you would feel within you, as is
beyond the Rhetorick of the Tongue to
set forth.</p>
               <p>7. Would you have much Love to
Christ? get much hatred of Sin, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
watch and pray, and strive and
fight against Sin, as the worst of Evils, as
that which doth so much displease your
Lord. Bewail sins of daily incursion, and
labour that your sins of Infirmity may be
less every day than other; Take heed of
sins of sudden surprize, but chiefly of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
sins, and that you comply not with
any temptations unto grosser miscarriages,
which like water cast upon the Fire of
your love to Christ, will put out the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43848:77"/>
flame, and leave onely a few unperceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
sparks in the corner of your hearts.
Suffer not Sinne to have any room
in your hearts, or if it will abide and
you cannot thrust it quite out, let it not
have a quiet habitation within you; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
sin as much as you can, wage war
every day with your remaining Lusts, let
no day pass over your heads without giving
some blows, some thrusts and wounds to
Sin. St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eighten the room of Sin in your
hearts as much as may be; the more room
Sin hath in your hearts, the less room
Christ will have there. Particularly, take
heed of inordinate love to the world, and
the things in the world, the prevalency
of which love will damp your love to
Christ; by how much more the world
gets of your love, by so much the less
Christ will have of it. A subordinate love
you may have to Persons and Things in
the world, but let no person or thing have
your chief love but only Christ; love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for it self with an abstracted love,
but love all inferiour things with inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
love, love all under the Lord, and in the
Lord, and for the Lord's sake; get all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
affections to the world crucified
by the Cross of Christ. You must have
dying affections to perishing things, if you
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43848:77"/>
would have a living and active love to the
ever-living Jesus.</p>
               <p>8. Would you have much love unto
Christ? associate your selves most with
those that have most love unto Christ; you
may fetch light from their light, &amp; you may
fetch warmth from their Fire; dead coals
are enkindled by the living, and your dead
hearts may be enkindled with love to
Christ by the warm discourse of those that
have warm hearts. Be ready to speak
of Christ and for Christ in any company
as you have sit opportunity, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
watch for an Occasion; shut your ears
against and reprove profane &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication;
divert that which is vain and
frothy, and be ready to begin and promote
that which is serious &amp; savoury, that which
is gracious and may tend to your own
and others Edification: Study the Art, and
practise it, of provoking all whom you
converse withall, not unto Strife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
but unto this love and Affection
unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and whilest
you are endeavouring to warm others
with this Love, you may be warmed your
selves.</p>
               <p>9. And lastly, Would you have much
Love unto Christ? be much in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of this love, hereby it is encreased
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43848:78"/>
and heightned; Use legs and have legs;
and if you act this love frequently, it will
hereby get strength and Activity; every
day endeavour to put forth some vigorous
acts of love unto Jesus Christ. In your
ordinary Callings and secular Business and
Employment, you may send up some looks
of Love unto Jesus Christ in your Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
But especially in the Duties of
Gods immediate Worship, labour that
your love may flow out unto Christ most
vigorously. In your daily secret Devotion
and Family-Worship, let love to Christ
draw forth tears from your eyes, at least
cause grief and sorrow in your hearts, in
the acknowledgement of your sins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath been dishonoured and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Let love to Christ draw forth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desires after Christ, and those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
manifestations, and consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which he doth give to none but such
as are his; let love to Christ put requests
into your mouths, arguments into your
requests, and fervour into your arguments
in your pleadings with him at the Throne
of Grace for further supplyes of his Grace,
and that you may be brought into more
intimacy of acquaintance with him. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day you should express your love to
Christ, especially on the Lords day, when
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43848:78"/>
almost the whole day is to be spent in
publick and private Exercises of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship, in all your love to Christ
should be in exercise; in your attendances
upon him in Ordinances you most bring
not only your Bodies before him, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
your Hearts unto him; this you
should be carefull to do in publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Hearing of the Word, Preaching
and Singing Psalms; often should you
endeavour in every Ordinance to lift up
your hearts unto the Lord; but above all
when you approach the Lords Table, all
your Graces should there and then be in
exercise, especially this Grace of love to
Jesus Christ, your Eye there should affect
your Heart, when you see the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of your crucified Lord, and think
what manner of Love he did bear to
you, that he should submit himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a Death for you, how should this
affect your hearts! And if ever, then
your Love to Christ should shew it
self, and act with the greatest vigour
and strength.</p>

               <p>HAving given Directions how to at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain
love to Christ in the truth and
in the strength of it, I come now to the

shew your love to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>More generally shew your Love to
Christ in your Obedience unto Christ, <hi>Ioh.
14. 15. If ye love me, keep my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
Be faithfull in the performance of
all known Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies which Christ doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and be carefull in the forbearance
of all known sins which Christ doth forbid;
let your great care be to please Christ,
whoever is displeased; and your great fear
be of offending Christ, whoever be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with your strictness. Shew your love,
1. In the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of your Obedience,
2. In the <hi>Willingness</hi> of your Obedience,
3. In the <hi>Vniversality</hi> of your Obedience,
4. In the <hi>Constancy</hi> of your Obedience.</p>
               <p>1. Shew your love to Christ, in the <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi>
of your Obedience. Hypocrites will
do some things which Christ commandeth,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43848:79"/>
but it is from carnal Motives and with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Designs; But let love to Christ be
the Motive, and the Honour of Christ the
End of your Obedience; obey Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you love him, and with a design to
please him; what you do, do heartily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, and above all things desire
and endeavour that what you doe may find
acceptation with him. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 9. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we labour, that whether present or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
we may be accepted of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Shew your love to Christ in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness.</hi>
of your Obedience; some will
obey Christ, but it is with great Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
they will perform Duties, but
they are burdensome, a weariness, and
toilsome, and the Commandements of
Christ are grievous unto them; they are
scarce ready unto any Duty, but when
they are scourg'd unto it by the Rods of
Affliction, or spurr'd and prickt forward
by the goads of Conscience; O the listles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and indisposition in the most, unto the
most spiritual part of the Service of Christ!
which is an evident proof of the defect of
love, either in the truth of it, or at least
in the measure and degree of it. Let your
love shew it self in the <hi>willingness</hi> of your
Obedience, serve the Lord with a willing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43848:80"/>
and ready mind, with alacrity and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of spirit, looking upon the Service
of Christ as your Honour, and esteeming
every Duty to be your Priviledge: If you
have any constraints unto Obedience, let
them be the constraints of love; as 2 <hi>Cor.
5.</hi> 14. If you be forced to obey Christ,
let there be no violence but the violence
If love; if you be drag'd to Duty, let it
oe with no other cords than the cords of
bove; let love be the Spur and Goad to
prick you forward, that you may not onely
walk but run in the wayes of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
with an enlarged heart.</p>
               <p>3. Shew your love to Christ in the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality</hi>
of your Obedience. Hypocrites

their turn, and will serve their carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;
other duties they omit and totally

it self in your respect to all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
though you cannot here attain
Perfection of Obedience, yet l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t your
Obedience be universal; obey Christ not
only in open Duties, which men are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of, but also in secret Duties, and
spiritual Duties, which depend upon the
exercise of the Mind, such as Meditation,
Contemplation, Self-search, and Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43848:80"/>
as also in the spiritual part of all
Duties, which no Eye can be witness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
but the Eye of God; and hereby you
may be distinguished from all Hypocrites
in the world.</p>
               <p>4. Shew your love to Christ in the
<hi>Constancy</hi> of your Obedience. <hi>Gal. 5. 7.
Ye did run well, who did hinder you, that
ye should not obey the truth?</hi> Some Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
are zealous Professors for a while,
and at first setting out seem to outstrip
many that are sincere, but they soon tire,
and are weary not onely <hi>in</hi> well-doing but
<hi>of</hi> it; they quickly s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not onely fall down, but fall off; not only
fall back, but fall away, and turn fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Apostates. Shew your love to Christ
not onely in setting out well, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
your Christian course well unto
the end of the course of your Lives; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
well, and patiently continue in well-doing:
Persevere in your Obedience; <hi>Be
not weary in well-doing,</hi> knowing that <hi>in
due time ye shall reap if ye faint not,</hi> Gal.
6. 9. And if you <hi>be faithfull unto death,</hi>
Christ hath promised to <hi>give you the Crown
of Life,</hi> Rev. 2. 10.</p>
               <p>More particularly, shew your love to
Christ, 1. In your learning, keeping,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43848:81"/>
asserting and maintaining of Christ's truths.
2. In your publick spiritedness and zeal for
Christs honour and interest. 3. In your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
resistance and opposition of Christs
Enemies. 4. In your Following of Christ's
example. 5. In your readiness to take up
and patiently to bear Christs cross. 6. In
your desires after Christs presence here,
a longing for Christ's second appearance
at the last day.</p>
               <p>1. Shew your love to Christ in your
learning, keeping, asserting and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ's Truths. 1. Learn Christ's
Truths, acquaint your selves by diligent
reading of the Scriptures, and other books
that may be a help hereunto, with all fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
truths of the Christian Religion
in the first place, and so go on and proceed
further to learn those truths which are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructory;
and whatever truths you
find a Foundation for in the Scriptures
which are the word of Truth, receive them,
not only in the light of them, but also in
the love of them; if the branches of truths
be in your heads, and the leaves of them
in your profession, and the fruit of them
in your actions, let the root of them be in
your Hearts. 2. Having learned the
truths of Christ as they are in Jesus, let
them not hang loose in your understandings
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43848:81"/>
but get them fastened and fixed, and close
girt about the loins of your mindes; hold
the truths of Christ fast, prize them above
all jewels, don't part with them upon any
terms, let all go, estate, liberty and life it self,
rather than any of this rich treasure which
Christ hath entrusted you withal. 3. Assert the
truths of Christ; be not ashamed or afraid to
own any truths of Christ in the most adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
&amp; gainsaying generation, profess your
belief of Christ and of the truths of Christ,
endeavour that the light of these truths may
shine abroad, and cast forth such bright
beams in the dark world where you live,
that others may be brought hereby unto
the knowledge of the Truth. 4. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to maintain Christ's truths, earnestly
contend for the Doctrine of Faith once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the Saints, endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
gainsayers, and to defend Christ's
truths against those corrupt and erroneous
opinions and Doctrins, which like leaven
is very apt to spread and infect the mindes
of men.</p>
               <p>2. Shew your love to Christ in your pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
spiritedness, and zeal for Christ's
honour and interest: let your affections be
publick not private, narrow, contracted
and centring in self; let your love be a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43848:82"/>
publick and general love, Love not only
Relations, but love all Christ's disciples,
though of different Perswasions and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
because of the image of Christ, &amp; love
not only your Friends that love you, but
also your Enemies that hate you, because
of the command of Christ. Let your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
be publick desires, desire the welfare
of the univeral Church, and of all Gods
people throughout the world, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
Pray for their Peace and Prosperity,
and endeavour as you have opportunity to
promote the publick good more than your
own private advantage; seek not your own
things, but the things of Jesus Christ. Let
your griefs be publick griefs, grieve not
only for your own sins, but also for the sins
of others, whereby Christ is dishonoured in
the world; grieve not only for your own
afflictions, but also for the afflictions of
<hi>Ioseph, Heb. 13, 3. Remember them that
are in bonds, as bound with them, and them
which suffer adversity, as being your selvs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in the body.</hi> You are in the same mystical
body with all Christ's afflicted members,
and when some members suffer, the rest
should suffer too, by way of sympathy.
Bleeding in their wounds and grieving in
their sorrows, be ready also to relieve any,
especially Christ's disciples when they are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43848:82"/>
in distresse and want according to your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
and as you have opportunity. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all your Talents for your Masters glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and endeavour to promote the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the Lord Jesus unto the utmost of
your abilities. 1. In reference to those
which are without. If you are called your
selves, labour to call others unto Christ, as
<hi>Andrew</hi> called <hi>Peter, Phillip</hi> called <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel</hi>
unto the <hi>Messias, Iohn</hi> 1. 40, 41.
44, 45. If you have found the <hi>Messias,</hi>
or rather have been found of him, let your
love to Christ, and love to Souls prompt
you, to endeavour the Conversion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that are your Relations, your Friends
and Acquaintances. Put your unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Friends in mind of their miserable
Estates whilst under the guilt and reigning
power of sin, whil'st slaves to the Devil
and their own lusts; mind them of Death
and the fearful consequences thereof to all
unpardoned sinners; tell them of Christ
that he is the only Saviour and Redeemer
of Mankind. How able and willing he is
to save them, if they seek after him and
apply themselves unto him; tell them that
not long since you were in the same estate
with themselves, living in the practice of
the same sins and going on in the same way
to destruction; and that the Lord hath
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43848:83"/>
shewed mercy unto you in your Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and bringing you into a state of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
tell them that there is mercy also for
them if they look after it, that Gods Grace
is most free, his mercy most plentiful, that
Christ is most Gracious and casteth out
none that come unto him: tell them of the
amiablenesse of Christ's Person, of the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
love which he hath shewn to fallen
mankind in his dying for them; and that
though he were dead, yet he is alive and
lives for evermore to intercede for all them
that make choice of him, &amp; make use of him
for their Advocate. Therefore perswade
them that they would break off their sins
by Repentance, which otherwise will be the
ruine both of their bodies and of their Souls
in Hell, and without delay that they would
come unto Christ and accept of him upon
Gospel-terms. If any of you cannot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
these arguments well your selves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them, if you can, to hear such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and Sermons, as through Gods
blessing have been effectual for your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and thus you may be instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to augment the Kingdom of Christ,
which is one of the best ways of expressing
your love unto Christ. 2. In reference to
them which are within; labour to promote
the interest of Christ amongst them that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43848:83"/>
are truly Gracious, by vigorous endeavors
to strengthen and establish them, to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
and encourage them in the wayes of the
Lord: Communicate the experiences
which you have had, as you see there is real
need, and it may tend not so much to your
praise as your Masters honour. Labour
in your places to be both shineing and
burning lights; be forward to every good
word and work. Look upon your selves
as the devoted Servants of Christ, and that
you are not your own, and therefore lay
out your selves to the utmost for him, and
give all diligence to glorifie him with your
bodies and spirits, with your Estates and
interests, with your gifts and talents, all
which are his, and ought to be at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
               <p>3. Shew your love to Christ in your vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
resistance and opposition of Christ's
Enemies. There are three grand Enemies of
Christ which you are by your Baptisme en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to fight against, namely the Devil,
the Flesh, and the World which war both
against Christ, and against your Souls.
This Trinity of Adversaries agree in one,
and combine together against his anointed,
doing their utmost endeavour to break his
bands, to untye his cords, and to unhinge
his Government; they would pluck the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43848:84"/>
Crown off of Christ's head could they
reach it, and the Scepter out of his hand,
they would devest Christ if they could of
all his power here on Earth, and confine
him to his territories in Heaven; but all
their attempts in this kind have been and
will be in vain, Christ hath tryed the
strength of these Enemies; and hath van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
them, but still some life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is left with them to war against the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seed; you are Christs Souldiers, listed
under his banner, shew your fidelity and
your love to your Captain and General,

fight the good fight of Faith, resist unto
blood, don't yeild upon any account; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully
turn away the Eye and Ear when
these Enemies would entice and allure you,
and stoutly make resolute opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, when they do most furiously
assault you; hearken to no suggestions of
the Devil, temptations of the world or
motions of the Flesh which would induce
and draw you into ways of sin, or which
would force and drive you out of the ways
of Christ; resist and oppose, and labour
to gain some victories over these adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
every day, especially get conquest
over the Flesh, and the other two will be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43848:84"/>
soon vanquished; Christ shewed his love
to you in submitting himself to be Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for you, do you shew your love to
Christ in Crucifying your Flesh with its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and lusts for his sake, in your self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial
and mortifying the deeds of the
body, when you deny your Carnal Reason
your carnal Wisedome, your carnal will,
your carnal Affections, your carnal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
all inordinacies of your sensual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
for the sake of Christ; when you crush
pride, Envy, Revenge, Malice, inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
anger, inordinate love, inordinate
desire, inordinate grief, lustfullness and all
evil concupiscence for the sake and because
of the command of Christ, all these are
acts and evidences of love to Christ, and
herein you should exercise your selves
daily.</p>
               <p>4. Shew your love to Christ in your
following of his example, discover your
affection unto him in your imitation of him,
in writing after his copy, in treading in his
steps, in walking as Christ himself walked,
when he was here upon the Earth, shew
your love to Christ by labouring after like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto Christ, that you may be like
him both in your inward disposition and
in your outward conversation: Christ was
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43848:85"/>
lowly, be you humble and mean in your
own esteem: Christ was meek, be you
gentle, easie to be intreated, and not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provoked: Christ loved God, let God
be the object of your love: Christ hated
sin, let sin also be the object of your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred:
Christ contemned the world, do you
get crucifyed affections unto it. Christ
was compassionate to those that were in
distresse, do you labour for the like bowels.
Christ used to Worship publickly in the
Synagogues, to pray with his Disciples,
and to spend time also in secret prayer, do
you give your attendance in the publick
assemblies of Gods people, worship God
in your Families, and be often upon your
knees at the Throne of Grace in secret.
Christ's mind was a heavenly mind, let
the same mind be in you as was in Christ.
Christ's will was submissive to his Fathers
will, let the same will be in you as was
in Christ. Christ's words were Gracious
and edifying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let your speech be always
with Grace, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oury and which may be
for edification. Christ's life was an active
life, he was always doing good, and he
was exactly holy in all his actions, be you
active and diligent in the service of God
in doing good to others, and be holy as
Christ was holy in all manner of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43848:85"/>
thus should you shew your love to
Christ in following Christs example, and
in imitating of him in every thing wherein
you are capable of such imitation.</p>
               <p>5. shew your love to Christ in your readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to take up and patiently bear Christ's
cross: I don't say you should desire suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for Christ, but sure I am that strong
love to Christ will not permit you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
them; don't go out of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s way for
them, neither go out of God's way from
them, if you meet with the cross in the way
of duty, don't either turn back, or start aside,
but chearfully take it up, &amp; when you have
got it up, patiently bear it, and don't throw
it off, till God take it off; when it is your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to suffer for Christ, look upon it also to
be your priviledge and be glad of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
rejoycing that you have any
thing to part withal for the sake of Christ,
if it be good name, or good estate, or good
Friends, if it be liberty or life it self; such
expressions of love are very honourable
and very pleasing to your Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
               <p>6. And lastly, Shew your love to Christ
in your desires after Christ's presence here,
and in your longing for his second appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43848:86"/>
at the last day. 1. Desire Christ's
Gracious presence here, and the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof, that according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
he would come unto you, that he
would draw near, and that you might feel
that he is near; desire that you might have
clearer discoveries of Christ, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
communion and fellowship with
Christ; above all company and fellowship,
desire the company fellowship and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with Christ, that you might
walk with him and converse with him, and
that there might be a dayly intercourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and your souls, and that all
distances between you, and strangeness
might be removed; let your love express
it self in desires after Christ when he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and in delights when he is present;
rejoice in the Lord exceedingly when he
doth manifest himself unto you graciously,
admire his beauty and delight in his smiles,
admire his love and delight in the perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his favour, let the actings of your
love, and the workings of it, be such to
your beloved dayly. 2. Desire also and
long for the second appearance of Christ at
the last day; when he saith, <hi>Surely I come
quickly,</hi> do you say, <hi>Amen, Even so come
Lord Iesus.</hi> Look upon time as slow of
heel and wing, that it runs no faster, that

it flies no swifter; look to the End of

Christ come down from the Throne of
God with such Brightness of Majesty,
and Brightness of Beauty, as will trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
you with Wonder and Joy. Say,
<hi>When Lord Iesus wilt thou take to thy
self thy great Power, and cloath thy self
with thy Authority, and come down to
judge the World? when wilt thou open the
everlasting gates of Heaven which have
been shut so long? When wilt thou descend
from Heaven with a shout, with the sound
of the great Trumpet, and send thine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to gather all thine Elect from the four
Winds, that all who love thee may meet
in one Society? when shall we put on our
Garments of Immortality, and be caught
up in the Clouds to meet thee in the day
of thy Triumph? When shall the day of
our Coronation come, and of our admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into the Glorious Mansions which thou
hast prepared for us in the Glorious Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
which is above? When wilt thou
shew us thy self, and give us to behold
thee face to face? When wilt thou shew
us the Father, and give us to behold him
immediately without a Glass? When wilt

thou shew us thy Glory which thou had<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>
and give us not onely to see it, but also to
share in it? When wilt thou open the Trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of thy Love, and receive us into the
nearest, closest, and sweetest embracements
thereof, and give us to drink of those
Rivers of Pleasures which are with thee?
O hasten Lord, hasten thy glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
that thou mayest be Glorified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole World, and we be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with thee, that we may be then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to live with thee, and reign with thee,
and be made perfectly happy in the full
and everlasting enjoyment of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have done with these Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the last thing in this Use of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>And what do you now say after all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to excite and perswade you to the
Love of Christ, and Directions therein?
shall all be in vain?</p>
               <p>What do you say, Sinners? shall Christ
have your hearts or no? will you har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
base lusts in your hearts, that will
damn you, and keep out the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ who alone can save you? shall
I gain no hearts for Christ by all may
Sermons which I have preached concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Love of Christ? My Lord and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43848:87"/>
Master hath sent me to woe you, to win
your hearts for him; may I speed or
no? shall my Message be accepted, and
Jesus Christ the most lovely person find
entertainment with you? If any person
or thing in the world which you do most
dearly love, do so well deserve your
love, lock your ears still against all my
words, and let them perish like an empty
sound in the Air; lock your hearts against
Christ, who stands knocking at the door,
and give an absolute and peremptory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
to give him any room there; But
if in the whole world you cannot find
out a suitable Beloved besides Christ, if
there be nothing here below but is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of your hearts, if all inferiour
things whilest they have your chief Love
do debase you and defile you, and unless
your hearts be taken off from them, will
certainly ruine and destroy you everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
O then be perswaded without any
further delay to open the everlasting doors
of your hearts, to let Christ into them,
and set Christ up in the highest seat of
your Affections; O be perswaded to give
Christ your chief Love, to give him your
Heart, and your whole heart; with grief
and hatred let go your hold of sin, and
embrace the Lord Jesus Christ in the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43848:88"/>
Arms of your dearest Love. And then I
would say to you as our Saviour did to
<hi>Zacheus</hi> when he gave him entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his house, <hi>This day is Salvation
come unto you.</hi> O happy day unto you!
O happy you that ever you were born,
if this day Christ should be heartily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by you! This then would be
the day of your Conversion, in which
the Angels would rejoyce; and though
Grief and Trouble might invade you for
a while because of your sin, yet this would
make way for your spiritual Joy; weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
might endure for a Night, but joy
would come in the Morning; but O the
Joy which you will then have in the day
of your Coronation, when all tears shall
be wiped away from your Eyes, and
when you shall have admission into the
glorious presence of the Lord, where
there is Fulness of Joy and Pleasures for
Evermore.</p>
               <p>And what do you say, Believers? you
that have some Love to Christ, shall this
Doctrine, and these Sermons which I
have preached, be a means to raise and
heighten your Love? Your Love hath
been too much mixed, will you love
Christ more purely? your love hath been
very weak, will you love Christ more
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43848:88"/>
strongly? Your Love to Christ hath been
but a spark, shall it now break forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a flame? after such blowings, shall
there be no burnings? When you think
of Christs Person so amiable, his Love so
incomparable, his Benefits so ine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>timable,
shall not this fire your hearts? and will
you not now love him more dearly and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
than ever? will you be perswaded
to get off your hearts from Earth and
Earthly things, and get up your hearts
to your Lord which is in Heaven, and to
settle your Love there upon him, so as
never to withdraw it from him any more?
Will you love the Lord Jesus much,
whom you can never love too much?
will you now dwell in the Love of
Christ, and be more frequent and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervent
in the actings of it? Then O what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
would you find in your Love! and
what sweetness in the sense of Christs
Love! This would be the surest Evidence
that Christ loveth you, because Christ
loveth first; and how would this sweeten
your passage through the Valley of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and through the Valley of Death.
This would sweeten a bitter cup, and make
a sweet cup more sweet. In Life, the sense
of Christs Love will be better than life;
but at Death this will be the onely stay
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43848:89"/>
and support which you can have, nothing
else can give any well-grounded comfort
in a dying hour. Death rageth and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Tyrant every where, shooteth his
Arrowes hither and thither, sometimes
he smiteth those that are Elder than your
selves, and sometimes those that are
Younger; sometimes those that are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than your selves, sometimes those that
are stronger; sometimes those that are
better, sometimes those that are worse;
sometimes the righteous are smitten,
sometimes the wicked; sometimes the
profane, and sometimes the Professors;
that all might be awakened to prepare.
And what is it that can give you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
when you come to the sides of the
pit? You may have the Love of your
dear Yoke-fellowes, weeping and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at your Bed-side, Children Kindred
and Friends wringing their hands, and
looking with a pitifull countenance upon
you, grieving to part with you, but
what comfort can all their Love yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your departing Spirits? their Love
may disturb you, and make you the more
unwilling to dye and leave them, because
they are so unwilling to part with you.
But the Love of Christ and sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
will be a Comfort indeed, because he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43848:89"/>
is a Friend whom you are not departing
from, but going unto, and O the delight
which then you may have, when Friends
look most sad, and Death looks most
grim, when the trembling Joynts, the

love him, and will manifest my

            </epigraph>
            <p>WE read, <hi>Luk. 4. 22. And all bare
him witness, and wondred at the
gracious words which proceeded out of his
mouth.</hi> Never did such gracious and sweet
words drop from the lips of any man that
ever lived, as those from the lips of Christ
when he was here upon the Earth; and
of all Christ's words, those which he spake
to his Disciples in his last Sermon, before
his last Suffering, in the 14, 15, and 16
Chapters of <hi>Iohn,</hi> are superlatively sweet,
and none more sweet in this Sermon than
the words of my Text read unto you, <hi>And
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43848:91"/>
he that loveth me shall be loved of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I will love him, and will manifest
my self unto him.</hi> In the former part of
the verse we have the Character of one
that doth truely love Christ: <hi>He that
hath my Commandements and keepeth them,
he it is that loveth me.</hi> In the latter part of
the verse which is my Text, we have the
Priviledge of one that doth truely love
Christ, and that is in three Promises which
Christ doth make unto him: 1. <hi>He that
loveth me shall be loved of my Father.
2. And I will love him. 3. And will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
my self unto him.</hi> It is the last of these
Promises which I shall speak unto by way
of <hi>Appendix</hi> unto my Treatise of the Love
which true Christians have and ought to
have unto Christ, and that is the Promise
of Christs manifesting himself unto such
as love him. And the Doctrine is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That Christ will manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

1. What it is for Christ to manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
2. That Christ will manifest himself
to them that love him. 3. How Christ
doth manifest himself unto such. 4. When
Christ doth manifest himself unto such.
5. Where Christ doth manifest himself
unto such as love him. 6. And lastly, make
some Application.</p>

               <p>1. Christ doth manifest himself when
he maketh a clearer discoverie unto His
Disciples of the excellency of His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

darker apprehensions of before; and this
is done when Christ doth more fully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

enlightened unto a more spiritual discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the surpassing Beauty and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in Christ's person, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of whom the most enlightned
Christians are capable of further growth
unto the end of their life, hence that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation

               </p>
               <p>2. Christ doth manifest himself, when
he maketh a deep impression, and giveth
a sweet sense to his Disciples of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
Christ is never really absent from
such as Love him, but he may Seem to be
so sometimes, they may apprehend him
to be a far off, he may and often doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the sense of his presence; <hi>Cant. 5, 6.
I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had
withdrawn himself and was gone.</hi> Christ
doth manifest himself, when he doth
draw near to his people, and maketh
them feel that he is near, giving them a
sweet sense of his presence through the
powerful breathings of his Spirit upon
them, whereby their hearts are quickned
and enlarged, and drawn forth towards
himself, and their graces excited unto
powerful exercise.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>And chiefly Christ doth Manifest
Himself, when He makes discovery of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43848:92"/>
His Love unto them that love him; when
He gives them to see not only the beauty
of His face, but also the smiles of His
face, when He gives them to behold the
amiableness of His countenance, and
withall lifts up upon them the light of
His countenance, when he sheddeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
the sense of His Love into their
hearts, giving them a full perswasion of
His special Love unto them, and also a
sweet sense thereof. Thus Christ doth
sometime look kindly, and speak kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto his people, and this sweet
Language is not spoken to the ear of
the body, but inwardly by His Spirit to
to their souls, when he saith to the soul,</hi>
I am thy salvation and thy Saviour, I have
loved thee with an everlasting Love, and
my Love is vnchangeable; The Mountains
shall depart and the hills be removed, but
my loving kindness shall never depart,
and be removed from thee; I have given
my self for thee, and I have given my self
unto thee, and I will never repent of this
gift; I have chosen thee for my self, called
and joyned thee unto my self, and I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
repent of this choice, nor suffer thee
to be disjoyned from me for ever; I have
thee upon my heart, and keep thee in my
hand, and no powers of Earth or Hell shall
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43848:93"/>
be able to pluck thee thence; I have given
thee my grace, and I will shew thee my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and ere long I will appear in the world
and receive thee to my self, that where I am
there thou mayest be also. Dry up then thy
tears, clear up thy countenance, banish thy
fears, droop no longer, dispond no more,
but be of good chear, thy sins are forgiven
thee, thy name is written in my book which
none can blot out, Thou hast a true Love
for me, and my Father himself loveth thee,
and I love thee with a most endeared Love,
and therefore do not question or doubt of
my Love any more. <hi>Thus Christ doth
manifest himself and his Love sometimes
unto drooping disponding souls.</hi>

               <p>2. THat Christ will manifest himself
unto them that love him, appears,
in that His Love doth engage Him, and
His word doth engage Him hereunto. His
Love doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngage Him, The Love of
Christ is like fire, that cannot conceal it
self long, and no fire so strong, and hath
such a vehement flame as the Love of
Christ to His people. <hi>Ioseph</hi> had a great
love to his Brethren notwithstanding all
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43848:93"/>
their unkindness, and although he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
himself for a while, and spake
roughly unto them, yet after they were
sensible of their fault, and were filled
with perplexing fears, he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
himself no longer from them, as in
<hi>Gen. 45. 1. Then Ioseph could not refrain
himself before all that stood by him, he
wept alou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and said unto his brethren, I
am Ioseph,</hi> and ver. 4. <hi>Ioseph said unto his
brethren, come near me, I am Ioseph your
brother whom ye sold into Egypt.</hi> So Christ
may conceal himself for a while from his
people, whatever love he hath to them,
and whatever they have to him; some
unkindnesses they have shewn may be the
cause of this hiding, but when they are
sensible of their fault, full of grief and
perplexity for their offences, his Love
will not permit him to hid himself much
longer; His Love will engage Him to
manifest and discover himself, and say, I
am Jesus your Saviour, come near me my
brethren, come near me, that you may
have a clearer view of me, that ye may
know me and know that I do love you.
The Word also of Christ doth engage him
manifest Himself unto them that Love
Him: It is Christs promise here in the
Text, <hi>He that loveth me shall be loved of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43848:94"/>
my Father, and I will Love him, and will
manifest my self unto him.</hi> Christs word
is sure, True and faithfull is Christs name;
the ordinances of the heaven may sooner
fail, than Christ fail of His Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>

               <p>3. HOw Christ doth manifest Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto them that Love him.</p>
               <p>1. Christ doth here in this world mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
himself but in part and darkly. The
soul is not now capable of the fullest and
clearest Manifestation of Christs, This is
a happiness reserved for the other world,
1. <hi>Ioh. 3. 2. Beloved now are we the sons
of God, and it doth not yet appear what we
shall be; but we know that when he shall
appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see
him as he is, Ioh. 17. 24. Father I will that
they also whom thou hast given me be with
me where I am, that they may behold my
glory which thou hast given me.</hi> It is Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
that Christs Disciples shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
like unto Christ, and shall have a
perfect manifestation of Christ, that they
shall see him as he is: It is Hereafter that
they shall behold his glory; The lustre
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43848:94"/>
and brightness of Christs glory is so
great that should he now let forth the
beams thereof upon them, it would da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle
and amaze them, it would strike them
blinde, yea it would strike them dead;
there is need, because of their weakness,
that Christ should keep a veil on his face,
when he makes discovery of himself, they
cannot now bear the full patefaction and
manifestation of Christ; therefore Christ
doth discover himself but in part. As
the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> saith concerning <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>
wisdom and prosperity, 1. <hi>King. 10.
6, 7. It was a true report that I heard in mine
own land of thy acts, and thy wisdom; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I believed not the words, until I came
and mine eyes had seen it; and behold the
one half was not told me, thy wisdom and
prosperity exceedeth the fame thereof.</hi> It
is not the one half which Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
do now hear or can discern of their
masters excellencies. It hath not now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into their hearts to conceive what
Beauties and Glories and most admirable
perfections there are hid in their Beloved;
not only Christ's Love but also Christ's
Loveliness doth pass their knowledge;
there are such dimensions of most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Glory in Christ's person, as do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
transcend the capacity of the most
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43848:95"/>
elevated minds, fully to comprehend.
Christ doth manifest himself truly to them
that Love him, yet it is but partly, and
that but a little part, it is but darkly by
the beams of a more obscure light, 1 <hi>Cor.
13. 9, 10, 11, 12. For we know in part,
and prophesie in part; But when that which
is perfect is come, then that which is in part
shall be done away: When I was a child I
spake as a child, I understood as a child,
I thought as a child; but when I became a
man I put away childish things: For now
we see thorow a glass darkly, but then Face
to Face; Now I know in part, then I shall
know as I am known.</hi> We Ministers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
part, we can tell you but a
little of what there really is in Christ, and
both we and you know but in part; our
conceptions of Christs excellencies and
our expressions now are childish, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there will be a perfect manifestation
of Christ, and then all imperfections of
knowledge will be removed. Now you
may see Christ, but it is through a glass
darkly; hereafter face to face: Indeed it
is said, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. We all with open face
beholding as in a glass the Glory of the
Lord are changed, &amp;c.</hi> There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
open discovery of Christ now in
Gospel-times, over what there was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43848:95"/>
the Law; the veil of Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
which covered and in a great
measure hid Christ from the view, is now
removed, our face is now open from that
veil, but Christs face is not fully open,
there is glass still between our eye and
Christ's face (the glass of Ordinances
which though it doth help us to see him,
yet it keeps us from the clearest discovery
of him) we see but thorow a glass darkly;
our eyes now need this glass to help our
weakness, and that we may see what we
do see: there is a time coming when we
shall be above the need and use of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance-glasses,
I mean when we shall see
Christ face to face, and know him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as we are known by him.</p>
               <p>2. Christ doth now manifest himself gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
unto them that Love him, Christ
doth not shew at once &amp; altogether what
he means to discover of himself and of his
Love, but he doth it by degrees, a little
at one time, and a little at another time, a
little in this Ordinance, and a little in that;
now he lets down some comfortable beams
of the light of his countenance into the
soul, by and by clouds do arise and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
this light, and darkness is upon the
spirit: Sometimes Christ opens the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43848:96"/>
and looks upon the soul, gives gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
smiles, by and by the curtain is
drawn, and his face is hid; now he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
and then he disappears; he manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
himself at one time, withdraws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at another time, and so leads his people
on from one discovery of himself unto
another, until he bringeth them at last unto
the full discovery of himself in Glory.</p>
               <p>3. Christ doth manifest himself most
sweetly unto them that Love him, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
after long absence. When the soul
hath been seeking and cannot finde him,
wandring in the wilderness under amazing
fears, perplexing doubts, doleful despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies,
sinking and heart-overwhelming
grief; after a black night of deep deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Oh how sweet is the day-spring from
on high! Oh how comfortable are the
bright beams of the morning light! when
he shineth upon their dark and despised
and sorrowful spirits, giving them to
know assuredly that they are the dearly
beloved of his Soul, that he hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
them, that he will not forsake
them, that he hath a more tender Love
unto them than the mother to her sucking
child! Oh the ravishments of spirit! Oh
the transports of soul which do arise from
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43848:96"/>
hence! O the songs which are then in their
mouths. This is our beloved, we have
waited for him! this is our dear Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
we have trusted in him! Tongue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
express the delight, the joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of heart, which doth arise from the
manifestation of Christ's presence and
love; the joy of harvest, the joy of the
Bridegroom on the wedding day, the joy
of victory and taking great spoils, spoils
from an Enemy, the joy of a poor man in
finding great treasures; and the greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
which ever was found in the sweetest
sensual enjoyment is not worthy to be
compared with the joys and exaltings of
heart, in the manifestation of Christ unto
the Soul.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <p>4. WHen doth Christ manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto them that love him?</p>
               <p>1. Sometime Christ doth quickly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
himself, after a little seeking; some
young Converts have early and soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoveries
of Christ and his love; they are
cast down for a little while, and Christ
soon comes unto them and lifts them up
again; weeping endures but for a night,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43848:97"/>
and that a short summer night, and joy
cometh early in the morning; they have
the spirit of bondage who awakeneth
them to fear, by &amp; by the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth graciously visit them, and make
discovery of their relation to the Father,
the love of their Saviour, and sheddeth
abroad the sense of his love into their
hearts.</p>
               <p>2. Sometimes Christ is long before he
manifest himself; it is long before some
do seek Christ, and it is long before such do
find him: Christ waites long to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
unto them, &amp; Christ doth often make
them wait long before he manifesteth to
them his loving kindnesses; yea some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
early seekers are not early finders;
Christ makes some wait a long time to try
their faith and patience, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and that he may prepare them for
more than ordinary comforts and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which he intendeth to give in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of himself unto them.</p>
               <p>3. Sometimes Christ doth suddenly
manifest himself unto them that love him,
<hi>Cant. 6. 12. Or ever I was aware my Soul
made me like the Charets of</hi> Aminadab, or
ever they are aware they see the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots
of <hi>Israel</hi> and the horsemen thereof, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43848:97"/>
the Lord Jesus doth come unto them in
the Chariots of Salvation with such Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Lustre as doth transport and amaze
them. Some Christians that truely love
Christ, have sought him in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and have not found him, and
they have sought Christ in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and have not found him; they
have been looking and waiting and hoping
that at this time Christ would discover
himself, or at that time he would disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
himself, and still he hath hid himself,
still they have come off with disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
this hath been their Grief, this
they have complained of before God, and
they have been under fears lest they
should never see him, never meet with
him at all; hereupon their Spirits have
been ready to fail and sink within them,
and in discouragement they have been
ready to say or think that all their labour
would be in vain; and yet they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to seek him to their death, and
though he should kill them, to put their
trust in him: And behold on a sudden,
when they have had the least expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and their hope hath been ready to
give up the Ghost, they have met with
Christ, and found him whom their Soul
loveth; on a sudden the Veil of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43848:98"/>
hath been rent, and they have seen
their Beloved in the Holy of Holies; on
a sudden the clouds have fled, their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath passed away, and the light hath
shined; the North-wind of trouble hath
ceased, and the sweet Southern Gales
have blown upon them; I mean they
have been under such shinings and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Spirit, that they have seen
and felt the presence of Christ; and such
a sweet sense of his Love, as hath filled
them with Soul-revishing Joy.</p>
               <p>4. Christ doth manifest himself Seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
unto them that Love him. Though
he doth not alwayes manifest himself
when they most desire, yet he doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
himself when they have most need,
and then they have most need when they
are most low, when they are most low
in their Spirits, most poor and mean in
their own esteem, as well as most low
in their condition through Affliction and
Trouble; Humility and Patience under
Affliction, doth make way for the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of Christ's manifestation; Christ
doth many times reserve his Cordials for
the Fainting sits, and the sweetest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
in the discoveries of his Love for
the time of the greatest Adversity; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43848:98"/>
when the trouble is for his sake,
he is graciously present; <hi>Iohn</hi> had his
Visions when he was Banished for the sake
of Christ unto the Isle <hi>Patmos.</hi> And when
all men forsook <hi>Paul</hi> at his answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Nero,</hi> then the Lord came to him,
stood by him and strengthned him.</p>

               <p>5. WHere doth Christ manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto them that love him?
This is in the way of his Ordinances, there
he doth walk, there he doth appear unto
his People; sometimes Christ doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
himself in the way of private Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
when they seek him in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
or in their Closets, when they
speak of him in conference, or when
they think of him in their Meditation and
Contemplation; sometimes Christ doth
manifest himself unto them that love him
in the way of Publick Ordinances, in
Publick Prayer or Fasting, in hearing of
the Word, or when they are Feasting at
his Table, especially in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ast men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Ordinance Christ doth frequently
manifest himself unto his Disciples most
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43848:99"/>
sweetly: At the Lords Table, the Lord
doth appear; in breaking of Bread he
discovers himself, as to the Disciples that
went to <hi>Immaus;</hi> in his Banquetting-house
he gives them to feast on his Love;
There are many who can say by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that if ever they met with Christ
in their Lives, and in any Ordinance,
they have met with him at the Sacrament,
there he hath unveiled his face, there he
hath revealed his Love, there he hath
breathed upon them by his Spirit, there
they have found and felt the Lord to be
near.</p>

that love him, this is Childrens Bread,

Promise; never look for any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Christs love unto you whilest
you go on in wayes of Sin, whilest you
are in your Natural Estate. I believe some
of you may be ready to say, <hi>What if
Christ doth not manifest himself unto us?
let us have our Honours and Dignity, let
us have our Wealth and Plenty, let us have
our Friends and Delights, and let who
will look after those aiery and fancifull Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions
in Christs Manifestations.</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
is this your language either of tongue
or heart? Let me tell you, one day you
will sing another tune, you will be of
another mind; one day you will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that all the Happiness which you
so eagerly pursued in the sweetest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-enjoyments,
was but a Fancy, that
it was thin, light and aiery; that it was
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43848:100"/>
vain and empty, when all is fled away
and left nothing behind but Stings and
bitter Grief, but inward wounds, gripes,
and dreads, upon the sight of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Death, and under apprehensions of
approaching Wrath, and eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

give for an Interest in Jesus Christ, and
a well-grounded Perswasion of his special
Love unto your Souls? Then the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations
of Christ will appear to be no
aiery thing, and that nothing besides this
can rationally support your Souls when
you come to the Borders of the Grave,
and to the Confines of Eternity. And
let me further tell you that have no love
to Christ, that although Christ whilest
you are such will never manifest himself
unto you in a way of Love, yet there is
a Day coming when he will Manifest
himself unto you, but this Manifestation
will be with a Vengeance, it will be in a
way of most Furious anger; I mean, at
the last day of Judgement, when Christ
will be revealed from Heaven, not onely
to those that Love him, but also to those
that Hate him, for every eye shall then
see him, and he will come in flaming Fire
to take Vengeance upon you that have
not obeyed this Gospel-Precept, to Love
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43848:100"/>
him. The Consideration of this should
awaken you to fear and fly from Sin, which
otherwise will be your ruine and eternal
Perdition; and O that withall you would
be perswaded to apply your selves unto
the Lord Jesus Christ by Faith, that you
may hereby have Interest in him, and in
that great Salvation which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased

many a brinish tear from your eyes, you

go mourning all the day: Yet you are
resolved to give your attendance still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the Lord, and for the Lord; you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
notwithstanding all discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

you know not whether he be yours; you
are resolved that Christ shall have your

upon him, though you know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you are accepted by him. This may
be a Use of Encouragement unto you;
certainly you are such as love Christ, and
are beloved by Christ, and Christ will
manifest himself unto such as have such
Love; let me tell you, that Christ is not
far from you, whatever you may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
though he be out of your sight,
yet you are not out of his, his eye is
upon you, and his heart is towards you;
he hears all your sighs, he sees all your

with you in all your Griefs; he loves
you, and ere long will let you know it;
he is now preparing you for sweet disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries

give you those discoveries. If you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

and may suddenly be found of you: And

               <p>2. There are others of you have had
some manifestations of Christ unto you
formerly, but you have lost them: your
beloved hath withdrawn himself and is
gone, you call and he giveth no answer,
you seek him, but you cannot find him.
Time hath been when your Lord was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and gave you Gracious visits fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
many a secret smile you have
seen in his face, many a comfortable word
you have had from his mouth, many a
love-token you have received at his hand:
Time hath been when you had your evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
written out fair and clean, with
the Seal of the Spirit set unto them, and
how exceedingly did you then rejoice in
the sense of Christ's love? how did you
feast your selves upon his rich entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gospel-priviledges which through
him you were invested withal? And O
the admirings which then you had of free
Grace! O the sweet meltings of heart in
the kindly sense of sin! O the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of desire which you had in your
Prayers! O the burnings of love to
Christ which you have often felt in your
bosomes! O the lively hopes which you
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43848:103"/>
had, and ineffable delight in hope of the
Glory of God! But now there is a strange
decay within you of Grace, and Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as if you were not the same Men and
Women as you were before. You have
withdrawn your selves from Christ, and
he hath withdrawn himself from your
Souls: you have let down your watch,
and the Devil hath got advantage against
you by his devices, he hath watched his
opportunity and entangled you in the
snares of some sins; whilst you have
heedlesly gone to the utmost confines of
duty, and been upon the borders of sin,
the Devil hath sent forth a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quadron of
temptations not with fiery darts, but with
silken cords, which have treated and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
with you to entice and perswade to
go a little further, they have told you what
pleasant fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t doth grow within those bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
most sweet and delicious to the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ste;
that there are Silver and Golden Mines
which you might quickly dig up, and
find precious substance; that there you
might have honour and esteem, and what
would you turn your back upon all these?
would you be so nice and strict as not to
despense with a little duty, as not to step
over the hedge a little way, where the
delights and advantage would be so great.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43848:103"/>
And if you have hesitated, they have told
you that it was very disputable, whether
the confines of duty did not reach beyond
the place which they would bring you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
propounding the example of others
of the same Religious Profession, that
have frequently gone so far, and why
should you scruple: or if it were a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
it was but a little transgression,
they would not desire you to go far, and
who is there that lives and doth not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
those bounds? and you might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repent and find mercy if God were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
you might quickly retire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into your former limits; then whilst
you have been parlying with temptations,
the silken cords have been fastned about
you, and e're you have been aware you
have been drawn along, partly willing and
partly unwilling, and enticed unto some
kind of sins, and complyed with some
kind of lusts, indulging your selves to give
them satisfaction, whereby you have
been beguil'd, and befool'd, whereby
you have been secretly wounded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
defiled; and thus your evidences
for Heaven have been miserably blotted,
so that now you are not able to read them.
Time hath been when worldly Affections
seemed to be mortified within you, to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43848:104"/>
be dead and buryed, many a sore thrust
and wound you had given unto them, and
how did they bleed and faint, and grew so
weak that they seemed to be giving up
the Ghost, and you have thought sure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y
they would never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ir much in you any
more; and then your love to Christ was
strong and active, it did burn and flame
within you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and O the zeal which you then
had for your Masters honour, and you
seemed to have no interest to carry on in
the world but the interest of Christ, and
you minded not your own things upon
your own account, but all your interests
were swallowed up in the interest of Jesus
Christ, which you chiefly minded and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for, and made every thing else to
truckle under it, and to be subservient
unto it; but now your affections to Christ
are strangely cooled; if there be the fire
of love to Christ still within you, it is not
fire in burning coals, or in a vehement
flame, but it is a fire in a few scattered
sparks, and those raked over that they
give neither light nor heat, and are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if at all, discernable by you; and
your wordly Affections which seem'd to
be dead, they have gotten Spirit and Life
and Vigour, and Strength: O the eager
desire which you have after the world, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43848:104"/>
the things in the world, and these accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with eager prosecution of the
world, now the world hath your thoughts
in contrivements about it, and the world
hath your tongues in your most frequent
discourse of it, now the world hath your
hand and your time, but that which is
worst of all, the world hath your heart too,
the world hath justled Christ off of his
Throne and for the present doth usurp his
seat. And is it then a wonder if your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
be offended that you should thus
decline in your love, that your hearts
should go a whoring from him unto the
Creature, in your giving those affections
unto any thing in the world which are his
due? Hence it is that Christ hath shut up
his count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nance from you, or if he looks,
it is with frowns upon you; you have lost
your first love, and you have lost your
first sights, and your first tastes of the
Love of Christ; now your spiritual
joys and comforts are fled out of sight,
they are lost and gone, and the bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of them only doth remain,
and whatever delights you have they are
only such as come in at the door of sense,
you have none at all that come in at the
door of faith, and your sensual delights
have expelled and banished your spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43848:105"/>
now the rich Gospel-priviledges have
not that savor and sweet relish with you
as heretofore; your minding and savour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so much the Earth and Earthly things,
hath disrelished your spiritual appetite.
O the mischief which indulged sin hath
done unto you! O the unfelt wounds, but
so much the more deep and dangerous,
which sin hath given you! O the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements
of sin in your Consciences, and
the stains &amp; blots which sin hath cast upon
your profession! O the havock which sin
hath made amongst your graces, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
your comforts! Leaves you have
still of an outward profession, but where
is your fruit to be found? If you have
some fruit, is it not withered fruit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>our
and ill-rellished, not such ripe and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and sweet fruit as heretofore in your

                  </gap> distance from such of you, and
are there not too many such amongst you?
And what need have you to remember
whence you are to fallen, to ransack
your hearts to find out your sins, to
humble your selves deeply, to repent
and grieve and mourn, to turn your
laughter into weeping, and your joy
into heaviness, and to return unto the
Lord speedily and do your first works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:43848:105"/>
otherwise some fearefull judgements are
like to befall you, and the Lord may be
even forced to awaken you with a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
and make you a terrour unto your
selves and unto all about you: Don't pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the Lord, by your thus running away
from him, to follow you with a storm as he
did <hi>Ionas,</hi> and to devour you in the floods
and waves of dreadfull afflictions, that
hereby he may reduce and restore you,
and keep you from being drowned in ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perdition and eternal destruction. It
may be the Lord hath scourged some of
you for your faults with the rods of some
crosses and disappointments, some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
losses and troubles; it may be he
hath put bitternesse upon those breasts
which you have been sucking, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
gall in the cup of your pleasures which
you have been drinking; and you have
begun to think of your evil wayes, and
seen what an evil thing and bitter it is to
backslide from the Lord; and you have
thought it was best with you when you
were nearest unto Christ. It may be God
hath dealt with you as he telleth his back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding
people he would do with them,
<hi>Hos. 2. 6, 7. Behold I will hedge up thy
way with thorns, and make a wall that she
shall not find her paths: Aud she shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43848:106"/>
after her Lovers, but she shall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them, and she shall seek them, but she
shall not finde them; Then shall she say, I
will go and return to my first husband, for
then it was better with me than now.</hi> And
now you are seeking after your Beloved,
but he hath withdrawn himself from you,
and seems to take no notice of you; you
call and cry, and sigh, and weep, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and complain, and seek, and wait,
and yet he withholds from you all special
discoveries of his Love: Possibly
doubts may hence arise, and fears grow
upon your spirits, and you are ready to
sink, and sometimes are almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with inward trouble. Let this
Doctrine be an encouragement to you
still to seek diligently and wait patiently,
for the Lord will manifest himself again
unto you in his own time, which is the
best time: He may try you for a while
whether you will follow him in the dark,
he may suffer you to wait some time for
him, who have made him to wait so long
time for you; But if you persevere to
seek him diligently in his wayes, you
shall finde that it will not be in vain. And
what would you say, ye backsliding
souls, if the Lord should manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto you at this time? would you
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43848:106"/>
not abuse his kindness? if he should
discover his Love to you again, would you
not grow wanton and carnally secure?
if he should now renew your evidences
and give them fair written, and easie to be
read by you, would you not blot them
again by your sins? if he should now
speak peace unto your Consciences,
would you not again return unto folly? If
he should now restore unto you the joyes
of his salvation, and send down the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost from Heaven to come unto
you, to be your comforter and to dwell
with you, would you not griev and
quench the Spirit and provoke him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
retirement, and more dreadfull
withdrawings than before? It may be
the Lord will try you; it may be the
Lord may draw near and make some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of himself, and discovery of his
Love unto you: it may be the Lord may
look kindly now upon you, and secretly

by his Spirit, at least he may give you a

him, and with earnest desires and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate

Lord; of all Persons in the world, you
have most reason to rejoyce, you are the
happiest men and women alive. It is not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43848:109"/>
Wealth in the greatest abundance which
can make men happy, the richest Persons
have often thorns of the greatest discontent
to pierce their hearts, and Stings of the
greatest guilt to wound their Consciences:
It is not the highest Honour and worldly
Dignity which can make men happy; the
vilest men are often exalted, and those
that are in the Highest places, are in the
most Slippery places, from whence they
are soon cast down into destruction, and
whatever security they have in Life,
yet they are usually consumed utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with Terrours when grim Death
doth appear and summon them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
It is not the sweetest sensual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
which can make men happy; Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is the Attendant, and Vex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion of
Spirit is the Consequent of all those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
that are sensual and sinfull, which
are the seed also of Pain and Everlasting
torment: Such onely can be said to be
happy in truth, as are really united and
related unto Jesus Christ, and through
him reconciled unto God, and entituled
unto the Kingdom of Heaven; but you
are the most happy, and have reason to
take the most comfort, who have not
onely Relation unto Christ, but also the
Manifestations of him; who know that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43848:109"/>
Christ is yours, and you are his, that
Christ loveth you, and that his Love, as
it had no beginning, so it is without
changing, and will know no ending. If
you know that Christ loveth you, you
have reason to rejoyce, because hereby
you may know assuredly that you are
Elected, that God by an eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
Decree hath chosen you, when
he hath chosen so few of fallen Men, and
none of the fallen Angels, and when there
was not the least foreseen Motive to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him hereunto; the assurance of this
may yield unexpressible sweetness unto
you. If you know that Christ loveth
you, you may know assuredly your Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Calling, Conversion, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Union unto Christ; and O what
matter of Joy is it to think, how God
hath called you out of Darkness into his
marvellous Light! how he hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
you out of the Snare of the Devil,
and the bonds of your own Lusts, and
set your Souls at liberty! how he hath
wrought a Miracle in your first Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the Grave and spiritual
death of Sin, &amp; put forth the same power
in your New Creation &amp; change of your
Natures, as in his first Creation of the
World! how he hath dissolved and made
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43848:110"/>
a divorce between your hearts and your
sins, and so wonderfully United and
espoused you unto the Lord Jesus, and
by this Conjunction and Relation given
you an Interest in all the Priviledges
which Christ hath purchased. If you
know that Christ doth love you, you
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y know assuredly that you are Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
through his Merits and Mediation,
and O what matter of Joy is this, to
think that all your sins Original and Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
are pardoned, that none can lay any
sin to your charge, because God hath
justified you! that there is none that shall
condemn you, because Christ hath loved
you, and out of Love hath dyed for you,
and is now making Intercession for you at
the right hand of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. to
be acquitted from all Guilt, and no more
lyable unto future wrath than if you had
never offended; and when you had no
Righteousness of your own, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
as perfectly Righteous in the
sight of God, through the Imputation of
Christ's perfect Righteousness! Who
have reason to rejoyce, if you have not
reason? If you know that Christ loveth
you, you may assuredly say, that you are
the Sons and Daughters of the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
and will you not rejoyce, when
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43848:110"/>
of Children of the Devil, Children of
Disobedience, Children of Wrath, you
are made the Children of God, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Jehovah, that is the Supream So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
and King of the whole World,
and when you have not an empty Name
onely, but are intituled to all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of his Children? If you know
that Christ doth love you, you may know
assuredly that he will keep alive his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in you, preserve his Grace in your
hearts, and enable you to persevere in
Faith and Holiness, notwithstanding all
the alluring Temptations which you may
meet withall in the World, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Suggestions and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of Sathan, and notwithstanding all
the powerfull workings of your remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lusts and corruptions, all which do
combine together, and use all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and policy (which is great) to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
your Grace, to draw you unto sin,
to entice or force you out of the wayes
of God; and O what matter of comfort
is it, that the Lord Jesus who loveth you,
hath undertaken for you, to keep you in
his hand, and by his unseen but mighty
power to enable you to resist and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
to hold on in his wayes, and hold
out unto the end, so that you may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43848:111"/>
with the Apostle, and say, as <hi>Rom.
8. 35, 37. Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ? shall tribulation, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siress,
or persecution, or famine, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
or peril, or sword? Nay, in all
these things we are more than conquerours
through him that loved us.</hi> And you may
be perswaded as <hi>Paul</hi> was, and greatly
rejoyce therein, that, as <hi>v. 38, 39. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,
nor Powers, nor things present,
nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth,
nor any other Creature shall be able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
you from the love of God which is
in Christ Iesus your Lord.</hi> If you know
that Christ doth love you, you may
know assuredly that your Prayers have
audience with God, that whatever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
and sinfull mixtures they
have, yet that they are mingled with
the sweet Incense of Christ's Merits,
through which they are persumed and
accepted; and what comfort is this, that
whatever you ask of the Father in the
Name of your dear Lord Jesus, if it be
for his Glory and your good, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
procure it for you. To conclude,
If you know that Christ doth love you,
you may know assuredly that you are
Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43848:111"/>
that as certainly as you are alive, you
shall attain eternal Felicity in the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
Vision and Fruition of your Lord; as
certainly as you have the first Fruits, so
certainly shall you have the Harvest; as
certainly as you have the Earnest, so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
shall you have the Inheritance; as
certainly as you see Christ by Faith here,
so certainly shall you have the Beatifical
Vision of his Person and Glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and be made perfectly happy in the
eternal and full Enjoyment of him; O
how should you then rejoyce in the Lord,
rejoyce in his Person, rejoyce in his Love,
rejoyce in his Benefits, rejoyce in what
you have, and rejoyce in what you hope
to have by him; rejoyce in what you
see now, and feel now, and taste now;
and rejoyce in the foresights and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastes
of your Happiness to come. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in the Lord always, and again I say
Rejoyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If you have Manifestations of Christs
Love unto you, Admire his Free Grace
in these Manifestations; as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 22.
when Christ had promised to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
himself unto such as love him, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
(not <hi>Iscariot,</hi> he was the Traytor, and
had no true love to his Master, but <hi>Iudas</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:43848:112"/>
the Brother of <hi>Iames</hi>) saith to him, <hi>Lord
how is it that thou wilt manifest thy self
unto us, and not unto the World?</hi> This
Question is not a Question of Enquiry
concerning the Way and Manner how
Christ would manifest himself unto them,
but it is a Question of Admiration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Thing; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
What is done? or
What is come to pass? How is it? or
Whence is it? His Question did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
an Answer, neither do we find any
to it, but onely expressed his Wonder
that Christ should manifest himself unto
them. And how should you wonder then
that the Lord Jesus should manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto you! That the Lord Jesus, whose
Name is Wonderfull, and hath so many
Wonders in him, a Person of so great
Eminency and Excellency, who hath such
a Crown of Glory upon his Head, such
Robes of Glory upon his Back, and on the
Vesture of his Garment and his Thigh a
Name written, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords;</hi> that this most excellent Person
should manifest himself unto You, such
as You, when he conceals himself from
the greatest Princes of the Earth, who
by their Interest, Authority and Influence
might that highly promote his Glory, he
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:43848:112"/>
should manifest himself unto You, who
for the most part are low and mean, poor
and despised in the World; that when
he hideth himself from most of the Wise
and Prudent, and great Scholars in the
world, who by their Parts and Learning
might magnifie his Name, and spread his
Fame, he should manifest himself unto
you, who for the most part are persons
of mean parts and Education; that when
Christ hideth himself from many Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
who have escaped the grosser Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
which are in the World, he
should reveal and manifest himself unto
you, some of whom before Conversion
were notoriously guilty of most foul sins;
that when Christ manifesteth himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so Few, that you should be in the
Number of those Few; how many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are here! That this Glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should send down another Glorious
Person, I mean the Holy Ghost, from
Heaven, (which is more than if he had
sent down all the Glorious Angels which
are in Heaven) to make this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of himself unto you; That he
should make use of the Foolishnesse of
Preaching as a Means to effect this
great thing, that while a man of like pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and infirmities with your selves is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:43848:113"/>
opening and applying the Scriptures, the
Lord by this means should unveil himself
and open the treasures of his Love unto
you: that your humble fervent and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
prayers here on Earth should ascend
up to the throne of God that is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and move the Lord Jesus that is there
to come down, thence, though not in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
yet by his Spirit; that prayer should
open heavens gate, and have such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
for this manifestation and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Christ; though the best prayers of
the best men are not without mixture of
sin: that whilst you are sitting at the
Lords table, the Lord himself should give
you a visit, and whilst you are eating
bread and wine at the Sacrament, he should
give you to see and feel and taste himself
and his Love by your spiritual senses. It
was wonderful humiliation in Christ that
when he could have commanded the most,
stately Horses, yea Lions, Elephants,
or Unicorns, he should ride to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
upon an Ass, and when Christ hath the
Chariots of so many thousand glorious
Angels, which he could command and
ride triumphantly in, when he makes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of himself unto his people, that
he should make use of the Chariots of so
mean Ordinances in the discovery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43848:113"/>
unto you; how many wonders are
here? how should you admire his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Grace and Love, and say, <hi>what is
man that thou art thus mindful of him, or
any of the sons of men, that thou shouldst
thus visit them? what are we unworthy
wretches? and why shouldst thou manifest
thy self unto us? even so dear Jesus because
it seemed good in thy sight:</hi> especially you
have reason to wonder and admire at the
manifestations which Christ hath given of
himself and love to you, when you consider
the excellency of these manifestations and
discoveries beyond all other discoveries. If
you have seen the most rare works of Art
and Human Invention, the most curious
Pictures, the most stately Edifices, or any
other works of the most ingenious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement:
If you have viewed the works
of nature which do far exceed those of
Art, the beautiful frame of the Heavens
over your heads, and the glorious Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
of Sun, Moon, and Stars, in their
wonderful light and motion; the Earth
under your feet when it hath got on its
best attire, when the fields are clothed
with grass in the Spring, or enriched with
corn in the summer; If you have seen the
most pleasant Brooks and Streams, and
Fountains of water, the most stately
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:43848:114"/>
Groves with losty and broad shadowing
Trees; the most flourishing Orchards, most
richly laden with variety of the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
fruit; the most delightfull Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
with variety of the choisest Flowers
casting forth the most fragrant smell; If
you have seen all sorts of Birds, and fowls
in the Air, All sorts of Beasts on the Earth,
All sorts of fish in the Sea; If you have seen
the most goodly men that ever were born;
the fairest women, with the most spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
beauty: What is the sight of all
these things, and the most lovely objects
that ever were visible to the eye of the
body? the sight of all is but mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
and not worthy to be named in
comparison with the sight of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
by the eye of the Soul; Whatever
beauty and loveliness there is to be found
in any, or in all visible Creatures, there is
infinitely more beauty and loveliness in
Jesus Christ; all visible beauty is but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
in Christ there is substantial beauty;
all visible beauty is fading, like the flower
that soon withereth, like the leaf that
soon fadeth, but in Christ there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
beauty; all visible beauty is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
and mean, yea deformity compared
with Christ's transcendent loveliness.
There is no discovery to the eye of the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:43848:114"/>
mind comparable to the discovery of
Christ unto the eye of Faith; the light
of Nature in the greatest improvement
of it, is but a weak and dim light in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
with the spiritual light of the
knowledge of Christ; no light so clear
and bright, no light so pure and sweet, as
that which makes discovery of the Lord
Jesus unto the Soul. This discovery of
Christ doth dispel clouds from the Mind,
and exhale lusts from the Heart; it doth
brighten the understanding and cleanse the
Affections; it doth warm the Heart with
love, and fill the Heart with comfort;
it quiets the Conscience and purifies it;
it gives a most sweet peace and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the spirit, and withall brings in such
spiritual joy, as is unspeakable and full
of Glory. O how then should you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Riches of the Grace, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Lord Jesus Christ unto you!
that he should give unto you this discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of himself, when the discovery is so
admirable, so excellent, so desirable, so
useful, and which doth list you up into a
far higher degree of excellency, than the
otherwise most accomplisht persons in
the world, that are without this discovery.</p>
               <p>3dly. To conclude, If you have these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:43848:115"/>
of Christ and his love unto
you, labor to retain these manifestations. In
a word, take heed of indulging your selves
in any sins, which may provoke him to
depart from you, and withdraw the sweet
and comfortable influences of his Spirit,
and be diligent in the use of all means and
ordinances, publick, private and secret,
whereby you may maintain daily Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
and Fellowship with him.</p>
