            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Goſpel Tidings, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THat there was a time in which the Goſpel was
preached and publiſhed, is a thing which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
is confeſsed by all that profeſs Chriſtianity;
but that there was an apoſtatizing from it, and a
night of thick darkneſs came over that diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is a thing that few underſtand; and therefore it is, that the
appearance of the ſame Goſpel which at this day is broken forth
in light, out of the night of apoſtacie, and preached again in the
ſame power, is by ſo few believed and received, for as that ſpirit
and power doth remain in people, which led into the apoſtacie,
and went over that glorious diſpenſation of the Goſpel that then
was, even ſo it blinds their mindes, that the Light of the glorious
Goſpel of Chriſt doth not ſhine unto them, though by the ſame
ſpirit &amp; power in which it was then preached it be preached again;
and ſo through the ignorance that is in them, they are led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in Error; having Eyes but ſee not, Eares but hear not, hearts
but do not underſtand, ſo are not converted nor healed, but in
darkneſs abides, and in darkneſs walks in their own way, and ſuch
wearies themſelves in an endleſs travel, being driven about with
divers doctrines, which is held forth in mans cunning part that
lies in wait to deceive, by which they are toſſed from one thing
to another, and catches at words and ſounds, inſtead of life and
power; and ſo the many Inventions have been ſought out, and
ſet up, with which people pleaſe themſelves as if they were in the
right way, though there is a cry in many which is not ſatisfied
in it: And theſe Inventions which are come up in the long night
of apoſtacie, and obſerved and practiſed as if they were a Goſpel
diſpenſation, they want the virtue with which the goſpel gives
ſatisfaction, and are found dry and emptie Ciſterns which yeilds
no refreſhings; for they onely lye in forms without, and not in
the light and power of God within, in which the goſpel hath a
free paſſage to the ſoul in its own virtue, and therefore unto
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45031:3"/>
that all people muſt come, from which the night of apoſtacy hath
cauſed them to erre, that they may feele the diſpenſation of the
Goſpel in its own power and virtue; for the Goſpel is not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into any new Invention, though people have invented many
new forms, &amp; every one ſets up their own form as a goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſation,
yet their form doth not make a Goſpel adminiſtration, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can any breathing deſire receive peace or ſatiſfaction therein;
for whoſe minds are turned outwards, &amp; looking for the Kingdom of
God in obſervations, they deceive themſelves with a vain hope, &amp;
runs themſelves at a greater diſtance from the light of the glorious
Goſpel of Chriſt, &amp; by how much they place their belief in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
form, by ſo much the more they err from the power, which
is the Goſpel &amp; loſes the virtue of its adminiſtration, &amp; whilſt they
are ſeeking the Kingdom of God in formes and obſervations
without, they neglect the power of the Goſpel, which miniſtreth
an entrance into the Kingdom of God within. Now as it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
confeſſed, that there was a time in which the Goſpel was
preached and publiſhed, ſo it is to be conſidered, in what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
their adminiſtration ſtood who was the miniſters of it, and
how they became worthy to be put in truſt with it, for the Apoſtle
ſaid, Our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of ucleanneſs, nor
of guile, but as we are allowed of God to be put in truſt with the
Goſpel: even ſo we ſpeak, not at pleaſing men, but God which
trieth our hearts, 1. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2. (mark) they were blowed of God,
and put in truſt with the Goſpel by him, having received Chriſt
Jeſus into their hearts by the manifeſtation of his light and love,
and ſo were found worthy in Chriſt to be put in truſt with the
Goſpel for by the holy principle of Light which they had received
in Chriſt Jeſus, they received power to Crucifie deceit, uncleanneſs,
and guile, and thereby they became renewed in the Spirit of their
mindes unto God, who put them in truſt with the goſpel, in that
which was pure and clean, in which he allowed them to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of it, not in words onely, but alſo in power; ſo that their
words which in the power was miniſtred, they were ſpoken as in
the ſight of God, who tried their hearts, and they did not frame
their words to pleaſe men, but in the power by which they were
made miniſters, they were made manifeſt unto every mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in the ſight of God: and the Apoſtle ſaid, Now thanks be
unto God which always cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45031:3"/>
manifeſt the ſavour of his knowledge by us in every place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for we are not as many which corrupt the Word of God, but as
of ſincerity but as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt,
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. (marke) they ſpake in Chriſt, and ſo were manifeſt to
every mans Conſcience in the ſight of God, and the meaſure of
Chriſt in every one bare witneſs unto their teſtimony; though
ſuch as did not joyn to the meaſure of Chriſt in themſelves could
not receive it yet the ſame principle in which they ſpake did bear
witneſs to it in every mans Conſcience, and ſo they ſtood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
unto God, and not unto men: whereby it is evident, that
they had received Chriſt Jeſus, and that he was in them; for they
ſpake in him, and that was the Goſpel which they preached, and
which many receiv<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d as glad tidings that brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallity
unto their ſouls, and they that did receive the glad
tydings of the goſpel, and did abide in it, they became followers
of the Lord, and of the truth in the love of it; ſo that the ſavour
of life in them that miniſtred, did reach the life in them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
by which life they all came into the fellowſhip of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and ſo they that miniſtred was a ſweet ſavour in the hearts
of thoſe that believed: and the Apoſtle ſaid, My ſpeech and my
preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in
demonſtration of the ſpirit, and of power; that your faith ſhould
not ſtand in the wiſdom of man, but in the power of God; for
what man knows the things of a man, ſave the Spirit of man
which is in him, Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but
the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the Spirit of the
World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the
things that are freely given to us of God; which things alſo we
ſpeak not in the words which mans wiſdome teacheth, but which
the holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing Spiritual things with Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
1. <hi>Cor</hi> 2. (mark) they had not received the Spirit of the world,
but the Spirit which is of God, &amp; that was their principle, &amp; in the
Spirit of God they knew the things that was freely given of God, &amp;
in the ſame principle in which they freely received, they freely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred;
&amp; this was the preaching of the Goſpel then not according
to mans wiſdom, but in Chriſt Jeſus the power &amp; wiſdom of God,
in which goſpel many believed, and were ſaved: and the Apoſtle
ſaid, Moreover brethren, I declare unto you the Goſpel which I
preached unto you, which alſo you have received, and wherein ye
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45031:4"/>
ſtand, by which alſo ye are ſaved, if ye keep in memorie what
preached unto you, unleſs ye have believed in vain, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15
(mark) the Goſpel which then was preached, they that received
it, ſtood in it, and were ſaved by it, and they were not to let it
ſlip out of their mindes, but to keep it in memorie, that they
might not believe in vain; and many did ſo receive it in the love
of it, as they did retain it, and the ſalvation in it, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by the power of it, to hold faſt that which they had received;
and ſuch continued in their well doing, and perſevered unto the
end, and died in the faith, having obtained eternall redemption
and Salvation by the power of the Goſpel; and unto whom this
Goſpel was hid, it was hid unto them that was loſt, in whom the
God of this World had blinded the mindes of them which belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not, leaſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is
the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. And ſuch
periſhed in their gain ſaying, not receiving the truth in the love
of it, but gave up themſelves to believe lyes, which the God of
this World led them into, and blinded their mindes with, and ſuch
could not ſee though they had Eyes, nor hear though they had
Eares, nor underſtand though they had hearts, and ſo was not
converted nor healed by the power of the Goſpel, though in the
ſame power it was preached unto them, as unto thoſe that did
believe in it, and receive it; and ſo it became the ſavour of life
unto life in thoſe that believed, and the ſavour of death unto
death in thoſe that periſhed, and as there were many which could
neither ſee, nor hear, nor underſtand the glorious diſpenſation
of the Goſpel, but were blinded by the God of this World, unto
whom they yeilded themſelves to obey, and ſo were never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
not healed, but periſhed in their gainſaying, even ſo there
were many whole Eyes were opened, and Ears unſtopped, and
hearts broken; who did both ſee, and hear, and underſtand the true
and living meſſage of the Goſpel, and yet did not abide in that
which they had ſeen, and heard, and underſtood; not likeing to
retein God in their knowledge, but yeilded themſelves again
unto the God of this World, and ſo became vailed from the
Light of the glorious Goſpel, that they loſt the ſight of that which
they had ſeen, and the hearing of that which they had heard, and
the underſtanding of that which they had in ſome meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
and by the God of this World unto whom they yeilded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45031:4"/>
themſelves again, their hearts were darkned, and their mindes
blinded; and though profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became
fooles; having put away faith and a good Conſcience, and made
ſhipwrack of it, &amp; though they were gone from the Goſpel; and the
power of it in themſelves, yet they reteined the form, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more in love with the form then the power, and ſo did not
onely err from the power, but turned againſt it, and denied
it; and of this ſort they were that crept into houſes; and led ſilly
women captive, loaden with ſins, and led away with divers luſts,
2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3. For they being erred from the power of God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made ſhipwrack of ſaith and a good Conſcience, they were
gone into Captivity themſeves, and ſo led others to follow them,
and captivated them in the forme in which they were always lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but never came to the knowledge of the truth, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
apoſtatized from the Light of the glorious Goſpel, and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the power of it, after that they had ſeen, and heard, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
ſomthing of it; and ſuch became falſe brethren, who tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the grace of God into Laſciviouſneſs, and denied the onely
Lord God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as in <hi>Jude.</hi> So that after the
Saints deceaſed, who by the power of the Goſpel was cleanſed,
and with its vertue waſhed from all filthineſs of fleſh, and ſpirit,
and did retain it, and hold it faſt in the pure principle of life, then
did the Apoſtacy overſpread, and the darkneſs of it covered the
Earth, and the God of this World came into dominion, and ruled
in the hearts of people, and in darkneſs they conceived what
was in the power practiſed, and thereby people came to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
being erred from the principle of God; and ſo that hath been
taken for a Goſpel diſpenſation, whcih in the unclean part hath
been conceived and practiſed, and in that unrighteous nature the
truth hath been held; for by the God of this World peoples
minds have been corrupted, &amp; their Eyes blinded; &amp; hereby it may
be underſtood, how the apoſtacy entered, and how the Goſpel
diſpenſation came to be loſt, and how the many invented forms
came to be ſet up and obſerved, with which people now ſeemes
to be well pleaſed and ſatiſfied, and every one according to their
own perſwaſion obſerves their own for me as a Goſpel diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet in all ages ſince the apoſtacy entered, there hath been
ſomething of God ſtirring in ſome particular, that hath breathed
after the enjoyment of that life which in pure Goſpel times was:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45031:5"/>
witneſſed amongſt the Saints and Goſpel worſhippers but the
God of this World being in dominion, it hath been Cruſhed
and quenched in its riſing and hath been beaten down again
by a ſtrong hand which the God of this World hath ſtretched
forth againſt it, ſo that it could not come to ſpread abroad in the
liberty of the life, but hath alway been ſuppreſſed in its riſing
by the force of Laws which the God of this World hath invented:
but now it hath pleaſed God in the fulneſs of time to reveale his
Son in power and great glory, who hath brought life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallity
to Light by his appearance, in whoſelife and power
the Goſpel is preached again, and many have believed and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the glad tydings of it, who ſome times were wandering in the
apoſtacy, and ſeeking peace in their own way but could not finde
it; for which cauſe they many times mourned and lamented, and
their Souls endured griefe and trouble for want of Chriſt, whom
they earneſtly breathed after: and though they had gone
through many invented forms, and tried the depths of mans wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in his own way; yet they could not finde him whom their
Souls longed after: but when the glorious Goſpel brake forth in
its own power, and came to be preached in the life, then by its
ſtrength their Ears were pierced, and the joyful ſound did enter
into their hearts, and the living witneſs of God was raiſed, and
life from death was witneſſed, and then they found him whom
their ſouls loved, and ſuch knows the Scripture to be fulfilled, and
can truly ſay, How beatutiful is the feet of him that brought glad
tidings of Salvation, and publiſhed peace, who is riſen in life to
proclaim the Goſpel; and ſuch do witneſs, that the night is over
and gone, and the day is come, and the light of the knowledge of
the glory of God ſhines in their hearts in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,
who is the firſt born of God, that brought many Son to glory,
who are now made living witneſſes of his Reſurrection, and his life,
and are allowed of God to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, whoſe
labour and traveail is in the ſtrength and power of God, and in
the ſame they publiſh his meſſage, that people may be turned
from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God;
that they may receive remiſſion of ſins, and come to an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
amongſt all that are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt Jeſus: and
whoſoever doth not bring this meſſage is not to be received; for
it is the ſame Goſpel that was preached unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45031:5"/>
which he believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is the ſame Goſpel that was preached by the
Apoſtles, and in which many then believed, and what they had
heard, and ſeen, and taſted, and handled of the word of life, that
they declared in the life, and ſo they preached Chriſt Jeſus, the
power of God to Salvation, and there was not another Goſpel to
be brought, either by Angel or man, but they that brought it was
to be accurſed; for the Apoſtle ſaid, though we, or an Angel from
heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you then that which we
have preached unto you let him be accurſed, as we ſaid before, ſo
ſay I now again, if any man preach any other Goſpel unto you
then that ye have received, let him be accurſed: but <hi>I</hi> certifie you
brethren, that the Goſpel which was preached of me, is not after
man, for <hi>I</hi> neither received it of man, neither was I taught it,
but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. Oh that they which
ſpeak of themſelves would conſider this, who knowes no more of
the Goſpel then what they receive of man, and are taught by man,
which is not the way by which the Apoſtle came to the Goſpel,
and therefore it is evident that ſuch have not the Goſpel to
preach who denies revelation, and ſo they preach another Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
then that which the Apoſtle preached. But now the ſame Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is known again by many in whom Jeſus Chriſt is revealed,
who hath brought life and Immortallity to light by the Goſpel,
and in his power it is preached again, even the ſame Goſpel
which is neither of man, nor by man, but in the ſame power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as they received it, and in the ſame power preached as they
preached it, and it is committed unto faithful men whom God
hath intruſted with it, who are able to teach others alſo; and this
is the Light which ſhines out of darkneſs, and goes over the night
of apoſtacy, with all the Apoſtates Inventions, and in power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemes
people up to God again, from whom they are alienated
in the apoſtacy, and ſuch whoſe Eys are ſhut, and Ears ſtopped,
and hearts hardened againſt this glorious adminiſtration of the
Goſpel, they are of all men moſt miſerable; for it is the mighty
power of God unto Salvation unto all that believe in it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it; but they that reject it, and are rebellious againſt it, they
reject the loving kindneſs of God, and with the Goſpel are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and not ſaved; for they that believe not, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
becauſe they believe not in the name of the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son of God, but unto all that do believe, his appearance brings
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45031:6"/>
life and immortallity to light by the Goſpel, and it is evident
that it is the ſame Goſpel that is now preached, and not another;
for it hath wrought effectually in the hearts of many, and hath
purged and expelled the uncleanneſs and filthineſs both of fleſh
and ſpirit, and hath pulled down felf-righteouſneſs, and revealed
the Righteouſneſs of God, in which many are eſtabliſhed: ſo
that the life of ſuch now who have received the Goſpel, doth fully
anſwer to the life of ſuch then, by which it is manifeſt that it is
the ſame Goſpel, and not another, having wrought the ſame work
in the hearts of all that have received it as in times paſt, and they
anſwer to the ſame in life and practice, as face anſwers face in a
glaſs; ſo that the demonſtration of the Goſpels power may be
clearly diſtinguiſhed from all Inventions, for though there may be
fair ſhews of Godlineſs in ſome particular forms, yet they are not
tranſlated into the power and life of Chriſt, in which the Goſpel
adminiſtration ſtandeth: therefore unto all ſuch, who yet abide
in darkneſs, and are ſeeking peace in their own way, is this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
ſent in love, that they unto the Light may be turned, by
which the danger of their way will be opened and diſcovered; for
the Light will open that eye which hath been cloſed, and unſtop
that Eare which hath been ſtopped, and break that heart which
hath been hardned by the God of this World, and ſo they will
come to ſee, and hear, and underſtand what is with the Light
made manifeſt, without which the things of God can never be
perceived; for as the Light is in it ſelf a moſt holy, pure, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
principle, ſo it doth diſcover in mans Conſcience all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
which is ſin, and lets him ſee what lovers he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
into his heart; which defiles him, and makes him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
in the ſight of the pure God, and in the Light waiting, that
voyce which ſpeaks from heaven will be heard, and the Goſpel will
ſound into that Ear which is unſtopped, &amp; pierce into the heart, &amp;
prick it, and with the precious ſavour of its virtue it will ſoften
it, and ſo the Light of the glorious Goſpel will ſhine out of the
night of apoſtacy, and bring glad tidings into the Soul, which in
the night of apoſtacy hath been captivated; and there man will
come to feele the love which God hath unto him, who would not
that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to the knowledg
of the truth, and be ſaved; and there is no want of love from God
to ſave men, but there is want of love from men to cloſe with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45031:6"/>
and joyn into the love which God makes manifeſt in the Light,
and ſo mans deſtruction is of himſelf, becauſe he loves not the
Light, but loves his evil deeds better, and follows the devices of
his own heart, which, with the Light is reproved; and ſuch obeys
not the Goſpel, in which the love of God is tendered, but ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the God of this World, and cheriſhes their own hearts luſts,
and this is mans own way, in which the god of this World blindes
him, and keeps him in the apoſtacy, where he is alienated from the
life of God; therefore let all people conſider, whilſt they have a
day; for with whom was the Lord grieved, was it not with thoſe
that had ſinned, whoſe carcaſſes fell in the wilderneſs; and unto
whom did he ſwear that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, was
it not thoſe that believed not; therefore all people take heed, leaſt
you out-stand the Lord in the hardneſs of your hearts, and let the
day of your viſitation ſlip over your heads without regarding
for unto which of you hath he not manifeſted his love, and who
amongſt you can truly ſay, the Lord hath not viſited; have you not
had many convictions in your Conſciences, and many convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for your ſins? have you not been reproved for the Evil
of your doings, and have you not been ſecretly judged for ſecret
faults? have you done any thing ſo privately that hath not been
manifeſt, or could you ever hide any thing ſo cloſely that hath
not been made known; who amongſt you can excuſe your ſelves
before the moſt High, or which of you can ſay in truth the Lord
hath not ſhewed me evil, or that <hi>I</hi> am ignorant of my ſin? who
amongſt you can ſtand to plead with God in theſe things? Oh
ſurely the day of account is very great, and unto it you muſt all
come, and the Lord will be clear when he judges, for all his
Judgments are true; and do you not draw his judgments upon
your ſelves, becauſe you regard not his law: how will you ſtand to
account for all your idle words and ungodly deeds, in which you
run at liberty as if all ſhould end without account? look over your
lives, and with the Light of Chriſt in your Conſciences view your
ſelves, and behold the fruit of your doings, and conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you can ſtand approved unto God in ſecret; for your lives
demonſtrate, your nature, and the fruit of your doings declares
your root, the old man is yet alive in you, and the god of this
World hath dominion over you, and with his deceivable work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he blindes you, and in the apoſtacy you are loſt, when the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45031:7"/>
Goſpel is hid from you, and ſo you remain in your fins, which
the Goſpel caſteth out and expelleth, where it is believed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and if you will but view your ſelves with the Light of
Chriſt which is in you, though you be not in it you will ſee that
you are under the Law, and approved by it, and not under the
Goſpel; and the Law ſaith, Thou ſhalt not Covet: now view your
ſelves and behold whether you keep this one commandment and if
you do not, then you are yet under the Law, and the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes
you; for it is Spiritual, holy, juſt, and good, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
becauſe of tranſgreſſion, and whilſt you are in tranſgreſſion
and doth not keep the Law, you are under the curſe, and not in
the bleſſing, which is a Goſpel ſtate. Now if you will view your
hearts with the Light, it will ſhew you that you are coveting an
evil covetouſneſs, and both the riches of this World, and the
riches of Knowledg your hearts are ſet upon, and theſe are two
great evils which the holy Law condemneth: and though you may
talk of the Goſpel, and a Goſpel-adminiſtration, and apprehend
your ſelves to be Goſpel-worſhippers, yet you are under the firſt
Covenant, with its curſe and condemnation, being yet in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
and you have not received the love in the Light, in which
the Law and Prophets is fulfilled; ſo it is not what you profeſs
that makes you to be the ſame you profeſs, neither is it what you
apprehend your ſouls to be that makes you ſo to be, for the new
man doth not live the life of the old; therefore let this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
enter into all your hearts, and ponder it in ſecret, that it is
not ſuch as onely profeſs the Goſpel that are approved, but ſuch
as obey the Goſpel; and therefore you that talk ſo much of a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
diſpenſation, and the free grace of God in it, and thereby
would exclude perfect obedience as a duty onely belonging to the
firſt Covenant, and ſay, it is not now of works; but of grace; and
run from good works, and ſo are reproved by St. <hi>James,</hi> you are
in the apoſtacy covered with imaginations; for all the children
of Light are children of obedience, and you that are not ſo,
are fooliſh and diſobedient; and whilſt you talke of
ſalvation by the free grace of God without works, your ſelves
are found in the works of ſin, and yeilding your ſelves to obey
the God of this world, and ſo you would hold two Kingdomes at
once; but do you not know, that unto whom you yeild your ſelves
ſervants to obey, his ſervants you are to whom you obey; and is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45031:7"/>
not here obedience to ſomthing, and doth the free grace of God
ſave the diſobedient, who yeild themſelves to obey the God of
this world, and denies the teachings of the grace when it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
for the grace of God appeareth unto all men, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of it doth diſcover ungodlineſs and worldly luſts in
all, but who are they that are taught to deny ungodlineſs and
worldly luſts? are not they ſuch as obey the grace in its appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
or can any be taught by the grace and not obey it; you
may as truly ſay, that all men ſhall be ſaved, becauſe the grace
unto all men appeareth; but this is known and witneſſed by the
children of Light, who are the children of obedience, that as the
grace appeareth againſt ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, ſo the
grace is to be obeyed in its appearance, and being obeyed, it then
teaches to deny that which it appears againſt; and not onely ſo,
but it alſo teaches to live the life of godlineſs, and ſo the grace
being obeyed it brings ſalvation; for it overcomes ſin, and gives
victory over the God of this World, who leadeth in ſin ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
as obeys him; and hereby it may be underſtood, that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is by grace, and not by works, and ſo it is believed and vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſsed
by all the children of Light, vvho knovves that obedience
to the grace, doth not ſet up the firſt Covenant, but eſtabliſhes
the ſecond, in vvhich the Goſpel is miniſtred according to the
riches of his grace, vvho is the fulneſs of all things; therefore it
is manifeſt that you are yet under <hi>Moſes,</hi> though you have Chriſt
to talk of, and the vail is yet over your hearts, not being redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from under the Lavv and its condemnation, but are in diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Light of Chriſt, by vvhich the law is fulfilled,
and in vvhich the Goſpel is preached again as in times paſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all come to the Light of Chriſt vvith vvhich you are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and obey it vvhen in your Conſciences it reproves you, that
it may guide you, and lead you, and teach you, and bring life and
imortality into you, vvhich you can never finde in your ovvn
vvay; and therefore out of your ovvn vvay you muſt depart in,
the leadings of the Light, if ever you come to the life from vvhich
the Light is made manifeſt, and you muſt obey the Light; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv
it, and not reject it, and quench it, and by follovving the
Light in obedience, it vvill bring you to forſake your ovvn vvay,
and all your invented forms, and vvill bring you into the vvay
vvhich God hath prepared, in vvhich the croſs is placed; upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45031:8"/>
vvhich all worldly luſts is crucified and condemned, and the old
man vvith all his deeds deſtroyed; and as you take up the Croſs
and follovv the Light, vvhich is to obey it, then you vvill have true
peace in your vvay, and vvill knovv and underſtand the Goſpel of
God, vvhich is the power of God unto Salvation; and the Goſpel
will have a free courſe in you, and not be quenched, and ſo the
Croſs is in the way which God hath prepared, but eaſe and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
liberty is in the way which man hath invented; and therefore
it is that ſo many walkes in it, and are ſo in love with it as they
will not forſake it, but whoſoever continues in that path, and
doth not turn to the Light, with the Light to be guided they will
finde the pit to be in the end of it; therefore how deeply are peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
concerned to take heed to their way, leaſt their obſtinacy run
them to perpetual ruine; for it is not a profeſſion of any ſort that
will bring peace in the latter end, though people may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
in what they do profeſs, according to their own forme, but
the life which in the Light is miniſtred, in that alone by which
the Soul is comforted, and ſuſtained, and in the needful times
is helped and relieved, and that is the Goſpel which brings glad
tydings of peace, and glad tydings of good things, that binde up
the broken hearted, and reſtores joy for mourning, and gives
the ſpirit of gladneſs for the ſpirit of heavineſs, and ſo the poor
receives the Goſpel, and it is glad tydings unto them, but the
rich reject it, being filled with their own wealth, and ſo they are
ſent emptie away as to the virtue which the Goſpel miniſtreth;
and therefore it is hard for a rich man to be ſaved, who hath ſtirred
himſelf with the fetchings in of wealth by his Earthly wiſdom,
his Ear is ſtopped to the joyful ſound of the Goſpel; but the poor
are ſenſible of their want, and ſo are always waiting to be ſupplied
from the ſpring of life, and are ready to receive when it opens and
miniſters, and by the Goſpel they are converted, relieved, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſtrengthned; for the virtue thereof flowes in the life,
unto every breathing ſoul that wants in the Light; and this is the
Goſpel which is preached again in the Spirits power, as in times
paſt, and the joyful ſound hath entered the hearts of the poor,
and thereby they are reſtored into the joy of Gods Salvation, and
are heires of the Kingdom, and inherits the riches of life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
ſo as the teſtimony of the Light is faithfully obeyed, the
power of the Goſpel, workes by operation, and overcomes the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45031:8"/>
god of this World, and rend away the vail with which he hath
blinded the minde, and then the minde enters into the power of
the Goſpel, and in the power receives faith to believe in God,
and by faith in the power there is a ſure ſtanding, and a patient
waiting upon God; then doth the power work into ſalvation
regeneration and tranſlation, beating down every ſtrong hold,
and caſting out the god of this World which hath been exalted
in the place where he ought not, and ſo darkneſs comes to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
out of man by the power of the Goſpel which worketh ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
in all that believe, by which the mindes is drawn into the
new and living way, and ſo comes to be redeemed up to God by
Jeſus Chriſt, in whom is life Eternal, and in whole life is the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
of the Goſpel; therefore all people, forſake your own
way and live, and walk in the way of underſtanding, that after
your long time of weary wandrings in the night ſeaſon where
darkneſs hath compaſſed you about, you may come to the Light
of Chriſt in your own Conſciences, and ſo enter into the ſame
reſt, which is onely in God.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A tender greeting unto the royal off-ſpring
of God.</head>
               <p>RIght Dear and tenderly, beloved Lambs, in an acceptable
time hath the Lord God manifeſted his everlaſting love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and in the day of his Salvation he hath ſweetly viſited
your tender ſoules, and hath raiſed you up by the arme of his
power into the glorious life of the ſon of his love, in whom he
hath choſen you, and in whom he hath ſet his love upon you, and
made you his peculiar ones, in whom he taketh great delight, and
unto you his love doth freely run without ceaſing, and his life
doth flow with pure ſtreams of ſweet refreſhings; for in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
he hath gathered you, and in his Covenant his virtue hath
free paſſage to you, in which you ſpring as plants of his own hand;
and in his hand he keepes you, that none can pluck you out; for
with his hand he hath done valiant things ſince the day he ſet
his love upon you, and you are made witneſſes of his mighty
power, by which he hath preſerved you in your greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45031:9"/>
it is none but he alone that could do that for you which
hath been done, and therefore he alone is worthy of all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for the work is of him, and the glory belongs unto him over
all. Therefore my dearly beloved in the Lord, keep your Eye ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
to the firſt principle, the meaſure of Light which is pure, for
therein the Goſpel was firſt preached unto you, and by the ſame
your Eyes were opened, and your Ears unſtopped, &amp; your hearts
broken and melted, and there was the hand reached forth by
which you was firſt helped, and by that holy principle alone you
have been quickned; for it preached from the throne of God, and
from his glory, and with the ſame you were overcome to yeild up
all to be made one with it: So that ye are made children of the
Light, and of the day, and are witneſſes that this principle
brought life and immortality to Light by the Goſpel, and the
glad tydings did reach your mourning ſouls, and you were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
turned unto God, and became followers of the truth in the
love of it, and the Lord hath been with you, and bleſſed you,
and hath made your way proſperous, even as a people upon whom
his love is placed; and as he hath choſen you, and is a God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with you, ſo let the deſires of your hearts be kept unto him,
and to the remembrance of his name, that the pure ſeed of life
may be Crowned in every one, which is the birth that ſeekes the
glory of God alone; for as ye abide in the principle in which you
are gathered, ſo will the pure fear be retained, and in the low
eſtate you will be preſerved, unto which the Lord hath great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard;
for the waves upon the waters doth but riſe to fall again,
but the low eſtate is fixed on the Rock, and upon the rock ſtands
higher then all, and there the life is fell which God doth highly
exalt. Oh ye tender hearts! the Light of Chriſt teacheth, that
plainneſs is the path of truth, and lowly mindes walks in that, way,
and ſimplicity is with them, and innocency cloaths them, and in
that life is the ſweet refreſhment; for there the babe doth relliſh
the ſavour of that which is good for food, and with the ſame is
comforted and nouriſhed in its tender growth; therefore in the
innocency keep our ſtation, that the weighty power of God
may for ever be your defence; ſo will the glory of his life reſt upon
you, and the plant of his hand wil flouriſh and be fruitful in you,
and in its beautie you will be comely as the off-spring of God,
and bear his Image in the ſeed of glory; therefore retain the firſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45031:9"/>
principle which is of God, that the love wherewith God loves you
may for ever remain with you, and do you increaſe therein to the
glory of him who hath choſen you; for there is not an other
Goſpel but that which was firſt preached amongſt you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by you, the ſound of which was joyful in your hearts, and
made your feeble knees to gather ſtrength, ſo that you could
walk and leap for joy. Oh dwell in the ſame my dear beloved, for
it is the weighty power of God, in which is the Kingdom and
life without end.</p>
               <p>And have ſuch in ſingular love who are Fathers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who
firſt brought the tydings of peace by the Goſpel; for they are
worthy of double honour vvho yet continues labouring in the
vvord and doctrine, and nurſes the birth vvith pure milk, and
refreſhes the plant vvith heavenly vvaters; and though ſome
be fallen aſleep, having finiſhed their teſtimony faithfully, yet
their life remains vvith us, and in the ſame their glorious teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
are had in remembrance; yea it can never be forgotten by
the upright in heart, for their labour and travel, and faithful ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
for the Lord and his precious truth, doth ſtand as a ſure
feal of their holy teſtimony, which by them was faithfully held
forth unto the end, againſt all unrighteouſneſs and ungodlineſs
of men, and all their unlawfull deeds, and they are now entered
into everlaſting reſt, where their reward is with them in fullneſs;
and as their precious life is reteined, ſo will their teſtimony be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
increaſed and enlarged, by which God will yet make
known his great power and glory, to the comfort of his people,
and amazement of their enemies; therefore hold faſt the gift of
God which in the Light ye have received, that you with the ſame
may be cloſe girded up, and in your well doing continue to the
end, neither looking back, nor turning aſide to lay hold upon
any other thing then what was firſt preached, and in which ye
believed and received, which is the gift of God into Eternal
life.</p>
               <p>Brethren, theſe things I write, not as though ye had need of
teaching, but in that dear and tender love which floweth to you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
in the ſame to ſtir up your pure mindes to retain and hold
faſt that which ye have heard from the begining; and the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which abideth in you will teach you the ſame, as ye abide in it;
for you have no need of teaching who are in the anointing, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45031:10"/>
as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, which alſo will
bring to your Remembrance whatſoever hath been told you,
through the holy teſtimony of faithful brethren in the ſame life,
ſo ye being come to that which abides for ever, ye know the Lord
to be your teacher, who by his Counſel inſtructs you in the night
ſeaſon, and with his love doth comfort you and ſtrengthen you,
when there is not another to help you; and herein the Lord hath
made you to differ from all wanderers, who are wearying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their own way, and ſetting up teachers in their own wills,
upon whom the apoſtacie yet abideth, ſo that they hear not the
heavenly voyce, but gives heed to fables; which unto them is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the voyce of dreamers; but yee beloved have a more ſure
word, being come to the heavenly Light, in which you hear Chriſts
voyce, and follow him as his own ſheep in his own way, where
he teaches you in ſecret with the ſtill voyce of his life, ſo that
you can ſit in ſilence and ſee your teacher, and hear his voyce
that ſpeakes from heaven, and receive the joyful ſound into your
hearts, and feed upon the ſweetneſs of his own virtue, and drink
of the Rivers of his pleaſure freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is the weighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God which goes over all the wandrings and preſſes into
the ſtillneſs, by which the ſeed of God comes into dominion, and
cloathes the babes of its nature with the garment of praiſe, and
in this life the witneſs of God is anſwered in every Conſcience;
and this is the life which unto you is come, and of which ye are
born, ye dear beloved Lambs, who are reconciled unto God
through Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe love, life and power he hath joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
you together, and made you a compleat body in himſelf, from
whom let no man ſeparate you, or put you aſunder; but grow in
his life, in which you are purely the off-spring of God, by whoſe
power you are regenerated, and born again of incorruptible ſeed,
and are tranſlated into the nature of the lamb, whoſe heavenly
image you bear in his glory.</p>
               <p>So let the Word of Chriſt dwell plentifully in you, and in the
ſame exhort one another, and build up one another in your moſt
holy faith, alwayes keeping your Eye to the movings of the word,
that none may quench it through fear or doubting, nor loſe its
motion by over-running; but as it purely moves in it ſelf, &amp; opens
the riches of its fulneſs, ſo let the virtue flow from its own life
without adding or diminiſhing, and there you will all drink at the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45031:10"/>
ſtreams of one fountain, and be comforted together by one
ſpring; for as there may be a ſervice loſt when the movings of the
word is quenched, ſo there can be no ſervice done when another
motion is anſwered, or the true motion of the word is over-run;
but when the word diſpoſeſit ſelf in the riches of it ſelf, the ſavour
of its life is to the life in which the Babes rejoyce in endleſs peace
and unitie.</p>
               <p>Oh ye Lambs, right dear and precious you are, be ſtrong in
the faith, and look up to God, the day of your glory yet break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth, darkneſs cannot vail it, cruelty cannot cloud it, your
innocencie preaches, your patience and meekneſs reaches Gods
witneſs, the ſeed anſwereth and riſeth, &amp; many Eyes are turning to
your Light and life, ſtrong deſires are kindled towards you, and
the hearts of many wiſheth well unto you; and though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
you a far off, yet they love you: Oh the patient ſufferings of
the lambes hath pierced deep, glorious is your teſtimony ye holy
ones; who ſhall oppoſe you to proſper, I know not any, though for
a time they may afflict you and caſt you down, yet you are not
forſaken, but ſhall riſe again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the moſt high hath bleſsed you,
and your life ſhall ſpread and flouriſh, whilſt they that ſeek your
hurt will run themſelves to ruine. Dearly beloved brethren and
lambs, Fare ye well in the life of Chriſt Jeſus, who hath made us
one in himſelf, and ſet us together in the heavenly places of his
love, in whoſe boſom our joy, and peace, and reſt is ſure for ever,
where <hi>I</hi> right dearly greet you all. The everlaſting God of power &amp;
peace be with you, preſerve and keep yon in his heavenly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
life and wiſdome, in dominion to reigne, even ſo Amen.</p>
               <p>The arme of the Lord in this place is largely ſtretched forth,
to the gathering of his elect, and the precious truth doth flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
and abundantly proſper, &amp; many are lately joyned with it, &amp;
are become followers of it in love, glory and everlaſting prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
be given unto God moſt High. Friends in theſe parts are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
well and freſh in the truth of God and meetings large &amp;
peaceable, and in the love and Life of God both bond and free
rejoyces together.</p>
