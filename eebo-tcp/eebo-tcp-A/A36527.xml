            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for the credit of their Cauſe: Not that this plot of theirs procures any reputation to it. For neither younger nor elder of them, as appears in this and other of their Writings, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know the truth of God, or expreſſe it truly, no not in their mother-tongue. For the compoſure of theſe Quaeries, and bold and falſe wording of them, ſheweth plainly the weakneſſe of all who had an hand in them: Unleſſe (as <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> in his Vindication of his Paraphraſes tells the <hi>Sorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi>) they think their ill language brings advantage to their ſuppoſed truth, and more true Language breeds ſuſpition of the truth. Therefore we beſeech you to read without partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, both the ſaid Quaeries, and the Authors Anſwer to them; likewiſe his Counter-Quaeries to him and them: And the Lord give you underſtanding to the eſtabliſhment in the truth according to Godlineſſe, <hi>Tit. 1. 1.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was both; for beſides the immediate aforeſaid, I was Ordained a Miniſter by the Superiours and Governours of the Church, as the Elders and Paſtours of the Churches were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Act. 14. 23.

                  <hi>Anſ.

Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by or for prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the Preſbytery. Meditate on theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly unto them, that thy profiting may appear to all. Take heed unto thy ſelf, and unto thy doctrine: continue in them: For in ſo doing thou ſhalt ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee.</hi> Yea, if the Apoſtles had been put to it, to preach upon a ſhort Text or theme methodically, as by a long practice in the Church it is expected from us, they muſt oft-times have ſtudied for it, as I conceive; though if we were left at large to ſpeak as the Spirit of God moveth us, and giveth matter in, I hope ſome of us, by Gods aſſiſtance, ſhould ſpeak to as good or better purpoſe, than many who now pretend to the Spirits actings.</p>

Secondly, I ſay, If men be made of God ſpiritual, whether Shepherds and Plowmen firſt, they may teach.

               <p>For firſt, the Lord hath aſſumed to himſelf the right and title of all tythes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 30, 31, 32. <hi>And all the Tythe of the land, whether of the ſeed of the land, or of the fruit of the Trees, is the Lords: it is holy to the Lord. And if a man will at all redeem ought of his Tythes, he ſhall adde thereto the fifth part thereof. And concerning the tythes of the herd, and of the flock, even of whatſoever paſſeth under the rod, the tenth ſhall be holy unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord hath beſtowed thoſe upon the ſecond Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to wit, the Levites, as well as upon the firſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>But the Tythes of the children of Iſrael, which they offer as an heave-offering to the Lord, I have given to the Levites to inherit.</hi> Hence it is that the Lord ſaith he was robbed as well as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, when theſe were detained, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Will a man rob God? but ye have robbed me: Yet ye ſay, Wherein have we robbed thee?

               <p>Now you will not deny but there is a Prieſthood or Miniſtery in the New Teſtament which is to ſucceed the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> as miniſtring thereunto, and more ſpiritual, effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, and worthy then the Prieſthood of <hi>Levi.</hi> We would then have you ſhew us where Chriſt or his Apoſtles have taken away that maintenance which was allowed to both the others: which you can never do out of clear Scriptures: Nay, doth not Chriſt rather confirm them, then take them away, though he

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt demand in this quaery, I ſay, I hold not the Baptiſme of Infants abſolutely neceſſary, but lawful onely. It is ſufficient that I have no command in Scripture againſt the ſprinckling of Infants in the face with baptiſmal water; but I have the commandment of Governours, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal for it; ſeeing I am commanded to be <hi>ſubject to every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58832:8"/>
                  <hi>or unto Governours as thoſe that are ſent by him,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Yet have we an univerſal Promiſe, that all Nations in the Earth ſhould be bleſſed in the ſeed of promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 5. &amp; 18. 18. &amp; 22. 18. which promiſe is made to us and our children, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. If children then be within the Covenant, why may not they receive the ſeal of the Coevnant? Chriſt himſelf ſaith alſo, that <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> Mark 10 14. why may not ſuch then receive the badges of the children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Yea, the Apoſtle affirms, That all which came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> under <hi>Moſes,</hi> children as well as parents, were baptized in the cloud and in the Sea, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2. which is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ground for Infant-Baptiſme. Chriſts inviting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging thoſe that brought little children, his embracing them, and praying for them, diſcovers his affection to ſuch; and his rebuking of his Diſciples who would have kept them back, makes not for you and the Antipaedobaptiſts, but againſt you all. To the ſecond demand I ſay, That actual faith is required onely in men and women of ſome years and capacity to hear the Word. But Infants may be in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them, if he lightens every one that comes into the world; eſpecially ſince ſome are ſanctified from the womb, as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 13. And if Chriſt be in them, then they are Chriſtians indeed, and not in profeſſion onely. To the third and laſt demand, I ſay, That the prayers of the Miniſter and the Saints in the Congregation (who pray for the regeneration, preſervation and ſalvation of the child) for the preſent may profit and benefit the Infant. The Lord alſo may with the outward waſhing even then give his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to the child. And though he do not yet, that waſhing may prove as good a document to the perſon baptized for the time to come, as Circumciſion did in times paſt to the Jews, when they were grown up, though adminiſtred in their Infancy. To ſay nothing that it is a great ſatisfaction to the Chriſtian parents, that their children are admitted into the body of the viſible Church, and have received a diſtinguiſhing badge and cognizance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; And the child it ſelf hath from thence no ſmall motive or inſtigation to be a follower of Chriſt in his death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, all are not of the world whom you take to be of the world, to wit, who are no Quakers, or counted and called ſuch. Secondly, <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the general, to whom <hi>David</hi> gave his Pſalmes to be ſung, were for the greater part unregenerate, and men of the world as ye call them. Thirdly, he gave them in metre or meaſures to be ſung, as the learned in the Hebrew tongue know well, though perhaps none of your new Schooles underſtood ſo much. Fourthly, what condition was <hi>David</hi> in, into which every man may not come in time? Fifthly, are not <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes part of the holy Scriptures which are permitted to all men, and are profitable for all men to read? Sixthly, the Jewes did read all the Old Teſtament in publick, with a ſinging voice, as the Learned know. Seventhly, Did not the Lord by his ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> teach all <hi>Iſrael</hi> a ſong of his own making, to convince them of his goodneſſe, and their own wickedneſſe for the time to come, even then when they ſhould depart from the Lord, corrupt themſelves, and become mere men of the world, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 19, 20, 21, 22? which Song is contained at large, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 1, 2, &amp;c. Now you will not deny but <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes may have the ſame uſe and effect even upon the wicked, when they find how far they are from his godly wayes, ſpiritual frame and growth: His prayers may teach them to pray; his hymnes may reach them to laud the Lord; His afflictions may order, ſupport and comfort them when they are in the like condition; His prophecies and promiſes may be the ſtrengthening of their faith. Finally, his zeal to God, and his love to righteouſneſſe, may provoke many. So that ſcarce any book in the whole Bible or Volume of the Scriptures is more univerſally profitable to be read, ſaid, or ſung, then this will prove for all ſorts and eſtates of men.

As for the firſt of theſe, the ends of Chriſts coming, they are theſe among others. One is, to deſtroy or aboliſh the work of the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8.—or to redeem us from all iniquity, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. A ſecond is, to ſive us from our other enemies, even out of the hands of all that hate us, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 71.

Heb. 2. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. A ſeventh was, to ſet us a perfect example both of active and paſſive obedience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. An eighth was, that he might for our comfort give us an example of victory over the wicked world, and the Prince of it, even for our encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to fight the ſame battel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. A ninth was, that he might break down the partition-wall betwixt the Jewes and the Gentiles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. The tenth was, to be <hi>the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begotten from the dead,</hi> Coloſ. 1. 18. or <hi>the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20.

Thirdly, there is a redemption from the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. or a ſaving of us from the wrath to come, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 10.

So <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did often of <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2. 19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 16, 17. So are the <hi>Corinthians</hi> commended by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3. and other Brethren alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. Yea, which of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is it to whom that Apoſtle wrote, who are not in ſome things commended by him? See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. &amp;. 15. 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 14, 15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 10. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. How many Saints by name receive honour from him in the 16 Chapter of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and in the laſt Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians?</hi> doth not the Elect Lady and her children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive honour from <hi>John,</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, and both <hi>Gains</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> in his third Epiſtle? yea, men may reſpect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for their places, and more eſpecially for their ſpiritual worth, and be in the faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Governour to whom he ſpake, <hi>Moſt noble Feſtus,</hi> Acts 26. 25. And <hi>Eliſha</hi> honoured the face or preſence of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 King. 3. 14. Yea, all the Saints muſt honour thoſe that fear the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> True it is, it is a great hinderance to the faith, or the believing of the true Word, for men to ſeek the honour of men more then the honour that comes from God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 44. but by a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing, we may both ſeek honour and glory, and immortality, and in the end alſo obtain eternal life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. It is alſo a blot and blemiſh to the true believers, to reſpect the ungodly that are rich and great in this world, before the true Saints that are poor, <hi>James</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. Yea, it is a plain denyal of the faith, and of a good conſcience alſo, to reſpect perſons in doing of Juſtice whether for favour or reward, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. But to give deſerved honour and reſpect to men, is ſo far from being an impediment, or injurious to the true faith, that his faith is juſtly to be ſuſpected for unſound, or weak at the leaſt, who doth it not; and much more denyes it to be lawful, as your acquaintance doth.</p>

Where did Chriſt or his Apoſtles deprive any man, and much more ſo great a ſociety of men of their birthright by Law, or their civil Inheritance, as you go about to deprive us the Miniſters of this Nation of our legal rights and dues given by pious Benefactors, and confirmed by many Lawes and Acts of Parliament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 68. Is the teaching Prieſthood to ceaſe till the ſpiritual <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> come unto us to bleſſe us after the ſlaughter of all our enemies with the heavenly bread and wine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3. That you ſay that Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> with the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58832:19"/>
Law annexed of Tythes is ceaſed under the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 69. Why then hath Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13, 14. given <hi>ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Doctors, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, and for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the meanſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 70. Is he an hireling that takes the ſalary and wages allowed by God and men for his labour which he doth faithfully? or he only that affects the wages alone, and not the work, leaving his charge in time of danger, and longing only for the ſhadow and reſt, as being weary of the work, ſeeing our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Joh. 10. 13. The hireling fleeth becauſe he is an hireling, and careth not for the ſheep?</hi> See <hi>Job</hi> 7. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 71. Are the Superiour powers hirelings becauſe they take tribute and cuſtome by Gods allowance for their ſupport? <hi>Rom. 13. 6. For, for this cauſe pay ye tribute alſo: for they are Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters attending continually upon this very thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 72. Is it then diſhoneſt gain to take or require that which by the Lawes of God and man is appointed unto us for the work we do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 73. Do any follow the way of <hi>Balaam</hi> but thoſe that for gain and reward ſake are ready to curſe Gods people, and to give evil counſel againſt them, that they may be drawn into whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and commit iniquity and fornication againſt the Lord, as be did, <hi>Rev. 2. 14. But I have a few things againſt thee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>becauſe thou haſt them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to caſt a ſtumbling block before the children of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed to Idols, and to commit fornication?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 74. Did ever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> caſt greater reproaches upon the Proteſtant Miniſters then you do, and are you not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited by ſome of her Emiſſaries, that you would have them all one with another rooted out at once? Yea, what can the Devil himſelf deſire more in this kind?</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58832:19"/>
                  <hi>For ſuch are falſe Apoſtles, deceitful workers, transforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt. And no marvel, for Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is transformed into an Angel of light?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 76. Is not that falſe light the moſt dangerous darkneſſe, the hardeſt to be diſcerned and driven away, ſeeing our Saviour faith, <hi>Matth. 6. 23. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body ſhall be full of darkneſſe. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkneſſe, how great is that darkneſſe?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 77. Are we not therefore to try mens pretended light by the Law and Word of God, ſeeing <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, Chap. 8. 20. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, If they speak not according to that, it is becauſe there is no light or morning in them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 78. What may men think of your pretended light, who hate ſo many of your Brethren in the Miniſtery of <hi>England,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 9. He that ſaith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkneſſe even till now?</hi>

               <p>

76. and was filled with the Holy Ghoſt from his mothers womb, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 15. was not ſent forth to preach and propheſie till he was thirty years old?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 85. Whether the Lord will break his own orders and commands expreſly ſet down in his Word, where he ſaith (as you already heard) by <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 6. that a Biſhop or Elder muſt not be a ſtripling or <hi>novice, leſt he be lifted up with pride, and fall into the condemnation of the devil?</hi>

               <p>87. If you be extraordinary Prophets immediately inſpired, as many of you pretend to be, where are the miracles which ſuch inſpired men wrought in times paſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 88. What have you foretold by way of prediction which hath accordingly come to paſſe, as the Prophets, Apoſtles, and inſpired men were wont to do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 89. Why do you quarrel with us for being called by men Doctors, and Maſters, when both names ſignifie but Teachers; which office you take to your ſelves with authority more then enough in your writings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 90. Is it the receiving ſuch names, or the arrogant ſeeking of them, and that in chief place (which was Chriſts own privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) that our Lord prohibits, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 8. ſaying, <hi>But be ye not called Rabbi, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt, and all you are Brethren,</hi> ſeeing the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11. calls the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Teachers of the Church <hi>Paſtours</hi> and <hi>Doctours,</hi> or <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> as was ſaid before?</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58832:20"/>
of the place? Is it the taking of thoſe after a modeſt refuſal and offer of them to others, or an arrogant affecting and ſeeking of them that Chriſt blames in the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 6. ſaying, <hi>They love the uppermoſt rooms at feaſts?</hi>

Do not many of you ſtand up even upon tables, ſtools, forms and ſeats, when you ſpeak to a great multitude, as we do in the reading-pues and pulpits prepared for that end? Is it then the taking and uſing of ſuch places to a right end, or the pride and arrogance of the vain-glorious Phariſees, in affecting and ſtriving for the chief ſeats that our Saviour reproves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 6. ſaying, <hi>They love the chief ſeats in the Synagogues?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 93. Do not you receive greetings and ſalutations from your brethren and diſciples where ever you meet them, and even in the Market-place? And why do you blame this thing in us or others which your ſelves omit? Is it the giving or receiving of courteous greetings, or a proud Itch after honour and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe that Chriſt condemns, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 7. ſaying, <hi>They love greetings in the Market-place?</hi>

And the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. ſpeaking of the falſe teachers, ſaith, <hi>And many ſhall follow their pernicious way, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 95. Seeing this Age is earthly-minded, and willing to ſerve God with that which coſts them nothing, contrary to the pious and noble ſpirit of <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 24. is it any great wonder that your doctrine againſt Tythes ſhould find ſo many willing, yea, greedy entertainers of it, as it hath done ſince it was firſt broached?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 96. Did ever Chriſt or the Apoſtles diſturb the Prieſts and Miniſters of their times while they were teaching the people, as many of you and yours have done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 97. Doth the Goſpel ordinarily call any man from his lawful calling, whereby he ſhould maintain himſelf and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 20. Let every man abide in the ſame calling wherein he was called?</hi> and, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 28. Let him that ſtole ſteal no more, but rather let him labour, working with</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:58832:21"/>
                  <hi>his hands the thing that is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 98. Were any of the diſciples of Chriſt or his Apoſtles ſo ſtrangely and prodigiouſly, yea, ſo phanatically and diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally acted in their firſt converſion, or afterwards, as Sir <hi>William Spencer, John Gilpin,</hi> and others ſometimes; our auditors and followers have been?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 99. Can any man guided by the Spirit of God ſpeak againſt Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as <hi>Robert Collinſon</hi> and other of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents have done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 100. Have ſo many fallen into diſtraction and madneſſe in any ſect, or under any doctrine, as there hath done among your hearers, eſpecially where the number of diſciples was no greater?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 101. Under what ſort of Teachers have ſo many hearers and followers out of ſo ſmall a number laid hands upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as ſome of yours have done?</p>
               <p>To ſay nothing of the Sorceries charged upon many of you, nor of the familiar ſpirits with which ſome of yours are reported to deal; can the beſt of you be ſo fully enlightened, and ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally filled with, and acted by the Holy Ghoſt, as you pretend to be, that are miſtaken in ſo many things as your own books diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover you to be? But I will conclude with the words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 7, 8, 9. Now I pray God that ye do no evil, not that we ſhould appear approved, but that ye ſhould do that which is honeſt, though we be as reprobates. For we can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth. For we are glad when we are weak, and ye are ſtrong. And this alſo we wiſh, even your perfection.</hi>
