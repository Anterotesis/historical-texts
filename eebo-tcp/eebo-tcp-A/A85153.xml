         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Shewing, the danger thereof, that it may be avoided, by all that fear God,

a warning to you all for going to wizards for Counſell, for you go
from God, to the Devill, that go to take Counſell of a wizard.</p>
            <q>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, See that there be no Witchcrafts amongst you,
There ſhall not he found amongſt you any that uſeth Divinations, nor any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver

            <q>Regard not them that have familiar ſpirits, neither ſeek after Wizards, to he

            <p>Thou broughrſt in a place of Scripture to have proved thy ſorceries and
lying divinations, which was this: And God ſaid, let there be lights in the
firmament of heaven, to divide the night from the day, and let them be for
ſigns and for ſeaſons, and for daies and years. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
            <p>That was nothing at all to prove Sorcery and Inchantments (thou Beaſt)
God did never ſay that by them they ſhould uſe Inchantments, and lying
divinations, and caſt figures, and tell fortunes, as Sorcerers and Witches,
and black Artiſts, Nicromancers, Wizards, that do divine lyes, which thing
God abhorres; and all lyars and diviners for mony, like thee. Read <hi>Deut.
18.</hi> 10, 11. But God ſet the Stars in the firmament of heaven, to praiſe
him, and to be for lights upon the earth, and God made two great lights,
the greater light to rule the day, and the leſſer light to rule the night, he
made the Stars alſo, and God ſet them in the firmament of heaven, to give
light upon the earth, and not for Witches to caſt figures, and Iyars to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
for mony by them, but he ſet them to rule over the day, and over the
night, and to divide the light from the darkneſſe, and God ſaw that it was
good, as it is written and witneſſed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Sun, Moon and Stars were ſet in the firmament of heaven,
to know the regiment or government thereof, and to hold forth the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, to praiſe him in the hoſt of heaven, in his wonderous works,
above the earth, and not for fortune-tellers and Inchanters to divine for
mony by them, as Wizards, (and thou diviner of lies,) wouldſt have them:
let the Scriptures be witneſſe againſt thee, and the Star-gazers, Wizards,
and all that divine for mony thereby: who would have the Scriptures
to bear thee out in that which they witneſſe againſt thee, for acting contrary
to them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Stars were not ſet in the firmament for ſuch as thou art, to
tell deſtinies or fortunes by, nor to divine lyes for mony by, nor to caſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures

as Wizards do, that take peoples mony for falſe dreams, and lying divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114700:5"/>
and as thou ſorcerer and perverter of the Scripture wouldſt have
them, but the Stars were ſet, to give light, and to know the noble works
of God in them, and by them in their covenant, as they ſtand and keep
their courſe, and to hold forth the wiſdom of God in the firmament of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and alſo that man might praiſe him for his noble acts, and as it is
written in the book of Pſalms, Oh, give thanks unto the Lord of Lords,
for his mercy endureth forever, (to his own hoſt) Oh, give thanks to him
that by wiſdome made the heavens, for his mercy endureth for ever; Oh,
give thanks to him that made the great lights, for his mercy (to his) endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for ever, the Sun to rule the day, and the Moon and the Stars to rule
the night, for his mercy endureth for ever, and they were not ſet to divine
lyes by, and caſt figures, to tell fortunes, ſo called, and ſpeak lying divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by, as thou (ſorcerer and diviner of lyes) wouldſt have them; the
Scriptures witneſſe againſt thee and all Wizards, and all that truly feares
God will witneſſe with me and the Scriptures, againſt thee and all diviners
of lyes, ſuch as thou art, that perverts the Scriptures. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. 1, 2, 3.
to the 10. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Again, the Stars were not ſet in the firmament to inchant and divine
lyes to get mony by, to make a trade of them, by uſing divinations as thou
(Star gazer and Wizard) wouldſt have them, who thy ſelf art a perverter of
Scripture to thy own deſtruction, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 16. But they were ſet there for
the praiſe of God, and to hold forth his wiſdome in the firmament of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to cauſe men to praiſe the Lord, as it is written, praiſe the Lord, praiſe
ye the Lord from the heavens, praiſe him in the higheſt, praiſe ye him all
his Angels, and praiſe ye him all his hoſts, praiſe him Sun and Moon, praiſe
him all ye Stars of light. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>It is not ſaid inchant, by the Stars, caſt figures by the Stars, nor tell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies
or fortunes by the Stars, neither is it ſaid, when goods are ſtolne or
ſtrayed, go to Wizards, they ſhall tell you of them by the Stars, as thou
wouldſt have it, that art an Inchanter, that uſeſt lying wonders, and divine
lyes for mony, and tell people of thoſe things which never come to paſſe,
and taketh their mony for thy lying divinations, as it was proved againſt
thee that day at <hi>Tamworth,</hi> thou Inchanter, Star-gazer, and diviner of lyes,
whoſe rage was great after thy deceit was diſcovered, and thy evill practiſe
declared againſt, which the Devill in thee would have alledged for by
Scripture, when the Scriptures turn edge againſt thee, and cut the off there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
as <hi>David</hi> cut off <hi>Goliah</hi>'s head with his own ſword, that defied the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the living God, as thou wert in enmity againſt the truth,
and cryed fie upon the ſervant of the only true God. Therefore thus ſaith
the Lord my God, and the redeemer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his choſen, he that formed

darkneſſe, as thou haſt done, that profeſſeſt God in words, and ſerves the
Divell in thy actions, and art ready to ſay in thy heart, I am, and none elſe,
beſides me, as ſuch in thy nature did: read, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 47. 11.</p>
            <p>Stand now with thy Inchantments, and with the multitude of thy Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries,
wherein thou haſt laboured and all that are deceived by thee, or
any ſuch. Let now the Aſtrologers, the Star-gazers, (like thee) ſtand up,
and ſee if they can ſave them from thoſe things that ſhall come upon them;
I lament for thoſe that are turned to Wizards, Aſtrologers, Star-gazers, and

               <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he had his Magicians (or the Divel's Wiſe men or Wizards)
that were in familiarity with the Divell, and black Artiſts to enquire of,
when he was troubled in Spirit, but they could not tell him of the things
that God was about to do, as it is in <hi>Gen.</hi> the 41. And it came to paſſe, that

God doth utterly abhorre that, and he is againſt it, and againſt all Diviners

aforeſaid, there was a meeting (of the Lords people) at <hi>Harliſton</hi>

and ſaid to one of the men (called Quakers) that he was his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

ſaid there was many inſtructors, but there was but few fathers, and
ſaid the ſpirits of the Prophets were ſubject to the Prophets, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the friend by the ſpirit of the Lord had ſpoken ſomething to him
in exhoſtation, and his ſpirit was much ſubjected, and tender he

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114700:12"/>
ing the danger that <hi>Daniel</hi> might fall into if he gave way to the
tempter, being convinced and having ſome opening in his mind,

not abiding in that which did convince him of the evil of his heart

raſhly and unadviſedly (without the true wiſdom) and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the temptation, did evil, and alſo opened the mouthes of

            <p>Therefore, all whoſe minds are turned with the light towards the
Lord Jeſus, from whence the Light comes; upon it wait, and in it
abide, that ye may be preſerved in the grace, and be kept for turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

turned from the light as <hi>Judas</hi> did, and ſo is an enemy to the Truth
as he was: but though he have ſo done, who now turns the grace of
God into wantonneſs and laſciviouſneſs: Wo from God is his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

enemies now, as it ever had, yet Truth is the ſame that it ever was.
And though the ſaid <hi>Daniel,</hi> by turning from the Light, maketh
ſhip-wrack of Faith and a good Conſcience, as <hi>Himeneus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
did that were given over to Satan, (as he is) yet ſome held
faſt, and doth hold faſt Faith and a good Conſcience, in which the
myſtery of Faith is held, prayſed be the Lord, and Truth is the ſame

him, <hi>John</hi> 6. to the 6-7. yet the Truth was the ſame, though ye did
