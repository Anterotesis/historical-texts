            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen I conſider your great Zeal to your Country, how much you have expos'd your ſelves for its Service, and how little you have improved your own Fortunes, I think it is but Juſtice to your Merits to make your Encomiums the Preface to the following Diſcourſe. 'Tis you that have abated the Pride, and reduced the Luxury of the Kingdom: You have been the Phyſicians and Divines of the Commonwealth, by purging it of that Droſs and Dung, which corrupts the Minds, and deſtroys the Souls of Men. You have convinced us that there is no Safety in Counſellors, nor Truſt to be put in Ships under your Conduct.</p>
            <p>You have clear'd the Seas, not of Pyrats, but of our own Merchants, and by that means have made our Priſons as ſo many Store-houſes to repleniſh your Troops. In fine, to uſe the Expreſſion of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Your Hearts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable for Wiſdom, and there is no finding out your Underſtanding.</hi> When I conſider all this, and
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:99230:3"/>
compare your Merits with your Preferments, how you came by them, and your behaviour in them, I cannot but think a Standing Army a Collateral Security to your Title to them, and therefore muſt commend your Policy in promoting it. <hi>For by theſe Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice.</hi> Theſe will be our Magiſtrates, who will not bear the Sword in vain. Theſe, like the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> will wear their <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> on their Backs and Breaſts, and will be our Prieſts, who will hew the Sinners to pieces, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did <hi>Agag</hi> before the Lord in <hi>Gilgal.</hi> By theſe you will be able to teach us Paſſive Obedience, as Men having Authority, and not as the Scribes. You will have your Reaſons in your Hands againſt reſiſting the higher Powers, and will prove your <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> by the Sword of the Lord and of <hi>Gideon.</hi>

            <head>An <hi>ARGUMENT,</hi> ſhewing that a <hi>STANDING ARMY</hi> is inconſiſtent with a free Government, and abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Conſtitution of the Engliſh Monarchy.</head>
            <p>WHen I conſider what a diſmal Scene of Blood and Deſolation hath appeared upon the Theatre of <hi>Europe</hi> during the Growth and Progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> Power, I cannot ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently applaud and admire our thrice happy Situation, by which we have long enjoy'd an uninterrupted courſe of Peace and Proſperity, whilſt our Neighbouring Nations have been miſerably haraſſed by perpetual War: For lying open to continual Invaſion, they can never enjoy Quiet and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor take a ſound Sleep, but, <hi>Hercules</hi> like, with Clubs in their hands: So that theſe Halcyon Days which we enjoy amidſt ſuch an univerſal Hurricane, muſt be ſolely attributed to our Tutelar God <hi>Neptune,</hi> who with a Guard of winged Courſers ſo ſtrongly intrenches us, that we may be ſaid to be <hi>mediâ inſuperabiles undâ,</hi> and not unfitly compar'd to the Earth, which ſtands fix'd and immoveable, and never to be ſhaken but by an internal Convulſion. And as Nature has been thus liberal to us in our Situation, ſo the Luxuriancy of our Soil makes it productive of numerous Commodities
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99230:4"/>
fit for Trade and Commerce: And as this Trade renders us Maſters of the Silver and Gold of the Eaſt and Weſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our toiling in the Mine, ſo it breeds us multitudes of able-bodied and skilful Seamen to defend the Treaſures they bring home, that even Luxury it ſelf, which has been the Bane and Deſtruction of moſt Countries where it has been predominant, may in ſome meaſure be eſteemed our Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by breeding up a Race of Men amongſt us, whoſe manner of Life will never ſuffer them to be debauched, or enervated with Eaſe or Idleneſs. But we have one thing more to boaſt of beſides all theſe Felicities, and that is, of being Free-men and not Slaves in this unhappy Age, when an univerſal Deluge of Tyranny has overſpread the face of the whole Earth; ſo that this is the Ark out of which if the Dove be ſent forth, ſhe will find no reſting place till her Return.</p>
            <p>Our Conſtitution is a limited mix'd Monarchy, where the King enjoys all the Prerogatives neceſſary to the ſupport of his Dignity, and Protection of his People, and is only abridged from the Power of injuring his own Subjects: In ſhort, the Man is looſe, and the Beaſt only bound; and our Government may truly be called an Empire of Laws, and not of Men; for every Man has the ſame right to what he ean acquire by his Labour and Induſtry, as the King hath to his Crown, and the meaneſt Subject hath his Remedy againſt him in his Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> No Man can be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, unleſs he has tranſgreſſed a Law of his own making, nor be try'd but by his own Neighbours; ſo that we enjoy a Liberty ſcarce known to the antient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And leſt the extraordinary Power intruſted in the Crown ſhould lean towards Arbitrary Government, or the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary Licentiouſneſs of the People ſhould encline towards a Democracy, the Wiſdom of our Anceſtors hath inſtituted a middle State, <hi>viz.</hi> of Nobility, whoſe Intereſt it is to trim
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99230:4"/>
this Boat of our Commonwealth, and to skreen the People againſt the Inſults of the Prince, and the Prince againſt the Popularity of the Commons, ſince if either Extream prevail ſo far as to oppreſs the other, they are ſure to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in their Ruin. And the meeting of theſe three States in Parliament is what we call our Government: for without all their Conſents no Law can be made, nor a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Money levied upon the Subjects; ſo that the King's Neceſſities do often oblige him to ſummon this Court, which is the Grand Inqueſt of the Kingdom, where the People ſpeak boldly their Grievances, and call to account over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Criminals, who are above the reach of ordinary Juſtice: ſo that the Excellence of this Government conſiſts in the due ballance of the ſeveral conſtituent Parts of it, for if either one of them ſhould be too hard for the other two, there is an actual Diſſolution of the Conſtitution; but whilſt we can continue in our preſent Condition, we may without Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity reckon our ſelves the happieſt People in the World.</p>
            <p>But as there is no degree of Human Happineſs but is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſome Defects, and the ſtrongeſt Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are moſt liable to certain Diſeaſes; ſo the very Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of our Government betrays it to ſome Inconveniences, the Wheels and Motions of it being ſo curious and delicate that it is often out of order, and therefore we ought to apply our utmoſt Endeavours to rectify and preſerve it: and I am afraid it is more owing to the accident of our Situation, than to our own Wiſdom, Integrity or Courage, that it has yet a Being; when we ſee moſt Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> over-run with Oppreſſion and Slavery, where the Lives, Eſtates and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People are ſubject to the lawleſs Fancy and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Prince, and the Rapine and Inſolence of his Officers; where the Nobility, that were formerly the bold Aſſertors of their Countries Liberty, are now only the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Ornaments of the Tyranny, and the People Beaſts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99230:5"/>
of Burden, and barely kept alive to ſupport the Luxury and Prodigality of their Maſters.</p>
            <p>And if we enquire how theſe unhappy Nations have loſt that precious Jewel <hi>Liberty,</hi> and we as yet preſerved it, we ſhall find their Miſeries and our Happineſs proceed from this, That their Neceſſities or Indiſcretion have permitted a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army to be kept amongſt them, and our Situation rather than our Prudence, hath as yet defended us from it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we had long ſince loſt what is the moſt valuable thing under Heaven: For, as I ſaid before, our Conſtitution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon a due ballance between King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and that Ballance depending upon their mutual Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Neceſſities they have of one another; if this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be once broke, there is an actual Diſſolution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Now this Ballance can never be preſerved but by an Union of the natural and artificial Strength of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that is, by making the Militia to conſiſt of the ſame Perſons as have the Property; or otherwiſe the Government is violent and againſt Nature, and cannot poſſibly continue, but the Conſtitution muſt either break the Army, or the Army will deſtroy the Conſtitution: for it is univerſally true, that where-ever the Militia is, there is or will be the Government in a ſhort time; and therefore the Inſtitutors of this Gothick Ballance (which was eſtabliſhed in all Parts of <hi>Europe)</hi> made the Militia to conſiſt of the ſame Parts as the Government, where the King was General, the Lords by virtue of their Caſtles and Honours, the great Commanders, and the Freeholders by their Tenures the Body of the Army; ſo that it was next to impoſſible for an Army thus conſtituted to act to the diſadvantage of the Conſtitution, unleſs we could ſuppoſe them to be Felons <hi>de ſe.</hi> And here I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſert that upon no other Foundation than this, can any Nation long preſerve its Freedom, unleſs ſome very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Accidents contribute to it; and I hope I ſhall make it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99230:5"/>
appear, that no Nation ever preſerved its Liberty, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an Army otherwiſe conſtituted within the Seat of their Government: and let us flatter our ſelves as much as we pleaſe, what happened yeſterday, will come to paſs again; and the ſame Cauſes will produce like Effects in all Ages.</p>
            <p>And here I can't avoid taking notice of ſome Gentlemen who a few Years ſince were the pretended Patriots of their Country, who had nothing in their Mouths but the ſacred Name of <hi>Liberty,</hi> who in the late Reigns could hardly afford the King the Prerogative that was due to him, and which was abſolutely neceſſary to put in motion this Machine of our Government, and to make the Springs and Wheels of it act naturally, and perform their Function: I ſay, theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that could not with Patience hear of the King's ordinary Guards, can now diſcourſe familiarly of twenty thouſand Men to be maintained in times of Peace; and the odious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe they give for this infamous Apoſtacy is, that if they ſhould not gratify the Court in this modeſt Requeſt, another Party may be careſſed who will grant this, or any thing elſe which is asked, and then they ſay matters will be much worſe; as if Arbitrary Government was a different thing in their hands, from what it is in others, or that the Lineaments and Features of Tyranny would become graceful and lovely when they are its <hi>Valet de Chambres.</hi> But let them not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, for if they think to make their Court this way, they will quickly find themſelves outflattered by the Party they fear, who have been long the Darlings of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, and whoſe Principles as well as Practices teach them to be Enemies to all the legal Rights, and juſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Native Country; and ſo theſe wretched Bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>

And tho we are ſecure from any Attempts of this kind du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of a Prince who hath reſcued us from a Captivity equal to what <hi>Moſes</hi> redeemed the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from: A Prince whoſe Life is ſo neceſſary to the Preſervation of <hi>Europe,</hi> that both Proteſtant and Popiſh Princes have forgot their antient Maxims, and laid aſide their innate Animoſities, and made it their common Intereſt to chuſe him their Patron and Protector: A Prince in whom we know no Vices but what have been eſteemed Vertues in others, <hi>viz.</hi> his unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Clemency to his Enemies, and his expoſing too much that Life upon which depends not only our Safety, but the Liberties of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion through the World: I ſay, was this moſt excellent Prince to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal (as his Great and Glorious Actions) we ought in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prudence to abandon all thoughts of Self-preſervation, and wholly to rely on his Care and Conduct. But ſince no Vertue nor pitch of Glory will exempt him from paying the common Debt to Nature, but Death hath a Sythe which cuts off the moſt noble Lives; we ought not to intruſt any Power with him, which we don't think proper to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to his Succeſſors: and doubtleſs our great Benefactor will not regret this, or any thing elſe that can reaſonably be demanded in order to compleat that Deliverance ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by his invincible Courage and Conduct; for to ſet us, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> within view of the promiſed Land, with a <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> is the greateſt of all Human Infelicities, and ſuch I ſhall always take our Caſe to be, whilſt a ſtanding Army muſt be kept up to prey upon our Entrails, and which muſt in the hands of an ill Prince (which we have the misfortune frequently to meet with) infallibly deſtroy our Conſtitunion. And this is ſo evident and important a Truth, that no Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator ever founded a free Government, but avoided this <hi>Caribdis,</hi> as a Rock againſt which his Commonwealth muſt certainly be ſhipwrack'd, as the <hi>Iſraelites, Athenians, Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99230:6"/>
Achaians, Lacedemonians, Thebans, Samnites,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> none of which Nations whilſt they kept their Liberty were ever known to maintain any Souldiers in conſtant Pay within their Cities, or ever ſuffered any of their Subjects to make War their Proſeſſion; well knowing that the Sword and Soveraignty always march hand in hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they trained their own Citizens and the Territories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them perpetually in Arms, and their whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths by this means became ſo many ſeveral formed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litias: A general Exerciſe of the beſt of their People in the uſe of Arms, was the only Bulwark of their Liberties; this was reckon'd the ſureſt way to preſerve them both at home and abroad, the People being ſecured thereby as well againſt the Domeſtick Affronts of any of their own Citizens, as againſt the Foreign Invaſions of ambitious and unruly Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Their Arms were never lodg'd in the hands of any who had not an Intereſt in preſerving the publick Peace, who fought <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> and thought themſelves ſufficiently paid by repelling Invaders, that they might with freedom return to their own Affairs. In thoſe days there was no difference between the Citizen, the Souldier, and the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, for all promiſcuouſly took Arms when the publick Safety required it, and afterwards laid them down with more Alacrity than they took them up: So that we find amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> the beſt and braveſt of their Generals came from the Plough, contentedly returning when the Work was over, and never demanded their Triumphs till they had laid down their Commands, and reduced themſelves to the ſtate of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men. Nor do we find that this famous Commonwealth ever permitted a Depoſition of their Arms in any other hands, till their Empire increaſing, Neceſſity conſtrained them to erect a conſtant ſtipendiary Souldiery abroad in Foreign Parts, either for the holding or winning of Provinces: Then Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry increaſing with Dominion, the ſtrict Rule and Diſcipline
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99230:7"/>
of Freedom ſoon abated, and Forces were kept up at home, which ſoon prov'd of ſuch dangerous Conſequence, that the People were forced to make a Law to employ them at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient diſtance; which was, that if any General marched over the River <hi>Rubicon,</hi> he ſhould be declar'd a publick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: and in the Paſſage of that River this following Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was erected; <hi>Imperator ſive miles, ſive Tyrannus armatus quiſquis ſiſtito, vexillum<expan>

            <p>Nor, as I ſaid before, did any Nation deviate from theſe Rules but they loſt their Liberty; and of this kind there are infinite Examples, out of which I ſhall give a few in ſeveral Ages, which are moſt known, and occur to every ones reading.</p>
            <p>The firſt Example I ſhall give is of <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> who artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially prevailing with the <hi>Athenians</hi> to allow him fifty Guards for the Defence of his Perſon, he ſo improv'd that Number, that he ſeiz'd upon the Caſtle and Government, deſtroy'd the Commonwealth, and made himſelf Tyrant of <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Corinthians</hi> being in apprehenſion of their Enemies, made a Decree for four hundred Men to be kept to defend their City, and gave <hi>Tymophanes</hi> the Command over them, who overturned their Government, cut off all the principal Citizens, and proclaim'd himſelf King of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agathocles</hi> being the Captain-General of the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> got ſuch an Intereſt in the Army, that he cut all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators to pieces, and the richeſt of the People, and made himſelf their King.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> for fear of the <hi>Teutones</hi> and <hi>Cimbri,</hi> who like vaſt Inundations threatned their Empire, choſe <hi>Martus</hi> their General, and, contrary to the Conſtitution of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99230:7"/>
continued him five Years in his Command, which gave him ſuch opportunity to inſinuate, and gain an Intereſt in their Army, that he oppreſſed their Liberty: and to this were owing all the Miſeries, Maſſacres, and Ruins which that City ſuffered under him and <hi>Scylla,</hi> who made the beſt Blood in the World run like Water in the Streets of <hi>Rome,</hi> and turn'd the whole City into a Shambles of the Nobility, Gentry and People.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing enabled <hi>Ceſar</hi> totally to overthrow that famous Commonwealth; for the Prolongation of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in <hi>Gaul</hi> gave him an opportunity to debauch his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and then upon a pretended Diſguſt he marched to <hi>Rome,</hi> drove out the Senators, ſeiz'd the Treaſury, fought then Forces, and made himſelf perpetual Dictator.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Olivaretto de Fermò</hi> deſired leave of his fellow-Citizens, that he might be admitted into their Town with a hundred Horſe of his Companions; which being granted, he put to the Sword all the principal Citizens, and proclaim'd himſelf their Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> being General of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> uſurped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and made himſelf Duke of <hi>Millain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> the Second King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd <hi>Sweden,</hi> he invited all the Senators and Nobility to a magnificent Entertainment, where after he had treated them highly for two days, he moſt barbarouſly butcher'd them: None eſcaped this Maſſacre but the brave <hi>Guſtavus Ericſon,</hi> who was then a Priſoner; but he afterwards eſcaping through a thouſand Difficulties, by his good Fortune, Courage and Conduct, drove the <hi>Danes</hi> out of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and reſtor'd the <hi>Swedes</hi> to their antient Kingdom. Nothing then was thought too great for their Generous Deliverer, every Mouth was full of his Praiſes, and by the Univerſal Voice of the People he was choſen their King; and to conſummate the laſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Gratitude, they truſted him with an Army:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99230:8"/>
but they ſoon found their Miſtake, for it coſt them their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and having granted that <hi>unum magnum,</hi> it was too late to diſpute any thing elſe: His Succeſſors having been pleaſed to take all the reſt, and now they remain the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Examples of too credulous Generoſity.</p>
            <p>The Story of <hi>Denmark</hi> is ſo generally known, and ſo well related by a late excellent Author, that it would be Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence in me to repeat it; only this I will obſerve, that if the King had not had an Army at his Command, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles had never deliver'd up their Government.</p>
            <p>Our Country man <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> turn'd out that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under which he ſerv'd, and who had got Immortal Honour through the whole World by their great Actions; and this he effected by the Aſſiſtance of an Army, which muſt be allowed to have had as much Vertue, Sobriety, and publick Spirit, as hath been known in the World ſince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt that ſort of Men.</p>
            <p>The laſt Inſtance I ſhall give, is of a French Colony, as I remember in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> who having War with the neighbouring <hi>Indians,</hi> and being tired in their March with the extremity of Heat, made their Slaves carry their Arms, who taking that opportunity fell upon them, and cut them to pieces; a juſt Puniſhment for their Folly. And this will always be the fate of thoſe that truſt their Arms out of their own hands: for it is a ridiculous Imagination to conceive Men will be Servants, when they can be Maſters. And as Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> judiciouſly obſerves, Whatever Nation ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers their Servants to carry their Arms, their Servants will make them hold their Trenchers.</p>
            <p>Some People object, That the Republicks of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> are Inſtances to diſprove my Aſſertion, who both keep great Armies, and yet have not loſt their Liberty. I anſwer, that neither keep any ſtanding Forces within the Seats of their Government, that is, within the City of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99230:8"/>
               <hi>Venice,</hi> or the great Towns of the United Provinces; but they defend theſe by their own Burghers, and quarter their Mercenaries in their conquered Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Continent of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> and the Situation of theſe States make their Armies, ſo poſted, not dangerous to them: for the <hi>Venetians</hi> cannot be attack'd without a Fleet, nor the <hi>Dutch</hi> be ever conquer'd by their own Forces, their Country being ſo full of ſtrong Towns, fortified both by Art and Nature, and defended by their own Citizens, that it would be a fruitleſs Attempt for their own Armies to invade them; for if they ſhould march againſt any of their Cities, 'tis but ſhutting up their Gates, and the Deſign is ſpoiled.</p>
            <p>But if we admit that an Army might be conſiſtent with Freedom in a Commonwealth, yet it is otherwiſe in a free Monarchy; for in the former 'tis wholly in the diſpoſal of the People, who nominate, appoint, diſcard, and puniſh the Generals and Officers as they think fit, and 'tis certain Death to make any Attempt upon their Liberties; whereas in the latter, the King is perpetual General, may model the Army as he pleaſes, and it will be called High-Treaſon to oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>And tho ſome Princes, as the Family of the <hi>Medices, Lewes</hi> the <hi>XIth,</hi> and others laid the Foundation of their Tyrannies without the immediate Aſſiſtance of an Army, yet they all found an Army neceſſary to eſtabliſh them; or otherwiſe a little Experience in the People of the change of their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would have made them diſgorge in a day that ill-gotten Power they had been acquiring for an Age.</p>
            <p>This Subject is ſo ſelf-evident, that I am almoſt aſham'd to prove it: for if we look through the World, we ſhall find in no Country, Liberty and an Army ſtand together; ſo that to know whether a People are Free or Slaves, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary only to ask, Whether there is an Army kept amongſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99230:9"/>
them? and the Solution of that Preliminary Queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the Doubt: as we ſee in <hi>China, India, Tartary, Perſia, Ethiopia, Turkey, Morocco, Muſcovy, Auſtria, France, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Tuſcany,</hi> and all the little Principalities of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where the People live in the moſt abandoned Slavery; and in Countries where no Armies are kept within the Seat of their Government, the People are free, as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Biſcay, Switzerland,</hi> the <hi>Griſons, Venice, Holland, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, Geneva, Raguſa, Algiers, Tunis, Hamborough, Lubeck,</hi> all the free Towns in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late Reigns. This Truth is ſo obvious, that the moſt barefac'd Advocates for an Army do not directly deny it, but qualify the matter by telling us, that a Number not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fifteen or twenty thouſand Men are a handful to ſo populous a Nation as this: Now I think that Number will bring as certain Ruin upon us, as if they were as many Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and I will give my Reaſons for it.</p>
            <p>It's the misfortune of all Countries, that they ſometimes lie under an unhappy neceſſity to defend themſelves by Arms againſt the Ambition of their Governours, and to fight for what's their own; for if a Prince will rule us with a Rod of Iron, and invade our Laws and Liberties, and neither be prevailed upon by our Miſeries, Supplications, or Tears, we have no Power upon Earth to appeal to, and therefore muſt patiently ſubmit to our Bondage, or ſtand upon our own Defence; which if we are enabled to do, we ſhall never be put upon it, but our Swords may grow ruſty in our hands: for that Nation is ſureſt to live in Peace, that is moſt capable of making War; and a Man that hath a Sword by his ſide, ſhall have leaſt occaſion to make uſe of it. Now I ſay, if the King hath twenty thouſand Men before hand with us, or much leſs than half that Number, the People can make no Effort to defend their Liberties without the Aſſiſtance of a Foreign Power, which is a Remedy moſt commonly as bad
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99230:9"/>
as the Diſeaſe; and if we have not a Power within our ſelves to defend our Laws, we are no Government.</p>
            <p>For <hi>England</hi> being a ſmall Country, few ſtrong Towns in it, and thoſe in the King's Hands, the Nobility diſarmed by the deſtruction of Tenures, and the Militia not to be raiſed but by the King's Command, there can be no Force levied in any part of <hi>England,</hi> but muſt be deſtroy'd in its Infancy by a few Regiments: For what will three or four thouſand naked and unarm'd Men ſignify againſt as many Troops of Mercenary Souldiers? What if they ſhould come into the Field and ſay, You muſt chooſe theſe and theſe Men your Repreſentatives; Where is your Choice? What if they ſhould ſay, Parliaments are ſeditious and factious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and therefore ought to be aboliſhed; What is become of your Freedom? Or, if they ſhould encompaſs the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Houſe, and threaten if they do not ſurrender up-their Government, they will put them to the Sword; What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the old Engliſh Conſtitution? Theſe things may be, and have been done in ſeveral parts of the World. What is it that cauſeth the Tyranny of the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day, but Servants in Arms? What is it that preſerved the glorious Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> but Swords in the hands of its Citizens?</p>
            <p>And if beſides this, we conſider the great Prerogatives of the Crown, and the vaſt Intereſt the King has and may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by the Diſtribution of ſo many profitable Offices of the Houſhold, of the Revenue, of State, of Law, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Navy, together with the Aſſiſtance of a powerful Party, who have been always the faſt and conſtant Friends to Arbitrary Power, whoſe only Quarrel to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty is, that he has knock'd off the Chains and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they thought they had lock'd faſt upon us; a Party who hath once engag'd us in an unhappy Quarrel amongſt our ſelves (the Conſequence of which I dread to name) and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99230:10"/>
ſince in a tedious and chargeable War, at the vaſt expence of Blood and Treaſure, to avoid that Captivity they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for us: I ſay, if any one conſiders this, he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that we have enough to do to guard our ſelves againſt the Power of the Court, without having an Army thrown into the Scale againſt us: and we have found oftner than once by too fatal. Experience the truth of this; for if we look back to the late Reigns, we ſhall ſee this Nation brought to the brink of Deſtruction, and breathing out the laſt Gaſp of their Liberty; and it is more owing to our good Fortune, than to any Effort we were able to make, that we eſcaped the fatal Blow.</p>
            <p>And I believe no Man will deny, but if <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt had had five thouſand Men before-hand with us, the People had never ſtruck a ſtroke for their Liberties; or if the late King <hi>James</hi> would have been contented with Arbitrary Power without bringing in Popery, but he and his black Guard would have bound us hand and foot before this time: But when their ill-contriv'd Oppreſſion came home to their own Doors, they quickly ſhew'd the World how different a thing it was to ſuffer themſelves, and to make other People ſuffer, and ſo we came by our Deliverance; and tho the late King had the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, People, and his own Army againſt him, and we had a very wiſe and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Prince nearly related to the Crown, and back'd by a powerful State for our Protector, yet we account this Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution next to a Miracle.</p>
            <p>I will add here, that moſt of the Nations I inſtanced before were inſlaved by ſmall Armies: <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> leſt behind him but 17000 Men; and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who was the Darling of the People, was ſuppreſs'd with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; nay, <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſeiz'd <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf with five thouſand, and fought the Battel of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> where the Fate of the World was decided, with twenty two thouſand; and moſt of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99230:10"/>
Revolutions of the Roman and Ottoman Empires ſince were cauſed by the Pretorian Bands, and the Court-Janizaries; the former of which never exceeded eight, nor the latter twelve thouſand Men: And if no greater Numbers could make ſuch Diſturbances in thoſe vaſt Empires, what will double the Force do with us? And they themſelves confeſs it, when they argue for an Army; for they tell us we may be ſurprized with ten or fifteen thouſand Men from <hi>France,</hi> and having no regular Force to oppoſe them, they will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the Kingdom. Now if ſo ſmall a Force can oppoſe the King, the Militia, with the united Power of the Nobility, Gentry and Commons, what will an equal Power do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the People, when ſupported by the Royal Authority, and a never-failing Intereſt that will attend it, except when it acts for the Publick Good?</p>
            <p>But we are told this Army is not deſign'd to be made a part of our Conſtitution, but to be kept only for a little time, till the Circumſtances of <hi>Europe</hi> will better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to be without them. But I would know of theſe Gentlemen, when they think that time will be? Will it be during the Life of King <hi>James,</hi> or after his Death? Shall we have leſs to fear from the Youth and Vigor of the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> than now from an unhappy Man ſinking under the load of Age and Misfortunes? Or, will <hi>France</hi> be more capable of offending us juſt after this tedious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive War, than hereafter when it has had a breathing time to repair the Calamities it has ſuffer'd by it? No: we can never disband our Army with ſo much ſafety as at this time; and this is well known by theſe Conſpirators againſt their Country, who are ſatisfied that a Continuation of them now, is an Eſtabliſhment of them for ever: for whilſt the Circumſtances of <hi>Europe</hi> ſtand in the preſent Poſture, the Argument will be equal to continue them; if the State of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould alter to the advantage of <hi>France,</hi> the Reaſon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99230:11"/>
will grow ſtronger, and we ſhall be told we muſt increaſe our Number: but if there ſhould be ſuch a turn of Affairs in the World, that we were no longer in apprehenſion of the French Power, they may be kept up without our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; nay, the very Diſcontents they may create ſhall be made an Argument for the continuing of them. But if they ſhould be kept from oppreſſing the People, in a little time they will grow habitual to us, and almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a part of our Conſtitution, and by degrees we ſhall be brought to believe them not only not dangerous, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for every body fees, but few underſtand, and thoſe few will never be able to perſwade the Multitude that there is any danger in thoſe Men they have lived quietly with for ſome Years, eſpecially when the disbanding them will (as they will be made believe) coſt them more Money out of their own Pockets to maintain a Militia: and of this we have had already an unhappy Experience. For <hi>Charles</hi> the Second being conniv'd at in keeping a few Guards (which were the firſt ever known to an Engliſh King beſides his Penſioners, and his Beef-eaters) he inſenſibly increaſed their Number, till he left a body of Men to his Succeſſor great enough to tell the Parliament, he would be no longer bound by the Laws he had ſworn to; and under the Shelter and Protection of theſe he raiſed an Army that had put a Period to our Government, if a Complication of Cauſes (which may never happen again) had not preſented the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with a Conjuncture to aſſert his own and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's Rights. And tho we have ſo lately eſcaped this Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, yet Habit has made Souldiers ſo familiar to us, that ſome who pretend to be zealous for Liberty, ſpeak of it as a Hardſhip to his preſent Majeſty, to refuſe him as many Men as his Predeceſſors; not conſidering that the raiſing them then was a Violation of our Laws, and that his Government is built upon the Deſtruction of theirs, and can no more
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99230:11"/>
ſtand upon the ſame Rubbiſh, than the Kingdom of Heaven be founded in Unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But the Conſpirators ſay, we need be in no apprehenſions of Slavery whilſt we keep the power of the Purſe in our own hands, which is very true; but they do not tell us that he has the power of raiſing Money, to whom no one dares re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it.

            </p>
            <p>For 'tis as certain that an Army will raiſe Money, as that Money will raiſe an Army; but if this courſe be too deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, 'tis but ſhutting up the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and diſobliging a few Tally-Jobbers (who have bought them for fifty <hi>per Cent.</hi> diſcount) and there will be near three Millions a Year ready cut and dry'd for them; and whoever doubts whether ſuch a Method as this is practicable, let him look back to the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: And I am afraid the Officers of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> have not much reaſon to value themſelves for their Payments in this Reign; at leaſt the Purchaſers of the Annuities are of that opinion, and would be apt to entertain ſome unſeaſonable Suſpicions, if they had not greater Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from his Majeſty's Vertue, than the Juſtice of the Miniſters. But if we could ſuppoſe (whatever is the fate of other Countries) that our Courtiers deſign nothing but the Publick Good, yet we ought not to hazard ſuch unuſual Vertue, by leading it into Temptation, which is part of our daily Duty to pray againſt. But I am afraid we don't live in an Age of Miracles, eſpecially of that ſort; our Heroes are made of a coarſer Allay, and have too much Droſs mix'd with their Conſtitutions for ſuch refin'd Principles: for in the little Experience I have had in the World, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved moſt Men to do as much Miſchief as lay in their Power, and therefore am for dealing with them as we do
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99230:12"/>
with Children and mad Men, that is, take away all Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons by which they may do either themſelves or others an Injury: As I think the Sheep in <hi>Boccaline</hi> made a prudent Addreſs to <hi>Apollo,</hi> when they deſired, that for the future Wolves might have no Teeth.</p>
            <p>When all other Arguments ſail, they call to their Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance the old Tyrant Neceſſity, and tell us the Power of <hi>France</hi> is ſo great, that let the Conſequence of an Army be what it will, we cannot be without one; and if we muſt be Slaves, we had better be ſo to a Proteſtant Prince than a Popiſh one, and the worſt of all Popiſh ones the F—King. Now I am of Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Opinion, that the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Epithet upon Tyranny is falſe Heraldry; for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant and Popiſh are both alike; and if I muſt be a Slave, it is very indifferent to me who is my Maſter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall never conſent to be ruled by an Army, which is the worſt that the moſt barbarous Conqueſt can impoſe upon me; which notwithſtanding we have little reaſon to fear whilſt we keep the Seas well guarded.</p>
            <p>It is certain there is no Country ſo ſituated for Naval Power as <hi>England.</hi> The Sea is our Element, our Seamen have as much hardy Bravery, and our Ships are as numerous, and built of as good Materials as any in the World: Such a Force well applied and managed is able to give Laws to the Univerſe; and if we keep a competent part of it well arm'd in times of Peace, it is the moſt ridiculous thing in nature to believe any Prince will have thoughts of invading us, unleſs he propoſes to be ſuperiour to us in Naval Power: For the Preparations neceſſary for ſuch an Undertaking will alarm all <hi>Europe,</hi> give both to us and our Confederates time to arm, and put our ſelves in a poſture of Defence. And whoever conſiders that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with ſix hundred Ships brought but fourteen thouſand Men, and the mighty Spaniſh Armado (then the Terror of the World)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99230:12"/>
imbark'd but eighteen thouſand, he will be aſſured that no Invaſion can be ſo ſudden upon us, but we ſhall have time to get ready our whole Fleet, bring ſome Forces from <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and prepare our own Militia if there ſhall be occaſion for it; eſpecially in times of Peace, when we ſhall have the liberty of all the Ports of <hi>France,</hi> and ſhall or may have Intelligence from every one of them.</p>
            <p>But they tell us ſuch a Wind may happen as may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to our Enemy, and keep us within our own Ports; which I ſay, as <hi>France</hi> lies to <hi>England,</hi> is almoſt impoſſible: for if we lie about <hi>Falmouth,</hi> or the Land's end, no Fleet from <hi>Breſt</hi> or the Ocean can eſcape us without a Miracle; and if the deſign be to invade us from any Port in the Channel, a very few Ships (which may ſafely lie at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor) will certainly prevent it: nor is it to be conceived that that cautious Prince will be at a vaſt Expence for the Contingency of ſuch a Critical Wind, or will ſend an Army into a Country where their Retreat is certainly cut off, when the failing in any part of his Deſign will bring a new War upon him, which lately coſt a third part of his People, a great many large Countries and ſtrong Towns, with all the Honour he had heaped up by his former Victories, to get rid of.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt confeſs, that the miſapplication of our Naval Force (which is our known Strength) for theſe laſt eight Years, is the ſtrongeſt, as it is the moſt uſual Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt me: which unriddles a Myſtery I did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand before, tho I never was ſo fooliſh as to believe all the Errors of that kind were the Effects of Chance or Ignorance, or that loſing ſo many Opportunities of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the French Fleet had not ſome extraordinary, tho occult Cauſe; and yet, notwithſtanding the reſtleſs Attempts of our Enemies, and the paltry Politicks of our own wretched St—n, this Fleet triumphantly defended us, ſo that our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99230:13"/>
Enemies in eight Years War could not get one opportunity of invading our Country.</p>
            <p>It's objected, that the Officers of our Fleet may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or that a Storm may ariſe which may deſtroy it all at once, and therefore we ought to have two Strings to our Bow. By which I perceive all their Fears lie one way, and that they do not care if they precipitate us into inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Ruin at home, to prevent a diſtant Poſſibility of it from <hi>France.</hi> But I think this Phantom too may be laid by a well-train'd Militia, and then all their Bugbears will vaniſh. This Word can be no ſooner out, but there's a Volly of ſmall Shot let fly at me: What! muſt we truſt our Safety to an undiſciplin'd Mob, who never dream'd of fighting when they undertook the Service; who are not inured to the Fatigue of a Camp, or ever ſaw the Face of an Enemy? And then they magnify Mercenary Troops, as if there was an intrinſick Virtue in a Red Coat, or that a Raggamuffin from robbing of Henrooſts in two Campagns could be cudgel'd into a Hero. Tho I muſt confeſs the Conduct of the Court in induſtriouſly enervating this Force, does in ſome meaſure juſtify their Objections: For the deteſtable Policies of the laſt Reigns were with the utmoſt Art and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to diſarm the People, and make the Militia uſeleſs, to countenance a ſtanding Army in order to bring in Popery and Slavery; and if any Methods were propoſed to make it more ſerviceable, the Court would never ſuffer them to be debated; and ſuch Officers as were more zealous in exerciſing their Companies than others were reprimanded, as if they deſign'd to raiſe a Rebellion. And now the worthy Patriots of this Reign are taking Advantage of the traitorous Neglect and infamous Policies of the laſt. But why may not a Militia be made uſeful? Why may not the Nobility, Gentry, and Free-holders of <hi>England</hi> be truſted with the Defence of their own Lives, Eſtates and Liberties, without having Guardians
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99230:13"/>
and Keepers aſſign'd them? And why may they not defend them with as much Vigour and Courage as Mercenaries who have nothing to loſe, nor any other Tie to engage their Fidelity, than the inconſiderable Pay of Six-pence a day, which they may have from the Conqueror?</p>
            <p>Why may not the Laws for ſhooting in Croſsbows be changed into Firelocks, and a competent Number of them be kept in every Pariſh for the young Men to exerciſe with on Holidays, and Rewards offered to the moſt expert, to ſtir up their Emulation?</p>
            <p>Why may not the whole Militia of <hi>England</hi> be reduced to ſixty thouſand, and a third part of thoſe kept by turns in conſtant Exerciſe?</p>
            <p>Why may not a Man be liſted in the Militia till he be diſcharged by his Maſter, as well as in the Army till he be diſcharged by his Captain? And why may not the ſame Horſe be always ſent forth, unleſs it can be made appear he is dead or maimed?</p>
            <p>Why may not the private Souldiers of the Army, when they are diſperſed in the ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, be ſent to the Militia? And why may not the inferiour Officers of the Army in ſome proportion command them?</p>
            <p>I ſay, theſe and other like things may be done, and ſome of them are done in our own Plantations, and the Iſlands of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Poland, Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Country of the <hi>Griſons;</hi> which are Nations much leſs conſiderable than <hi>England,</hi> have as formidable Neighbours, no Sea nor Fleet to defend them, nothing but a Militia to depend upon, and yet no one dares at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them: And we have ſeen as great Performances done formerly by the Apprentices of <hi>London,</hi> and in the late War by the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>Miquelets</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and the Militia in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as can be parallel'd in Hiſtory:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99230:14"/>
And ſo it would be with us, if the Court would give their hearty Aſſiſtance in promoting this Deſign; if the King would appear in Perſon at the Head of them, and give Rewards and Honour to ſuch as deſerve them, we ſhould quickly ſee the young Nobility and Gentry appear magnificent in Arms and Equipage, ſhew a generous Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in outvying one another in Military Exerciſes, and place a noble Ambition in making themſelves ſerviceable to their Country: as antiently the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Thebans</hi> from being the moſt contemptible Nations in <hi>Greece,</hi> by the Conduct of <hi>Pelopidas, Epaminondas,</hi> and <hi>Philopemen,</hi> came to have the beſt diſciplin'd Troops and moſt excellent Souldiers in the World.</p>
            <p>They object, that ſuch a Militia as this is a ſtanding Army, and will be as dangerous, and much more chargable. I anſwer;</p>
            <p>That there can be no danger from an Army where the Nobility and chief Gentry of <hi>England</hi> are the Commanders, and the Body of it made up of the Freeholders, their Sons and Servants; unleſs we can conceive that the Nobility and Gentry will join in an unnatural Deſign to make void their own Titles to their Eſtates and Liberties: and if they could entertain ſo ridiculous a Propoſition, they would never be obeyed by the Souldiers, who will have a reſpect to thoſe that ſend them forth and pay them, and to whom they muſt return again when their time is expired. For if I ſend a Man, I will as ſurely chooſe one who ſhall fight for me, as a Mercenary Officer will chooſe one that ſhall fight againſt me; and the late Governments are Witneſſes to the truth of this, who debauched the Militia more than ever I hope to ſee it again, and yet durſt never rely upon them to aſſiſt their Arbitrary Deſigns; as we may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Invaſion, their Officers durſt not bring them near his Army for fear of a Revolt.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99230:14"/>
Nay, the Penſioner-Parliament themſelves turn'd ſhort upon the Court, when they expected them to give the finiſhing ſtroke to our Ruin.</p>
            <p>To the laſt part of the Objection, That this Militia will be more chargable than an Army; I anſwer, That ſince (as I ſuppoſe) no Man propoſes wholly to lay them aſide, if we add the extraordinary Expence of maintaining twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men to the ordinary Charge of the Militia, it is much more than ſufficient to make the latter uſeful. But if this Objection were true, it ought not to enter into Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with the Preſervation of our Laws and Liberties; for it is better to give a third part of my Eſtate, if it were neceſſary, than to have all taken from me.</p>
            <p>And tho it ſhould be granted, that a Militia is not as ſerviceable as an Army kept to conſtant Diſcipline, yet I believe theſe Gentlemen themſelves will confeſs, that ſixty thouſand of them trained as before, are as good as twenty thouſand of their ſtanding Troops, which is the Queſtion; for it's impoſſible to have them both uſeful at the ſame time, they being as incompatible as broad and clipt Money, never current together; and therefore the Court muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend wholly upon a Militia, or elſe they will not depend upon them at all. And this by the way may ſilence that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that we muſt keep our Army till the Militia be diſciplin'd; for that will never be done whilſt the Court has an Army: and the ſame Objection will be made ſeven Years hence as now; ſo that a ſmall Army can be of no uſe to us, but to make our Fleet neglected, to hinder the Militia from being trained, and enſlave us at home; for they are too few to defend us againſt an Invaſion, and too many for the People to oppoſe.</p>
            <p>I dare ſpeak with the greater aſſurance upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, having the Authority of as great Men as the World hath produced for my Juſtification. <hi>Machiavel</hi> ſpends
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99230:15"/>
ſeveral Chapters to prove, that no Prince or State ought to ſuffer any of their Subjects to make War their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and that no Nation can be ſecure with any other Forces than a ſetled Militia. My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in ſeveral places bears his Teſtimony againſt a Standing Army, and particularly he tells us, that a Mercenary Army is fitteſt to invade a Country, but a Militia to defend it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt have Eſtates to get, and the latter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect. Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> hath founded his whole <hi>Oceana</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a trained Militia; and I have lately read a French Book, called a Hiſtory of the Politicks of <hi>France,</hi> which ſays, <hi>Enſin ſi on veut ruiner Les Anglois il ſuffit de les obliger a tenir des Troupes ſur pied.</hi> Nay, I believe no Author ever treated of a Free Government, that did not expreſs his Abhorrence of an Army; for (as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſays) whoever does uſe them, tho he may ſpread his Feathers for a time, he will mew them ſoon after; and raiſe them with what Deſign you pleaſe, yet, like the <hi>Weſt India</hi> Dogs in <hi>Boccaline,</hi> in a little time they will certainly turn Sheep-biters.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will be ſaid, that the Artillery of the World is changed ſince ſome of theſe wrote, and War is become more a Myſtery, and therefore more Experience is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make good Souldiers. But wherein does this Myſtery conſiſt? not in exerciſing a Company, and obeying a few words of Command; theſe are Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that the dulleſt Noddle will comprehend in a few Weeks. Nay, I have heard that the Modern Exerciſe is much ſhorter and eaſier than the Antient. But the great Improvements in War are in Regular Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fortification, Gunnery, skilful Ingineering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are Arts not to be learned without much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Experience, and are as much gained in the Cloſet as in the Field; and I ſuppoſe no Man will ſay, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99230:15"/>
the keeping ſtanding Forces is neceſſary to make a good Ingineer.</p>
            <p>As to actual Experience in War, that is not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial either to a Standing Army or a Militia, as ſuch; but the ſormer may be without it, and the latter gain it according as they have opportunities of Action. 'Tis true, at preſent the Army hath been trained up in a long War, and hath gained great Knowledg: but theſe Men will not be loſt when they are disbanded, they will be ſtill in <hi>England;</hi> and if the Parliament does give them a Gratuity ſuitable to the Service they have done their Country, they will be ready to reſume their Arms when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever occaſion offers.</p>
            <p>But I deſire to know of theſe Patriots how comes an Army neceſſary to our Preſervation now, and never ſince the Conqueſt before? Did ever the prevailing Party in the Wars of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> attempt to keep up a Standing Army to ſupport themſelves? No: they had more Senſe than to ſacrifice their own Liberty, and more Honour than to enſlave their Country, the more eaſily to carry on their own Faction. Were not the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as powerful, as good Souldiers, and as much our Enemies, as the <hi>French</hi> are now? Was not <hi>Flanders</hi> as near us as <hi>France?</hi> and the Popiſh Intereſt in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time as ſtrong as the Jacobite is now? and yet that moſt excellent Princeſs never dream'd of a Standing Army, but thought her ſureſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was to reign in the Hearts of her Subjects, which the following Story ſufficiently teſtifies. When the Duke of <hi>Alanſon</hi> came over to <hi>England,</hi> and for ſome time had admired the Riches of the City, the Conduct of her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Magnificence of her Court, he asked her amidſt ſo much Splendor where were her Guards? which Queſtion ſhe reſolved a few days after as ſhe took him in her Coach through the City, when pointing to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99230:16"/>
People (who received her in Crowds with repeated Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations) Theſe, ſaid ſhe, my Lord, are my Guards; Theſe have their Hands, their Hearts, and their Purſes always ready at my Command: and theſe were Guards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who defended her through a long and ſucceſsful Reign of forty four Years againſt all the Machinations of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> a diſputed Title, and the perpetual Conſpiracies of her own Popiſh Subjects; a Security the Roman Emperors could not boaſt of with their Pretorian Bands, and their Eaſtern and Weſtern Armies.</p>
            <p>Were not the <hi>French</hi> as powerful in <hi>Charles</hi> the Second and King <hi>James</hi> his time, as they are after this long and deſtructive War, and a leſs Alliance to oppoſe them? and yet we then thought a much leſs Army than is now contended for, a moſt inſupportable Grievance; inſomuch that in <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign the Grand-Jury pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them, and the Penſioner Parliament voted them to be a Nuſance, ſent Sir <hi>Joſ. W—ſon</hi> to the Tower for ſaying, the King might keep Guards for the Defence of his Perſon, and addreſſed to have them disbanded. And now our Apoſtates would make their Court by doing what the worſt Parliament ever <hi>England</hi> ſaw could not think of without Horror and Confuſion. They ſay the King of <hi>France</hi> was in League with our late Kings, ſo he is with us; and he would have broke it then, if he had thought it ſafe, and for his Intereſt as much as now. But they ſay we have more diſaffected Perſons to join with him; which I muſt deny, for I believe no King of <hi>England</hi> in any Age had deſervedly more Intereſt than the preſent; and if during ſuch an expenſive War, in which we have conſumed ſo much Blood and Treaſure, paid ſuch vaſt and unequal Taxes, loſt ſo many thouſand Ships, and bore a Shock by recoining our Money, which would have torn up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation from its Foundation, and reduced it to its
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99230:16"/>
antient Chaos, when moſt Countries would have ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the misfortune, and repined at their Deliverance (as Men in Sickneſs commonly quarrel with their deareſt Friends) I ſay, if at that time he had ſo great and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal an Intereſt, there can be no doubt but in times of Peace, when the People reap the Fruits of that Courage and Conduct he hath ſhewn in their Defence, he will be the moſt Beloved and Glorious Prince that ever filled the Engliſh Throne.</p>
            <p>I will make one Aſſertion more, and then conclude this Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the moſt likely way of reſtoring King <hi>James,</hi> is maintaining a Standing Army to keep him out.</p>
            <p>For the King's Safety ſtands upon a Rock whilſt it depends upon the ſolid Foundation of the Affections of the People, which is never to be ſhaken till 'tis as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as the Sun in the Firmament, that there is a formed Deſign to overthrow our Laws and Liberties; but if we keep a Standing Army, all depends upon the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and capricious Humours of the Souldiery, which in all Ages have produced more violent and ſudden Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, than ever have been known in unarmed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For there is ſuch a Chain of Dependence amongſt them, that if two or three of the chief Officers ſhould be diſobliged, or have Intrigues with Jacobite Miſtreſſes; or if the King of <hi>France</hi> could once again buy his Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners into the Court or Army, or offer a better Market to ſome that are in already, we ſhall have another Rehearſal Revolution, and the People be only idle Spectators of their own Ruin. And whoſoever conſiders the Compoſition of an Army, and doubts this, let him look back to the Roman Empire, where he will find out of twenty ſix Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, ſixteen depoſed and murdered by their own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; nay, half the Hiſtory of the World is made up
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99230:17"/>
of Examples of this kind: but we need not go any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than our own Country, where we have but twice kept Armies in time of Peace, and both times they turn'd out their own Maſters. The firſt under <hi>Cromwell,</hi> expell'd that Parliament under which they had fought ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully for many Years; afterwards under General <hi>Monk</hi> they deſtroy'd the Government they before ſet up, and brought back <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and he afterwards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded them leſt they might have turned him out again. The other Inſtance is freſh in every one's memory, how King <hi>James</hi>'s Army join'd with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> now our Rightful and Lawful King. And what could have been expected otherwiſe from Men of diſſolute and debauched Principles, who call themſelves Souldiers of Fortune? who make Murder their Profeſſion, and enquire no farther into the Juſtice of the Cauſe, than how they ſhall be paid; who muſt be falſe, rapacious and cruel in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. For having no other Profeſſion or Subſiſtence to depend upon, they are forced to ſtir up the Ambition of Princes, and engage them in perpetual Quarrels, that they may ſhare of the Spoils they make. Such Men, like ſome ſort of ravenous Fiſh, fare beſt in a Storm; and therefore we may reaſonably ſuppoſe they will be better pleaſed with the Tyrannical Government of the late King, than the mild and gracious Adminiſtration of his Preſent Majeſty, who came over to <hi>England</hi> to reſcue us from Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and he has done it, and triumphs in it in ſpight of his Enemies.</p>
            <p>In this Diſcourſe I have purpoſely omitted ſpeaking of the leſſer Inconveniences attending a Standing Army, ſuch as frequent Quarrels, Murders and Robberies; the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Game in the Country; the quartering upon publick, and ſometimes private Houſes; the influencing of Elections of Parliament by an artificial diſtribution of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99230:17"/>
Quarters; the rendring ſo many Men uſeleſs to Labour, and almoſt Propagation, together with a much greater Deſtruction of them, by taking them from a laborious way of living to a looſe idle Life; and beſides this, the Inſolence of the Officers, and the Debaucheries that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted both by them and their Souldiers in all the Towns they come in, to the ruin of multitudes of Women, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of their Families, and ill Example to others; and a numerous train of Miſchiefs beſides, almoſt endleſs to enumerate. Theſe are trivial as well as particular Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in reſpect of thoſe I have treated about, which ſtrike at the Heart's-blood of our Conſtitution, and therefore I thought theſe not conſiderable enough to bear a part in a Diſcourſe of this nature: Beſides, they often procure their own Remedy, working Miracles, and making ſome Men ſee that were born blind, and impregnable againſt all the Artillery of Reaſon; for Experience is the only Miſtreſs of Fools: A wiſe Man will know a Pike will bite when he ſees his Teeth, which another will not make diſcovery of but by the loſs of a Finger.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid here againſt Standing Armies, I would be underſtood of ſuch as are the Inſtruments of Tyranny and their Country's Ruin, and therefore I need make no Apology to our own which was raiſed by the Conſent of the Parliament in this juſt and neceſſary War, and next under God and our Great and Glorious Deliverer, have by their Bravery and Conduct preſerved our Liberties, and the Proteſtant Religion through <hi>Europe.</hi> For if in future Reigns any Deſigns ſhould be levelled againſt our Laws, we may be aſſured theſe Men would be diſcarded, and others promoted in their rooms who are fit for ſuch Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think it reaſonable that our Army ſhould be ruined by that Peace, which by their Courage and Fidelity
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99230:18"/>
they have procured for their Country; and I doubt not but the Generoſity and Gratitude of the Parliament will give them a Donative equal to their Commiſſions, which, when the Foreigners are paid and ſent home, will amount to no extraordinary Sum; at moſt'tis but ſuppoſing the War to have ſix Months longer continuance, which is an eaſy Compoſition for the Charge of keeping them. But if there are any Gentlemen amongſt them who think we can no otherwiſe expreſs our Gratitude, but by ſigning and ſealing our own Ruin, I hope we ſhall diſappoint their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not give the World occaſion to tell ſo fooliſh a Story of us, as that we turn'd to graſs one of the moſt powerful Monarchs in the World for breaking our Laws, that we have maintain'd an eight Years War at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of forty Millions of Money, and the Blood of three hundred thouſand Men, to juſtify the glorious Action we have done; that by it we preſerv'd all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides, and loſt our own Liberties; at leaſt I hope it ſhall not be ſaid we conſented to it.</p>
