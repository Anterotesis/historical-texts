            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT is commonly ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Gameſters, that the Standers by oft-times ſee more than the perſons themſelves that play.</p>
                  <p>The like may be ſaid, as to the Writing of Books: That the Critical
<pb facs="tcp:59749:4"/>
Reader ſoon diſcovers the Errors and Defects of the Writer.</p>
                  <p>Withall, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Obſervation, even of the Vulgar and Inferior ſort of the People of <hi>France</hi>; that when any Stranger chanceth to trip or falter, either in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, or <hi>Idiom</hi> of their Language, they, inſtead of laughing at their failings, are ſtill ready to help them out,
<pb facs="tcp:59749:4"/>
and inform them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>In our preſent Affair therefore, there is no more to do, than to wiſh the good fortune of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the moſt courteous and beſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Readers; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for it: for, in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Productions, Manufactures, Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and other things herein contained, there
<pb facs="tcp:59749:5"/>
is (if not more) at leaſt, as much need of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as of Books; of conſulting the Living, as the Dead.</p>
                  <p>Whatever then, through haſte, Inadvertency, or want of convenient Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; either of Miſtake, or Omiſſion of what is moſt Curious or Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (I ſay, moſt Curious or Remarkable; ſince a too particular, and Minute Account would ſwell each

                  <p>THE Iſland of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the largeſt of the <hi>European</hi> Iſlands, and to very few Iſlands of the World inferiour in bigneſs, to none in Fertility, Power, Good Government and the Glory of its great Actions, lies between 52 and 58 degrees of <hi>Northern</hi> Latitude. <hi>England</hi> the nobleſt and largeſt part thereof, and a diſtinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of it ſelf, though at preſent united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59749:7"/>
one Monarch, hath undergone four ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral grand Revolutions. Not to mention the <hi>Samotheans, Albioniſts,</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> his <hi>Trojan</hi> Dynaſtie, whoſe credit depends ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon fabulous Tradition than real Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, the ancient Inhabitants of this Iſland are ſcarce taken notice of by any Author of account but by the name of <hi>Britains</hi>; and the firſt certainly known Attaque that ever was made upon them, was by the <hi>Romans,</hi> under <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>; and after that ſeveral others by the Lieutenants of ſeveral ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Emperors, not without a World of Bloodſhed: The Natives no leſs ſtoutly reſiſting, than the <hi>Romans</hi> furious aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, till at length they gain'd a no leſs quiet than perhaps advantageous Poſſeſſion among us; I mean, advantageous to this Iſland; ſo that the Loſers may be ſaid to have been the greateſt Gainers, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the greateſt Triumphers: For if we conſider, from the ſeveral Deſcriptions that have been written thereof, what bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and abſurd Cuſtoms the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> had among them; we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Civility and Arts were ſo much the earlier introduced by the coming in of the <hi>Romans</hi>; who alſo by their long Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation here, and Familiar Converſe with the Old Inhabitants, were of Foreigners
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59749:7"/>
become as it were Natives, of Enemies Protectors, inſomuch that when they were call'd away for the Defence of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces Abroad, their Departure was no leſs regretted, than their Arrival was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.</p>
                  <p>The next Attempters upon this part of the Iſland were the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who being at firſt Invited in for their Aſſiſtance againſt the Invading <hi>Picts</hi> and other Borderers, became at length themſelves the greateſt Invaders; and playing upon the Eaſie and Luxurious Temper of the Prince that firſt Incourag'd their coming over, they got a Footing, which by continued freſh Supplies ſent over from time to time, they made ſo ſure, that all the Force the <hi>Britains</hi> were able to make againſt them for ſeveral Ages, was not able to unfix it. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this great Oppoſition, in which ſeveral of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings Signaliz'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even to the Fame of Heroes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Great King <hi>Arthur,</hi> whoſe Glory nothing hath ſo much Eclips'd, as that his Actions (great enough in their Truth) are blown up into Storys, ſo Romantick and and Surpaſſing all Credit, maugre I ſay all the Force could be Muſtered againſt them: They ſtill Increaſed in Number and Strength, till in the end the <hi>Britains</hi> quite
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59749:8"/>
tir'd out, were glad to retire into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous and remote parts of the Land, (by which they kept themſelves for many Ages a people intirely diſtinct, and their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to this very day unmixt; the Root of ours being evidently the <hi>Saxon,</hi> ſo that the other muſt needs be the Ancient <hi>Britiſh</hi>) and leave all the reſt to be ſhar'd among the new Poſſeſſors, who, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many Proprietors in the Conqueſt, dealt out the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarchy into ſeven Parcels; which ſevenfold Partition it may well be wondred how it could keep up ſo long, conſidering the Confuſions, and as it were Civil Wars, that aroſe (as how could they but ariſe) among ſo many Petty Monarchs upon one Continent (that is, as to the bounds of each Kingdom) till at length one ſwallowing up the other, the ſtronger the weaker, this Seven-headed <hi>Hydra</hi> of Government came to a Period, and one bright face of Monarchy ſhot up again, and ſpread its Luſtre over all this better part of <hi>Britain,</hi> which hath ever ſince been called the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and hath ſo continued, with little or no Interruption, from the Raign of the Great <hi>Egbert.</hi> He it was who firſt reduc'd this Heptarchy into a Perfect Monarchy, though it was tending toward it ſometime
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59749:8"/>
before, even to this day; and from him the <hi>Aera</hi> of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchies by Hiſtorians and Chronologers are reputed to commence: So that from the ſaid <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> his preſent Majeſty that now Happily Reigns, is reckon'd the fourty ſixth ſole Monarch of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>But ſcarce was this Government well ſetled, when the expected Tranquility thereof was diſturbed by a new Generation of Invaders, more Barbarous and Miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than ever any either before or ſince; Committers of far greater Outrages and Cruelties: Yet ſo often either driven out, or totally extirpated; ſo often bravely Conquered in the Field by the high Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Conduct of ſeveral of our <hi>Engliſh Saxon</hi> Monarchs (whoſe Fame ſtands great in Hiſtory to this day for their Vertue and Gallantry, both in Peace and War) that it may well be wondred, how any one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could ſpare ſuch Multitudes of People, as continually pour'd in upon us for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages together; and how ſuch nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Forces could make ſuch frequent Landings with ſo little Oppoſition: But then it muſt be conſidered, that we had no <hi>Summer</hi> Guards Abroad, no Squadrons of Firſt, Second and Third Rate Frigats to Cruiſe about and Guard the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts;

what kind of Ships there were in thoſe either for War or Trade, cannot be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from any Account or Deſcription we find recorded or publiſh'd; but thus much may well be concluded, that the beſt Man of War of thoſe times was far Inferior to the meaneſt Merchant-Man now adays. For the ſpace of about 174 years, <hi>viz.</hi> from 833, to 1017. was this poor King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom harraſs'd by the continual Invaſions of theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Pirates; yet could they not in all this ſpace catch hold of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> till the ſaid year 1017. and then they held it no longer than du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of three Kings; after which it reverted again to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Line.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth and laſt Invaſion was that of the <hi>Normans,</hi> if he can properly be call'd an Invader, who ſeems to have come in with the Conſent, at leaſt if not Invitation of ſeveral of the Nobility and Prelacy; for elſe doubtleſs his claim could not have been ſo eaſily decided by the dint of one Battle, and he ſo readily have had the Crown put on his Head by <hi>Aldred</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> who with ſeveral other Biſhops and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, met him upon the way, and pay'd him their Allegiance; and from this <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Conqueror the Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> hath been kept up in a continued, though

Among the Prae-eminences which this Kingdom hath above all the other Kingdoms of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> the chiefeſt and which moſt redounds to its Glory, is, that it was firſt Enlightned with the Knowledge of True Religion; ſo that whatſoever place it may claim in <hi>Europe,</hi> it deſerves at leaſt to be eſteemed the firſt Kingdom of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi>: And admit that <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> were not the firſt that Preached the Goſpel here, though there are not wanting Teſtimonies, to make it out, not altogether contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: However, it is moſt certain, that the Chriſtian Religion here, is of a much elder date, than the coming over of <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk; that is, even in the very Apoſtles time, by the Teſtimony of <hi>Gildas</hi>; and as it appears by the mention of a Noble <hi>Britiſh</hi> Lady, <hi>Claudia Rufina,</hi> in one of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles; and it was not much above 100 years after e're it was own'd by publick Authority: For the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King mention'd in Hiſtory, is our <hi>Britiſh</hi> King <hi>Lucius,</hi> who was Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with the Emperor <hi>Commodus,</hi> alſo the firſt Chriſtian Emperor, at leaſt the firſt that publickly Profeſs'd, Protected and Maintain'd the Chriſtian Faith, (for before him <hi>Philippus Arabs</hi> is ſaid to have been a

                     <p>The places of <hi>England</hi> moſt eminenly Famous for ſeveral ſorts of Fiſh, are <hi>New-caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine</hi> for Salmon; as alſo <hi>Bywell</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the River <hi>Wye</hi> in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refordſhire,</hi> alſo the River <hi>Lune</hi> near <hi>Cocker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fand-Abbey</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi> The Coaſt of <hi>Cornwall</hi> for Herrings; there being there ſo great a Trade of Herring-Fiſhing, that there is ſcarce the like again in any place of <hi>Europe</hi>; at <hi>Limmouth</hi> alſo in <hi>Dorcetſhire</hi> there is taken great quantity of Herrings; at <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Herrings are very large and good, and are therefore called <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Capons. <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and ſome
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59749:17"/>
other places thereabout upon the <hi>Severn,</hi> for a Fiſh call'd a Mort, which in Taſte hath very much of the Salmon in it; <hi>Suſſex</hi> in general for Carps: For Lobſters <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Selſey</hi> (ſo called, <hi>qu.</hi> Iſle of Seals or Sea-Calves) in the ſame County; the firſt for ſmall ones, but very Sweet and well Taſted; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond for thoſe eſteemed, not only becauſe of their Goodneſs, but alſo their Fulneſs and Largeneſs; for Cockles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey.</hi> For Oyſters <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſeveral places of <hi>Kent,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Whitſtaple</hi> and <hi>Reculver,</hi> which for Oyſters of ſavoury ſaltneſs, exceed all other parts of that County, eſpecially <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culver.</hi> There is a ſort of ſmall Fiſh called a Pilchard, commonly about the bigneſs of a Herring (though I have heard ſay, that in ſome parts of <hi>Cornwall</hi> there have been taken Pilchards an Ell long) and not much differing in ſhape in ſeveral places on the Sea-coaſts of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> At a place called <hi>Foreditch</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> there are Trouts of a treble remark: Firſt, That they equal Salmon in Largeneſs. Secondly, That they remain nine Months in the Sea, and three in Freſh-water. Thirdly, That contrary to the nature of all other Trouts, they have been known but once to have been
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59749:18"/>
taken in that place with an Angle, ſo much more cunning they are than all the reſt of their kind. In the River <hi>Kennet</hi> near <hi>Hungerford</hi> in <hi>Barkſhire,</hi> there is great plenty of Trouts, remarkably large and good; alſo the Town of <hi>Hungerford</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Marlborough,</hi> and ſome other Places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, are noted for plenty and goodneſs of Cray-Fiſh. The River <hi>Stowr</hi> in <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetſhire</hi> hath a particular commendation for Tenches, as ſome parts of <hi>Cambridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> for the beſt Eels, and <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> for plenty of Pikes: But there is alſo another Stowr in <hi>Kent,</hi> which runs through <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and is ſaid to breed the beſt Trouts in the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> of <hi>England</hi>: Yet thoſe of <hi>Caſhalton</hi> in <hi>Surry</hi> are accounted excellent Trouts. In <hi>Miander-Meer</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> there breeds a ſort of Fiſh called a Chare, which they ſay is no where elſe to be found. Much more might be ſaid, (but that it is not our buſineſs to dwell upon any particular, but to take a general Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of ſeveral things) of the Animals which our Country excels in above others; but to ſpeak of the Minerals and Vegetables which this Iſland produceth, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire each a large Volume; and though we have no Mines of Gold, yet the many Mines we have of other Mettalls, as Iron,

Lead, Tin, Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and it is ſaid ſome diſcoveries have been alſo made of Silver, beſides Mines of Allum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Coal and other Minerals, would, if utmoſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement were made of our Trade and Manufacture, make a conſiderable compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The <hi>Stanneries</hi> or Tin-Mines of <hi>Cornwall</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire</hi> have been famous from all Antiquity: And whereas it hath been formerly taken for granted, that the <hi>Britains</hi> were unknown to the reſt of the World before the Arrival of the <hi>Romans</hi>; there are not wanting who are of Opinion, and have confirmed their Opinion with probable Evidences, that the Ancient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Iſland, long before the <hi>Romans</hi> Arrival, had Commerce with the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Phaenicians</hi>; and that becauſe they would not admit of Strangers into their Country, therefore they made the Iſles of <hi>Scilly</hi> the Mart for the vending of their Tin; whereupon ſome ſuppoſe them to be thoſe Iſlands which the Ancients cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Caſſiterides,</hi> which imports as much as Tin-Iſles; not as having any Tin-Mines in them, but as being the Mart, as we ſaid before, for the Vending of that Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. And of all parts in <hi>Cornwall, Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin-Hill</hi> is particularly taken notice of for its Rich and Plentiful Veins of Tin. Nor
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59749:19"/>
do the Mines of <hi>Cornwall</hi> abound in Tin only, but 'tis ſaid there have been quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Metallick Oar that have contain'd a mixture of Gold and Silver; and very memorable is the tradition of a quantity of Silver Oar, dig'd out of a place in the Pariſh of <hi>Comb-Martin</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> out of which <hi>William Wimondham</hi> coin'd 270 weight of Silver for <hi>Elionor</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Bar.</hi> A place called <hi>Newlands</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> is rich in Copper Mines, and hath ſome ſtore of Black-Lead; eſpecially about <hi>Keſwick.</hi> In this County alſo, the Stone called <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> is ſaid to have been here firſt found: But much of this <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> is digg'd out of <hi>Mendip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire.</hi> At <hi>Wenlock</hi> in <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, there was found a Rich Copper Mine. The Rich Mines of Iron in the Forreſt of <hi>Dean</hi> in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> have been an occaſion of making thoſe Woods very thin, in reſpect of what they have been formerly. <hi>Kent</hi> hath ſeveral Iron Mines, and alſo Veins of Marl. <hi>Darbyſhire</hi> abounds much in Minerals, and ſeveral kinds of Stones; particularly in the <hi>Peak</hi> of <hi>Darby,</hi> there are Mines that afford plenty of Lead, likewiſe <hi>Stibium</hi> or Antimony, alſo ſtore of Mill-ſtones and Whet-ſtones; nor leſs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59749:19"/>
noted are the Lead-Mines on <hi>Mendip-hills</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi>: As alſo thoſe on the Hills of <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> where there are likewiſe Copper-Mines; near <hi>Moinglath</hi> in <hi>Denby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> is a plentiful Vein of Lead: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the <hi>Abby of Fountains</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> not far from whence in the ſame Shire is ſtore of Iron: Other Mines alſo there are, which though not ſo Rich, are no leſs uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than thoſe of Mettal; as Alom, Coal, Free-ſtone, Fullers-earth, Marl, with all which, take one with another, there is ſurely no Nation better ſtor'd; and indeed our Salt-pits are no other than a kind of Liquid-Mines. It is no leſs wonderful to obſerve what abundant Supplies of Fewel are yearly ſent up from the Coal-Mines of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to this Vaſt City of <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of the Nation, beſides what is Exported into Foraign parts; then it may ſeem hard to conjecture how this City could ſubſiſt before the diſcovery of this great Mine, which was not till the year 1305. Since we find by experience, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occaſion of the obſtructing of this <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Fleet, and the raiſing of the Price of Coals, into what great diſtreſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency the City is thereupon reduc'd; but then it muſt be conſidered that the City then was nothing near ſo large as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59749:20"/>
now, and the Country far better ſtor'd with Wood; the want whereof for Firing, is not the only prejudice the Nation hath ſuſtain'd by the vaſt quantity of Timber that hath been fell'd of late Ages; the number of Alehouſes is alſo increas'd ten to one, at leaſt within theſe 100 years, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, as may well be imagin'd, the number of Brewhouſes to ſupply them with Drink; which Houſes cannot be maintain'd and carry on their Trade, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wonderful quantity of Fewel: Nor need it be wondred how other great Cities are able to ſubſiſt without the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience (as doubtleſs there is ſcarce any City of the World that hath the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for Fewel) conſidering the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Climate, of Cuſtoms, of manner of Living, and of Diet. There are who ſpeak of <hi>Blackheath,</hi> as a place no leſs ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abounding with Pit-Coal to ſerve the City of <hi>London</hi> and parts adjacent, than <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> it ſelf, but are willing to believe that the grand ſecurity of theſe Coal-pits, lies in the great prejudice to Navigation, which the breaking of them up would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, in regard this Colliers Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>London</hi> is the greateſt Nurſery of Seamen we have; which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection would eaſily ceaſe, could the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59749:20"/>
Trade be once promoted, till when the Coal Mines of <hi>Blackheath</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be laid aſide. There is alſo Sea-Coal, like that of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> at <hi>Wedsborough</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Riding</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi>: Likewiſe up and down in many of the Inland parts of <hi>England,</hi> there is abundance of Pit-Coal of another nature, that is too ſay, not Caking or Clinging together (a quantity of ſmall Particles) into one great lump or maſs, like that of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>; but as it is laid on in great pieces, burning ſheer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into Aſhes, each piece like Wood. Up and down in ſeveral parts of <hi>Darbyſhire</hi> and <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> there is a ſort of Pit-Coal, which is commonly called Cannel-Coal, perhaps as it were Candle-Coal, becauſe it burns clear like a Candle; this Coal is of a bright ſhining gloſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of ſo tough and ſolid a ſubſtance, that they frequently make thereof Standiſhes, Salt-Sellers, Candleſticks and other ſuch like Utenſils, which appear as it were of a courſer ſort of Jett. In <hi>Staffordſhire, Penſneth-Chace</hi> is particularly made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of for plenty of Pit-Coal. In <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Coal-Overton</hi> in the Hundred of <hi>Weſt-Goſcot,</hi> and other parts of the <hi>North</hi> of this County, where there is ſtore of Pit-Coal of a Bituminous nature, very hard and

faſt: In <hi>Warwickſhire, Bedworth</hi>: In <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, Mendip-hill,</hi> and ſeveral places on the ſhore of the River <hi>Frome</hi>: In <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondſhire,</hi> the tops of certain Hills. In the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey</hi> there is ſaid to be great ſtore of an Aluminous Matter, out of which it is thought might be made very good Alum and Copperaſs, but nothing of this nature hath been brought to that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Alum-works in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> through the great Induſtry of Sir <hi>John Bourchier,</hi> who in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> made away with a conſiderable Eſtate for the carrying on of this great work, in lieu whereof he obtain'd the grant of a Patent from the King, whereby he was Inveſted with the whole benefit of the ſaid Alum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, which was valued at a Thouſand Pound a year; but however matters were carried, his Grandchild Mr. <hi>Richard Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier,</hi> is now reduc'd to utmoſt neceſſity, receiving no relief by vertue of the Patent for the loſs of the Paternal Eſtate: But <hi>Gesborough</hi> in this Shire is moſt particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted for an Alum-Mine, which ſome ſay was firſt found out by Sir <hi>Thomas Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loner</hi> Tutor to Prince <hi>Henry.</hi> As for the Stone-Quarries of <hi>England,</hi> they muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be confeſs'd inferior to thoſe of <hi>Italy, Greece,</hi> and other parts, for all Curious

kinds of Marble, Alabaſter and Porphyrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (of Marble the Parian was Anciently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the beſt:) However we have many Structures both publick and private to ſhew, which being built of our own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Free-ſtone, want not their State and Elegance. The principal Magazine of this Commodity, is the Iſle of <hi>Portland</hi> in <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetſhire,</hi> which hath ſupplied many of the grand Buildings of <hi>England.</hi> Likewiſe the Iſle of <hi>Purbeck</hi> in the ſame Shire, hath Veins of Marble, which though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, but ſcatteringly here and there, as <hi>Cambden</hi> obſerves, yet run a great way under ground. At <hi>Edgcomb</hi> Houſe near <hi>Plimouth</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> there is digg'd good quantity of a Stone, which is of great uſe and Ornament in Building; alſo on the Moors of the ſaid County, there is found a ſort of Stone, which is thence called the Moor-ſtone, of which there are frequently made Chimney-Pieces and Ornaments of Windows and Doors; beſides another ſort of the colour of Marble. In <hi>Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> there is digg'd a ſoft Stone, at leaſt much ſofter than Alabaſter, with which being burnt and made into a Plaſter, they generally floor their Upper-Rooms, this Plaſter being well laid, as ſoon as it comes to be dry, proves harder than any Plaſter

of <hi>Paris,</hi> and is wonderful durable. In <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> hard by <hi>Snodhill-Caſtle,</hi> is a Quarry, from whence they ſay there is digg'd forth very good Marble. At a place called <hi>Peter</hi>'s-<hi>poſt</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> is a famous Quarry of Stone; alſo near <hi>Shirburn</hi> in the ſame Shire: Nor is that near <hi>Mancheſter</hi> in <hi>Laneaſhire</hi> inconſiderable; beſides a Quarry of a fine Reddiſh-ſtone on the Banks of the River <hi>Irwell</hi> in the ſame Shire: Moreover, what we want in Alabaſter, <hi>Porphyrie</hi> Marble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is more than compenſated to us by Stones of a greater value, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> there are found in great quantities Stones of a natural Smoothneſs, formed into Angles, and conſiderably large, ſome of the bigneſs of a Walnut, or thereabout, and of ſuch a luſtre, that many ſcruple not to call them Diamonds, and probably they might paſs for ſuch, did not the cunning Lapidary know how to diſtinguiſh the true Orient Diamond from others by its <hi>Adamantine</hi> hardneſs and ſolidity: Likewiſe St. <hi>Vincents</hi> Rock at <hi>Briſtol</hi> affords plenty of theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diamonds, commonly called <hi>Briſtol</hi> Stones: At <hi>Shugbury</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> is a ſort of precious Stone, at leaſt by ſome ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, called <hi>Aſtroites,</hi> from a mark it hath upon it reſembling a Star. And on the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59749:22"/>
Rocks of <hi>Guarnſey,</hi> there is a hard Stone called an Emeril. Nor are we wholly deſtitute of Marble and Alabaſter, though doubtleſs ſhort for Beauty and Fineneſs to thoſe of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi>; in ſome parts of <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> there is digg'd a ſort of Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſter, thought to be the beſt in <hi>England.</hi> Fullers-Earth, Potters-Earth, Marl, Lime, Slate, Tobacco-Pipe-Clay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are large Veins in ſeveral parts, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Woburn</hi> in <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> abounds in Fullers-Earth; as alſo <hi>Rigate</hi> in <hi>Surry</hi>: In ſome parts of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> the ſtore of Marl that is found there, gives Appellation to one of the chief Towns of that Shire, <hi>viz. Marlborough,</hi> and in divers parts of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi> is found a Marl, which very much enriches the Land. Near <hi>Nonſuch</hi> in <hi>Surry</hi> is a large Vein of Potters-Earth. Near <hi>Walſal</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> are ſtore of Lime-Pits: And not many Miles from <hi>Pomfret</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> it being averr'd by ſome that no leſs than 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a year uſually made of the Lime thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>In ſome parts of <hi>Cornwall</hi> there is Slate of three ſorts and colours, <hi>viz.</hi> The Blew, the Grey, and the Sage-colour; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at a place called <hi>Walling-ſlate</hi> in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> is digg'd up great ſtore of Slate: As alſo at <hi>Collyweſton</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> at

And to the Mill-ſtones of the <hi>Peak</hi> before mentioned, we may add thoſe digg'd up at <hi>Mowcup</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> There is a ſort of Earth called Talcum, us'd by Painters and Colourers, of which ſtore is dig'd up in ſeveral parts of <hi>Suſſex</hi>: And the beſt of Saltpeter, is ſaid to be found in <hi>Northamptonſhire.</hi> Out of the Salt-pits of <hi>England</hi> is extracted ſo white and fine a ſort of Salt, that the moſt refined Sugar looks not more white and fine; it is alſo commonly made up into Maſſes, in the form of Sugar-Loaves: Moſt of theſe <hi>Wiches,</hi> the moſt noted, are in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> all denominated accordingly, <hi>viz. Nantwich, Middlewich</hi> and <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich; Nantwich,</hi> beſides the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Salt-pit, which is generally called the <hi>Whitewich,</hi> is next to the City of <hi>Cheſter</hi> it ſelf, the moſt Eminent Town of all <hi>Cheſhire: Middlewich</hi> hath two Pits, between which there runs a ſmall Brook and parts them: The Pit in <hi>Northwich</hi> is called the <hi>Black-wich</hi>; I ſuppoſe becauſe the Salt drawn hence is Blacker and Courſer than any of the reſt. In <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> there is alſo a place of principal note for theſe Wiches or Salt-pits, <hi>viz. Droit-Wich,</hi> or <hi>Dirt-Wich,</hi> where there are three Wells,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59749:23"/>
whoſe water from <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> till <hi>Midſummer</hi> is of ſo Brackiſh a nature, that all that time they boil great quantities of Salt out of it in Furnaces, which for that end are erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the Wells; whereas all the reſt of the year the water is ſo freſh, that no Salt can be extracted out of it.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe Plants and Shrubs which are moſt peculiarly of the growth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it would be too particular a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for this ſo general a Work, to aſſign each its ſeveral place, as there are very many places where this or that Herb, Tree or Shrub, hath as it were its peculiar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and education: All the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Buckingham</hi> is denominated from the great number of Beech-Trees there grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Iſle of <hi>Scalny</hi> in <hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> is almoſt all over grown with Wild-Time; But there are ſome Plants, which being of themſelves not ordinary or common, or of a more than common Vertue or Efficacy, do ſo much the more ſignalize the places where they grow, eſpecially being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted places of their production. The Saffron about <hi>Walden</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> is ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently reputed above the Saffron of any other parts, that that Town is never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned but by the name of <hi>Saffron-Walden.

At <hi>Barklow</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> there grows in great abundance an Herb, bearing Red-Berries, called <hi>Danewort,</hi> from a Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it ſprang firſt from the Blood of the <hi>Danes:</hi> On the Cliffs between <hi>Deal</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> great plenty of Samphire grows; <hi>Weſtward</hi> from <hi>Dengeneſs</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> Peaſe ſpring up naturally in Cluſters like Grapes, and differ not much in Taſte from common-field Peaſe. Between <hi>Sandwich</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> a kind of Hops is obſerved to grow naturally among the Beach and Pebbles; Garlick is no where better nor more plentiful, than at <hi>Stratton</hi> in <hi>Cornwall</hi>: Several parts of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and <hi>Porbery</hi> moſt peculiarly in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi>

                     <p>THe Wonders of <hi>England</hi> conſiſt chiefly in Stones, Caves, Lakes, Fountains, Ditches, and ſeveral prodigious Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli or Hillocks caſt up by Art and Labour; there was never doubtleſs heard of in any part of the World, ſo miraculous a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Stones, for ſo it is generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be, as that on <hi>Salisbury-Plain,</hi> within ſix or ſeven Miles of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Stone-henge</hi>; it appears to have been a treble row of Stones, circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly plac'd one within another, and rear'd ſtreight up on end, notwithſtanding they are of a prodigious bigneſs, that is to ſay, 28 Foot long for the moſt part, and 7 Foot broad, beſides others of a vaſt bulk
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59749:25"/>
(though not ſo big as the upright ones) which lye overthwart from one to another, and are faſtened with Tenent and Mortis; but the form of this wonderful Structure is very much defac'd, ſome of the greater Stones being either fallen, or reclining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ground, and many of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart Stones being fallen; how ſuch huge Stones could be brought thither, by whom, and upon what occaſion, is diſputed by Writers; the moſt that hath been ſaid on this Subject is written by Mr. <hi>Inigo Jones</hi> Surveyor General to King <hi>James,</hi> and his late Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, and Dr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> both various, and oft times contrary in their Opinions, and poſſibly neither of them altogether in the right: About half a dozen Mile further on the <hi>Plain</hi> towards <hi>Hungerford,</hi> I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (nor do I remember it to have been taken notice of by any one elſe) a Stone of a great bulk, but not above a Foot and a half in heighth from the ground, which though of the ſame hardneſs and ſolidity with thoſe above mentioned, hath the top of it driven all over full of Nails of the largeſt ſize. There is alſo a part of the <hi>Plain</hi> between <hi>Marleborough</hi> and <hi>Caun,</hi> which being ſtrew'd all over with Stones of a Grey colour, is therefore called the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59749:26"/>
                        <hi>Grey Weathers</hi>; the leaſt of theſe Stones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a conſiderable bigneſs, and ſome very large; thoſe of the ordinary ſize ſeeming to be of about half a dozen or half a ſcore Pound weight, one with another; and here and there in ſome odd nooks, a little out of the Road, a large Stone reared up on end, like thoſe at <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> and ſometimes not much inferior in bulk. In <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> there is a Market-Town called <hi>Stone,</hi> from a large heap of Stones caſt up there, as a Monumental mark of Infamy upon <hi>Wulpher</hi> the <hi>Mercian,</hi> who in this very place ſacrific'd to his Heatheniſh fury his two Sons, <hi>Wulfald</hi> and <hi>Rufinus,</hi> for no other cauſe than their imbracing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith. Near <hi>Burrowbridge,</hi> a little Town in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> there are four Stones of a very vaſt bulk, and Pyramidally ſhap'd, ſuppos'd to be erected by the <hi>Romans,</hi> in memory of ſome great Victory thereabouts obtain'd. Upon the Hills near <hi>North-Tine</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> though Boggy and full of water, there are great heaps of Stones, which ſome take for a Memorial of ſome great Battle there fought. Near <hi>Eniſham</hi> in the <hi>South</hi> part of <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> there are Stones called <hi>Roll-rich-ſtones,</hi> erected in manner of thoſe at <hi>Stone-henge</hi>; which certain fabulous Traditions have rendred
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59749:26"/>
to have been men ſo transform'd; but more certain Hiſtory delivers them the Monument of a great Battle there fought by <hi>Rollo</hi> the <hi>Dane.</hi> At <hi>Bosken</hi> in <hi>Cornwall</hi> there is another of 18 large Stones erected, and plac'd in a circular figure 12 Foot diſtant each from the other; a Trophy of ſome <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Saxon</hi> Victory. In the ſame County are other Monumental Stones called the <hi>Hurlers,</hi> which fabulous Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will have to be the Stony Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis of certain Humane Creatures, but common reaſon gives the ſame conjecture of them as of the foremention'd. The like may be ſaid of two other large Stones erected in St. <hi>Clares</hi> Pariſh, in one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is an Inſcription in ſtrange and intelligible Characters; other Remarks there are in the ſame County form'd by Nature only, as that Pile of Rocks one upon the other, called <hi>Wring-Cheeſe,</hi> near the loweſt of them, having the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a Cheeſe hard preſs'd, by the accumulation of Rocks upon it; the other is a very wonderful Rock call'd <hi>Main-Amber,</hi> near <hi>Penſans</hi>; this Rock lies upon leſſer Rocks, in ſuch an exact <hi>equilibrium,</hi> that what the puſh of a Finger, can ſtir and cauſe as it were to totter, not the greateſt force imaginable is able to diſplace.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59749:27"/>
Likewiſe by <hi>Helford,</hi> is a vaſt Rock lying on the ground, the top whereof being hollow, containeth water which ebbeth and floweth like the Sea. Three Miles from <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> on the edge of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> there lye ſcattered up and down in a dry Sandy-ground, divers Craggy-ſtones of a conſiderable magnitude; the two biggeſt whereof ſtanding cloſe together, ſeem by the creaſe which divides them in a ſtraight line, as if they were but juſt ſaw'd aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In the ſame County, near <hi>Tenderden-Steeple,</hi> is a Stone, which by the falling of the Rain, palpably gathers increaſe of bulk. At <hi>Exmore</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> are great Stones erected, ſome in a Circular, ſome in a Triangular form, in memory doubtleſs of ſome <hi>Roman, Saxon</hi> or <hi>Daniſh</hi> Victory. In <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> near the River <hi>Loder,</hi> there are Pyramidal Stones pitched for a Mile together, ſome 9, ſome 14 Foot thick. At <hi>Salcelds</hi> upon the River <hi>Eden</hi> in <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> is a Monumental Trophy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 77 Stones, called by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants <hi>Long-Meg and her Daughters</hi>; one of which Stones alone, called the <hi>Long-Meg,</hi> being 15 Foot high from the ground, all the reſt but 10. On the Hill called <hi>Mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-Morgan</hi> in <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> there is a Monument ſuperſcrib'd with a very fatal
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59749:27"/>
Character; for it hath been received from thoſe that live thereabout, that whoever reads it ſhall die ſoon after, if there be not a fallacy herein, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Character is ſo ſtrange and uncouth that no man is able to read it.</p>
                     <p>Some places are noted for Stones of another kind, that is to ſay, whoſe Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity conſiſts in the unuſualneſs of their Figure. At <hi>Alderly</hi> in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> upon the top of certain Hills are found Oyſters, Cockles and Periwinkles of ſolid Stone; and at <hi>Puckle-Church</hi> in the ſame Shire, there is a Vein of Blew-ſtone, conſiſting of ſeveral Stones, Smooth, Square, and about half a Foot thick, as it were Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and ready cut out fit for work; they lye about ſeven or eight one upon another, as it were in beds very near, contiguous to each other for about the length of a Pearch. And at <hi>Laſſington</hi> in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> there is plenty of that which we call the Star-ſtone, being of the figure of a Mullet, or what we commonly picture for a Star, of a Grey colour, and of the circumference of a ſingle Penny, but the thickneſs of half a Crown; they ſtick together in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of about three or four Inches long, and being ſingly put into Vinegar, they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally move and tend towards a Unition.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59749:28"/>
Near <hi>Sayworth</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> are Stones that have a very near reſemblance of Cockles. In a Town call'd <hi>Cainſham,</hi> in the Road-way between <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thereabout, there are Stones frequently to be ſeen wreathing in a Spiral form like Snails; this Town is commonly Nick-nam'd <hi>Smoaky-Cainſham</hi> upon this occaſion: Some years ſince one of the Townſmen ſtanding at his door with Tears in his Eyes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ask'd by one of his Neighbours that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd him as he paſs'd by, what the cauſe of his Grief was, anſwered, <hi>That there was ſo great a Smoak in his houſe that he was not able to endure to ſtay within doors</hi>; When in truth he had been newly beaten by his Wife: Whereupon Travellers now and then to make themſelves Sport, will ask, <hi>Whether that Town be called</hi> Smoaky-Cainſham: But the wiſer ſort of thoſe that ask this queſtion, prepare at the ſame inſtant to put on to a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſpeed, for fear of ſome Hoſtility from the good Women of the place. At <hi>Whitbay</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> are Stones of a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine</hi> Figure: Alſo in the Stone-Quarry at <hi>Kingham</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire.</hi> On <hi>Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary-Topping</hi> a Hill in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> are Stones found in the ſhape of Sea-winkles and Cockles: At <hi>Huntly-Nab</hi> in the ſame
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59749:28"/>
County, at the roots of the Rocks, are Stones as perfectly round as any Ball, in which broken, are the ſhapes of Stony-Serpents, all but the head. Of the Caves of <hi>England,</hi> thoſe of principal remark are, Firſt, <hi>Ochy-hole</hi> near <hi>Wells</hi> in <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>; it is a Cave of large extent into the earth, and in which, thoſe that have made the fartheſt Incurſions, are ſaid to have diſcerned many Rivulets and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, or hollow Receſſes. Secondly, A Cave very much talk'd of, under an Old Caſtle in the <hi>Peak</hi> of <hi>Darby,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Devils Arſe in Peak</hi>; there is a ſtrange ſtory told by one <hi>Gervaſius,</hi> of a Swinherd belonging to one <hi>William de Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerel,</hi> ſometime Lord of the Place. This Swinherd having loſt a Sow great with Pig, is ſaid to have entred in earneſt queſt thereof into the mouth of this Cave, and paſſing through ſeveral obſcure Nooks and windings, to have come at length into a ſpacious Field, where among a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Reapers he found his Maſters Sow which had newly Pig'd; and making his Caſe known to the chief perſon in Office there, brought back his Sow, together with her Pigs, returning the ſame way he came. Thirdly, In the ſame County another Cave, called <hi>Eldenhole</hi> in the <hi>Peak</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59749:29"/>
Forreſt, which ſhoots directly down into the Earth, and as far as 60 yards of depth is to be ſeen into the mouth or entrance, on the top is about 30 yards in length, and 15 in breadth, but downwards it ſtraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens into a much narrower ſpace. Fourthly, Certain Caves called the <hi>Gyants Caves,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween great <hi>Badmin</hi> and <hi>Lockington,</hi> on the border of <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi> At a place called <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> not far from <hi>Darlington</hi> in the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Durham,</hi> there are three Pits of an extraordinary depth, commonly called <hi>Hell-Kettles,</hi> ſuppos'd to be produc'd by an Earthquake, which hapned in the year 1179. And near <hi>Tilbury</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> there are ſeveral Pits in a Chalky ground, which are judg'd to be no leſs than 12 Fathom deep. Alſo near <hi>Feverſham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> there are many Pits, which being ſomewhat narrow at the top, and widening towards the bottom, are diſtinguiſhed into ſeveral Rooms or Apartments, and ſupported as it were with Pillars of Chalk. At a Houſe of the Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s at <hi>Emsbury,</hi> I have been told, that at the pulling down of an old Wall, the Labourers diſcovered a Cavity, which upon ſearch led to a large Cave, where there was found a Monument of great Antiquity and Riches, which by the Character, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59749:29"/>
ſome other circumſtances, appears to have been the Tomb of Queen <hi>Guinever,</hi> Wife to King <hi>Arthur</hi>: Near <hi>Kirby-Longdale</hi> in <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> are many deep places like Caves. Fifthly, At <hi>Aberbarry</hi> in <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſhire,</hi> there is a Cave at the bottom of a Hill, the mouth whereof is a gaping Clift or Chink, into which, when the Wind enters, there is heard a kind of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious noice, as it were of Cymbals: There hath been alſo heard from a Clift on the Sea-ſide, near the Iſland <hi>Barry,</hi> a ſound as it were of Smiths at work, and this by the Teſtimony of <hi>Lilius Giraldus.</hi> Lakes and Fountains there are very many among us, which have ſomething ſtrange and extraordinary in them: Near <hi>Brereton</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> which belongs to an Eminent Family of the ſame Name, there is a Pool, wherein the bodies of Trees ſwimming are ſaid to preſage the Death of ſome of the Family. There are two Lakes very near to each other, hard by St. <hi>Agnes-Hill</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> of which it is credibly reported, that in the one of them Fiſh will live and thrive, in the other not. In <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> near <hi>Furneſs-Fells,</hi> there is a ſtanding water, accounted the greateſt in <hi>England,</hi> commonly called <hi>Miander-Meer,</hi> being no leſs than 10 Miles in length, and all along
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59749:30"/>
paved with ſtone at the bottom: It is ſaid moreover, that a Fiſh call'd a Ohare, breeds here only, and no where elſe. In <hi>Huntingtonſhire</hi> there are ſeveral Lakes, (and among the reſt one called <hi>Wittleſmeer-Lake</hi>) which in faireſt weather grow tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous, and rage with violent ſurges like the Sea. In <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> there are two remarkable Lakes; of one, <hi>Necham</hi> delivers, <hi>That by its Roaring it foretells things to come,</hi> the other is call'd <hi>Mahal,</hi> of which the Tradition goes, <hi>That Horſes when tir'd, drinking of the water thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes freſh as ever</hi>: Of this <hi>Gervaſe</hi> of <hi>Tilbury</hi> makes particular mention. On the high Hills of <hi>Carnarvonſhire,</hi> there are two Meers of a ſtrange nature (if report be true) for one is ſaid to produce a ſort of Fiſh that hath but one Eye; the other to have a floatable Iſland, whereon no ſooner any one ſets foot, but it drives farther off from the ſhoar. There is alſo at <hi>Bala</hi> in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionethſhire,</hi> a Pool which never fills by Land-floods, though riſing never ſo high, but in tempeſtuous weather, ſwelleth above its Banks. At <hi>Lynſavathan</hi> in <hi>Brecknock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> is a Meer which is ſaid to have ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up a City, that once ſtood in the room thereof; through this Meer runs the River <hi>Levenny,</hi> keeping its own ſtream in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59749:30"/>
and unmix'd. At <hi>Kilken</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> is a little Well which hath a conſtant eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing like the Sea. At <hi>Giggleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> there are three ſmall Springs, of two whereof there is nothing of obſervable, but the middlemoſt hath a conſtant courſe of ebbing and flowing four times an hour; the difference between its higheſt riſe and loweſt fall, being about eight Inches. Likewiſe in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> in the <hi>Forreſt</hi> of the <hi>Peak,</hi> is ſuch another Spring ebbing and flowing 4 times an hour, obſerving a conſtant and due revolution of its tydes. On the River <hi>Ogmore</hi> in <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſhire,</hi> there is a Well which every full tyde in <hi>Summer</hi> time is almoſt deſtitute of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but at ebb is repleniſh'd, many times very near, but never totally to an overflowing. Another there is at <hi>Carry-Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Caermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſhire,</hi> which ebbs and flows. Another in <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> near the River <hi>Loder,</hi> which ebbs and flows ſeveral times a day. At <hi>Lemington</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> a Salt Spring ariſeth at a great diſtance from the Sea. Near <hi>Kenet</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> the water breaking but of certain ſtones, is accounted a ſign of Dearth. The River <hi>Can</hi> in <hi>Weſtmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath Cataracts, which by their fall foretell either Rain or fair Weather. The riſing of a Bourn near <hi>Croiden</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59749:31"/>
is ſaid to preſage Mortality. Near <hi>St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> there is a Brook cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which when it breaketh out, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſageth Dearth, or ſome other Calamity. In a private mans Yard at <hi>Pitchford</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> is a Well whoſe waters caſt up a Skum of liquid <hi>Bitumen.</hi> In the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding</hi> of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> are Wells called <hi>Tingtong</hi> Wells, three Miles within the earth. The Petrifying Wells and Springs of <hi>England</hi> are very many, nor is it worth the while to mention all of them, the chief are in theſe particular Places; at <hi>Newenham</hi> or <hi>Menham-Reges</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire</hi>: Three which are alſo of a Medicinal quality, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrained through Allum, at <hi>Lutterworth</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire.</hi> Near <hi>Knarisborough</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> the <hi>Well-Drepa,</hi> whoſe Waters diſtil from the Rocks that hang over it. At <hi>Hodington-Hill</hi> near <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon the deſcent of the Hill. At <hi>Boxly Abbey</hi> near <hi>Maidſton</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi>; at <hi>Egerton</hi> in the ſame County. Nor are thoſe Wells and Springs to be forgotten, among the <hi>Memorabilia</hi> of Nature, whoſe Waters are of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal virtue; the chief of this nature, not only of <hi>England,</hi> but even of all <hi>Europe,</hi> for the virtue of the Waters, the Magnificence of the Structures about the Wells, and the vaſt reſort to them; are thoſe famous
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59749:31"/>
Bathing Wells, which give denomination to the City <hi>Bath,</hi> and which were firſt found out by one <hi>Bladud,</hi> who is reckoned in the Catalogue of our Ancient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings, and renowned in Hiſtory (if it may be called Hiſtory, and not rather Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Tradition) as well for Philoſopher as King. Others there are, whoſe Waters eſteemed for their Purging quality, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally carous'd, as <hi>Ebſham</hi> or <hi>Epſone-Wells</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> of <hi>Barnet</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> and now of late of <hi>North-hall</hi> in the ſame Shire. Now I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but fancy that there muſt needs be a very great advantage in this way of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, ſince thoſe who Evacuate ſo merrily with ſo much divertiſement, ſo many as it were together for good Companies ſake, no doubt find a more effectual Operation, than thoſe who coop'd up in a Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chamber, ſup up a mixture of Nauſeous and uncouth Ingredients out of an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries Shop: Other places there are, not altogether of no note for their Medicinal Wells, as <hi>Luckington</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> where there is a Well called <hi>Handcocks-Well,</hi> whoſe greateſt Virtue conſiſts in the Cure of ſore Eyes; having alſo this property, that its Water is cold in <hi>Summer</hi> and hot in <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Eckington</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> where
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59749:32"/>
there is lately diſcovered a Medicinal Well, accounted of great Virtue for ſeveral Diſtempers. <hi>Wallingborough</hi> in <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſhire,</hi> where upon the account of the Waters, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> lay for ſeveral weeks. <hi>Leniſham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> ſix Miles from <hi>London,</hi> where in the year 1651. a Medicinal Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was found, which hath been ſince much frequented. <hi>Dulwich</hi> Wells within three Miles of <hi>London</hi>: And within the City ſeveral, but the moſt noted, that at the Poſtern-gate by <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and that called <hi>Crowders-Well</hi> hard by <hi>Cripple-gate. Aleyceſton</hi> in <hi>Huntingtonſhire,</hi> where there are two ſmall Springs, one whereof being freſh, is accounted good for the Eyes; the other a little Brackiſh, for Scabs and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy. <hi>Buxton</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> where within the compaſs of 24 Foot, there ariſe out of a Rock from under a Square Structure of Free-ſtone 9 Springs, whereof one only is cold, all the reſt very warm: But among all theſe, it would be an unpardonable overſight to paſs by unmention'd, that famous Well of St. <hi>Winifrid,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Holy-Well</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> formerly much frequented, partly by way of Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, partly for the great Virtue it was reputed to have in the Cure of many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, through the eaſie Faith, no doubt,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59749:32"/>
and fond Credulity of the deluded Vulgar who are always apt to pay high Adoration and aſcribe miraculous Cures to the Bodies; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore that Nation that will ever hope to flouriſh, ought to uſe all means and endeavours poſſible for the increaſing of its People, and to avoid as much as may be all occaſions of Depopulation. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſes of the Diſpeopleing of <hi>Spain,</hi> which according to the Teſtimony of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Creditable Authors, hath been Ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much better Peopled than at preſent; have been firſt the multitude of Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Religious Priſons, thoſe Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles of forc'd Chaſtity, and as they are ordered Impediments of the Worlds Lawful Increaſe: Next the Violent Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Moors</hi> out of <hi>Spain,</hi> after that by a long eſtabliſh'd ſettlement, and being habituated to the ſame Cuſtoms, Manners and Religion, they were become as it were one Body with the reſt of the People. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Thoſe vaſt Colonies ſent out of <hi>Spain</hi> to maintain and poſſeſs the ample Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, or rather Ambitious and Bloody
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59749:34"/>
Invaſions and Depopulations made by the the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there. The Cities and Market-Towns of <hi>England,</hi> are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 607. to which the reſt of the Burrough Towns, that is, ſuch as ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament, and all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Villages (whereof ſome are conder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) being added, make above 10 times the number, ſo that all the Pariſhes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> are reckon'd 9285. and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs within the ſaid circumference, which is generally computed to be about 1352 Miles, might be very well comprehended five times as many Towns or Places of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, if all the Forreſts, Chaces, and unimproved vaſt Heaths and Commons, were taken in and improved to the beſt advantage.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be wondred at, that next to being born under a Happy Climate, the living under a Happy Government, the greateſt advantage and Strength of a People, is to be numerous, proportionably to the extent of Territory they poſſeſs. Since in the firſt place it is apparent enough, that in a well Inhabited City, the People muſt needs be ſo much the better able to defend themſelves from any Force or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Next, if it be a place of any Trade, take any particular number of what
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59749:34"/>
Trade ſoever, and it is not to be imagin'd that they ſhould be e're a whit the poorer, but rather the richer, than if the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants had been fewer: For admit them of the ſame Trade or Imployment, a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and correſponſible Trade is the more lively and vigorouſly carried on by many hands; and ſuppoſe them of ſeveral Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, the circulation of Money from the one to other, helps all in general. Though 'tis true, that in a ſtraggling Town or City, whoſe parts lye disjoyn'd and far aſunder; the people however conſiderable in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, cannot be ſo aſſiſtant to each other in mutual Aid, Society or Commerce, as in a regular and well compacted City: So likewiſe in a Kingdom, that Prince who hath never ſo large an Empire, yet if thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Peopled, or divided into ſeveral parts remotely diſtant, and interrupted from mutual intercourſe by long Voyages of Land and Sea, cannot be look'd upon as ſo powerful a Prince, as he that hath the like number of People in one intire and united Dominion. Certainly no Monarch of the World, much leſs of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be that hath added moſt to his Empire by never ſo many new made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts) can pretend to ſo large a ſhare or portion of the Earth, as the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:59749:35"/>
who nevertheleſs (as the tranſactions of a few late paſt years have made appear,) hath born but his fourth part with other Princes and States, in oppoſition to a Prince far inferior to him in Juriſdiction; and what ſhould be the reaſon of this, but that his Dominions lye ſo remote from each other, and his Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> which his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence there chiefly enables, is the leaſt Peopled of all the reſt, and his Viceroys of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico</hi> (the poſſeſſion whereof hath been main occaſion of Impoveriſhing <hi>Spain</hi> of its people) are in effect, ſetting aſide the Title, as great Kings as himſelf; nor much leſs are thoſe of <hi>Naples, Sicily, Millain,</hi> and what remains of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſo that he ſeems in reality King of <hi>Spain</hi> alone, and of the reſt of his Dominions, but in Title only: And to come a little nearer the matter, if all the Kings Subjects in <hi>New-England, Virginia, Maryland,</hi> &amp;c. were planted in thoſe unpeopled Regions of this Iſland (their Native Soyl) which are more than large enough to receive them, there is no doubt to be made, but that they would be more capable of ſerving their King, than they can poſſibly be at ſuch a diſtance, thus tranſplanted to the other end of the World: To be ſhort, no Rational man will deny, but that that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59749:35"/>
Prince, who from a Territory no larger than the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> is able to bring 100000 men into the field, is no leſs Potent than he who from a Territory 20 times as large is able to raiſe a not much greater number; and ſo much the more, by how much he levies them with leſs Trouble and Charge. That Soveraign Conquers beſt, who wins the hearts of his people by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, Juſtice, good Government, and wholſome Laws. He beſt plants Colonies, who maintains a flouriſhing Trade to Forraign parts; he beſt inlarges his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, who husbands his People to the beſt advantage, and conſults beſt for their Preſervation and Increaſe; hereby approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf all this while a true Chriſtian Prince, not in Name only, but in reality no leſs; and upon this ſcore, let the World judge, whether our <hi>Defenſor Fidei</hi> have not a juſt Title to that of <hi>Chriſtianiſſimus</hi> alſo. When as for any Potentate or Grandee of the World, Pontifical or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to graſp at Power and Empire by War, Bloodſhed and Rapine, though under never ſo ſpacious a pretence, even propoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Faith it ſelf, and at the ſame time to take upon him the Name of Chriſtian, muſt needs be the higheſt affront to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſhame to Religion imaginable.

The Stile of Chriſtian Cut-throat, (for that muſt neceſſarily follow) implying a cnntradiction not to be reconcil'd by all the art of Sopiſtry and Jeſuitiſm; ſince he that hath but heard of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, cannot be ignorant that Peace and Charity are the very root and foundation of Chriſtianity, and that Religion under what Title ſoever, which is otherwiſe grounded, is to be abhorr'd by all ſober men. The <hi>Creator</hi> ſaid to the Earth at the beginning, Increaſe and be Repleniſh'd: The <hi>Deſtroyer</hi> hath been ſaying to the ſame Earth from the beginning, from Age to Age; be ruin'd, laid waſt and Diſpeopled by humane Slaughter. Now how far the parallel will hold between the greater, and Man the leſſer World, as to the neceſſity of Purging and Bleeding; and whether it be ſo wholſom, as ſome would have us think, that the ſuperfluous blood of the World ſhould be let out by the Phlebotomy of War, we ſhall wave the inquiry at this preſent; only I am of opinion, that it would be better to leave the Phyſicking of the World to the great Phyſitian there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, than that man upon man ſhould ſo often practice his Fatal Chyrurgery. There is ſufficient reaſon to believe that thoſe frequent Inundations of People, thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59749:36"/>
ſwarms of <hi>Cimbrians, Teutones, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobards, Huns, Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> which <hi>Scythia</hi> in former times pour'd out into the milder Regions of <hi>Europe,</hi> were not ſo much the Luxuriance and off-ſcouring of an over-peopled Nation, (ſince not any one denomination of Country beſides, takes up ſo large a part of the earth, or hath ſo many vaſt unhabited Vacancies) but a kind of agreement among certain numbers of men to carve themſelves out better Commons than their own Country afforded; and throw off the <hi>Scythian</hi> Froſt and roughneſs, by the Warm Sun-ſhine of <hi>Gallia, Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Now to come cloſer to the deſign of our Diſcourſe: Three things are to be conſidered. Firſt, Whether this Nation have not been in former Ages more Populous than at preſent. Next, what the occaſion of this Diſpopulation hath been. Laſtly, The means of reſtoration to priſtine Populacy, or at leaſt of Repleniſhment in ſome degree. The firſt conſideration is anſwered by the ſecond: There is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be made, but that the complicated Invaſions of <hi>Romans, Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> (eſpecially the laſt ſo dreadfully Barbarous) was the Deſtruction of a World of People, and the Demoliſhment of many Towns and Cities; and after the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59749:37"/>
the Bloody Civil Wars amongſt us; firſt of the Barons, next of the two Roſes: As for the <hi>Norman</hi> Invaſion it ſelf, it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd indeed no great matter of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation, ſince except a few inconſiderable Inſurrections that happen'd afterwards, the buſineſs was decided by the dint of one Battle, and happily the Conqueror had not been ſorry, had more of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fallen in that quarrel; ſince, like a true Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father and Foraign Invader, more than like a Native Father of the Country, he could find in his heart to lay waſte 28 Towns and Villages, to make a large ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for wild Beaſts. The laſt and main conſideration, is how to repair this loſs of People; ſhall we call the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>America</hi> back to their Native Soyl? or ſhall we invite the Induſtrious, or the Diſtreſſed of other Nations to come over and live among us? or ſhall we indeavour to People the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion better with thoſe People, if I may ſo call them, we have already; that is, turn Drones into Bees, and two Legg'd Cattle into Men? The firſt I take altogether to be Impracticable and Irrational to go about; for it would be an endleſs thing for ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of People to unfix themſelves from their ſetled Imploys and Habitations, and to be put to remove their Effects back to a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59749:37"/>
Country now grown as ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth to them, as any other Foraign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſecond, according to my poor judgment, cannot be diſadvantageous to this Kingdom, could it be well compas'd and well manag'd, ſo as to give no diſtaſte to the preſent Inhabitants; for it hath been a general and frequent Complaint, in my hearing, among ſome Tradeſmen of <hi>London,</hi> that Foraigners (eſpecially theſe <hi>French</hi> Dogs, as they ſtile them) come over, ſettle themſelves among us, and eat the Bread out of our Mouths. Nevertheleſs it is certain, that in many Towns of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Canterbury, Norwich,</hi> &amp;c. many Families of Foraigners are well ſetled, exerciſe the Epidemick Trade of thoſe Places peaceably and proſperouſly enough, and without envy or diſturbance. Hoſpitality is a certain evidence of a good Nature and Generous Inclination; and it hath been formerly, and doubtleſs ſtill is in a great meaſure, the particular Credit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry, to keep Plentiful Houſes, on purpoſe to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain Strangers, give Shelter to benighted Travellers, and Succour all perſons in Diſtreſs: And as among particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, no man but an Indigent Wretch, or Ill-natur'd Churl, will deny Relief to a perſon, that through real and remedileſs
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59749:38"/>
want makes application to him. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe among Nations, that People that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the Accomodation of their Country to their ſupplicant Neighbours, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly Baniſhed their own Native Land, or driven, out by Perſecution and Tyranny, fly to them for Refuge, muſt needs be the Inhabitants of a Beggarly and Unhoſpitable Soyl, or be themſelves a ſort of Inhumane and Savage-Bores. Our Kingdom, God be thanked, is ſufficiently Fertile; our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives not accounted Ill-natured, and for Room we have not only to ſpare, but within the whole Circuit of <hi>England</hi> enough, as we have ſaid before, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a far greater power of People twice, if not thrice the number: So that an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of peaceable Strangers can be no injury, may be a conſiderable benefit to us; ſo that in being Charitable to others, we ſhall be no loſers our ſelves; and never was there ſo important and ſeaſonable an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offered as now, for the receiving of Foraigners among us; ſince never did any perſecuted people ſo want our Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Succour, as at this time, theſe our Proteſtant Neighbours, who in their own Native Country, and among the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, are denyed that Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which living peaceably, they could not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59749:38"/>
doubt of among the ſevereſt of <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Ethnicks</hi>; and all this for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then denying to fall down before the obtruded Idol, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were dealt with in the days of the Tyrant <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>: But by Divine Providence it falls out happily to be at a time that <hi>England</hi> is govern'd by the moſt Juſt and Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Princes; who out of his Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Proteſtant Religion, and that innate Generoſity and Clemency where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he delights to oblige all mankind, hath by an Order of Councel of the  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>  of <hi>September</hi> this preſent year 1681. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all thoſe that ſhall come over, ſuch ample Priviledges and Immunities, as will much ſoften and allay their preſent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and in a great meaſure compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate for their being forc'd to abandon their Native habitations. The laſt cannot be reaſonably judg'd unfeaſible, and is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt abſolutely neceſſary, ſince thoſe many thouſands of Unimployed perſons, burthens of the earth, who preſume they were only born to Eat and Drink, are no better than ſo many Ciphers, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly loſt to their Country: Nay which is worſe, they may juſtly be reckoned as ſo many Vermine and Noxious Animals; for Idleneſs it ſelf cannot always ſubſiſt in its
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59749:39"/>
own ſtation, but oftentimes is forc'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Action, but 'tis the worſt part of Action, Miſchief. As admit a Nation never ſo thinly Inhabited, and yet a Million of thoſe Inhabitants prove utterly uſeleſs and unprofitable, that Nation may well be ſaid to be too Populous by that Million: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Cut-purſe, Pick-pocket, Houſe-breaker, Highway-man, and whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides can be imagin'd miſchievous, are but the ſeveral Metamorphoſes of an Idle Liver; and thus Idleneſs tends to a more fatal kind of Depopulation: The unworking perſon indeed, who in ſome ſence may be ſaid to be no perſon, but dead to the ſervice of his Country, yet is capable of being quickned and inſpir'd with the life of Action; but the worker of Iniquity, who is commonly the reſult of the unworking Perſon, takes courſes which tend to an irrevivable Deſtruction. The firſt is but that Malefactor in <hi>Poſſe,</hi> which the Thief and Robber is in <hi>Eſſe</hi>; and doubtleſs were the Potential Maleficence, which is Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſeverely inquired into, and regulated by the Diſcipline of Law and Government, ſo many of the Kings Subjects would not yearly at every Seſſion and Aſſize, as Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Malefactors, be made ſad Examples of Juſtice, and cut off from the Land of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59749:39"/>
the Living, to which in this World there is no return. But what hath been ſaid all this while of the unworking Perſon, (whom to compel to work, that he may be kept from Starving, and reſtrain from Stealing, that he may be reſtrained from the Gallows, is no Injurious, but Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable part of a Magiſtrate) it is to be underſtood only of thoſe narrow Soul'd Loiterers, who being not worth a Groat in the World, chooſe rather to go ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring up and down Beg, Filch and be Lowſy, than Honeſtly to get their Bread by clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Induſtry and wholeſome Labour: Whereas for him that hath enough to Live on, who ſhall hinder him, if he pleaſe and have the Conſcience, to be Idle and good for nothing at his own Charges: As for thoſe who are great in Money, Lands, or High Offices, great alſo are their Priviledges; for the World hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally a very great favour and reſpect for ſuch as flouriſh and are proſperous in it, (as well as contempt for the Poor and Unfortunate) and except they ſhall unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately happen to become Envy'd-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, will be apt to have a favourable excuſe for whatſoever is either omitted or committed by them. However, there is a real merit that cannot be denyed them,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59749:40"/>
which is, that they have wherewithal to be ſerviceable to their King and Country: A Rich man, meerly as a Rich man, muſt needs be acknowledged a uſeful perſon in his Generation, eſpecially if his Heart be anſwerable to his Purſe, or however where ſomething is to be had, there is a poſſibility of obtaining: On the other ſide, though it be juſt and rational to give Law to thoſe who will not give Law to themſelves, to compel men to their own as well as the publick good, to work that they may not Starve, to do well, that they may not ſuffer for doing ill. It is not yet ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to reaſon, that any one ſhould be forc'd to performance, though of things never ſo juſt, above Ability, or to make ſatisfactions out of nothing. That the Idle and Induſtrious alike, to ſatisfie the rigorous Juſtice of a Self-loving Creditor, ſhould for being Idle or Unfortunate, be condemned to perpetual Idleneſs and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and for no other cauſe, than not working Impoſſibilities, be conſtrain'd to lie ſtarving and ſtinking to death in a loathſom Gaol, is a piece of Judiciality. I do not underſtand, and I verily believe, that it is no leſs unjuſt, for any one to be Cruel and Rigorous in the exacting of his <hi>Own</hi> from him that <hi>Hath</hi> not, than for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59749:40"/>
him that <hi>Hath,</hi> to forbear the payment of what he <hi>Owes</hi>; who alſo, if not willing of himſelf, may and ought to be made ſo by force and rigour: Which may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted otherwiſe than by Confinement, for a Priſon is leaſt a puniſhment to thoſe that moſt deſerve it. To conclude, a too rigorous procedure either to Death or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, ſeems an over-acting in Juſtice, and as it were tending much alike to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a kind of Depopulation; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no great difference between not to be at all, and not to be at Liberty; the firſt totally, the ſecond after a manner, depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World of thoſe whoſe Lives and Liberties might happily have been uſefully enough, ſpar'd for the Commonwealth.</p>

                     <p>Among the woollen Manufacture of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> may be reckon'd the weaving and knitting of Stockings, the uſe of which woven and knit Stockings hath not been in this Nation longer than about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of K. <hi>James</hi>'s Reign: It being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry memorable what D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59749:43"/>
of the Trade in moſt Places where there is any thing of woollen Manufacture, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at <hi>Norwich</hi>; yet Jerſie Stockings have for a long time had a particular name. The Next Place may properly be allow'd to our making of Bone-lace, which is the chief of the Ornamentals worn in this Nation, though not ſo totally as before the Needle-works came in faſhion, which though brought to great perfection, yet have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd ſo much the leſs eſteem, by how much thoſe of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Points <hi>de Venice</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Larron</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> came more in faſhion, as all foreign Artifices uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (eſpecially the <hi>French</hi>) have ever the chiefeſt vogue among our Gallants. So general is this Manufacture in many Parts of <hi>England,</hi> that the Poor of whole Towns are almoſt totally imploy'd, and in a great meaſure maintain'd thereby: Particularly, <hi>Honiton</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> is a noted Town for his ſort of Workmanſhip; as likewiſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi> and <hi>Marlborough</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire, Ouldny</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire, Amerſham</hi> and <hi>Cheſham</hi> in the ſame Shire, <hi>Blandford</hi> in <hi>Dorcetſhire</hi>; which laſt Place hath been famous alſo for making of Band-ſtrings, and now Point-<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Smiths-work, whatever it is at preſent, hath been heretofore peculiarly attributed to the Artiſts of <hi>Salisbury</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micham</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire, Chedder</hi> in <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, Sheffield</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire, Malton</hi> in the ſame Shire, and <hi>Walſal</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi>; particularly <hi>Salisbury</hi> is commended for Razors; <hi>Bremicham</hi> and <hi>Sheffield</hi> for Blades of Knives; <hi>Chedder</hi> for Teaſels or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

But by the way, the mention of Knives hath brought to mind a juſt occaſion of admiration, that is, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have been obſerv'd, and not without juſt cauſe, to be a good ſtout eating People, there being more ſubſtantial Joynts of Beef and Mutton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſum'd among us, than perhaps in any part of the World beſides, how it ſhould come to paſs, that we ſhould be ſo tardy in the Art of Knife-making; or what Invention we had in former days, to avoid thoſe Indecencies at the Table, which the want of Knives muſt in all likelihood be the cauſe of: For it is credibly reported, that one <hi>Thomas Matthews</hi> living on <hi>Fleet</hi>-bridge, was the firſt that made Knives in <hi>England,</hi> which was in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of the Reign of Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>

                     <p>The beſt Tobacco-pipes, for neatneſs of ſhape and form, and for a curious ſhining gloſs, are made at <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> vulgarly call'd <hi>Emsbury</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> about a mile or two from <hi>Stonehenge</hi>; they are commonly call'd Gantlet-Pipes (having the mark of a Gantlet impreſs'd on the flat bottom of the

                     <p>There are alſo ſeveral edible and potable Works of Art, which may in my opinion properly enough come under the Head of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures. The Coagulation of Milk into the Conſiſtence of Cheeſe, is ſaid to have been the firſt Invention of the <hi>Oſci,</hi> an ancient People of <hi>Italy</hi>; but whence or from whomſoever proceeding, this ſort of artificial Food is the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and univerſal, in all Parts of the World where the moſt rational and civil way of Eating is in uſe. Of all the Shires of <hi>England, Cheſhire</hi> for this kind of Edible, may, I judge, be allow'd the Bays, above all other Parts, at leaſt of this Kingdom; and for ought I know, a true <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Cheeſe, if rightly valu'd, may ſtand in competition with the Parmeſan of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Angelot of <hi>France,</hi> and the Full-moon of <hi>Holland,</hi> only with this pre-eminence reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the laſt, that but for the bigneſs, it might ſerve as well for the Bowling-green as the Table. <hi>Suffolk</hi> in this particular challenges the next place, but doubtleſs in reſpect rather of quantity than quality; for this County furniſhes with Cheeſes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeveral other Parts of <hi>England,</hi> but alſo
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59749:45"/>
                        <hi>Spain, France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>; a lean Traveller may poſſibly be thought able to endure a long Journey better than one that's plump and fat. Theſe are the two principal Cheeſe-Counties of <hi>England</hi>; but in other Counties, this Pretenſion is fixt to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Places, as in <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> to <hi>Chedder</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd, the Cheeſes whereof are of that repute, as to be frequently, preferr'd even before thoſe of <hi>Cheſhire</hi>; Opinion and Imagination are two great things.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Warwickſhire, Banbury</hi> hath a Name both for Cheeſes and Cakes, the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which Name is beſt left to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd taſter of both. For Sugar'd-Cakes, <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> is without controverſie allow'd to bear away the Bell from all other Places. But to ſave the Reputation of the Cake-makers of other Parts, this Super-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence is attributed to the nature of the <hi>Severn</hi>-water in that Place. Other Places there are that challenge their Peculiars of this nature, but the moſt proverbially emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent are the Whitepot of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and Dumpling of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor muſt the Potables of <hi>England</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together forgotten.

                     <p>To the Manufactury of <hi>England,</hi> may not unfitly be added an account of thoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arts and Inventions, which are now flouriſhing in this Nation, whether newly, or for ſome Ages laſt paſt. And among theſe, the firſt and principal is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and by ſome highly applauded, and by others moſt condemned, Art of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. This noble Invention, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects uſeful, and no way ſo pernicious as ſome would have it thought, was firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd by <hi>William Caxton</hi> Mercer, who in the Reign of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the IV. kept his Printing-houſe in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Abbey, by the permiſſion of <hi>Simon Iſlip</hi> Abbot of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>; and the firſt Book ſet forth, ſome ſay, was <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Offices</hi>; others ſay, a Book treating of the way of playing the Game at Cheſs.</p>
                     <p>The next Invention appearing here among us, muſt be allow'd little leſs inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious than the former, but wonderfully more capable of doing miſchief, I mean, the truly black Art of Gunpowder, the ſwarthy Invention of a ſwarthy <hi>Monk,</hi> and poſſibly by the Inſpiration of the Prince of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59749:46"/>
Darkneſs. Yet one thing is worthy to be obſerv'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſince the diſcovery of this gloomy Drug, whatever deſtruction hath been committed by whole-ſale, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of amends hath been made by retail: For whereas in former Times, when the Bow, Lance and Javelin were in uſe, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry makes nothing of 40 or 50000 ſlain in the Field; now that the Musket, Dragoon and Piſtol came in faſhion (even with the Cannon to boot) it is a great matter to hear of the fall of 10 or 20000. beſides, as a Member ſometimes is not ill loſt to ſave a Man, ſo in greater Bodies, a Houſe may be better ſpar'd than a whole Street or Town, which deliverance nothing but Gunpowder can effect. But then againſt this benefit may be oppos'd the ſpringing of Mines, to blow up Caſtles, Forts and Cittadels, meerly for deſtructions ſake.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be doubted, and it appears from Hiſtories, that the Chariot hath been known in <hi>England</hi> as well as in other Parts of the World time out of mind; but the uſe of thoſe portable Houſes call'd Coaches, which at this day being increas'd to a vaſt multitude, make ſuch a clutter in the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> to the great diſturbance of the poor Foot-Paſſenger, is ſaid to have firſt commenc'd about the year 1556. till
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59749:47"/>
when, 'tis to be preſum'd, that great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſeldom ſtirr'd out but in fair weather, whereas now all Seaſons for Viſits are alike; otherwiſe the Cavalcade of Princes and Nobles on Horſeback, may doubtleſs afford the Beholder as comely a Spectacle as a long train of Coaches. Together with the Coach, or not long after, I gueſs, came in the Coaches Epitome, the Sedan, more elegantly ſtyl'd a Chair, a much more eaſie ſort of paſſage, as perform'd not by draught but carriage, and that by the more rational ſort of Animal. But there is another kind of moving Domicil of much later date, call'd a Caleſh, which ſeems like a Coach cut off in the middle, wherein commonly the Driver and the Driven is one and the ſelf-ſame perſon.</p>
                     <p>Watches, and other horary Motions of that nature, it is certain, came out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and according to the beſt conjecture, ſomewhat more than a 100 years ſince. The principal Artiſts of this kind menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd are <hi>Janus Torrianellus,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius van Drebble</hi>; but ſince all kind of automa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Motions by Clock-work have been wonderfully improv'd by thoſe of our own Nation, particularly M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Davie Mell,</hi> beſides his excellent judgement and fancy in Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Compoſitions, and his great perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance

on the Violin, above all others of his Time, (for within theſe 20 years, the very quinteſſence of that Inſtruments Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick hath been extracted, as being chiefly in faſhion) was ſo prodigious an Artiſt in all Mechanick Motions by Clock-work, that if any one ſince hath equall'd him in Art, he hath at leaſt fallen ſhort in Fame.</p>
                     <p>But of all Inventions of this kind, the <hi>Pendulum</hi> of lateſt date, is alſo of greateſt curioſity and uſe, being generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd the Deſign of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

the mention of a Perſon, who from his own natural Fancy and Ingenuity, hath arriv'd to that perfection, as well in this as all manner of Torning elſe, that he is judg'd by knowing Perſons not to be exceeded, if equall'd, by any that have been bred up to the Art, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:59749:49"/>As for Painting, our Nation can boaſt nothing like the Works of the great Sir <hi>Anthony Vandike,</hi> who though born a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, died an Engliſhman. Nor hath he wanted ſeveral famous Succeſſors; as <hi>Dobſon, Fuller, Walker, Lillie, Greenhill,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Perſon famous among us for Painting in Miniature, was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <p>Scene-Paintings and Machines have not been known in <hi>England</hi> till within theſe 20 years; and the only eminent Men in this kind have been Mr. <hi>Streeter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſon,</hi> ſome years ſince deceaſed.</p>
                     <p>In Muſick, it would be too tedious to determine, whether the Improvement or Alteration hath been greater. Certain it is, that ſeveral old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inſtruments are laid aſide; as the Orpharian, the Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phone, an Inſtrument ſurely not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd, conſidering its rare Structure, and the Eſteem had of it by learned and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt judiciouſly Muſical Perſons of this Age, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Prujean,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Rugely.</hi>

His Pitch-Pipe, for the tuning of Muſical Inſtruments to conſort; Pitch is particularly worthy note for exactneſs, variety and curious Work, above any thing that is to be ſeen elſewhere of this nature. The Harp is rather increas'd than diminiſh'd in repute; and though the <hi>Welſh</hi> Gut-ſtring formerly gave place to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> Wire-ſtring, by reaſon of the maſterly Hands of Mr. <hi>John Cob,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lewis Williams,</hi> now the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gut-ſtring comes up with it, through the excellent Maſtery of Mr. <hi>Maurice,</hi> Mr. <hi>Evans,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedhurſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Webſter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Grant,</hi> living with my Lord <hi>Mountague,</hi> and for the Outlandiſh way of Playing, Mr. <hi>Arn.</hi> The Violin is now of all others generally of higheſt eſteem, and is indeed a very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſtrument in Conſort, and now arriv'd to that perfection of performance, that it were endleſs to enumerate all that have been of late accounted great Violin-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.

                     <p>The making of Glaſſes is ſaid to have been begun in <hi>England, anno</hi> 1557. about which time there liv'd at <hi>Chiddingsfold,</hi> a Perſon very famous for this Art, which as it grew improv'd, the finer ſort were firſt made at <hi>Crotchet-friers</hi>; but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Flint-Glaſs, which is the fineſt and cleareſt ever made here, and very near, if not altogether equal to thoſe of <hi>Venice,</hi> was firſt begun by Mr. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and ſince car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with good ſucceſs by Mr. <hi>Ravenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft.</hi> There is now a Company of 12 Men of the Potters Trade, who are Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of this ſort of Workmanſhip, chiefly exercis'd at preſent at the <hi>Savoy</hi>-Houſe in the <hi>Strand.</hi> But the firſt Glaſs-plates for Looking-glaſſes, Coach-windows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> were made at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 10 years ſince, by the Encouragement of his Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Direction of Mr. <hi>Reeves</hi> afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>
                     <p>The firſt in <hi>England</hi> who caſt braſs Guns, <hi>viz.</hi> Cannons, Culverines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſaid to have been one <hi>John Oaven</hi>; after him <hi>Peter Band</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> in the firſt year of the Reign of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the VI. caſt iron Falcons, Falconets, Minions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but

                     <p>In Gunſmiths-work there hath been of late years diſcover'd a very large increaſe of Art and Ingenuity, as to the Locks and Barrels of Muskets, Carbines, Piſtols, and the like. In which ſort of Artifice there have been many excellent Workmen; whereof at this day, Mr. <hi>Shaw,</hi> and <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fard,</hi> Gunſmiths to his Majeſty, and Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> living in <hi>Exeter-ſtreet,</hi> are eſteem'd the chiefeſt Artiſts of <hi>London,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in all probability, of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another principal branch of Smiths-work, is the making of Locks and Keys, in which nothing, was ever ſeen ſo curious and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, as what is done at this day by Mr. <hi>Wilkins.</hi>

                     <p>Mathematical Inſtruments, as Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Quadrants, Rulers, are moſt certainly now more exquiſitely made than ever. Herein Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> in <hi>Hoſier-lane,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> in <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> were lately the moſt celebrated Workmen; now Mr. <hi>Markham</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Winne</hi> in <hi>Chancery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane.</hi>

                     <p>The Projection of Globes, Spheres and Maps, is without controverſie now more exactly underſtood than formerly, through the Ingenuity firſt of Mr. <hi>Moxon,</hi> now of

Mr. <hi>Berry</hi> near <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> in <hi>Cornhil.</hi> Nor is there without all doubt in all things of this nature, a better Graver than Mr. <hi>Lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here may not unfitly be mention'd the new Invention of an Iron Pen, which beſides its laſtingneſs, is equally fit for uſe with the beſt Gooſe-Quill whatſoever: By Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Writing-Maſter to <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi>-Hoſpital.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpoken of Printing, it will not be unſeaſonable to intimate how much Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-founding hath been advanc'd of late. S. <hi>Henry Savil</hi>'s ſilver Character for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> was much admir'd at that time; but of late we have had many Books printed in very delicate Characters, both ſmall and great, eſpecially the fine ſmall Greek Character, in which ſeveral Greek Poets have been printed at the <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> is ſo curious, that nothing can be more, not excepting the fine ſmall Prints of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Leyden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It would be endleſs to reckon up all the new Allamodes of Cloths, Stuffs, Silks, Ribbands, and the like.</p>
                     <p>But of the many curious Pieces in Wax-work, Straw-work, Acupiction in Silks and Sattins, cutting of Paper, Cloth, or fine Leather, into exquiſite Figures, folding
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59749:54"/>
of Napkins into the ſhapes of Birds, Beaſts, or Fiſhes, tho Ingenuity of former Ages (as to moſt of theſe Artifices) hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not receiv'd much addition. Though in Wax there are to be ſeen very curious things of late Workmanſhip, which poſſibly have arriv'd to utmoſt Improvement: For Imboſsment in Wax, Mr. <hi>Houſeman</hi> was certainly the beſt Artiſt that hath been known in theſe Parts.</p>
                     <p>The rich Embroidery of former Times, as will appear to thoſe, who viſiting the Houſes of the old Nobility and Gentry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the pompous Furniture left by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtry of thoſe Families, is, as I conjecture, not eaſily out-done, if equall'd, by any thing this Age can produce.</p>
                     <p>The Art of making fine white Thread, is ſaid to have been brought into <hi>England</hi> about the year 1670. by Mr. <hi>Joſeph Allen,</hi> Citizen and Merchant-Taylor of <hi>London,</hi> keeping a Thread-ſhop in <hi>Biſhopgate-ſtreet,</hi> at the <hi>Golden Anchor</hi> near <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> even to the value of 3 <hi>l.</hi> the pound, and vying with the Nuns Thread of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Glaſſen Bee-hive is mention'd by my Ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>John Worlidge</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersfield,</hi> to have been the Contrivance of Mr. <hi>William Mew,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Eaſlington</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire.</hi> He alſo mentions a wooden
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59749:55"/>
Hive of an Octangle form, with a glaſs Window in one of the ſides. This glaſſen Bee-hive, I remember, about 30 years ago, was much talk'd of as a great Rarity, when the late Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> had of them in his Garden at <hi>Wadham</hi>-Colledg, whereof he was then Warden; both ſorts are now ſufficiently common, but they are no where to be ſeen better order'd and more curious than at Mr. <hi>Evelin</hi>'s Paradice of a Garden by <hi>Deptford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Plow, though as ancient as Tillage it ſelf; the Improvements are but of late years: The chief whereof mention'd by Mr. <hi>Blith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Worlidge,</hi> are the ſingle wheel'd Plow and the double wheel'd Plow, and the double Plow, which is in the nature of two Plows joyn'd together. Mr. <hi>John Houghton</hi> alſo (worthily for his great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and Induſtry) a Fellow of the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Society,</hi> in that moſt uſeful Deſign of his, call'd, <hi>A Collection of Letters for the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Husbandry,</hi> inſerts an Invention of <hi>Thomas Llewellin,</hi> at the <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Cateaten-ſtreet,</hi> for plowing with one Man and two Horſes or Oxen, a greater quantity of Land than can be perform'd at the ſame time with double the number of Men and Cattel. He alſo in the ſame Sheet gives a large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a Malt-kill at <hi>Nottingham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59749:55"/>Engines of grand bulk, force and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, are doubtleſs near as ancient as whatever Art or Invention have produc'd, being of too great neceſſity to be unthought of by any thinking or inventing People.</p>
                     <p>Cranes and Engines for the drawing up of Goods of great bulk and weight, ſuch as we have at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> and ſuch like Places, are mention'd in ancient Authors.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in War, the <hi>Arcubaliſtae,</hi> and the <hi>Arietes</hi> or Battering-Rams, which againſt the Walls of beſieged Towns did more than multitudes of Men.</p>
                     <p>What the Antiquity is of Corn Wind-mills, is hard to determine whether in this or any other Nation.</p>
                     <p>The Paper-Mill is certainly of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Invention, and it may be wonder'd that in all this time Paper-making hath not been brought to a greater height in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it being judg'd very poſſible, that as good Paper might be made in <hi>England,</hi> as any is brought over from <hi>France, Holland,</hi> or any other foreign Part.</p>
                     <p>The Powder-Mill cannot be of very long ſtanding, ſince it is ſcarce 200 years that Gunpowder it ſelf hath bounc'd and made a ſmoak in the World.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, of theſe grand performing Engines, there is a very great number even
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59749:56"/>
of late Invention, of which I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to call to mind at leaſt the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>For the grubbing up of Stumps of Oak, there is an Engine call'd the <hi>German Devil,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Evelin</hi> in his incomparable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Foreſt-trees, affirms to have been made uſe of by a Noble Perſon of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that ſucceſs, that by the help thereof one Man was able to do more than could otherwiſe have been done by 12 Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.

But to ſum up the Glory of this Place, it will be ſufficient to repeat what <hi>Speed</hi> quotes from <hi>Leyland,</hi> viz. <hi>The Sun hath not ſeen a City</hi> (ſo he calls it) <hi>more fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and delicately ſeated upon an aſcent of a Hill, having a River running on the Eaſt-ſide, nor was there ever a more noble Abbey, either for Revenues or incomparable Magnificence,</hi> in whoſe Circuit appeareth rather a City

like ſo many Gems about it, yet far more illuſtrious by thoſe bright Lamps of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which from this Place have ſhot their Lights into the World.

About a dozen years ago there hapned a ſhrewd Fire, which burnt down a great part of this Street, which being rebuilt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the Street appears much more ſtately than before; and that which gives the greater grace to it, is the Proſpect of a fine Houſe of my Lord <hi>Seymour</hi>'s, at the Towns end, which is the more remarkable, by reaſon of a Mount which is aſcended by a Path, which winds round about upward toward the top like a Screw.</p>

                     <p>The Church of <hi>Bath,</hi> though <hi>Litchfield</hi> be the Biſhop's principal Seat, is by ſome call'd a Cathedral, and for largeneſs and elegance of Building may well enough be ſo accounted.</p>

                     <p>Another Church in the ſame City call'd the <hi>Temple,</hi> is remarkable for its Tower, which whenſoever the Bell is rung, divides from the reſt of the Building, with a Cleft from the bottom to the top, which gapes the breadth of three Fingers.</p>

Bridge; but afterwards receiv'd a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pitch of luſtre by being built of Stone, inſomuch that without controverſie it is judg'd the nobleſt Structure of that kind in <hi>Europe.</hi> It ſtands upon 19 Arches of Stone, which ſupport a Street of very fair Edifices, of a quarter of a Mile in length, for ſo much the breadth of the <hi>Thames</hi> is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that place.</p>
                     <p>The next for Beauty and Magnificence, is that of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>; and after that the Bridg of <hi>Stratford upon Avon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among the three Beauties of the Town of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the Bridge is one, the other two being the Church and Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>Over the River <hi>Ouſe,</hi> which encircles the Town of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> all but the North-ſide, are three fair Bridges of Stone.</p>
                     <p>The ſame River <hi>Ouſe</hi> runs through the midſt of the Town of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and hath over it a handſom Stone-Bridge, with two Gates upon it.</p>
                     <p>Over the River <hi>Dee</hi> is a ſtately Stone-Bridge, which leads to the City of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> It is ſupported with 8 Arches, and hath at
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59749:75"/>
each end two ſtrong Gates, from whence the Walls commence, within which the City lyes in an oblong Square.</p>
                     <p>From the River <hi>Derwent,</hi> a ſmall Brook runs through the Town of <hi>Darby,</hi> (which lyes on the Weſtern-bank of that River) under 9 Bridges. But the ſtatelieſt of all is that in the North-Eaſt part of the Town, upon which ſtandeth a fair Chappel of Stone.</p>
                     <p>Over the River <hi>VVeer,</hi> with which the City of <hi>Durham</hi> is almoſt wholly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd, two neat Stone-Bridges, one from the South, the other from the North-Road, lead into the midſt of the Town.</p>

                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59749:76"/>Several others there are, and ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not unworthy of memory, but theſe being the very chiefeſt, it will not be worth the while to mention any more.</p>
                     <p>The grand Ornaments of any City are the publick Buildings thereof; and next to the Churches, Palaces and Bridges, are the Monumental Structures, that preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt obviouſly to the view of Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in Streets and High-ways, as Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, Arches, and the Columnal or Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Works, erected as Trophies in memory of ſome great Action or Perſon; as alſo Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for publick Games and Spectacles.</p>
                     <p>For Structures of this kind, never any City of the World was ſo famous as old <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Circus's, Amphitheaters, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, Pyramids, Tryumphal Arches, Eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian Statues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> next to the maſſie Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were accounted the greateſt Pieces of Art and Magnificence the World ever ſaw. Nor are the Pyramids, Columns and Aguglia's of the preſent <hi>Rome,</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unmemorable.</p>
                     <p>Of Monuments of this nature in <hi>England,</hi> the Croſſes erected in Streets and publick Places were the chief. And of thoſe the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59749:76"/>
principal were <hi>Coventry</hi>-Croſs; and in this City <hi>Charing</hi>-Croſs, and that of <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> which laſt was certainly the nobleſt Piece of Workmanſhip of this nature, as well for the largeneſs as the curiouſneſs of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery that ever was ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Next, The Aqueducts or Conduits have been accounted no ſmall Street-ornaments in many Towns and Cities, but the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that were in <hi>London,</hi> may ſerve for all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The chief that were in <hi>London</hi> before the Fire of 66. were the Standart in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> a Structure that might have paſs'd for a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Piece of Workmanſhip, had it not ſtood ſo near ſo rich a Croſs. Another at the lower end of <hi>Cheapſide.</hi> Another in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil.</hi> That in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> hard by <hi>Shoe-lane</hi> end; and another in <hi>Holborn,</hi> near <hi>Holborn</hi>-Bridge, beſides ſeveral others of leſs Note. The only Conduit lately erected, now ſtanding, is a pretty little Structure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cow-lane</hi> and <hi>Snow-hill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since the Fire, other kind of Monuments have been rais'd, which add not a little to the Ornament of the City in general, and give peculiar Grace to the Places where they

with him was ſlain his Companion <hi>Gallus,</hi> at a Brook, which from him ſtill retains the name of <hi>Gall-brook,</hi> or <hi>Wall brook.</hi> Here <hi>Sigebert,</hi> third King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles,</hi> who began his Reign in the year of our Lord 596. and <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Reign in the year of our Lord 562. built the Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, as 'tis ſaid, where there had been a Temple of <hi>Diana.</hi> In the Reign of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Ironſide,</hi> this City was cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſieg'd by the <hi>Danes,</hi> but the Siege was ſoon rais'd by that valiant Prince King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund.</hi> About the year 1077. the Tower of <hi>London</hi> was built by K. <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, whoſe Succeſſour K. <hi>William Rufus</hi> built new walls about it. <hi>Anno</hi> 1135. in the Reign of K. <hi>Stephen</hi> the greateſt part of this City was conſumed by an accidental Fire.

Princes, and Nobles; but the grandeſt tranſaction that <hi>London</hi> can boaſt of, was that moſt ſtately Cavalcade which his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty made through it the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May An.</hi> 1660. when he returned from a long Exile to the Government of theſe Kingdoms: But the year 1666. was fatal to it by reaſon of that moſt dreadful fire that conſum'd all before it from <hi>Grace-Church</hi> Street to the Inner Temple, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying to the number, as is generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, of 13000 dwelling-houſes; and this preceded but the year before by the fierceſt Peſtilence that ever raged within the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of the Weekly Bills.

                     <p>In <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> in <hi>London</hi> three great Queens had their Sepulture, <hi>viz.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59749:149"/>
rendered her the awfull Miſtriſs of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; and by Trade and Induſtry, more then by Arms, kept up her Reputation for ſix hundred Years, when ranging the World to find out Countries unconquered, at laſt, from <hi>Gallia,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> under the leading of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> they entered <hi>Brittain</hi>; a Place then wild and rude, not knowing how to uſe the abundant plenty that Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, but refuſing all manner of Dainties, fed upon Roots of Herbs, and Barks of Trees; not Tilling any Ground, nor ſowing Corn, otherwiſe then ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on the untilled Surface of the Earth, and harrowing it over with Buſhes, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering their Cattle, Fowl, and Fiſh, of which they had ſtore, to continue uſeleſs, ſcarcely knowing any ſhoar but their own: Their Traffick, or Merchandiſe, for the moſt part amongſt themſelves, and that but mean; their chief Riches conſiſting (as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith) in Ivory-Boxes, Sheers, Onches, Bitts, Bridles, Chains of Iron, Wreaths, Glaſs coloured and the like, which they uſually delivered to each other as currant Coyn, for what their neceſſity required; but no ſooner had the <hi>Romans</hi> Civilized them, and inſtructed them in ſuch Arts as were moſt ſutable to their Capacities, and might ſtand them in greateſt ſtead, but

they began to Build Houſes (living before for the moſt in Huts, and going naked) and turned their Leather Boats into Tall Ships, Furrowing the Seas broad back, and diſcovering many Nations, to them, till then, unknown: So that by Traffick abroad, and Improvement at home, this Iſland grew famous, and ſpread it's Name to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Limit of the known Earth; ſo that being rightly termed the Store-Houſe of the Weſtern World, all the Neighbour-Nations Traded hither; ſo that thoſe Ports and Havens that were for a long time uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, were now filled with Ships of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: So that Silver and Gold was had in Abundance, and Coyns in imitation of thoſe the <hi>Romans</hi> Stamped with the Effigies of their Kings and Princes, which then were many, each County containing two or three, and they for the moſt part at variance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, which gave the <hi>Romans</hi> an opportunity to become Conquerors at an eaſier rate then otherwiſe they could.</p>

Forraign Nations again came in with the growths of their diſtant Soil, and ſo ſhe again became a Store-Houſe of Wealth; but eſpecially, when the ſole Monarchy was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59749:150"/>
reduced under <hi>Egbert</hi> the nineteenth King of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi>—under whom things Flouriſhed in a peaceful manner. But ſoon after, as if Fate had envied her happyneſs, the <hi>Danes</hi> (no leſs Bloody then the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> had been) made an Invaſion, tempted by the glittering Wealth of this fair Iſle, and never left off till they had graſped the Scepter, and reduced it to the obedience of <hi>Canute,</hi> under whom again ſhe Flouriſhed more then ever, and ſo continued to do (Trade increaſing and Arts duly improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) till the Conqueſt by the Norman-Duke, who for a while put a ſtop to her aſpiring, yet ſoon after gave incouragements to Induſtry by Grants, Charters, and large immunities; and from him, through the Reigns of ſeveral Peaceful Kings, the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of her Proſperity continued. Maritim affairs being proſecuted with ſuch Succeſs, that our Sailers began to Plough (till then) unknown Seas, and ſo Succesfully that they brought home great ſtore of Riches, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a way to thoſe that ſucceeded, to bring to perfection what at this day renders us happy in all temporal Bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far proceeded in general to ſhew what <hi>Brittain</hi> has been in her infancy, I ſhall now proceed to give the Reader an account of ſuch matters as have more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59749:151"/>
conduced to the proſperous and Flouriſhing Eſtate, wherein ſhe has for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years paſt remained, and does at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remain; which chiefly, next Heaven, we muſt attribute to her ſtore of Shipping, and Expertneſs in Navigation, ſo long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by her indulgent Kings, who in Peace and War have maintained the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of the Seas with Navies almoſt incredible; ſo that no Neighbour-Nation durſt diſturb our Traffick. Not to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on King <hi>Arthure,</hi> who found out the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Tracts, and paſſed on conquering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the utmoſt Orient, attended by a Squadron of three hundred Ships; nor <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> his Succeſſor, who Ploughed the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the deep with four hundred Sail, aſſerting his Soveraignty on the Main, to the admiration of the Neighbour-Nations. Nor was <hi>Canute</hi> the Puiſſant Daniſh King, then Reigning in <hi>Brittain,</hi> leſs formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on his watery Empire, being proud to have annexed to his Style Lord of the Ocean. Nor <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, leſs Potent in Naval forces, as appears by the many Ships of War he ſet forth to give Battle to his Brother in Law <hi>Godwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> who kept the Seas with a great number of Ships that ſpoiled and waſted the Coaſts of <hi>Brittain,</hi> as appears
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59749:151"/>
in the Reign of that King; tho indeed Heaven at that time prevented the Shedding of <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Blood, by ſending juſt as they were about to ingage a thick Fogg to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Face of the Deep, ſo that none could ſee a Ships length. By this means Seamen were brought up and fitted for Navigation, in ſuch ſort that in the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Norman-Conqueſt, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, Traffick abroad began to Flouriſh; nor was Manufacture, that Sinew of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſs regarded, People being incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged thereto, not only by the Princes themſelves with large Indulgencies, but by ſuch Wealthy Peers and others, as more ſought the good of the Publick-Weal than their own Private intereſt, which ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds in the end to their profit. For tho the Poor be never ſo induſtrious, yet wanting what to Trade with, their Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry will faint; but if they have imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to improve themſelves, Lands, and all things elſe will be improved, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to a higher Eſtimate, and the growth of <hi>England</hi> be made of value equal, if not exceeding any <hi>European</hi> Commodity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: So that this ſpot of an Iſland may, nay is, rightly termed the Store-Houſe of the World, who can ſubſiſt of her ſelf, but without whoſe Commodities few Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59749:152"/>
can maintain their Grandure.</p>
                     <p>But to the purpoſe: The Kings after the Conqueſt intending to make this their conſtant Seat, and making little eſteem of their Ancient Inheritance, the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy</hi> did not let to increaſe the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of this Kingdom, by granting large Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and immunities to thoſe that were Induſtrious, but eſpecially to the City of <hi>London,</hi> the chief reſidence of Royalty, named by many Kings, their Royal Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Nor was any thing thought too dear that might conduce to her Felicity, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Charter granted by King <hi>William</hi> the firſt, commonly called the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, which was in theſe words.</p>
                     <p>William <hi>King, greeteth</hi> William <hi>Biſhop, and</hi> Godfry Porters <hi>and all the Burgeſſes within</hi> London, French, <hi>and</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and I grant you, that I will that you maintain and injoy all your Laws, that you did in the days of King</hi> Edward (meaning the Confeſſor<hi>'s) and I will, that each Child be his Fathers Heir; and further, I will, that no man wrong you, and ſo God keep you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This free conceſſion gave ſcope to Trade, being much augmented by ſucceeding Kings, ſo that Tradſemen growing numerous, they ſo prevailed upon the Benign Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Reigning Princes, that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>Skinners</hi> had the Favour to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated in the firſt Year of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Anno</hi> 1327. and were made a Brotherhood in the eighteenth of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Reign.</p>
                     <p n="7">7.

                     <p n="8">8. The <hi>Haberdaſhers,</hi> or <hi>Hurrers,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo called were Incorporated a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood

                     <p n="11">11. The <hi>Vintners,</hi> formerly called <hi>Wine-Tunners</hi> were Incorporated in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, after he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered all <hi>Normandy,</hi> and by that means ingroſſed moſt of the French Vintage; But were not confirmed till the fifteenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth.</p>

                     <p>And thus in brief, have I declared the Original of the twelve Principal Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, upon whom the greateſt Streſs of Trade depends, and by whoſe prudent Management, and Induſtry, <hi>Brittain</hi> Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,

                     <p>All of theſe are Fraternities, and moſt of them Incorporated and have Charters of Priviledge, and large Immunities, tho in the days of our Forefathers, many of them were not known, not having brought their ſeveral Trades and Crafts to perfection, for many of which they were obliged to be beholden to Strangers; but the Natives of this Kingdom being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> naturally Ripe-wited and of a toward Genius, ſoon

by the aforeſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and by him indowed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny large Priviledges, tho at this day the Woollen Manufacture, being greatly increaſed, every one buyes his Commodity where he can find it beſt Cheap, ſo that there remaining no fixed Staple, theſe Merchants are not now of ſuch Repute as formerly.</p>

                     <p>THe Engliſh Merchants Trading by Navigation (who by viſiting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Countries, and Trafficking with the Inhabitants, bring in the ſtore of the whole World) are chiefly theſe, and their Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations moſtly as followeth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Merchants Adventurers, were Incorporated by King <hi>Edward</hi> the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59749:156"/>
fourth, from which time, they Traded with good Succeſs, until the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who, for a further incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to their Induſtry, not only confirmed them, but inlarged their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Merchants of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> or <hi>Muſcovia,</hi> who having improved their Trade and Commerce in that Remote Kingdom, to the Inriching their Native Land, were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated by King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, greatly incouraged by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and had their confirmation, with an Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Priviledges, from the ever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of Navigation the Bounteous Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Merchants of <hi>Elbing,</hi> were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and by her greatly incouraged; ſhe, like a prudent Queen, and Patroneſs of her Country, well knowing, that by Traffick, not only her Revenues would be improved, but likewiſe her People be Inriched, and ſhe rendered formidable to her aſpiring Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, tho ſince upon ſome diſtaſt, they have left Trading in that place, and Trade at <hi>Hambourg,</hi> and other free Cities and Ports.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Turky-Merchants, or Merchants of the <hi>Levant,</hi> were likewiſe Incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59749:156"/>
by the ſame Queen, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with a large addition, to their Priviledges by King <hi>James.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Merchants of <hi>Spain,</hi> or more properly, Spaniſh Merchants, or ſuch of our Nation as Traded to <hi>Spain,</hi> were Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Merchants were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated by Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Anno</hi> 1600. from which time they have continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their Trade in thoſe remote parts of the World, being now one of the Wealthieſt Corporations in <hi>Europe</hi>; their firſt riſe was by imploying a Joynt-ſtock to build Ships (of which now they have Store) and ſo themſelves in imitation of the <hi>Portegueſe,</hi> and other induſtrious People, Traded to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and ſoon found the advantage by bringing home the ſame Commodities which we before were behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Strangers for at ſecond Hand, and dear Rates.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign and in the beginning of King <hi>James</hi>'s, the <hi>Eaſtland, Greenland,</hi> and French Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, were ſetled in companies and Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Succeſs, Building many Ships, and continually imploying ſome thouſands of Perſons in the Management of their Affairs, Exporting Commodities of our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59749:157"/>
growth, and bring in thoſe of the growth of other Countries.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. There are likewiſe a Company of <hi>Virginia,</hi> or <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Merchants, whoſe Induſtry has much improved our Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> and advance the King's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in his Cuſtoms twenty thouſand pound <hi>per Annum</hi>; which Trade into thoſe parts has, and dayly will increaſe and turn to the Advantage of our Nation, and be a means of making further Diſcoveries in thoſe vaſt Seas, in which lie hid paſt doubt many fair Iſlands, if not Continents as Rich as thoſe which yield the <hi>Spaniard</hi> yearly ſo many Millions of Ducates in Gold Ore, and Bars of Silver. Theſe and other Traders in remote parts make <hi>England</hi> Flouriſh, and ſtand the envy of her Neighbour Nations. There is likewiſe the <hi>Guinnie</hi> and <hi>Barbary</hi> Companies, both Rich in Shipping and Merchandiſe, having ſince their Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gotten great Eſteem, and much improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Navigation. And now, having given an account of the Conſtitution and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe in general that drive on the Trade, and Commerce both by Land and Sea, before I Lanch into the Ocean, to take a view of other Countries, or to deſcribe their Trade and Traffick I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Publick view the Commodities of

                        <hi>ENgland,</hi> the Head of the Brittiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, is in every Place ſo admirable abounding with plenty, that to deſcribe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59749:158"/>
her in every part of her Trade and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Situation, would exact a large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum. Therefore I ſhall only in brief expoſe to view what is moſt material as to my purpoſe: And firſt, I ſhall begin with <hi>Cornwell,</hi> as being the remoteſt of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Counties, or Provinces; tho it be in it ſelf, in many places, to appearance a Barren and Mountainous Country, yet does it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Rich Mines of Tinn, which brought to perfection, is of great eſteem in all Countries. With it there is alſo digged Gold and Silver, tho hardly worth refining, the Earth not having heat enough to bring it to perfection; there is found likewiſe a Stone Tranſparent, naturally formed in Angles and Points like a Diamond, which was it not ſo common, might merit high eſteem. On that Coaſt, Herrings and Pilch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards are taken in great number, which not only ſuſtain the Inhabitants, but being dryed prove good Merchandiſe in <hi>Spain, France, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> The Sea Coaſt is adorned with many Towns, of which <hi>Falmouth</hi> is chief, being capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many Veſſels; nor is St. <hi>Ives</hi> of leſs note, yielding great ſtore of Fiſh, not reckoned leſs yearly then four or five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Hogsheads of Pilchards, and five hundred Barrels of Herrings, beſides ſome
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59749:158"/>
Tuns of Congerdouſt, &amp; great ſtore of Ray-Fiſh, which imploys ſome hundreds of the Inhabitants, and inables them to provide plentifully for their Families, and reſerve, as the old ſaying is, a Penny againſt a rainy day.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Commodities, <hi>viz.</hi> Pilchards, are vended by the Hogshead, four of them making a Tun, as likewiſe by the thouſand, they allowing twelve hundred ſmall Tale to the thouſand, and a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of Herrings, commonly thirty Gallons, is ſold to the Merchants for eighteen Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, twenty Shillings, or according as the fiſhing Seaſon is propitious; Congerdouſt is ſold by the Kintale, <hi>viz.</hi> one hundred and twelve pound to the Kintale; Ray-fiſh are for the moſt part ſold freſh, and that by the Dozen, at two Shillings four Pence, two Shillings ſix Pence, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three Shillings <hi>per</hi> Dozen, but their Dozens are extraordinary large, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſometimes ſixty to the Dozen, but ſometimes leſs, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Place; their Weight is one hundred and twelve pound according to the Stander, their Yard and Ell equal to thoſe of <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their Buſhel for Grain and Salt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contains twenty eight Gallons Water
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59749:159"/>
Meaſure, and ſo proportionable the greater or the leſſer Meaſures; but their Buſhel uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Publick Markets for Corns is but twenty Gallons, their Gallon agreeing with the <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Gallon. The Bakers in thoſe parts are but few, and the moſt thing they ſtand in need of is Salt, Ten thouſand Buſhel being yearly ſpent in Curing their Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>The manner of taking Pilchards and Herrings is with Nets, but the Ray-Fiſh with Hooks; the firſt being Fiſhed for from the firſt of <hi>July</hi> till the firſt of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>; the ſecond, from <hi>Michalemaſs</hi> till <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs</hi>; and the third and laſt, only in the Prime of Summer; ſixty Boats, and about four hundred men being imployed therein.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59749:174"/>
twenty ſix Yards. All ſorts of Cloaths that are ſix quarters and a half wide, ought to weigh ſixty pound, and be twenty four and twenty ſix Yards in length; broad and narrow <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> of four quarters wide, weigh thirty pound, and in length are twenty four, and twenty five Yards. Broad-Cloath of <hi>Taunton, Dunſtable,</hi> and <hi>Bridg-Water</hi> of ſeven quarters, weigh thirty pound the Cloath, and in Meaſure are twelve, and thirteen Yards. <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Kerſies, and Doſſens of four quarters, weigh thirteen pounds, in Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure twelve, and thirteen Yards. Chequer Kerſies, Grays, Striped and Plain of four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are in Weight twenty four pound, in Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſeventeen, and eighteen Yards. Ordinary Peniſtons or Forreſts of three quarters and a half, in Weight twenty eight pound, in Meaſure twelve and thirteen Yards. Sort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peniſton of ſix quarters and a half are pounds thirty five, Yards thirteen and fourteen. Waſhers of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and others the Cloaths are ſeventeen pounds in Weight, in Meaſure ſeventeen and eighteen Yards. This Cuſtom of aſſizing Cloaths at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Weight was firſt impoſed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting defrauds in making ſlight ſleaſy, or imperfect Cloaths, and if any of the aforeſaid Cloaths prove otherwiſe then is ſpecifyed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59749:174"/>
the maker, or ſeller, ought to allow accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the want, either in Width, Length, or Weight, and for ſo refuſing, may be ſued for a defraud.</p>
                     <p>To bring this to perfection the Weight of Wool is thus, the Sack of Wool doth contain three hundred ſixty four pounds, the Tod twenty eight pound, thirteen Tods being accounted to a Sack; every Tod being four Nales, and every Nail, ſeven pound: The Sack of Wool is imputed to finiſh four Standard Cloaths, of twenty four Yards each in length, &amp; ſix Yards &amp; half quar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter wide, of ſixty pound Weight, commonly called Sorting Cloaths. In the Weight it is to be noted whether the Cloaths are thick Mill'd, well ſcoured, and throughly dryed, that the ſame be Meaſured by the Yard, and that an Inch be allowed to every Yard: And thus much for Woollen Manufacture.</p>
                     <p>And now I am entering on Ship-Board, to view the World, and to paſs the unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomed Paths of the Deep.

The Weigh either of Corn or Salt is forty ſix Buſhels; and the Laſt is eighty Buſhels. Note in Salt Water Meaſure is allowed, <hi>viz.</hi> five Pecks to the Buſhel. Liquid Meaſures thus, the Ale Firkin to contain eight Gallons, Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derkin ſixteen, and the Barrel thirty two.

A Runlet of Oyl ought to be eight Gallons and a half, a Hogs-Head ſixty three, a Pipe one hundred twenty ſix, and the Tun one hundred fifty two; tho as to Oyl in the Meaſure thereof, the Cuſtom of <hi>London</hi> differs from the Statute, allowing but ſeven pound to each Gallon, and by that means the Tun is reduced to one hundred thirty ſix, and ſo at this day 'tis ſold; and thus far having proceeded to give thoſe that are deſirous to Trade, or Traffick,

The main entrance out of <hi>Virginia</hi> into the Sea, is about 10 Leagues; the Country is full of Navigable Rivers, ſtored with Fiſh, and ſome of them abounding with Oyſters, Crabs, and Sturgeon, many of the Rivers being 7, 8, 9, or 10 Miles over, running 140 and 150 Miles up in the Country, ſo that Ships Anchor with great Security, no Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted but with <hi>England.</hi> So that as ſoon as any Veſſel arrives, the Maſter, or Captain, reſorts to the Governour, to give him an account from whence he came, his Reſidence being for the moſt part at <hi>Jame</hi>'s City lying 40 Miles up <hi>Jame</hi>'s Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and round about the Engliſh Colony, the <hi>Indians</hi> Inhabit, whoſe Treacheries prove too often fatal to our Country-men, as the ſeveral Maſſacrees they have made can te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. Their Courts of Judicature chiefly conſiſt of 4 quarterly Courts, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and his Council being Judges, to try and determine, as well in matters Criminal, as Suits between man and man, and every year once an Aſſembly meet in imitation of our Parliament, to ſettle weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Affairs.

                     <p>The greateſt abuſe that Merchants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is the Packing of Tobacco; which looſe Packed, or either too dry or wet put up, often deceives their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; therefore the only way to diſcover ſuch Frauds, is by weighing it.

                        <hi>Peru</hi> is for Gold, the richeſt Province of <hi>America</hi>: The Mines being more plentiful then Mines of Lead and Iron in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Riches thereof may be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured by this: When <hi>Piſcario</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain ſubdued it, and took the King Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, he propoſed his Ranſom, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the treacherous <hi>Spaniard</hi> upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Promiſe for his Life and Liberty, as much refined Gold and Silver as amounted to ten Millions, but perfidious as he was, when he had Poſſeſſion of the Treaſure not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Oath, he ſlew him. The chief City is St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s, inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; the Soyl brings forth all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Fruits, as likewiſe ſtore of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco; but one thing is more admirable, on the Banks of the River <hi>Riolaplata</hi> grow Figtrees, one ſide of which bear Figs in Winter, and the other in Summer, and this River is 130. miles over, and 2000. in length; and in it are many Iſlands.</p>

                     <p>The manner of getting the Gold in theſe remote Parts of the World, are by Mining, or Waſhing and Fiſhing; As thus, they firſt ſearch the ground, and finding it ſtockt with Ore, they dig into the Mountains, and ſtill as they go under-prop, or Arch, ſo that a Mine ſometimes is a Furlong under ground; their Earth they waſh through Sieves, and the Mold ſeparated, the Gold appears. Silver run in Veins or Sprigs, and therefore is got more eaſily. As for the Fiſhing for Gold, it is thus: They turn the Courſe of ſmall Rivers or Brooks, at the bottom of the Golden Mountains; or with ſuch things as take up Ballaſt in the Thames, drag up the Sand, and then ſift it. The Gold which is found in the Rivers is waſhed from the Mountains, by the fierce Rains which in thoſe parts are frequent.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59749:194"/>
the moſt part Breeders of Cattle, and Hunters of Wild-Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>The Commodities of theſe Countries, are Corn, Sugar, Cattle, Rice, Fruits, Gold Sands, and Ingots; which they expoſe to Sail for Cloath, Callicoes, Copper, Baſons, Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, Guns, Shot, Glaſs, Beads, and the like; but Principally Salt, of which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity that Country is deficient; but the chief <hi>Maritim</hi> parts are <hi>Guinny,</hi> and <hi>Benin,</hi> firſt diſcovered by the Portugals, and for the abundance of Gold the Country af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foards called the Golden Coaſt; the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of which ſpreading wide in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Engliſh ſoon found it out, and after them the <hi>Dutch</hi>: and now the <hi>French</hi> have ſome Trade there. The manner of Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus: The Ships coming into the Road caſt Anchor, and the Merchants or Factors going on Shoar, declare what Wares they have on Board, to the Perſons called Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, or Brokers, which live in little Huts along the Coaſt, and when the <hi>Moors</hi> come down with their Gold, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them that ſuch and ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are to be had, upon which taking Boat together they come on Board, and laying by ſuch things as they like, propoſe what Gold they will give for them, which if accepted the Bargain is made; and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59749:194"/>
they return with their Goods on Shoar.</p>
                     <p>The Cuſtoms are various. Particular Officers, being ſet in every Port, to take an Account of what is bought and ſold; and every one that comes to buy, tho he buy nothing, muſt pay a ſmall Stipend for his Perſon; upon his returning from on Shipboard, and to prevent defraud, there is ſtill a Son, Brother, or Kinſman of the Kings, to whom the Port belongeth, to ſee the Toll be duly taken; and he that buyes Commodities under the value of 2 Ounces of Gold, makes his price for Cuſtoms as he can, but he that buy's above which they call a Benda, pays to the Value of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in Gold for every Benda.</p>
                     <p>As for Coyns they have none, the Trade among themſelves being for Gold-Sands, or Ingot by Weight, the fineneſs of which they try with Artificial Needles, in number 24; in ſome Places they melt their Gold, and draw it into Wire, and ſo cut into ſmall pieces, the better to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it as occaſion requires, and in other places they have pieces of Iron, which goes Currant inſtead of Mony.</p>
                     <p>Their Weights conſiſt of Copper, the greateſt of which is a Benda, containing 2 Ounces Troy, a Benda offa, or half a Benda. The Aſſeva which is two Peſoes
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59749:195"/>
and a half, the Egebba, or 2 Peſos which is half an Ounce, and ſo leſſer tell they come to Drams, and Scruples of Troy Weight, but their pound is found the ¾ part of an Ounce heavier than ours.</p>
                     <p>Their Meaſures for Cloath is a Jactam, accounted 12 Foot Engliſh, which they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into two parts; as for their Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Cloath, they cut it into long Slips, and make Girdles of it.</p>
                     <p>Formerly the Trade in thoſe parts was very advantagious, but of late (one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtriving to outvye each other) have given them an inſight into the true value of Gold, and of ſuch Commodities as they receive for it.</p>
                     <p>The Sugar Trade which is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is ingroſſed by the <hi>Portugals</hi> at a certain Annual rate, and no other Nation ſuffered to deal therein, the Sugar made there being Tranſported to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> is from thence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percſd throughout <hi>Europe.</hi> And thus much for <hi>Negrita,</hi> and the <hi>Guinny</hi> Trade.</p>

or Vice-King. The Commodities Traded for by the <hi>Europian</hi> Merchants, are Flax, Rice, Balſoms, Puls, Fruits, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, Sugars, Hemp, and the like; which according to the overflowing of <hi>Nilus</hi> the Soil yields in plenty, or Scarcity, ſo that when they have a plentiful Year; they make a Feaſt to <hi>Nilus,</hi> or the River God; as they Term him, and exceedingly Rejoyce thereto.</p>
                     <p>The yearly Revenue of this Kingdom, accrueing by Cuſtoms, and other ways a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 3 Millions of Sheraffes, each valued at 8 Shillings Sterling, one Million of which is ſent to the grand Signeur, one for maintaining the forces of the Kingdom, and the other to enable the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> to keep his Court.</p>
                     <p>The Cuſtoms are either payed in Species or compounded for at 10 <hi>per cent.</hi> only Money entred pays but one and a half <hi>per cent.</hi> but outward all Commodities pay 11 <hi>per cent.</hi> which is accounted the <hi>Soldan</hi>'s Cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>The Cuſtoms of <hi>Alexandria</hi> are farmed by the <hi>Jews</hi> at 20000 Medins <hi>per diem,</hi> which according to computation, amounts to 55000 pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> Sterling.</p>
                     <p>Their Weights and Meaſures, are the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>

                     <p>Their Accounts are variouſly kept, ſome in one ſort of Coyn, and ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The chief Trade driven here by the <hi>European</hi> Chriſtians, is by the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi>; the Engliſh having of late declined it, as having the growth of the Country or the ſame Commodities, at cheaper Rates in <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Aleppo.</hi> And thus much for the Continent of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

into 480 Grains, each Ounce of Silver fine being according accounted worth 5 Shillings 2 pence of our money, and ſo more or leſs according to the addition or diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of allay.

Gold and one of Silver, the third 22 Carots of Gold and 2 of Silver, and ſo one Carot worſe till there remains but one Carot of fine Gold in Mixture, with 23 Carots of Silver.

And by this means you may know the fineneſs of any Ingot or Piece of Gold or Silver; as thus, touch the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got or Piece of Gold or Silver upon your Touch-Stone, and by it the Needle you think is neareſt it in fineneſs; and if that ſuit not with it, try another till it ſuits with it, which when wet, will appear, and ſo by the mark of your Needle, you may be aſſured of the fineneſs of the Silver or Gold ſo touched, which is a better, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſafer, and ſurer way then to try it by Fire. And thus much for Gold and Silver, as to their Tryal of fineneſs.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LV. A Treatiſe of Precious-Stones, how to know them and their true value, <hi>viz.</hi> Diamonds, Rubies, Saphyrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo the goodneſs and worth of Pearles in General.</head>
                     <p>THe Weight uſual in <hi>India</hi> for Diamonds and Precious Stones, were brought thither by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> called the Mange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar or Fanan, which differs not much from the Carot, whereof 150 Carots make an Ounce Troy; and is divided into 64.33.16.8.4.2.1. ½ ¼ ⅛ 1/16 Parts. The Mangelue or Mangear is near or altogether 5 Grains Weight, or 2 Tars ⅔ Accounted the ⅔ of 1 Carot, ſo that 4 Grains and 4 Tars weigh a Fanan, the Fanan being ſomewhat above 2 of our Carots, for 11 ¼ Fanans are 1 Mittigal. and 6 Mittiglas and ½ make the Ounce Troy; this Fanan in many parts of <hi>India</hi> goes currant for a Coyn, being E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually valued with a Spaniſh Ryal; and thus having laid down the proportion of the Weights, I ſhall firſt begin with the Dimonds, the chief of Precious Stones,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59749:237"/>
then to know a good and true Diamond take this rule. A good and right Diamond is faſt and no ways porous, ſo that it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Fire, and after ſeveral hours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance therein, come out bright as at firſt; and in choice of ſuch a one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it muſt be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Brown, Yellowiſh, Blewiſh, nor a Dulliſh-Black, but of a good Water-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaline; not wanting any corner when Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed on a Mill, nor be too thick nor too thinn, but ſo as it may be ſet firm, and to good advantage in a Ring, or Collet without being upholden by Velvet, and ſuch a Diamond weighing 1 Carot is worth 35 pounds Sterling or upwards.</p>
                     <p>Note when you have found out the true value of a perfect Diamond or Diamonds, this Rule is to be obſerved. Suppoſe a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond weighing a Carot Weight be worth 40 Ducats more or leſs, then the 4th. part being ten Ducats is the price of a Diamond weighing half a Carot, ſo the Diamond weighing a Carot is worth but the 4th. part of the value of one weighing 2 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots, <hi>viz.</hi> 40 Ducats, and that weighing 2 Carots worth 160 Ducats; and ſo if there be over Weight by Grains, you muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all into Grains, and then a Diamond weighing 3 Grains is worth but the 4th. part of that weighing 6. And this is a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59749:237"/>
Rule, not only for Diamonds but all manner of precious Stones, according to Equality in goodneſs, as for Example a thick Table Diamond of the goodneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid weighing 1 Grain is worth 1 pound 17 Shillings 6 pence, weighing 2 Grains is worth 7 pound 10 Shillings, weighing 3 Grains is worth 16 pound 17 Shillings 6 pence, weighing 1 Carot is worth 30 pound, and ſo proportionably to 8 Carots, yet there are ſome Diamonds imperfect, and not of any Extraordinary value, which are called Brut Diamonds, Naifs, Rocks, and flat-Stones, which are bought and ſold at uncertain rates.</p>
                     <p>The Ruby is found in <hi>Zeilam</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> and called commonly the Carbuncle, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Fire to know its perfection, the which if it abide and come out Burning like a Cole and of a high Colour, it is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted perfect; a Stone of which perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on weighing but one Carot or ½, a Fanan is valued at 30 Fanans in <hi>Callicut,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in value as the Dimonds according to their Weight; there is another ſort on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called a Ruby, found in a River in the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu</hi>; but it will not indure the Fire, but looſeth it's Colour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when put to the Tryal; there are likewiſe ſeveral ſorts of Rubies as the Carbuncle, Ballas,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59749:238"/>
Spinal, Garnat, and Rubas; but this Ruby of <hi>Pegu</hi> is accounted the next in value to the Carbuncle, and a Ruby ſquare table-wiſe, perfect, and of high Colour of 16.18.20. or 24. Carots in Colour, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fanan is worth ſometimes in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>'s, 100. Ducats, and in <hi>England</hi> weighing 11 ½ Carots, and of 20 Carots in Colour perfect and without Blemiſh, is worth 350 pound Sterling or rather more.</p>
                     <p>Saphyrs are found in <hi>Zeilam, Calucut, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinger, Canoner,</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> and thoſe are accounted beſt that are of a pure Azure or Sky-Colour, and in that hardneſs excelleth all other Stones the Diamond excepted, and according to their Colour are held in Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; as for example, Saphyr weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Carot is worth 2 Fanans, one weighing 2 Carots is worth 5 Fanans, one weighing 3 worth 10 Fanans, and one weighing 4 Carots worth 15 Fanans, and ſo Proportionably each Fanan being Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted 2 Carots; after this manner Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoiſe, Topaze, Berrils, Cryſolites, Jacynths, Amathiſts, and other precious Stones are known and valued every one according to their goodneſs and Weight; as for Pearls, how they are taken, I have before ſet down, and now I ſhall as far as is neceſſary make a report of their true value
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59749:238"/>
according as they are in goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Rule to value Oriental Pearls, from a Grain in Weight to what bigneſs any will afford, is by the Colour, Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pear-Faſhion, or Oval; and that is in all parts perfect, as to Water and Gloſs, without Knobs, Specks, Yellowneſs or other imperfections, and a Pearl of this perfection weighing a Carot is worth a Ducat in <hi>India.</hi> But before I proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to their value it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to relate how they are ſold, by thoſe that have the diſpoſing of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> ſell them by Sieves of Latten full of holes in number 12, one bigger then the other as to their holes, and according to the largeneſs or ſmallneſs, the price is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated; for thoſe of the 10, 11, and 12 Sieve are ſeldom capable to be holed, and therefore are called Seed-Pearls; moſt fit for Apothecaries, to be uſed by them in their Phyſical Preparations; but the others for the uſe of Ladies, and others to adorn themſelves withal; and for the price of all large Pearls, they are valued as is ſaid by Weight and fairneſs, as Diamonds and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precious Stones, tho ſeldom before they be holed for fear of their breaking in the holing; as thus, a Pearl of one Grain is worth 7 pence, of 2 Grains 2 Shillings
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59749:239"/>
6 pence, of 3 Grains 5 Shillings 7 pence, of 1 Carot 10 Shillings, and ſo in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to thoſe of greater Weight, as for Seed-Pearls, the ſmalleſt of which are Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted 4500. to the Ounce, and the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt 400 or 450 to the Ounce, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly divided into 6 parts, the Prizes are theſe: The 6th. or ſmalleſt ſort 4500 are commonly ſold for 2 pound 4 Shillings the Ounce, the 5th. ſort are ſold for 1 pound 6 Shillings the Ounce, the 4th. ſort at 10 Shillings the Ounce, the third ſort at 18 Shillings the Ounce, the ſecond at 1 pound 6 Shillings, and the firſt at 1 pound 15 Shillings. But note that the firſt is termed the ſixth ſort, and ſo Conſequently the ſixth the firſt; the Rag Pearls which are ſold likewiſe by the Ounce, according to their bigneſs are divided into thirds, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, and firſts, an Ounce of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 350 Pearls, is Accounted worth 1 pound 18 Shillings, an Ounce containing 250 Pearls is Accounted worth 3 pounds, an Ounce of 150 worth 4 pounds, and ſo according to their leſſer quantity or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in making the Ounce, all ſorts of half round Pearls of pure Water, and Gloſs are Accounted worth a round Pearl of half the Weight. And thus much for Gold, Silver, precious Stones, and Oriential
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59749:239"/>
Pearls; with which I ſhall return to <hi>Europe,</hi> as the common Receptacle of thoſe rich Commodities, which were of little value to the <hi>Indians,</hi> before the <hi>European</hi> Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators ſet Prizes thereon, and by that means taught the Natives how to Eſteem them; for in the firſt Diſcovery of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> they bought them for Beads of Glaſs, and ſuch like Trifles, but now they are not purchaſed; but at Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary rates.</p>

                     <p>And hither the Engliſh bring Bays, Cloath, Lead, Tinn, Herrings, Pilchards, <hi>Newland</hi>-Fiſh, <hi>Affrican</hi> Hides, Wax, Calves-Skins, Salmond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in Exchange receive Oyls, Wines, Verdigreeſe, Paper, Linnen, and other Manufactures, &amp; at this Port they have free Licence to Tranſport Spaniſh Ryals of 8/8

Commodities which drew moſt of the Trading Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> to Trade thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, exhauſting the Trade of <hi>Bruges</hi> where the Engliſh Merchants Adventurers before reſided; the third and laſt cauſe was the Wars between <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the <hi>French,</hi> which obliged the Nobility, and Gentry for ſafety to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their Families thither, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being taken with the pleaſantneſs of the place would not remove, but Built them ſtately Houſes, and made that City for the moſt part the Place of their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of the decay of Trade in the City of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> was the Wars with <hi>Spain,</hi> in which Merchants were Pillaged, their Ships taken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Abridgement of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and the Trade which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> found in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home in their own Bottoms, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were obliged to the <hi>Portugals</hi> for; but as it is at this Day, a pretty Trade is driven in the City, moſt of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries bringing in their Growth and Manufacture.</p>
                     <p>The Commodities found in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> are Wines, Silks, Arras-Hangings, Spices, Drugs, Fruit, ſtore of Corn, Woollen Cloath, ſome Oyl, and the like; brought out of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59749:265"/>
its Neighbourhood, and the Adjacent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
                     <p>The Accounts of <hi>Antwerp</hi> are kept in Livers, Solds, and Deniers, which they reckon Pounds, Shillings, Pence, 12 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers making a Sold, and 20 Solds a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or pound Flemiſh, tho worth no more then 12 Shillings Sterling, or as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it 240 Groſſes, 12 Groſſes being a Sold, and according to theſe Values on Coyn they make their Exchanges. The other currant Coyns are Doits, 4 of which make a Stiver, and 10 Stivers make 1 Shilling Sterling. 2 Blanks make a Stiver, and half 6 Stivers make the Flemiſh Shilling, 28 Stivers make a Guilder, which is 3 Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings 4 pence Flemiſh, ſo that 100 pound Flemiſh is found to make but 50 pound Engliſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>The Weight is the pound of 16 Ounces, 100 of which pounds make their Quintar, and the Quintar found to be 104 pound Engliſh. So that from this allowance or over Weight, many imagine that the Tret of <hi>London</hi> had its Original.</p>
                     <p>The Meaſure of length is the Ell, 100 of which are found to make 60 <hi>London</hi> Ells in the Meaſure of Linnen Cloath. They have likewiſe an Ell for Meaſuring of Silk, which is 1 ½ in the 100 leſs then the Cloath Ell.</p>

                     <p>The Exchanges are very great, by Reaſon moſt of the Bills of <hi>Spain</hi> are drawn upon the Merchants and Traders of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> for the disburſement of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for the maintainance of the Army, that is for the moſt part kept on Foot in the Provinces.</p>

all of its own Growth and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture.</p>
                     <p>The Cities and Towns of the Empire, may by good Right be divided into 3 parts, as firſt the Hanſ-Towns, which enjoy large Privileges and Immunities, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be about 70, which for the moſt par are accommodated with Navigable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and abound in rich Manufactures. Secondly thoſe called the Imperial Cities, which are imputed free Cities, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their great Priviledges, above the reſt in Coyning money, barring any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Subjection unleſs to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, whom they only do acknowledge for their Protector, and in lieu of it pay an annual Tribute, being 60 odd in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And thirdly thoſe that are under the Subjection of the Electoral Princes, which are commonly called Principalities.</p>
                     <p>The Rivers by which theſe Towns for the moſt part are inriched are 4, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Danube</hi> which running 1500 Miles receives about 58 Navigable Rivers, and at laſt diſimbogues it ſelf into the <hi>Euzine</hi> or Black-Sea. The River <hi>Rhine</hi> which after paſſing through <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Belgia</hi> for 800 Miles falls into the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, the River <hi>Albis</hi> which is large and Navigable for near 400 Miles, and the River <hi>Odera,</hi> which paſſing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59749:269"/>
300 Miles through the Country falleth into the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea.</p>
                     <p>There are likewiſe ſeveral other Rivers of note, that greatly contribute to the Fertilizing the Country, but theſe being the chief, I ſhall paſs over the reſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Deſcription of ſome Cities require the mentioning of them.</p>

who find great incouragement, and by their Labour is the common Stock improved; tho ſince its falling into the Hands of the <hi>French</hi> King, they have not proceeded with ſuch Alacrity as formerly, by Reaſon of the little aſſurance they have of keeping what they acquire by their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                     <p>The Commodities Traded for hither are Linnen Cloath, Iron, Diaper, Rheniſh Wine, Copper, Wax, and Hemp, for which they receive out of <hi>England</hi> Tinn, Lead, and Woollen Cloath; out of <hi>Spain</hi> Fruits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wines, Oyls, Salt, and Wool; and out of <hi>Italy</hi> Silks, both Raw and wrought.</p>

The Trade at preſent is very conſiderable, by Reaſon of the reſidence of our Merchants there, and the Factories held in other parts, it being the Key as it were of that part of <hi>Germany,</hi> whither the Inland Towns bring their Commodities to vend, as Quick-Silver, Stuffs, Silks, Cloath, Wine, Wax, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, Corn, and the like; moſt <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Commodities are found here, and great quantities of the Growth of <hi>Spain,</hi> and here the Engliſh vend Cloath, Iron, Tinn, Lead, Drugs, Spices, and the like,

The Towns by Reaſon of the coldneſs of the Clime and Dampneſs cauſed by the Sea are but few, the chief being <hi>Nidroſia</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> once a famous Mart, but now reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to nothing in reſpect of Trade, the Trade that it had having paſſed through ſeveral Cities, is at laſt ſetled in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and what Trade does remain is from the Ships that paſs this way to <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Weight moſt in uſe is the pound, 100 of which renders 92 <hi>London</hi> Averdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pois Weight, tho of late they have got a Cuſtom to Weigh in a String, which is
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59749:274"/>
very uncertain, rendering ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs. Their Meaſure of Length and Concave Meaſures, the latter of which is for the moſt part uſed in Meaſuring of Salt, are agreeable to our Yard and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel.</p>
                     <p>The Commodities vended here are Bays, Says, Linnen, Wine, Spices, Sugars, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, Lead, Tinn, Iron, and ſuch like.

                     <p>The Weight moſt in uſe is the Pood, by which all fine Goods are weighed, as Silk, Beavor, Wool, and the like; but for Groſs Goods they have a Weight cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Berzovet accounted 10 Poods or the Ruſs Ship-pound computed to be 360 pound Averdupois, ſo that all Goods bought by

                        <hi>Cracovia</hi> is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> Situate on the Banks of the River <hi>Viſtula,</hi> which is Navigable for near 400 Miles, being as it were incompaſſed with diſtant Mountains, and fortifyed with ſtrong Walls and fair Buildings; being the Seat of the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> and is found to produce the Commodities of the whole Kingdom, as Tar, Roſin, Pitch, Hemp,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59749:278"/>
Wax, Honey, Barly, Oats, Amber, Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and Hides, which Commodities are ſent up the River; and diſtributed to ſuch Merchants as come to Trade for the Growth of the Kingdom. There are likewiſe found Furs of divers ſorts, ſome Minerals, and the like; for which the Inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Commodities of divers Nations which are brought both by Land and Sea.</p>
                     <p>The Coyns of this City, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Kingdom, are the Ducat of Gold called the <hi>Polander</hi>; which is accounted 70 Poliſh Groſs.

                     <p>The Weights are the Pound and Stone, 40 pound making the Stone, and 40 of thoſe Stones make the Ship-pound, which is 400 pound, and 100 pound of <hi>London</hi> is found to make 120 of <hi>Elbin.</hi> Their Laſt of Wheat is reckoned to weigh 5200 pound.

                     <p>This City is the common Mart for all Commodities of the Empire, receiving &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing inwards and outwards the growth of each Province: And hither the Merchants of <hi>London</hi> firſt began to Trade <hi>Anno</hi> 1586, and in a ſhort time found ſuch incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> ſending an Ambaſſador to mediate on their behalf; that they ſoon obtained to be incorporated by the ſaid Queen, and growing in Trade, were confirmed by King <hi>James,</hi> with an Augmentation of their Priviledges, and then by King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, under the Title of the Merchants of <hi>England,</hi> Trading in the <hi>Levant</hi> Seas, or <hi>Levant</hi> Merchants, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe account a Leiger Ambaſſador re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to protect the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Factories, and take care that right be done them, who before his departure from <hi>England,</hi> is always approved of by his Majeſty, but himſelf and retinue have their charges defrayed by the Company, which Honourable truſt now remains in the right Honourable the Lord <hi>Shandois,</hi> they have likewiſe ſeveral Conſuls to protect their Factories throughout the Empire, who keep Janizaries, Druggermen or Interpreters, Secretaries, and Miniſters,

with other the like neceſſary attendants in Sallary, being permitted free exerciſe of Religion: And hither it is at preſent that the Engliſh are found the Principal Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, tho the <hi>Venetians, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> by ſundry devices have indeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate themſelves, into the good opinions of the Turkiſh Merchants; who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted 4 kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the Native <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and laſtly the <hi>Jews.</hi> The chief Commodities found here are Grograms, Mohairs, Chamlets, <hi>Perſian</hi>-Silk, wrought and unwrought Gold, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, Anniſeeds, Cumminſeeds, Cottons, Galls, Pepper, Jndico, Nutmegs, Cinamon, Mace, and Drugs, theſe laſt being the Commodities of the <hi>Eaſt-India's,</hi> are brought cheaper and better from thence, therefore not Traded for by the Engliſh at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> but rather carryed by them thither, and exchanged for the Growth of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as likewiſe Lead, Tinn, Cloath, Furs, as Martins, Cony-Skins, Sables, Titchues, and the like; at the change of every Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, the Company make a preſent to the Grand-Signeour, which is levyed by the Company themſelves by way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the like are the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> obliged to do upon ſome occaſion, and for the ſupport of their Factories and Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors.</p>

                     <p>The Weights are the Grain, 4 of which make a Quillat, a Dram which is 16 Grains of which all greater Weights are compoſed by Multiplication: as a Yurſdrome is 100 Drams, and found to be 1 pound Sotile of <hi>Venice,</hi> or 72 Mittigals: a Lodero is 176 Drams, or 19 ½ Ounces Averdupois: an Oake is 400<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Drams accounted 2 pound 11 ½ Ounces: 100 Lodero's are accounted 24 Oaks; and compoſe the Quintar of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> which has been found to render be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 118 and 120 pound Engliſh Suttle.

A Batman is 6 Oaks, or 16 ⅓ pound Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, by which all Silks are bought, and according to theſe all other Weights of the Empire are regulated.</p>
                     <p>The Meaſures of Length are the Pico's, which are 3. The firſt for Cloath which is accounted 26 ½ Inches.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond for Grograms, Chamlet, and ſuch like, containing 24 Inches, ſo that 24 of theſe Pico's are found to make 16 Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Yards. The third is the Linnen Pico, which is the former doubled. To none of theſe is any advantage allowed as in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                     <p>The Concave Meaſure is called the Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, by which for the moſt part Corn is Meaſured, 8 ⅔ of which are obſerved to make the <hi>London</hi> Quarter, Wines, Oyls, and almoſt all Liquids are ſold by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, weighing 8 Oaks, and is about ⅔ of an Engliſh Gallon, as indeed moſt Commodities are ſold by Weight.</p>

there is by agreement payed 1 ½ <hi>per cent.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all pondrous Commodities, and 1 up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Meaſurable Commodities, which is to be defrayed between the buyer and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, but if a <hi>Turk</hi> be one, his part is remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and this is levyed for the Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Hoſpital founded by <hi>Sultan Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> which duties are farmed by an Emine or Farmer call'd the Grand-Seigenors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and are moſt commonly payed the one half in Aſpers, of 80 Aſpers to the Dollar, and the other in Sultanies of Gold, or otherwiſe as the Merchants and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomer can agree.

                     <p>THe Iſlands in theſe Seas are many, therefore I ſhall only name thoſe of little note and inſiſt upon the chief.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then there is found the Iſland of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedos,</hi> abounding with Wines.</p>
                     <p>The Iſle of <hi>Samothracia,</hi> commodious for the Harbouring Ships.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lemnos</hi> from whence comes that Antidote, called <hi>Terra Sigilata,</hi> or <hi>Terra Lemnos,</hi> then <hi>Scio</hi> or <hi>Chios,</hi> abounding in Trees, from which they diſtill Maſtick, which Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Grand Signeour claims as his right.</p>
                     <p>Next the famous Iſland of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> which by Reaſon of its commodious Situation in the Ocean, is found to be a Place of great reſort. In the chief City from which the Iſland takes name, is a conſiderable Mart, affording Corn, Wines, Oyls, Raſins, Wax, Honey, Cotton, Cordovants, Cotton Wools,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59749:285"/>

The Weight is the Rotolo, 100 of which makes the Quintar or 536 pound Engliſh. The Meaſure of Length is the Cane, which is found to be 84 Inches of Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>The next Iſland that offers, is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> which coſt the <hi>Turks</hi> ſo dear a purchaſe. Therefore I ſhall not think it amiſs to deſcribe its Commodities, Weights, and Meaſures.</p>

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59749:286"/>
Olives, Raſins, Corn, Cattle, Fiſh, and the like; containing ſeveral Cities of note as <hi>Candia</hi>; from whence the Iſland has its name, <hi>Canea, Rhettmio, Sittia,</hi> and <hi>Suda,</hi> being a Haven capable of receiving 1000 or 1500 large Veſſels, and before the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> loſt it, their Coyns were currant throughout the Iſland, and their Weights the Quintars Suttle and Groſs.

                     <p>THe Commodities that theſe Iſlands prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally afford are Honey, Wax, Oyl, Wine &amp; Currans, being Subject to the Signeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Venice</hi>; and hither it is that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Trade for Currans, now being of great uſe; and from whence they yearly bring 3000 Tuns or upward, which at firſt they bought for ſmall matters, but the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſeeing that Fruit ſo much coveted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to inquire into the uſe they were put to, the which when they found, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon imagined the Engliſh could not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without them, the better to recover the loſt Trade of <hi>Venice</hi>; that State im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a Tax of 5 Ducats upon every 1000 Weight, which is ſince Augmented, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Cuſtom payed in <hi>England</hi>

with this Proviſo; that the Currans be laden in a Veſſel that comes purpoſely to lade that Commodity, but if She Landeth her outward Fraight in <hi>Venice</hi> or ⅔ part thereof, and then goeth to Lade at any of theſe Iſlands, the Cuſtoms then are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated.</p>
                     <p>For the Growth of theſe Iſlands; the Engliſh Merchants Exchange Cloath, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuano's, Serges, Lead, Tinn, Herrings, <hi>Newland</hi>-Fiſh, and Pilchards, tho the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Trade is for Spaniſh Ryals; all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther money currant amongſt the Iſlanders, being the ſame with that of <hi>Venice.</hi> The Natives keeping their Accounts as in <hi>Venice,</hi> tho Merchants Strangers often keep theirs in Dollars, which are thoſe Ryals of 8/8 and Gaſſets 80 to the Dollar.</p>
                     <p>The Weight is the pound of 12 Ounces, 100 of which pounds make the Quintar, and agrees with <hi>Venice,</hi> thus the 100 pound Suttle of <hi>Venice</hi> make but 63 ½ pound of theſe Iſlands, and the Groſs hundred of <hi>Venice</hi> renders but the common 100 pound.

                     <p>Oyl is ſold by a Meaſure called the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and is computed to weigh 13 pound Engliſh, 10 of which make a Candia, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.

Here it was that ſeveral Perſons were left a whole Winter (the Ship going away during their Hunting up in the Country) and lived in a Hutt upon Bears-Fleſh, Veniſon, Wild-Foxes, Birds, and the Greens or preſſings of the Whales, till next year the Ships came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and fetched them off.

                     <p>THat Exchanges are a Principal part of Merchandiſe, it is moſt certain, and has been ſo found for 200 Years p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſt, tho not brought to perfection till of late Days. The places moſt apt for Exchanges are
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59749:292"/>
thoſe where many Merchants of divers Nations reſide; and have frequent meetings in relation to Trade, and Prizes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, whoſe returns are Subject to great Exchanges, which are ever advantageous to the place where they are Practiſed. Now ſome places there are that have Exchanges in themſelves, yet are compelled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon other places; having only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times or Fairs appointed by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of Exchangers, in which, or to which Bills of Exchange are either expired, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, or dated, one of which is <hi>Placentia</hi>; and indeed all Towns in Countries where there is more then one Exchange eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Metropolis</hi> or Principal Exchange gives Rules, and Rates to the reſt; provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Coyns be of equal value and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor indeed tho many places have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the name of Exchanges, yet that Exchange remains not ſo much in <hi>Eſſe</hi> as in the will of the Merchants, Bankers, and Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, in whoſe Power it is to aſſign the place as they think convenient; and for the moſt part pitch upon Principal places, where their Bills are ſure to have a quick diſpatch. Now there are ſeveral Cities that exchange in one and the ſame Monies, Coyns, and Denomination; as <hi>Naples, Lechie, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the two latter included in the former,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59749:292"/>
                        <hi>Palermo,</hi> and <hi>Meſſina,</hi> comprehended in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia; Valentia, Saragoſa,</hi> and <hi>Barſelona</hi> in <hi>Cattalonia; Sevil, Alcala,</hi> and <hi>Medina-del-Campo</hi> in <hi>Caſtilia; Frankford, Colona, Norem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and <hi>Auguſta</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> with many other of leſs note. But exchange now from a Plain and eaſie Method is reduced to ſo many myſterious Points, that it is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary difficult to underſtand it aright in all places, therefore I ſhall only lay down ſuch Particulars as chiefly concern Engliſh Merchants; and are conducing to the Trade of the Brittiſh Empire. The firſt thing then that is to be obſerved, is the true value of the Coyn of the City, or Port where you make your exchange, which is not to be taken according to the value of the Coyn as it is currant, but according to its Weight and fineneſs, and ſo the return may be proportionable; but if Bills are drawn to pay a Merchant reſiding in any place where the Coyn is currant, and he diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it for Commodities of the Growth, or Manufacture of the Country, then it matters not how the Coyn has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunced above its true value, by Reaſon it is currant, tho perhaps ſhould the Coyn be carryed into an other Kingdom, it might redound to the loſs of the receiver a third part; and this equallizing Coyns of divers
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59749:293"/>
Nations by Ballance I called a Par, by which all Coyns of Silver or Gold eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, are reduced to an equal value; as for example, <hi>Placentia</hi> exchanges with <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> one Crown of currant money there for 1 Shilling 6 pence ½ <hi>ob.</hi> Sterling, <hi>Lyons</hi> the Crown currant for 2 Shillings 8 pence Sterling, <hi>Rome</hi> exchanges her Ducat 87 ½ pence Sterling, <hi>Genoa</hi> her Crown of Gold at 83 pence Sterling, <hi>Millain</hi> her Crown of Gold 84 pence ½ <hi>ob.</hi> Sterling, <hi>Venice</hi> her Ducat at 60 pence Sterling, <hi>Florence</hi> her Crown at 80 pence, <hi>Luca</hi> her Ducat at 67 pence Sterling, <hi>Naples</hi> her Ducat at 66 ½ pence Sterling, <hi>Lechy</hi> her Ducat at 6 pence Sterling, <hi>Bary</hi> her Ducat at 62 pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Palermo</hi> her Ducat at 78 pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Meſſina</hi> her Ducat at 72 pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Valentia</hi> her Ducat at 72 ½ pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Saragoſa</hi> her Ducat at 73 pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Barſalonia</hi> her Ducat at 72 pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Sevil</hi> her Ducat at 72 pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Lisbon</hi> her Ducat at 69 pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Bolonia</hi> her Ducat at 67 pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Bergamo</hi> her Ducaton at 67 pence Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Frankfort, Noremburg, Auguſta,</hi> and <hi>Viena</hi> (in all which Cities one and the ſame Coyn is currant) Exchange their Florin at 50 pence Sterling; all theſe Cities and Towns <hi>London</hi> exchanges within broken numbers
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59749:293"/>
(that is by pence) at the rates aforeſaid, and ſo Multiplies into greater Summs as occaſion requires, but with <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Collen, Amſterdam, &amp;c,</hi> in whole number, as one pound Sterling for 34 ½ Flemiſh Shillings, and proportionable for greater Summs.</p>
                     <p>Again in <hi>London</hi> and throughout all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Exchangers and Merchants keep their Accounts in Pounds, Shillings, Pence, and caſt them up as is done in other places, by Solds, Livers, and Denire, <hi>viz.</hi> 12 pence to the Shilling, and 20 Shillings to the pound, and are found to exchange with <hi>Tranſmarine</hi> Cities thus, <hi>viz.</hi> to allow 64 pence Sterling, for the Crown of <hi>Placentia</hi> 64 pence Sterling, for the Crown of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> 66 pence Sterling, for the Ducat of <hi>Rome</hi> 65 pence, for the Crown of Gold of <hi>Genoa</hi> 64 2/4 pence, for the Crown of Gold of <hi>Millain</hi> 50 pence, for the Ducat in <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> 61 pence, for the Crown of <hi>Florence</hi> 53 ½ pence, for the Ducaton of <hi>Luca</hi> 50 pence, for the Ducat of <hi>Naples</hi> 50 ½ pence, for the Ducat of <hi>Lechy</hi> 51 pence, for the Ducat of <hi>Bary</hi> 57 ½, for the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat of <hi>Palermo</hi> 56 ½, for which Ducat of <hi>Meſſina</hi> one pound Sterling, for 34 ½ Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Flemiſh, with <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Collon</hi> 57 ½ pence, for the Ducat of <hi>Valentia</hi> 59

And thus the currant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is ſetled, and continues unleſs in times of War, when Princes to Inrich their Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, make an Inhaunſment upon the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Coyns in their reſpective Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and at other times when the Banker or Exchanger takes the advantage of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties neceſſity, upon whoſe Accounts the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is to be made.</p>
                     <p>The Terms of paying Bills of exchange in <hi>London</hi> with other Cities, are commonly theſe.

                     <head>CHAP. XCX. Several uſeful obſervations to be carefully noted, in the Management of Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</head>
                     <p>OBſerve to note in your Book the Name of the place of aboad of the Perſon who preſents the Bill, keep Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Bills ſent to get accepted, make the direction of Bills on the inſide, and all for the Reaſons following.</p>
                     <p>Firſt by knowing the place of Aboad of him that preſented the firſt Bill, he may be the better excuſed, if he except againſt the ſecond Bill from the ſame Hand, before the firſt be ſatisfyed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly by taking Copies of Bills ſent to get acceptance, you may know how Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes go in all places, and at the ſame time to know without any great trouble, on whom you are to call for your money, and what Day.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly to make the direction of Bills on the inſide, will give larger Scope to Write this Aſſignment on the back ſide.</p>
                     <p n="4">4ly. Every Perſon who receives a Bill to get it accepted, whether for himſelf or
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59749:298"/>
another muſt, tho ſome hold the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, preſent the ſaid Bill in due time; that the Perſon who is to accept it, may order his affairs accordingly, and not be ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the preſentation of a Bill, juſt when it becomes due.</p>
                     <p n="5">5ly. If a Bill be proteſted after accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it does not clear the party who was faulty in non-payment, but renders him lyable to pay the charges; and expoſes him to an Action at Law, to which before he was not lyable, nor is the Drawer cleared, but obliged to ſee the Bill ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6ly. Times of payment are according to the diſtance or Cuſtom of the places, where the Bills are drawn, &amp; were payable, as has before been briefly touched, as from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Antwerp, Midelborrough, Rotterdam, Lyſle, Rouen</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> at a Months Uſance.</p>
                     <p n="7">7ly It is dangerous to draw a Bill payable to the bearer, by Reaſon if a Bill ſhould happen to be loſt, any Perſon might bring it for acceptance or payment, therefore the ſafeſt way is to make it payable to a particular man, or his order; for otherwiſe if it ſhould be payed to the wrong party, and the Bill received, he on whom it is drawn, is not lyable to pay it again unleſs a Fraud be proved.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:59749:299"/>81y. A Bill of Exchange is held ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick, that it requires no witneſs, nor is it requiſite that any Perſon unleſs the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that receives it be preſent at the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, or that any one be preſent, when the party who accepts it under-writes his name, for if any Perſon either Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Subſcriber ſhould deny his Hand, it may be eaſiely proved by comparing his Letter or Books of Account, and if that be proved his credit is inevitably ruined.</p>
                     <p n="9">9ly. If you receive an Outland Bill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it preſently, and if it be refuſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt without delay, and ſend it back to the Drawer with Proteſt, which will be for the advantage of both. Twenty four Hours is the longeſt time, that you are obliged to give any Merchant to conſider whether he will or not, and after that, it is at your pleaſure whether you will proteſt or give longer time, and after proteſt advice ought to be given to the Drawer by the firſt Poſt.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If a Bill be drawn on two Perſons, and not to them or either of them, but joyntly, yet if one do accept it and the other refuſe it the Bill ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. If a Bill be preſented to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and he by word of mouth, deſires
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59749:299"/>
it may be left in his Hands, and does Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally accept it, altho he afterwards refuſe to Subſcribe it, yet ſuch an acceptance is valid, and he may be Sued upon due Proteſt, tho Proteſt muſt not be made till the money becomes due.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. If a man accept a Bill for part and not for the whole, alledging he has no more in his Hands; the Perſon to whom the money is payable, may receive the part and give an acquittance for ſo much as he receives, but muſt enter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for non-payment of the reſt, and ſend it away as ſoon as the party refuſes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for the whole.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Drawer is Maſter of the Bill till it becomes due, and may Countermand it by ſending an Expreſs to the party, who has accepted it not to pay it without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order, which order muſt be made, and paſſed before a publick Notary, and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed to the party that hath accepted the Bill, but if the money be pay'd it is paſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. A Bill of Exchange may be pay'd at Uſance ſingle, double or treble, that is length of time according to the quality of the Perſon; the occaſion or difficulty of paſſage by Reaſon of different Seaſons, but general Uſance is accounted a Month from
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59749:300"/>
the Date of the Bill, each month tho dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in number of Days being accounted, the Month required on that occaſion.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. A Bill payable at Days ſight, is from the Day after it is accepted, elſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ought to be made. If an accepted Bill be loſt, yet it will not Bar the payment, but may be Sued for as if the Bill were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor is the party who accepted it bound to pay a ſecond Bill, before the firſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, unleſs the ſecond Bill be directed to the party who loſt the Former in lieu thereof.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. When a Bill is accepted, there is no revoking it, but it muſt be either payed or Proteſted; tho ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that the Acceptor and the Party to whom the Bill is payable, do conclude upon longer time then the Bill ſpecifies, or to take it by Parcels; yet if he doubt the honeſty of the Acceptor, the Preſentor muſt nowithſtanding make Proteſt, or the Acceptor may refuſe further payment, and yet not lye lyable to be Sued.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. If a Bill be directed to a party, and he be out of Town, not leaving any Warrant of Attorney, to impower his Wife or Servants to accept it; and another Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to ſupport the Drawers credit, will accept and pay it, yet Proteſt muſt be made againſt the party on whom it was drawn for non-acceptance.</p>
                     <p n="18">
                        <pb n="305" facs="tcp:59749:300"/>18. In ſome caſes half Uſance is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially in Inland Bills, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted 15 Days.</p>
                     <p>Note that all Bills muſt be Proteſted 3 Days after they become due, it being dangerous to exceed that time, altho one of the Days happened on a Sunday, yet tho the 3 Days are expired, 'tis not at all unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Proteſt.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Bills payable at a fixed Day, are not meant one, and the ſame Day if they come from any place where the new Style is practiſed, becauſe the old and new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of ten Days difference. As for Example, if a Bill be dated new Style payable on the 10 of <hi>March,</hi> it is not payable till the 10 of <hi>March</hi> old Style, which is the 20th. of <hi>March</hi> new Style.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. A Wife or a Servant cannot accept a Bill of Exchange, unleſs the Husband or Maſter impower them by a Warrant of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney ſo to do, or that formerly they have accepted Bills with his good liking, and by him diſcharged.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. If a party on whom a Bill is drawn, live at a diſtant City or place of Exchange, from him that is to receive the money, he muſt go himſelf or ſend the Bill down to ſome Friend to get it accepted, which if not accepted, Proteſt muſt be entered, if it
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59749:301"/>
be a place of Exchange, or by the help of a Letter of ſuch refuſal, from the Friend who endeavoured to get it accepted, Proteſt may be made at <hi>London,</hi> tho the party live at <hi>Southampton,</hi> but if accepted and your Bill returned when it becomes due, if it be made payable at <hi>london,</hi> you muſt expect there your money, or enter Proteſt for non-payment.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. If a Merchant that accepted a Bill prove non-Solvent, and abſent himſelf from the Exchange; you muſt before the Bill be due, cauſe demand to be made by a Notary for better Security, and in default thereof cauſe Proteſt to be made, and ſend away the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt by the next Poſt to the Drawer of the Bill, who muſt defray the charges of ſuch Proteſt, and all Proteſts muſt be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sun and Sun, that is, between Sun Riſing and Sun Setting; other Hours being accounted unſeaſonable, and held amongſt Merchants Illegal.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. If a Proteſt be returned to the Drawer or Indorſer, he muſt get an able man to under-write the Proteſt, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himſelf to make ſpeedy payment with Coſts and Rechange, but if the Proteſt be returned for want of payment, and you have had Security already upon the Proteſt for non-acceptance or want of better Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, then upon receipt of your Proteſt
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59749:301"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or non-payment, you may only acquaint the Drawer or party that took up the money, and tarry out the proportion of time, at which the Bill was made payable, to be accounted from the time it fell due, before you demand your Principal money, with the Rechange and charges of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who drew the Bill or his Security, which according to the Law of Merchants, they are bound to ſatisfy either joyntly or ſeverally.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. When you have an accepted Bill proteſted for want of payment, keep the Bill, but ſend away the Proteſt, by which means the money is recoverable of the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. If a Bill be delivered to a party to be accepted, and yet by the careleſneſs or otherwiſe of the party that received it in order to accept be Loſt, then muſt he who brought it demand a note under the Hand and Seal of the Merchant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who received the Bill for the payment of the money, at the Day ſpecifyed in the Bill, upon a ſecond Bill if it come to hand, or if not upon the note it ſelf, and if ſuch note be refuſed to be given, then the party who ſhould receive the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney upon the loſt Bill, muſt enter proteſt and ſend it away, and when the money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes due upon the loſt Bill, he muſt make
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59749:302"/>
demand of it, and for non-payment enter Proteſt a ſecond time, and ſend it away, or if he have a note, yet if it be not payed at the time therein limited, he muſt Proteſt as upon a Bill of Exchange.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. If a Perſon ſend a Bill to a Friend of his to get it accepted, tho drawn upon no particular Perſon, but a Blanck left to put in the parties Name that will accept it, it is according to the Law of Merchants ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. If a Bill be drawn by one Merchant upon another, upon the account of a third man; he upon whom it is drawn has liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to chuſe whether he will accept it upon the account of the third Perſon, or on his account who drew it; but then he muſt go before a Publick Notary, and declare his intent, of which the Notary muſt make an Act indue Form to be ſent away to the party whom it concerns; and he muſt alſo cauſe an Act to be made for payment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when it becomes due, declaring that he will pay it for the Honour of the Drawer, but upon no other account then is the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er accountable to him for the Summ ſpecifyed in the Bill.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. If a Bill be drawn upon a Merchant, who after acceptance for want of money, or otherwiſe fails to pay it when due, another
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59749:302"/>

                     <head>CHAP. CXI. Of Letters of credit, and to what intent they are drawn.</head>
                     <p>THere are divers ſorts of Letters, that paſs between Merchants and Merchants, or Merchants and their Factors. As Letters of Commiſſion for buying and ſelling, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of advice, Letters of Fraight, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Credit; the latter of which are properly ſuch as are Written to furniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by Exchange, upon the credit of him that Writes them, ſo that by virtue of the Letter or Letters ſo Written, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant or Banker that Writes the Letter or Letters, are bound as firmly, as if they had given Bond to ſatisfy by Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; or otherwiſe any Summ or Summs of money, taken upon them by thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſpecifyed therein. And theſe Letters are two ſorts, the one General and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecial.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is when I Write my open Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to all Merchants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who ſhall Furniſh ſuch and ſuch Perſons upon my Letter of credit, wherein I do bind my ſelf, that what Monies ſhall be delivered unto ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59749:305"/>
parties therein ſpecifyed, within the time limited at ſuch and ſuch rates, or as the Exchange is currant; I will repay by Bills of Exchange or otherwiſe: and if any one ſhould refuſe to pay Bills for monies receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Letters of credit, yet thoſe Letters being produced, and proved to be his, are as binding as Hand and Seal, and ſtand as good in Law.</p>
                     <p>The ſpecial Letter of credit, is directed to a peculiar Perſon, and is of force equal with the former; as for the Forms of the General Letters of credit, they are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſutable to the occaſion of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the form of a ſpecial or particular Letter of credit may run thus.

that they ventured into the till then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed innavigable Seas; propoſing to themſelves that if they eſcaped with their Lives, tho both Ships and Goods were loſt, they ſhould not be much indammaged.</p>

Theſe Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are divers of ſorts, ſome being made for places general, others certain; thoſe upon certain places or Ports are made upon Goods laden, which if they miſcarry before they are ſafely Landed at the place agreed on, the Inſurer muſt make good as far as he has inſured, but upon certain notice of their ſafe Arrival, he may demand the Premio a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, and the Policy is then void, and the like upon Goods inward bound, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Merchant and Inſurer can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>

                        <pb n="327" facs="tcp:59749:312"/>A General Anſurance is when a Ship goes a Trading Voyage, taking in at one Port and vending at another; ſo that the Inſurer is lyable to any damage ſhe ſuſtains till ſhe returns in ſafety to the Port from whence She ſets out, that is in her Cargo only, unleſs the Ship and her Appurtenances are inſured, which are frequently included, tho then the Premio runs higher.</p>
                     <p>Goods ſent by Land may likewiſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, tho that ſeldom happens; or if any Perſon fears being taken by the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Moors,</hi> he may inſure his Perſon of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Premio, and then if he be taken, the inſurer is obliged to Ranſom him: that is, pay ſo much money as is inſured, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Aſſurers</hi> inſert in their Policies loſt or not loſt, that is, when Ships have been a long time abroad, and no advice of their being in any Port, but then the Premio runs high as 30, 40, and ſometimes more <hi>per cent.</hi> for if the Ship be loſt at the time the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is Subſcribed, yet ſo much as is inſured muſt be made good, but then it muſt be contrary to the knowledge of him that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or otherwiſe it will be accounted a Fraud.</p>
                     <p>If any Perſon aſſures a Rotten Veſſel for more then She is worth, and then going out of the Port or Harbour, She Privately
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59749:313"/>
cauſes to be Wrecked or Sunk, if it can be proved it is a Defraud, and he who Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Policy, is not bound to make ſatisfaction, but it is obſerved of late that ſeldom any one Perſon will inſure a whole Ship; but Subſcribe 50 pound, 100 pound or more at a certain Premio, currant at the time of aſſuring; which when the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Born they receive; but if a loſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, the Premio is deducted together with the uſual Abatements; ſo that the inſured ſeldom receives more then 80 pound in the 100 pound, and many now adays are ſo adventurous, that they will enſure againſt Heaven and Earth; Streſs of Weather, Storms, Enemies, Pirates, Rovers, and all other Caſualties. If a Merchant enſures a Ship, he only names in the Policy of ſuch a Burthen, then if She be loſt the Inſurers are bound to make the Ship only good, and not the Wares: If the Wares be inſured it matters not whether each particular is mentioned in the Policy, but in general up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the chief Commodities, and all other Commodities laden or to be laden for the enſured.</p>
                     <p>If a Ship be Enſured and take Fire 'ere She break Ground, the <hi>Aſſurers</hi> in ſuch a caſe are not lyable to make Reſtitution, unleſs the words be in the Policy at ſuch
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59749:313"/>
a Port, or from ſuch a Port, unleſs She had firſt broken Ground, and had been forced back again by Storm.</p>
                     <p>If a Ship be Enſured and prove Leaky, and the Maſter for preſervation of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, lade it into another Ship, and that Ship be loſt, the Enſurer is not bound to make the Cargo good, unleſs in the Policy it is mentioned, untill the Goods by the ſaid Ship or any other ſhould be ſafely Landed at ſuch a place, naming it.</p>
                     <p>It is held that if a Perſon Enſure more Goods then he has on Board, and ſeveral Perſons Subſcribed the Policy, yet the firſt Subſcribers are only bound to pay the loſs if they miſcarry, and thoſe that Subſcribed over and above the value of the Goods, remitting their Premio 10 Shillings <hi>per cent.</hi> reducted for their Subſcriptions are diſcharged: If a Cargo be Enſured to ſuch a Port there ſafely to be unladed, and her Cargo is ſold on Board, the Property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altered, if the Ship afterwards miſcarry, the Enſurer is not obliged to make it good, if the buyer agrees for the Fraight to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to any other Port.</p>
                     <p>If Goods be Enſured, and the Enſured contrary to the knowledge of the Enſurer, Lades prohibited Goods, by which the Ship may become forfeited, then the Enſurer
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59749:314"/>
is not lyable to make good the Cargo, unleſs after the lading of ſuch Goods they are prohibited.</p>
                     <p>If any Goods be damaged in the Ship by neglect of the Maſter or Mariners, the Enſurer is not bound to make Satisfaction. And further 'tis always expedient to prevent differences that may ariſe between the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer and the Enſured, that the Bills of lading conſiſt of three parts, one to be ſent over Sea, the other left with the Maſter, and the laſt with the Lader.</p>
                     <p>This Office or Court of aſſurance, was erected by the Statute of the 43 of <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> Chap. 12, whereby the Judges or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners appointed to determine differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ariſing, were the Judges of the Court of Admiralty, the Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> two Doctors of the Civil Law, two Barriſters, eight diſcreet Merchants or any five of them, and that they or the Major part, ſhould have Power to hear, examine, order or decree all ſuch cauſes in a Summary way, without pleading or expence, and to have Power to Summon Parties to Examine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, commit to Priſon upon diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or the like; but this way being found tedious, becauſe ſo many parties as made a Court, were not at all times to be Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it was taken into conſideration, and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59749:314"/>
in the 12 of <hi>Car.</hi> 2 Chap. 23 Enacted that 3 Commiſſioners ſhould make the Court <hi>viz.</hi> a Doctor of the Civil Law, a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſter of 5 Years ſtanding, and a Merchant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have Power to Act in all caſes, after their being Sworn before the Lord Major; and if the Witneſs refuſe to come upon the firſt Summons, and tender of reaſonable charges, upon the ſecond Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons they may impriſon them for ſuch their contempt, or give coſts, and commonly differences come to an Iſſue in a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, their proceedings being as well out of Term-time as it.</p>
                     <p>The Judgments are there given upon mature deliberation, by Perſons well Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Marine affairs; and if the Sentence be ſuppoſed unreaſonable, then the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, may upon an appeal determine the ſame; tho no appeal from thence can lye before the whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is depoſited, and the full coſt payed to the appelled. So that it prevents the trouble of taking up the Party by Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, againſt whom the Decree has paſſed, and a further advantage is, they may in this Court decree againſt 20 Enſurers at once, which at common Law muſt be Sued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, tho the Execution cannot lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Body and Goods, but againſt either as at Common Law.</p>

                        <hi>FOenus Nauticum</hi> or <hi>Bottomery,</hi> is by the <hi>Dutch</hi> called <hi>Bomery, Bodmery,</hi> or <hi>Boddemerii</hi>; from the Keel or Bottom of a Ship, the Part being taken for the Whole, and was called by the Ancient Britains <hi>Bodo</hi> or <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi> the bottom of a Ship, Signifying the bottom or the Cargo therein contained, the which as Land is mortgaged for certain Sums of Money taken up thereon, and is bound to ſatisfy the ſame at return, with ſuch intereſt as is agreed on the Statute of uſury, in that caſe being excluded by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Hazard the Lender runs; for
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59749:315"/>
in many caſes money is taken up thus. I lend 100 pound upon a Ship, to receive 150 if the Ship arrives ſafe at ſuch a Port, but if She chance to Miſcarry, my money is loſt, and many times Maſters of Ships could not ſet out, if they did not in this nature take up Monies; for which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their Ship or Cargo become Pledges; but ſome Perſons have taken hold of this occaſion to Bar the Statute of uſury: thus they get the Party to feign he has a Ship bound for <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or any ſuch Port, making a ſpecial obligation to pay the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney again at ſo much <hi>per cent.</hi> at a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time Granted for the return of the Ship; and if She do not in that time return the money to be pay'd notwithſtanding, but certain it is if a Perſon have 500 or 1000 pound lying by him, and knows of an ingenious Merchant or Maſter of a Ship, who is fitting out for a Voyage, and is Slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſtocked, and he lends him this money to buy ſuch Commodities as will vend in the places whither he is bound, running the Riſque to have nothing, if the Ship miſcarry, and 30 <hi>per cent.</hi> Intereſt, if She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſafe, it is altogether as profitable for the merchant as Maſter; as to take up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at Brokerage, and to Enſure his Ship or Cargo. And if the Merchant or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59749:316"/>
makes double return of the ſaid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he gets ſufficiently, as well as the Venturer, and this cannot be accounted uſury.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another way both profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Honourable, as thus, ſuppoſe a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon puts a ſtock into the Hands of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Society, which is termed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſtock, the Principal being never to be recalled, tho it may be often ſold for good advantage, but he that put it in or buys it receives ſtill his dividend, which produces ſometimes twenty and ſometimes more <hi>per cent.</hi> and the Hazard only is if the proportion of the ſtock that goes out be loſt, he muſt abate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by remitting the dividend he will keep up the ſtock. And 100 pound in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company has been of late ſold at 180 or 190 pound.</p>

                     <p>FRaight is commonly agreed on between the owners and the Merchant, by a Writing of Charter-party, wherein are concluded the particulars of the contract; and if there be no ſuch Writing but only earneſt given, then if the Merchant recant 'tis held by ſome, nay and often obſerved that he only loſes his earneſt, and that if the owners recant they loſe double earneſt; tho many learned in the Law are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that an Action for dammage, if any be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by ſuch revocation will lye; if a Merchant ſhould hire a Veſſel, and not have his Goods ready at the time appointed, and the Veſſel loſe the Seaſon of the Paſſage, or a Ship hired be unfiting to Sail, ſo that the Merchant muſt either loſe the paſſage of his Goods, or lade them on another Veſſel, dammage may be recovered by an Action at common Law.</p>

                     <p>A Wreck is properly when a Ship is caſt away, and no live thing eſcapes to Shoar; and then thoſe upon whoſe Grounds the Goods are caſt by the Sea, ought unleſs they are Periſhable to keep them a twelve-month, to ſee if any will claim them; and if any do take ſuch Goods, and contrary to the known Laws convert them to their own uſe, they are upon Conviction of the ſame, to pay four times the value to the owner, and as much to the King; but if the Goods are Periſhable, then the Sherif, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner, or Bailif, in whoſe Juriſdiction they are found may ſell them, but muſt be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for ſo much money, to thoſe that can make out the Goods were theirs; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch Wrecks as much as may be, all

Fiſher-men upon ſevere Penalties are forbid to Fiſh with Lights in the Night. But if Goods Wrecked be not owned or Sued for within a Year and a Day, they fall to the King's Exchequer by the Law of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and the Iſlue muſt be tryed before the Judges of the Wrecks; always provided this Law do not extend to Pirates, Sea-Rovers, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Turks,</hi> or Enemies to the Chriſtian Faith, and if any who unjuſtly detains any ſuch Wrecked Goods, ſhall refuſe to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, or ſatisfaction to the full value, he ſhall be Impriſoned, and if a Lords Bailiff be therein found to offend, the Lord is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to deliver his Balif's Body to the King. And as for Cuſtom, Wrecked Goods rarely pay any, but if the Ship be caſt away, or all the Goods or the Major part of them ſaved, in ſuch a caſe they pay an eaſie Cuſtom, as the Labour of ſaving them was more or leſs difficult, and in that caſe light Goods as Silver and Gold, according to value ſhall pay leſs then heavy and Groſs Goods. All Wrecks of Whales or great Sturgeon are properly the Kings.</p>
                     <p>There are other ſorts of Wrecks as <hi>Flotſam, Jetſam,</hi> and <hi>Lagan</hi> or <hi>Ligan</hi>; the former is when a Ship is Sunk, and the Goods are found Floating on the Sea. The ſecond is when a Ship is about to ſink, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

Theſe three are commonly the Kings grant, within the high and low Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter marks by preſcription, as it appears by thoſe in the Weſt Countries, who preſcribe to have Wrecks as far as they can ſee a Humber Barrel.</p>
                     <p>If a Ship be ready to Periſh, and all the men for preſervation of their Lives eſcape in their Long-Boat; yet if the Ship drive afterward into any Port, it is no Wreck; and the like if a Ship be taken by Pirates, and after taking out the Men and Goods turned it a Drift.</p>
                     <p>All owners claiming Wrecks, muſt make their Proof by their Cocquets or Marks Perſonal, Teſtimony upon Oath or the Books of Entery in the Cuſtom-Houſe, and if any ſuch Wreck belongs to the King, the

party muſt Sue out a Commiſſion to hear and determine, and that by the Oaths of twelve men, or elſe he may bring his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at Law, and make his proof by Verdict, but let him be careful that ſuch his Action be brought within a Year and a Day, or it will not lye; all <hi>Flotſams, Jetſams,</hi> and <hi>Legans</hi> appertain by grant of Charter to the Lord high Admiral, and muſt be decided if found upon the high Sea, in the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty.

                     <p>The Citizens of <hi>London, viz.</hi> thoſe that are Reſident are exempted from the Cuſtom or Impoſt called Prizage, which is, that out of ten Tuns of Wine the King is to have one, paying for it 20 Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but Citizens muſt not own any Wines ſo imported under Colour, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59749:327"/>
Strangers from paying Priſage. If a Freeman live in another City, and ſend Wines to unlade at the Port of <hi>London</hi>; he ſhall not be capable of this Priviledge, but muſt be reſident as aforeſaid, for by a private Act in the 24 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was made, that the Lord Major would make Strangers Citizens; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was there declared, that this Benefit to be diſcharged from payment of Priſage, extended not to ſuch Citizens as were made ſo by Gift, but ſuch as were Legally Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, according to the true, intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, by Service or Adoption, and reſident in the ſaid City; and 'tis further obſerved that if any Merchant not a Citizen break Bulk, tho he deliver but part of his Cargo, yet the Duty is to be levyed upon all, as if all had been unladen. And this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge likewiſe enjoy the Inhabitants reſident in the Cinque-Ports.</p>
                     <p>Butherage, as I have before ſaid, is 2 Shillings <hi>per</hi> Tun, upon Wines imported by Strangers; but the Engliſh are exempted from that Duty. And thus much for the Priviledges, Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> in relation to Trade.</p>

                  <p>FOrasmuch as men who are in a decaying condition, or who have but an ill opinion of their own concernments, inſtead of being (as ſome think) the more induſtrious to reſist the evil they apprehended, do contrarywiſe become the more Languid and ineffectual to all in all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoures; neither caring to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

or proſecute even the probable means of their relief: I as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Common-Wealth, next to the knowing the preciſe truth in what Condition the common intereſt stands, would all in doubtful caſes thinkthe beſt and conſequently not diſpair without strong and manifest Reaſons, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examining what ever tends to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen my hopes of the Publick Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>
                  <p>I have therefore thought fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the following perſwaſions, which I find too currant in the World, and too much to have affected the

minds of ſome to the prejudice of all, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Rents of Lands are Generally fallen, that therefore and for many other Reaſons, the whole Kingdom growes poorer and poorer; that formerly it abounded with Gold; but now there is a great Scarcity both of Gold and Silver.</p>
                  <p>That there is no Trade nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for the people, and yet that the Land is underpeopled, that Taxes have been many and great. That <hi>Ireland</hi> and the Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> and other additions to

the Crown are a Burthen to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that <hi>Scotland</hi> is of no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; that Trade in General doth lamentably decay, that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> are at our Heels in the Race of Naval power, the <hi>French</hi> grow too fatt upon both, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo Rich and Potent, that it is but their Clemency, that they do not devour their Neighbours; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Church and State of <hi>England,</hi> are in the ſame danger with the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> with many other diſmal Suggeſtions, which I do rather Stifle then repeat.</p>

That a ſmall Country and few People by Situation, Trade, and Policy, may be equivalent in Wealth, and Strength to a far greater People and Territories; and particularly that conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies for Shipping and Water-Carriage do most eminently and fundamentally conduce thereto.</head>
                     <p>THe firſt principal Concluſion by reaſon of it's Length I conſider in three parts, whereof the firſt that a ſmall Country and few People may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent in Wealth and Strength to a far greater People and Territories.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59749:337"/>This part of the firſt principal Concluſion needs little proof, foraſmuch as one Acre of Land may bear as much Corn and feed as many Cattle as twenty by the difference of the Soyl, ſome Parcels of Ground are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo defenſible as that 100 men being poſſeſt thereof, can reſiſt the Invaſion of 500. Bad Land may be improved and made good, Bog may by dreining be made Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; Heath Land may (as in <hi>Flanders</hi>) be made to bear Flax, and Clover-graſs, ſo as to advance in value from 1. to 100. the ſame Land being built upon may centriple the Rent, which it yieldeth as paſture; one man is nimbler and ſtronger and more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Labour than another; one man by Art may do as much work as many, <hi>viz.</hi> one man with a Mill can grind as much Corn as 20. can pound in a Mortar, one Printer can make as many Copies as an hundred can write by hand; one horſe can carry as much upon Wheels as five men upon their backs, and in a Boat, or upon Ice as 20; ſo that I ſay again the firſt point of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral poſition needs little or no proof.</p>
                     <p>But the ſecond and more material part of this Concluſion is, that this difference in Land and People ariſes principally from their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation Trade and Policy.</p>
                     <p>To clear this I ſhall compare <hi>Holland</hi>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59749:337"/>
and <hi>Zealand</hi> with the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> do not contain above 1. Million of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acres, whereas the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> contains above 80.</p>
                     <p>Now the original and primitive difference holds proportion as Lands to Land; for it is hard to ſay that when theſe places were 1ſt. planted, whether an Acre of Land in <hi>Holland</hi> was better then the like quantity in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi>: Now is there any reaſon to ſuppoſe, but that therefore upon the firſt Plantation the number of Planters was in proportion to the quantity of Land; wherefore if the People are not in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Land the ſame muſt be attributed to the Situation of the Land, and to the Trade and Policy of the People.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The next thing to be ſhewn is that <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> at this day is not only <hi>80</hi>th. as rich and strong as <hi>France,</hi> but that it hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the <hi>3</hi>d. or thereabouts, which I think will appear upon the ballance of the following Particulars, viz.</head>

And the Author of a moſt judicious Diſcourſe of Husbandry (ſuppoſed to be Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi>) doth from reaſon and experience ſhew that Lands in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flax, Turnips, Clover-graſs, Madder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will eaſily yield 10 pound <hi>per</hi> Acre, ſo as the Territories of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> ſhould by this account, yield at leaſt 10 Millions <hi>per Annum</hi>; yet I do not believe the ſame to be ſo much, nor <hi>France</hi> ſo little as aforeſaid, but rather that one bears to the other as about 7 or 8 to one.</p>
                        <p>The People of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> are one 3d part of thoſe in <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> which two Cities differ not in People a 20th part from each other as hath appeared by the Bills of Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Chriſtenings from each, but the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Buildings in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> may well be half that of <hi>Paris</hi> by reaſon of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, Grafts and Bridges, which in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> are more numerous and chargeable than <hi>Paris</hi>: Moreover the Habitations of the pooreſt People in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> are twice or thrice as good as thoſe of <hi>France</hi> but the People of the one to the People of the other being but as 13 to 1. the value of the Houſing muſt be as about 5 to 1. The Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of <hi>Europe</hi> being about 2 Millions of tuns I ſuppoſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have about 5000000, the <hi>Dutch</hi> 900 thouſand, the <hi>French</hi> 100
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59749:338"/>
thouſand, the <hi>Hamburgers</hi> and the Subjects of <hi>Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Dantzick</hi> 250 thouſand, and <hi>Spain, Portugal, Italy, &amp;c.</hi> 250 thouſand; ſo as the Shipping in our caſe of <hi>France</hi> to that of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> is about 1 to 9: which reckoned great and ſmall one with another at 8 pound <hi>per</hi> Tun makes the worth to be 800 thouſand pounds to 7 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, &amp; 2000000 pounds the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Capital in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company is worth about 3 Millions where the <hi>French</hi> has little or nothing.</p>
                        <p>The value of the Goods exported out of <hi>France</hi> into all parts are ſuppoſed quadruple to what is ſent to <hi>England</hi> alone, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all about 5 Millions; but what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of <hi>Holland</hi> into <hi>England</hi> is worth 3 Millions; and what is exported thence into all the World beſides is ſextuple to that Summ.</p>
                        <p>The Moneys yearly raiſed by the <hi>French</hi> King, as the ſame appears by the Book inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled the <hi>State of France,</hi> dedicated to the King printed <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1669. and ſet forth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times by Authority, is 82 Millions of <hi>French</hi> Livers, which is about ½ Millions of pounds Sterling, of which Summ the Author ſayes that one 5th part was abated for Nonva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luers or Inſolvencies.</p>
                        <p>So as (I ſuppoſe) not above 5 Millions were effectually raiſed, but whereas ſome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59749:339"/>
ſay the King of <hi>France</hi> raiſed 11 Millions as the ⅕ of the Effects of <hi>France,</hi> I humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, that the Land and Sea forces, all the Buildings and Interleguments which we have heard by common Fame to have been ſet forth and made in any of theſe laſt 7 years needed not to have coſt 6 Millions Sterling; wherefore I ſuppoſe he hath not raiſed more, eſpecially ſince there were ⅕ inſolven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies when the Tax was at that pitch.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> paying 67 of 100 pay'd by all the United Provinces, and the City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> paying 27 of the ſaid 67, it follows that if <hi>Amſterdam</hi> hath pay'd 4000 pound <hi>Flemmiſh per diem,</hi> or about 146000 <hi>per Annum,</hi> or about 80 thouſand pound Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that all <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> have paid above 2 Millions <hi>per Annum</hi>; now the Reaſons why they pay ſo much, I think are theſe <hi>(viz)</hi> 1. the Author of the State of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> ſaith ſo.</p>
                        <p n="2">2dly. Exciſe of Victuals at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſeems above half the Original value of the ſame <hi>(viz)</hi> ground Corn pays 20 Stivers the Buſhel, or 63 Gilders the Laſt, Beer 113 Stivers the Barrel, houſing ⅙ of Rent, fruit ⅛ of what it coſt; other Commodities 1/7 ⅛ 1/9 1/12 Salt <hi>ad libitum,</hi> all weighed Goods pay beſides the premiſes a vaſt ſum: now if the expence of the People of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> at a Medium, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59749:339"/>
without Exciſe, were 8 pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> whereas in <hi>England</hi> 'tis 7 pound, then if all the ſeveral Impoſts above named raiſe it 5 pound more, there being 160 thouſand Souls in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> the Sum of 800 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound Sterling <hi>per Annum</hi> will thereby be raiſed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly. Though the Expence of each Head ſhould be 13 pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> 'tis well known that there be few in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> who do not earn much more than the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
                        <p n="4">4thly. If <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> pay <hi>per Annum</hi> 2,000,000 pounds, then all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces together muſt pay about 3 Millions, leſs then which Sum <hi>per Annum</hi> perhaps is not ſufficient to have maintained the Naval War with <hi>England,</hi> 72 thouſand land Forces beſides all other the ordinary charges of their Government, whereof the Church is there a part. To conclude, it ſeems from the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that all <hi>France</hi> doth not raiſe above thrice as much from the publick Charge, as <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> alone do.</p>
                        <p n="5">5thly. Intereſt of Money in <hi>France</hi> 7 pounds <hi>per Centum,</hi> but in <hi>Holland</hi> ſcarce half ſo much.</p>
                        <p n="6">6thly. The Country of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> conſiſting as it were of Iſlands guarded with the Sea, Shipping and Marſhes, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59749:340"/>
at ¼ the charge of a plain open Country is, and where the Seat of War may be both Winter and Summer, whereas in others nothing can be done but in the Summer only.</p>
                        <p n="7">7thly. But above all the particulars hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto conſidered that of Superlucration ought chiefly to be taken in, for if a Prince have never ſo many Subjects and his Country never ſo good, yet if either through ſloath or extravagant Expences or oppreſſion and injuſtice, what ever is gained, ſhall be ſpent as faſt as gotten, the State muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed poor. Wherefore let it be conſidered how much, or how many times rather <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> are now above what they were 100 years ago; which we muſt alſo do of <hi>France</hi>; now if <hi>France</hi> hath ſcarce doubled it's Wealth and Power, and that the other have decupled theirs; I ſhall give the preference to the latter, even altho the 9 increaſed by the one ſhould not exceed the one half gained by the other; becauſe one hath a Store for 9 years, and the other but for 1. To conclude upon the whole, that though <hi>France</hi> being Peopled to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> as 13 to 1, and in quantity of good Land as 80 to 1, yet is not 13 times Richer and Stronger, much leſs 80 times, nor much above thrice, which was to be proved.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59749:340"/>Having thus diſpatched the two firſt Branches of the firſt principal Concluſion, it follows to ſhew that this difference of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in Wealth and Strength, ariſes in particular from conveniencies for Shipping and Water-carriage.</p>
                        <p>Many writing on this Subject do ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Hollanders</hi> as if they were more, and all other Nations leſs then men, (as to the matter of Trade and Policy) making them Angels, and others Fools, Brutes and Sots as to thoſe particulars, whereas I take the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Atchievements to lie ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the Situation of the Country, whereby they do things inimitable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and have advantages whereof others are incapable.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The Soyl of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> is low Land, rich and fertile, whereby it is able to feed many men, and ſo as that men may live near each other for their mutual Aſſiſtance in Trade, I ſay that 1000 Acres that can feed 1000 Souls is better than 10000 of no more effect, for the following reaſons to it <hi>(viz.)</hi> firſt ſuppoſe ſome great Fabrick were in building by 1000 men, ſhall not much more time be ſpared if that they lived all upon 1000 Acres, then if they were forced to live upon 10 times as large a Scope of Land?</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59749:341"/>2dly. The charge of their care of their Souls, and the Miniſtry would be far greater in the one caſe then the other, as alſo of Mutual defence in caſe of invaſion, and even of Thieves and Robbers; moreover the charge of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice would be much eaſier where Witneſſes and Parties may be eaſily Summoned, Attendance leſs expenſive when mens Actions would be better known, when wrong and Juſtice would not be covered as in thin-peopled places they are.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly thoſe who live in ſolitary places muſt be their own Soldiers, Divines, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and Lawyers, and muſt have their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſtored with neceſſary proviſions (like a Ship going upon a long Voyage) to the great waſt and needleſs expence of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions: the value of this firſt conveniency to the <hi>Dutch</hi> I reckon to be about 100 thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Holland</hi> is a level Country, ſo as, if in any part thereof a Wind-Mill may be ſet up, and by it's being moiſt and vaporous, there is always Wind ſtirring over it, by which advantage the labour of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hands is ſaved, foraſmuch as a Mill made by one man in half a year will do as much labour as 4 men for 5 years together; this advantage is greater or leſs where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and eaſe of Labour is ſo, but in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59749:341"/>
                           <hi>Holland</hi> it is eminently great, and the worth of this Conveniency between near 100 and 150 thouſand pound.</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly. there is much more to be gained by Manufacture than Husbandry, and by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe than Manufacture, but <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> being ſeated at the Mouths of 3 long great Rivers, and paſſing through rich Countries do keep all the Inhabitants upon the ſides of thoſe Rivers but as Husbandmen, whilſt themſelves are the Manufactors of their Commodities, and do diſpence them into all Parts of the World, making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns for the ſame at what price almoſt they pleaſe themſelves; and in ſhort, they keep the Trade of thoſe Countries through which the ſame Rivers paſs, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of this 3d convenience is 200 thouſand pound.</p>
                        <p n="4">4thly. In <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> there is ſcarce any place of work or buſineſs one Mile diſtance from a Navigable Water, and the charge of Water-carriage is generally but the 15th or 20th part of Land-carriages, wherefore if there be as much Trade there as in <hi>France,</hi> then the <hi>Hollanders</hi> can out-ſell the <hi>French</hi> 14/15 of all the Expence of all travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling poſtage and carriage whatſoever, which even in <hi>England</hi> I take to be 300 thouſand pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> where the very poſtage
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59749:342"/>
of Letters coſts the People perhaps 50 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> though farmed at much leſs, and all other Labours of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Porters at leaſt ſix times as much; the value of this conveniency I eſtimate to be above 300 thouſand pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5thly. The defenſibleneſs of the Country by reaſon of it's Situation in the Sea upon Iſlands, and in the Marſhes, impaſſible ground, dicked and trenched, eſpecially conſidering how the place is aimed at for it's Wealth, I ſay the charge for defending this Country is eaſier than if it were a plain Champion at leaſt 200 thouſand pound <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6thly. <hi>Holland</hi> is ſo conſiderable for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ships in Harbour with ſmall Expence of men and ground-tackle that it ſaves them <hi>per Annum</hi> 200 thouſand pounds of what muſt be ſpent in <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now if all theſe natural Advantages do amount to above one Million <hi>per Annum</hi> of profit, and that the Trade of all <hi>Europe,</hi> nay of the whole World, with which our <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans</hi> do trade, is not above 45 Millions <hi>per Annum</hi>; and if 1/50 of the value be 1/7 of the profit, it is plain that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> may command and govern the whole Trade.</p>
                        <p n="7">7thly. Thoſe who have their Situation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59749:342"/>
thus towards the Sea, abound with Fiſh at home, and having alſo the command of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, have by conſequence the Fiſhing Trade, whereof that of <hi>Herring</hi> alone brings more yearly profit to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> than the Trade of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> or of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to themſelves, being as ſome ſay <hi>viis</hi> and <hi>modis</hi> of above 3 Millions <hi>per Annum</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
                        <p n="8">8thly. It is not to be doubted but thoſe who have the Trade of Fiſhing and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping will ſecure themſelves of the Trade of Timber, for Ships, Boats, Maſts, and Casks, of Hemp for Cordage, Sails and Nets, of Salt, of Iron, as alſo of Pitch, Tar, Roſin, Brimſtone, Oyl and Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as neceſſary Appurtenances to Shipping and Fiſhing.</p>
                        <p n="9">9thly. Thoſe who predominate in Fiſhing and Shipping have more occaſion then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to frequent all parts of the World, and to obſerve what is wanting or redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant every where, and what each People can do, and what they deſire, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be the Factors and Carriers for the whole World of Trade, upon which ground they bring all Native Commodities to be Manufactured at home, and carried back to the Country where they grow, all which we ſee, for do they not work the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59749:343"/>
Sugars of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the Timber and Iron of <hi>Baltick,</hi> the Hemp of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the Lead, Tin, and Wool of <hi>England,</hi> the Quick-Silver and Silk of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Yarn and dying Stuffs of <hi>Turkey? &amp;c.</hi> to be ſhort in all the ancient States and Empires thoſe who had the Shipping had the Wealth; and if 2 <hi>per Centum</hi> in the price of Commodities, be perhaps 20 <hi>per Centum</hi> in the Gain, it is manifeſt that they who can in 45 Millions under-ſell others by one Million (upon Account of Mutual Intereſt and inſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Advantages only) may eaſily have the Trade of the World, without ſuch Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Wits and Judgments as ſome attribute to the <hi>Hollander.</hi>

                        <head>Having thus done with their Situation I come now to their Trade.</head>
                        <p>It is commonly ſeen that each Country flouriſheth in the Manufacture of it's own Native Commodity, <hi>viz. England</hi> for Woollen-Manufactures, <hi>France</hi> for Paper, <hi>Swihltand</hi> for Iron-ware, <hi>Portugal</hi> for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectures, <hi>Italy</hi> for Silks. Upon which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it follows, that <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> muſt flouriſh moſt in the Trade of Shipping, and ſo become Carriers and Factors to the whole World of Trade; now the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59749:343"/>
of Shipping Trade are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. Husbandmen, Sea-men, Souldiers and Merchants are the very Pillars of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, all the other great profeſſions do ariſe out of the infirmities and miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of thoſe: Now the Sea-man is 3 of theſe 4; for every Sea-man of induſtry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity is not only a Navigator, but a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, &amp; alſo a Souldier, not becauſe he has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten occaſion to fight, and handle Arms, but becauſe he is Mamilarized with hardſhip and hazards extending to Life and Limb; for Training and Duelling is a ſmall part of a Soldier, in reſpect of his laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Qualifications, the one being quickly and preſently learned, the other not without many years moſt painful Experience, wherefore to have the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of abounding in Sea-men is a vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency.</p>
                        <p n="2">2dly. the Husbandmen of <hi>England</hi> earn but about 4 <hi>s. per</hi> Week, but the Sea-man has as good as 12 <hi>s.</hi> in Wages, Victuals, Drink, and (as it were) Houſing with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accomodations, ſo a Seaman is ineffect 3 Husbandmen, wherefore there is little Ploughing or Sowing of Corn in <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Zealand,</hi> or breeding of young Cattle, but their Land is improved by building
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59749:344"/>
Houſes, Ships, Engines, Dickes, Wharfs, Gardens of pleaſure, extraordinary Flowers and Fruits, Dairy and feeding of Cattel, for Rape, Flax, Madder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of ſeveral Advantagious Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly. Whereas the imployments of other men is confined to their own Country, that of a Sea-man is free to the whole World; ſo as where Trade may (as they call it) be dead, here or there, now and then, it is certain that ſomewhere or other in the World, as Trade is always quick enough <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Proviſion is always plentiful, the Benefit whereof they who command the Shipping enjoy, and they only.</p>
                        <p n="4">4thly. The great and ultimate effects of Trade is not wealth at large, but particularly abundance of Silver, Gold, and Jewels which are not periſhable, but are wealth at all times and all places; whereas abundance of Wine, Corn, Fowl, Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are riches but <hi>hic et nunc</hi>: So as the raiſing of ſuch Commodities, and the following of ſuch Trade is not profitable before others, which do ſtore the Countrys with Silver, Jewels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the labour of Seamen and Freight of Ships, of the Nature of an exported Commodity, the over-plus whereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what is imported brings home Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59749:344"/>5thly. Thoſe who have the command of the Sea-Trade may work at eaſier Freight, with more profit then others at greater, for as Cloth muſt be cheaper made, when one Cards, another Spins, another Weaves, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Draws, another Dreſſes, another Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Packs; then when all the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons above mentioned were clunſily perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame hand; ſo thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Trade of Shipping, can build long ſlight Ships, for carrying Maſts, Firr, Timber, Boards, Bolkes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that one is for Lead, Iron, Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one ſort of Veſſels to Trade at Ports, where they need never ly aground, others where they muſt jump upon the Sand, twice every 12 hours, one ſort of Veſſel, and way of Manning in time of Peace, and for cheap groſs Goods, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for War, and precious Commodities, one ſort of Veſſel for the Turbulent Sea, another for Inland Waters and Rivers, one ſort of Veſſels and Rigging where haſt is requiſite, for the Maidenhead of a Market, another where ⅕ or 4/1 part of the time makes no matter, one ſort of Maſting and Rigging for long Voyages, another for Coaſting, one ſort of Veſſels for Fiſhing, another for Trade, one ſort for War, for this or the contrary, another for Burthen only, ſome for Oars, ſome for Poles, ſome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59749:345"/>
for Sails, and ſome for draught by men or Horſes, ſome for the Northern Navigations amongſt Ice, and ſome for the South a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Storms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this I take to be the chief of ſeveral Reaſons why the <hi>Hollanders</hi> can go at leſs Freight than their Neighbours <hi>(viz.)</hi> becauſe they can afford a particular ſort of Veſſels, for each particular Trade.</p>
                        <p>I have ſhewn how the Situation has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them Shipping, and how ſhipping in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects has given them all other Trade, and how Foreign Traffick muſt give them as much Manufactures as they can mannage themſelves, and as for the over-plus make the reſt of the World but as Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to their Ships; it now remains to ſhew the effects of their policy ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon theſe natural advantages, not as ſome think the exceſs of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I have omitted to mention that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were 100 years ſince a poor and oppreſſed People, living in a Country natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally cold moiſt and unpleaſant, and were withal perſecuted for their Etrodoxy in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                        <p>From whence it neceſſarily follows that this People muſt labour hard, and ſet all hands to work, and Rich and Poor, young and old muſt ſtudy the Art of Number, Weight and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, muſt fare hard, provide for Impotents,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59749:345"/>
and for Orphans, out of hope to make profit by their Labours, muſt puniſh the Lazy by Labours. I ſay all theſe particulars, ſaid to be the ſubtile Excogitations of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſeem to me but with what could not almoſt have been otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>Liberty of Conſcience, Regiſtry of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances, ſmall Cuſtoms, Banks, Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, and Law-Merchant, riſe all from the ſame Spring, and tend to the ſame Sea. As for Loans of Intereſt, 'tis alſo a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect of all the premiſes, and not the fruit of their contrivance.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore we ſhall only ſhew in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the Efficacy of each, and firſt, of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience; but before I enter upon theſe, I ſhall mention a practice almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, whether it refers to Trade or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is not material, which is, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> undermaſting and ſayling of ſuch of their Shipping as carry cheap and groſs Goods, and whoſe Sail doth not depend much upon Seaſon.</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted that of 2 equal and like Veſſels if one ſpreads 1600 yards of like Canvas, and the other 2500, their Speed is but as 4 to 5, ſo as one ſoon brings home the ſame Timber in 4 days, as the other will in 5, now if we conſider that although thoſe Ships be but 4 or 5 days under Sayl, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59749:346"/>
they are perhaps 30 upon the Voyage, ſo as the one is but 1/30 parts longer upon the whole Voyage than the other, tho ⅕ longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sail; now if Maſts, Yards, Rigging, Cables, and Anchors, do depend upon the quantity and extent of the Sails, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently hands alſo, it follows that the one Veſſel goes at 3/1 leſs charge loſing but 1/80 of the time and of what depends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                        <p>I come to the firſt Policy of the <hi>Dutch, viz,</hi> Liberty of Conſcience, which I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they grant upon theſe grounds, (but keeping up always a force to maintain the Common Peace)</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. They themſelves broke with <hi>Spain</hi> to avoid the Impoſition of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</p>
                        <p n="2">2dly. Diſſenters of this kind are for the moſt part thinking, ſober and patient men, and ſuch as believe, that Labour &amp; Induſtry is their duty towards God, (how Erroneous ſoever their Principles be.)</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly. Theſe People believing the Juſtice of God, and ſeeing moſt licentious perſons to enjoy moſt of the World and it's beſt things, will never venture to be of the ſame Religion and Profeſſion with voluptua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and men of extreme Wealth and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who they think have their Portion in this World.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59749:346"/>4thly. They cannot but know, that no man can believe what himſelf pleaſes, and to force men to ſay they believe when they do not, is vain, abſurd, and without Honor to God.</p>
                        <p n="5">5thly. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not to be an Infallible Church, and that others had the ſame Scriptures for guide as themſelves, and withal the ſame Intereſt to ſave their Souls, did not think fit to make this matter their buſineſs, no more but to make Bonds of the Seamen they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, not to caſt away their own Ships and lives.</p>
                        <p n="6">6thly. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> obſerve that in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> eſpecially the Latter, the Church men are about 100 to one, to what they uſe or need, the principal care of whom is to preſerve Uniformity, and this they take to be a ſuperfluous charge.</p>
                        <p n="7">7thly. They obſerve where moſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours have been uſed to keep Uniformity their Exterodoxy hath moſt abounded.</p>
                        <p n="8">8thly. They believe that if ⅕ of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were Exterodox, and that if the whole quarter ſhould by Miracle be removed, that within a ſmall time 4/1 of the Remainder would again become Exterodox ſome way or other, it being Natural for men to differ in Opinions in Matters above ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59749:347"/>
and for thoſe who have leſs Wealth to think thry have the more Wit and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, eſpecially in the things of God which they think chiefly to belong to the Poor.</p>
                        <p n="9">9thly. They think the caſe of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, as it is repreſented in the Acts of the Apoſtles, looks like that of the preſent Diſſenters, (I mean externally) moreover it is to be obſerved that Trade does not (as ſome think) beſt flouriſh under popular Government, but rather that Trade is more vigorouſly carried on in every State and Government by the exterodox par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſame, and ſuch as profeſs O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions differ from what are publickly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed (that is to ſay) in <hi>India</hi> where the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion is Authorized.</p>
                        <p>There the <hi>Banians</hi> are the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Merchants, in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, the <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians, at <hi>Venice, Naples, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorn, Genica,</hi> and <hi>Lisbon Jews,</hi> and now Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts Merchants Strangers. But to be ſhort, in the part of <hi>Europe</hi> where the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion now has, or lately has had Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, there 3 qrs. of the whole Trade is in the hands of ſuch as have ſeparated from the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as alſo theſe of the United Provinces, with <hi>Denmark,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59749:347"/>
Sweden</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> together with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the <hi>Norman</hi> Proteſtant Princes, and the Hans-Towns do at this day poſſeſs a quarter of the Trade of the World, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>France</hi> it ſelf the <hi>Hugonets</hi> are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably far the greateſt Trades, nor is it to be denyed but that in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the ſaid <hi>Roman</hi> Religion is not Authorized, but the profeſſors thereof have a great part of the Trade, from whence it follows that Trade is not fixed to any Species of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſuch, but rather as before hath been the ſaid, to the heterodox party of the whole; the truth whereof appears alſo in all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Towns of greateſt Trade in <hi>England</hi>; nor do I find reaſon to believe that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Seamen in the whole World are ſufficient to man effectually a Fleet equal to what the King of <hi>England</hi> now has, but the now Papiſt-Seamen can do above thrice as much. Wherefore he whom this latter party does effectionately own to be their Head, cannot probably be wronged in his Sea-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments by the Author; from whence it follows, that for the Advancement of Trade (if that be a Sufficient Reaſon) indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence muſt be granted in matters of Opinion, thoſe Licentious Actings as even in <hi>Holland</hi> be reſtrained by force.</p>
                        <p>The 2d. Policy or help to Trade uſed by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59749:348"/>
the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> is Securing the Titles to Lands and Houſes, for although Lands &amp; Houſes may be called <hi>Terra firma et res immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,</hi> yet the Title unto them is no more certain then it pleaſeth the Laws, and Authority to make them, wherefore the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> do by Regiſtries and other ways of aſſurance make the Title as immoveable as the Lands, for there can be no incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Induſtry where there is no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of what ſhall be gotten by it, and where by Fraud and Corruption one man may take away with eaſe and by a trick what another has gotten by extream labour and pains.</p>
                        <p>There has been much Diſcourſe about introducing of Regiſtories into <hi>England,</hi> the Lawyers for the moſt part do object againſt it, alledging the Titles of Lands in <hi>England</hi> are ſufficiently ſecure already; wherefore omitting the conſiderations, of ſmall and oblique Reaſons, <hi>pro et contra,</hi> it were good that enquiry were made from the Officers of ſeveral Courts to what Sum or Value pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers damnified for theſe laſt 10 Yeahs, by ſuch fraudulent conveyance as Regiſtries would have prevented, the 10th part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at a Medium is the annual loſs which the People ſuſtain for want of them, and then Computation is to be made, of the annual
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59749:348"/>
charge of Regiſtring ſuch extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances, would ſecure the Titles of Lands more by comparing theſe two Summs, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſo much agitated, may be determined.</p>
                        <p>Their third Policy is their Bank, the uſe whereof is to encreaſe money or rather to make a ſmall Sum equivalent to Trade in a greater, for the effecting whereof theſe things are to be conſidered: Firſt how much Money will drive the Trade of the Nation, 2dly, how much current Money there is actually in the Nation. 3dly. how much will ſerve to make all payments of under 5 Pound, or any other convenient Sum throughout the year. 4thly. for what Sum the Keepers of the Bank are unqueſtionable ſecurity. If all theſe 4 particulars be well known, then it may be alſo known how much of ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney above mentioned, may ſafely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be lodged in the Bank, and to how much ready current Money the ſaid depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mony is equivalent; (as for example) ſuppoſe 100 thouſand pounds will drive the Trade of the Nation, and ſuppoſe there be but 60 thouſand pounds of ready Mony in the ſame; ſuppoſe alſo the 20 thouſand pound will drive one, and anſwer all pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made of under 150 pound, in this caſe 40 of the 60 being put into the Brank will be equivalent unto 80, which 80, and 20,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59749:349"/>
kept out of the Bank, do make up 100, <hi>viz.</hi> enough to drive the Trade, as was purpoſed. Where note that the Bank-keepers muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for double the Sum intruſted with them, and muſt have power to levy upon the General weight they happen to loſe, unto particular Men; upon which grounds the Bankers may freely make uſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived 40 pound, whereby the ſaid Sum and with the like Sum in credit, makes 80 pound, and with the 20 reſerved 100.</p>
                        <p>I might here add many more particulars, but being the ſame has already been noted by others, I conclude only with adding one obſervation which I think to be of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> do ridd their hands of 2 Trades, which are of great tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moil and danger, and yet of leaſt profit. The 1ſt whereof is that of a common and private Soldier, for ſuch they can hire from <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their Lives for 6 pence a day, whilſt themſelves ſafely and quietly follow ſuch Trades whereby the meaneſt of them gain 6 times as much, and withal by this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Strangers for Souldiers their Country becomes more and more peopled, foraſmuch as the Children of ſuch Strangers are <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and take to Trades, whilſt new Strangers are admitted <hi>in finitum</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59749:349"/>
theſe Souldiers at convenient intervals, do at leaſt as much work as is equivalent to what they ſpend; and conſequently by this way of imploying of Strangers for Souldiers, they people the Country, and ſave their own Perſons from Danger and Miſery, without any real Expence; effecting by this Method, what others have in vain attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Laws for naturalizing of Strangers; as if men could be charmed to tranſport themſelves, from their own native, into a forreign Country, meerly by words, and for the bare leave of being called by a new Name. In <hi>Ireland,</hi> Laws for Naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have had little Effect, to bring in Aliens; and 'tis no wonder if Engliſhmen will not go thither, without they may have the pay of Souldiers, or ſome other Advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to Maintainance.</p>
                        <p>Having intimated the way by which the Hollanders do increaſe their People, I ſhall here digreſs to ſet down the way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the value of every Head one with another, and that the inſtance of People in <hi>England; (viz.)</hi> Suppoſe the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be ſix Millions in number, that their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence at 7 pound <hi>per</hi> head be forty two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, ſuppoſe alſo that the Rents of Lands be eight Millions, and the profit of all the perſonal Eſtate be ſix Millions more, it muſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59749:350"/>
needs follow, that the Labour of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſupplied the remaining thirty ſix Millions; the which multiplyed by twenty, (the maſs of Mankind being worth twenty years Purchaſe as well as Land) makes five hundred and twenty Millions, as the value of the whole People; which number divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſix Millions, makes above eight Pound Sterling to be the value of each Head, Man, Woman, and Child, and of a dull Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons twice as much: From whence we may learn to compute, the Loſs we have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Plague, by the ſlaughter of Men in War, and by ſending them abroad unto the Service of forreign Princes. The other Trade the Hollanders have ridd their Hand of, is the old patriarchal Trade of being Cowkeepers, and in a great meaſure of which concerns plowing and ſowing of Corn, have put that Imployment upon the Danes and Polanders, from whence they have their young Cattle and Corn. Here we may take notice that as Trades and curious Arts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſo the Trade of Husbandry will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, unleſs the Wages of Husbandmen muſt riſe, and conſequently the Rents of Lands muſt fall.</p>
                        <p>For proof whereof I dare affirm that if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59749:350"/>
could become Tradeſmen, and earn ſixteen Pence a day, which is no great Wages, two Shillings, and two Shillings and ſix Pence being uſually given; that then it would be the Advantage of <hi>England,</hi> to throw up their Husbandry, and make no uſe of their Lands, but for Graſs, Horſes, Milch-Cows, Gardens and Orchards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which if it be ſo, and that Trade and Manufacture have increaſed in <hi>England, (viz.)</hi> If a quarter part of the People apply themſelves to theſe Faculties more then they did heretofore, and if the price of Corn be no greater now then when Husbandmen were more numerous, and Tradeſmen fewer: It follows from the ſingle Reaſon (tho others may be added) that if the Rents of Lands muſt fall: as for Example, ſuppoſe the price of Wheat be fifty or ſixty Pence the Buſhel; now if the Rent of the Land whereon it grew be the third Sheaf, then of the ſixty Pence, twenty Pence is for the Land, and fourty Pence for the Husbandman; but if the Husbandman's Wages ſhould riſe ⅛ part, or from eight to nine Pence <hi>per diem</hi>; then the Husbandman's Share in the Buſhel of Wheat, raiſed from fourty to fourty five Pence, and conſequently the Rent of the Land muſt fall from twenty to fifteen Pence; for we ſuppoſe the price of the Wheat ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59749:351"/>
eſpecially ſince we can't raiſe it, for if we did attempt it Corn would be brought unto us as unto <hi>Holland,</hi> from Forraign parts, where the State of Husbandry was not changed.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have done with the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Concluſion, That a ſmall Territory and even a few people may by Situation Trade and Policy be made Equivalent to a far greater, and that conveniences for Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Water-Carriage do moſt Eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Fundamentally conduce thereunto.</p>

                     <p>IF the money or other Effects levied from the people by way of Tax were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and annihilated; then it is clear, that ſuch levies would diminiſh the Common-Wealth: or if the ſame were exported out of the Kingdom without any return at all, then

Beautifying the Country where they live by Elegant Diet, Apparel, Furniture, Houſing, Pleaſant Gardens and Orchards and Publick Edifices <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo are increaſing the Gold, and Silver, and Jewels thereof, by Trade and Armes; I ſay, if the Stock of theſe men ſhould be Diminiſhed by a Tax, and Transferred to ſuch as do nothing at all but to Eat, Drink, Sing, Play, Dance, nay to ſuch as Study the Metaphyſicks, or other needleſs Speculations, or elſe imploy themſelves in any other way which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth no material thing, or things of real uſe and value, in the common Wealth; in this caſe the Wealth of the Publick will be diminiſhed otherwiſe then as ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes are Recreations and Refreſhments of the minds; and which being moderately uſed, do qualify and diſpoſe men to what in it ſelf is more conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore upon the whole matter, to know whether a Tax will do good or harm, the State of the People and of their Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be well known, that is to ſay, what part of the People are unfit for Labour by their impotency and infancy, and alſo what part are exempt from the ſame by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Wealths, Function or Dignities, by reaſon of their charge and imployments, otherwiſe Governing Directing and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                     <p>Having in general illuſtrated this Point, which I think needs no other Proof but il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration, I come next to intimate that no part of <hi>Europe</hi> has paid ſo much by way of Tax as <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> for theſe laſt Forty years; and yet no Country has in the ſame time increaſed—comparably to them; and it is manifeſt they have followed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rates above-mentioned; for they Tax Meats and Drinks moſt heavily of all, to reſtrain the exceſſive expence of thoſe things which twenty four hours do's as to the uſe of man, wholly annihilate; and they are

more Favourable to Commodities to the greater duration: nor do they tax accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what men gain, but in extraordinary caſes, but alwaies according to what men ſpend, and moſt of all to what they ſpend needleſly and without Proſpect of return; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Grounds their Cuſtoms upon Goods imported and exported are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly low; as if they intended by them only to keep an Account, of what Forreign Trade, and to retaliate upon their Neighbours States, the prejudices done them by their Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Impoſition.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59749:354"/>
and yet one Monarch may be double as Rich as the other; <hi>viz.</hi> If one take the Tenth part of the Peoples Subſtance to his own diſpoſe, and the other Twentyeth; nay, the Monarch of a poor people may appear more ſplendid and glorious then that of a Richer; which perhaps may be ſomewhat the caſe of <hi>France,</hi> as hereafter ſhall be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. As an Inſtance and Application of what has been ſaid I conceive that in <hi>Ireland</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is above one hundred thouſand people, near three hundred thouſand Smoaks or Hearths, it were more tolerable for the people, and more profitable for the King, that each head paid two Shillngs-worth of Flax, then that each Smoke ſhould pay two Shillings in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and yet for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Ireland</hi> being under-Peopled, and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Land very cheap, ſtore of Fiſh and Fowl, the Ground yielding every where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Roots (and particularly that bread like Root-Potatoes) and withal they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to perform their Husbandry with ſuch Harneſs and Tackling as each man can make, living in ſuch Houſes as (almoſt) every man can Build; and every Houſwife being a Spinner and Dyer of Wool, and Yarn, they can live and Subject after their preſent Faſhions, without the uſe of Gold and Silver money, and can ſupply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59749:354"/>
with neceſſaries above named, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Labouring two Hours <hi>per diem.</hi> Now it has been found by reaſon of inſolvencies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, rather from the uſeleſneſs, then want of Money amongſt theſe poor People, that from 300000 Hearths, which ſhould have yielded 30 thouſand pounds, not much above 15000 thouſand pounds of money could be levied; whereas it is eaſily imagined that 4 or 5 People dwelling in that Cottage which has but one Smoke could eaſily have Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ground-Plat of 40 Foot Square with Flax, or the 50th. part of an Acre; for ſo much ground will bear eighth or Ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings-worth of that Commodity, and the rent of ſo much ground in few places amounts to a Penny; nor is there any skill requiſite to this Practice, wherewith the Country is not already Familiar. Now as for a Merchant for the ſaid Flax, there is imported into <hi>Holland</hi> it ſelf, over and above what the Country produces, as much Flax as is there ſold for between eighth Score and 200000 pound. And into <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is imported as much Linnen Cloth made of Flax and there Spent as is worth above half a Million of money, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewn. Wherefore having ſhewn that Silver money is uſeleſs to the poor People of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that half the Hearth-money could
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59749:355"/>
ſcarce be raiſed by Reaſon thereof, that the People are ⅕ part imployed, that the People and Land of <hi>Ireland</hi> are competently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifyed for Flax, that one Penny-worth of Land will produce Ten Shillings-worth of the ſame, and that there is Market enow and enow for above 100000 pounds-worth; I conceive my Propoſition ſufficiently prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at leaſt to ſet forward and promote a practice, eſpecially ſince if all the Flax ſo produced ſhould yield nothing, yet there is nothing loſt, the ſame time having been worſe ſpent before upon the ſame Ground: the like Tax of two Shillings <hi>per</hi> head, may be raiſed with the like advantage from the People of <hi>England</hi> which would amount to Six hundred thouſand pounds.—<hi>per Annum</hi> to be paid in Flax manufactured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all ſorts of Linens, Threds, Tapes and Laces which we now receive from <hi>France, Flanders, Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> the value whereof does far exceed the ſum laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as has appeared by the examination of Particulars.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved by Clothiers and others who imploy great numbers of poor people, that when Corn is extreamly plentiful the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Poor is Proportionably dear, and Scarce to be had at all; (So licentious are they who Labour only to Eat, or rather
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59749:355"/>
to Drink:) wherefore when ſo many Acres of Corn as do uſually produce ſufficient ſtore for the Nation, ſhall produce perhaps dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what is exported, or neceſſary; it ſeems not unreaſonable, that this common Bleſſing of God ſhould be imployed to the common good of the People, repreſented by their Sovereign; much leſs that the ſame ſhould be abuſed by the vile and brutiſh part of Mankind, to the prejudice of the Common-Wealth; and conſequently that ſuch Surpluſage of Corn ſhould be ſent to Publick Store-Houſes, from thence to be diſpoſed of to the beſt advantage of the Publick. Now if the Corn ſpent in <hi>England</hi> at five Shilings <hi>per</hi> Buſhel Wheat, and two Shillings ſix Pence Barley be worth 10,000,000. It follows that in Years in great Plenty when the ſaid Grains are ⅓ part cheaper, that a vaſt advantage might accrue to the Common-Wealth, which now is ſpent in once feeding the People in quantity, or quality, and ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in diſpoſing them to their uſual Labour. The like may be ſaid of Sugar, Tobacco, and Pepper, which Cuſtoms has now made neceſſary to all ſorts of People, and with overplanting them has made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably cheap; I ſay, it is not abſurd that the Publick ſhould be advantaged by this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59749:356"/>
Extraordinary Plenty.</p>

                        <p>The way of the preſent <hi>Militia</hi> or train-Bands in a Gentle Tax upon the Country, becauſe it is only a few Days Labour in the Year, of a few in reſpect of the whole, uſing their own Goods, that is, their own Armes. Now if there be 300,0000. of Males in <hi>England</hi> there be above 200,000. of them who are between the Age of ſixteen and thirty unmarryed Perſons, and who live by their Labour and Service; for of ſo many the preſent <hi>Militia</hi> conſiſts, and if 150,000. of theſe were Armed and trained as Foot, and 50000 as Horſe, the ſaid Force at Land together with 30,000. men at Sea, would by Gods ordinary Bleſſing, defend the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being an Iſland againſt any force in view; but the charge of Arming, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plining and rendevouzing all their men twice or thrice a Year would be a very Gentle Tax levied by the People themſelves and paid to themſelves. Moreover if out of the ſaid number ⅓ part were ſelected of ſuch as are more then ordinary fit for War, and exerciſed and rendevouzed fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59749:356"/>
times <hi>per Annum,</hi> the charge thereof being but a fortnights pay in the Year, would be alſo a very Gentle Tax. Laſtly if out of this laſt mentioned number ¼ again ſhould be ſelected, making 16,000. Foot, and 6000 Horſe to be Exerciſed and rendevouzed forty Days in the Year, I ſay that the charge of all theſe three <hi>Militia</hi>'s, allowing the latter ſix Weaks pay <hi>per Annum,</hi> would not coſt <hi>per Annum</hi> above 120,000. pounds which I take to be ſo eaſie a burthen for ſo great a Benefit.</p>
                        <p>Foraſmuch as the preſent <hi>Navy</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> requires 36,000. men to man it, and for that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade of Shipping re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires about 48,000. men to manage it, it follows that there ought to be about 48,000. competently qualifyed for theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; for want whereof, we ſee it is a long while before a Royal <hi>Navy</hi> can be made, which till it be, is of no Effectual uſe but lies at charge. And we ſee likewiſe upon their occaſions that Merchants are put to great ſtraights, and inconveniencies, and do pay exciſe-rates for the carrying on their Trade. Now if 24,000. able Bodyed Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whereby 6000 <hi>per Annum</hi> brought up and fitted for Sea-ſervice, and for their incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement allowed twenty Shillings <hi>per Annum</hi> for every Year they had been at Sea, even
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59749:357"/>
when they ſtay at home, not exceeding ſix pound for thoſe who have ſerved ſix years or upwards; it follows that about 72000. pound at the <hi>medium</hi> of three pound <hi>per</hi> man would ſo ſatiate the whole number; and ſo foraſmuch as half the Sea-men which manage the Merchants Trade are ſuppoſed to be always in Harbour, and are about 40000 together with the ſaid half, the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries laſt mentioned, would upon Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies man out the whole Royal <hi>Navy,</hi> leaving to the Merchant 12000 of the able Auxiliaries to perform their buſineſs in Harbour, till others come home from the Sea; I ſay that more then this Summ 72000 pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> is Fruitleſly ſpent &amp; over-paid by the Merchants whenſoever a great Fleet is to be fitted out. Now theſe whom I call Auxiliary Seamen are ſuch as have another Trade beſides wherewith to maintain themſelves when they are not imployed at Sea; and the charge of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining themſelves the 72000 pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> I take to be little or nothing for the Reaſons above-mentioned, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an eaſie Tax to the people becauſe levied by and paid to themſelves. As we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould be Taxed with Flax, and <hi>England</hi> by Linnen and other Manufactures of the ſame; ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59749:357"/>
that <hi>Scotland</hi> might be Taxed as much to be paid in Herrings, as <hi>Ireland</hi> in Flax. Now theſe three Taxes of Flax, Linnen and Herrings, and the maintenance of the Triple <hi>Militia,</hi> and of the Auxiliary Seamen above-mentioned, do all five of them together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 1,000,000. pounds of money, the raiſing whereof is not a Million ſpent but gain'd to the Common-Wealth, unleſs it can be made appear that by Reaſon of all or any of them the Exportations of Wollen Manufactures, Lead and Tin, are leſſened, or of ſuch Commodities as our own Eaſt and Weſt <hi>India</hi> Trade do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; for as much as I conceive that the Exportation of theſe laſt mentioned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities is the Touch-ſtone, whereby the Wealth of <hi>England</hi> is Tried, and the Pulſe whereby the Health of the Kingdom may be diſcerned.</p>

                     <p>POwer at Sea conſiſts chiefly in men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fight at Sea; and that in ſuch Shipping as is moſt proper for the Seas. Wherein they ſerve; and thoſe are in theſe Northern Sea-Ships from between 300 to 1300 Tuns, and of theſe ſuch as Draw much Water, and have a deep latih in the Sea, in order to keep a good Wind and not to fall too Leward, a matter of vaſt advantage in Sea-Service; wherefore it is to be Examined, firſt, Whether the French King has Ports in the Northern Seas, where he has moſt occaſion, for his Fleets of War in any Conſiſts above, to receive the Veſſels above-mentioned in all Weather, both in Winter and Summer Seats; for if the <hi>French</hi> King could bring to Sea an equal number of Fighting men with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59749:358"/>
in ſmall Float Leward Veſſels, he would certainly be of the weaker ſide; for a Veſſel of 1000 Tuns man'd with 500 Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men with five Veſſels of 200 Tuns each man'd with 100 men apiece, ſhall in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reaſon have the better offenſively and defenſively; for aſmuch as the great Ship can carry ſuch Ordnance as can reach the ſmall ones at a far greater diſtance, then theſe can reach, or at leſt hurt the other, and can batrer and ſink at a diſtance, when a ſmall one can ſcarce pierce.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is more difficult for men out of a ſmall veſſel to enter a tall Ship, then for men from an higher place to leap down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lower; nor is ſmall Shot ſo effectual upon a tall Ship, as <hi>vice verſa.</hi> And as for Veſſels drawing much Water, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently keeping a good Wind, they can toke or tear Leward Veſſels at pleaſure, and ſecure themſelves from being boarded by them.</p>
                     <p>Moreover the Windward Ship has a fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mark at a Leward Ship, then <hi>vice verſa,</hi> and can place her ſhot upon ſuch parts of the Leward Veſſel as upon the next tack will be under Water. Now the French King having no Ports able to receive large Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Veſſels between <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>

                        </gap> wherefore altho the French King were immenſly rich, and could build what Ships he pleaſed both for number and quality, yet if he have not Ports to receive and ſhelter that ſort and ſize of Shipping which is fit for his purpoſe, his Riches will in this caſe be Fruitleſs and a meer expence, without any return or profit. Some will ſay that other Nations can't build ſo good Ships as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I do indeed hope they can't; but becauſe it ſeems too poſſible that they may ſooner or later, by Practice and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I ſhall not make uſe of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, having only bound my ſelf to ſhew that the Impediments of <hi>France</hi> (as to this purpoſe) are natural and perpetual, Ships and Guns do not fight of themſelves, but men who act and manage them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is more material to ſhew that the French King, neither has, nor can have men ſufficient to man a Fleet of equal Strength, to that of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                        </gap> part muſt be Perſons of great Experience and Reputation in Sea-Service; another ⅛ part muſt be ſuch as have uſed the Sea ſeven Years, and upwards; half of them or ¼ part muſt be ſuch as have uſed the Sea above a twelve Month, <hi>viz.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, or ſix Years, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing but one quarter of the whole compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be ſuch as never were at Sea at all, or at moſt but one Voyage, or upon one Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſo that at a medium, I reckon the whole Fleet muſt be men of three or four Years growth one with another. <hi>Fournier,</hi> a late judicious Writer making it his buſineſs to perſuade the World how conſiderable the Kings of <hi>France</hi> was, or might be at Sea, in ninety two or ninety three Pages of his Hierography, ſaith, that there was one place in <hi>Britany</hi> which had Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the King with 1400 Seamen, and that perhaps the whole Sea coaſt of <hi>France</hi> might have furniſhed him with fifteen times as many. Now ſuppoſing the whole Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were true, yet the ſame number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts but to 21,000, all which if the whole Trade of Shipping in <hi>France</hi> were quite and clean abandoned, would not by above a third man in a Fleet, be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59749:360"/>
to that of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and if the Trade were but barely kept alive there would not be one third part men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to man the ſaid Fleet.</p>
                     <p>But if the Shipping Trade of <hi>France</hi> be not above a quarter as great as that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that one third part of the ſame, namely the Fiſhing Trade to the Banks of new-found Land is not peculiar nor Fixed to the <hi>French</hi>; then I ſay, that if the King of <hi>England</hi> who has Power to preſs men cannot under two or three Months time man his Fleet, then the French King with leſs then a quarter of the ſame help can never do it at all; for in <hi>France,</hi> as ſhall be elſewhere ſhewn, there are not a 15000 Tun of Trading Veſſels, and conſequently not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 15,000. Seamen reckoning a man to every tenth Tun, and it has been ſhewed that the French King can't at preſent man ſuch a Fleet as is above deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>We come next to ſhew that he never can bring under natural and perpetual impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt if there be but 15,000. Seaman in all <hi>France</hi> to manage it's Trade, it is not to be ſuppoſed that the ſaid trade ſhould be diſtinguiſhed, nor that it ſhould ſpare above five of the ſaid 15,000. towards managing of the Fleet, which requires 35,000. men; now the deficient 30000 muſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59749:360"/>
be ſupplyed out of theſe four ways; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by taking in Land-men, of which ſort there muſt not be above 10,000, ſince the Seamen will never be contented without being the Major part, nor do they Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh well to Land-men at all, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce even at thoſe Succeſſes of which the ſaid Land-men can claim any ſhare, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hard that themſelves, who are bred to Miſerable and Painful and dangerous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and yet profitable to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, ſhould at a time when Booty and purchaſe may be gotten, be Dog'd or hindred with any Conjunction, which Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are forced to admit theſe to any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſhare with themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Secondly the Seamen which are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed 20,000 muſt be had, that is, ſhired from other Nations, which can't be without Tempting 'em with ſo much wages as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that given by Merchants; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Counterpoyſe the dammage of being hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their own Prince, and allowed no quarter if taken, the trouble of carrying themſelves away when reſtraints are upon 'em, and alſo the infamy of having been Apoſtates to their Country and Cauſe. I ſay their wages muſt be more than double to what their own Prince gives them; and their <hi>Aurum</hi> muſt be very great, that they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59749:361"/>
ſhall not at long run be abuſed by thoſe who imploy them (as hating the Traytor tho loving the Treaſon) I ſay moreover that thoſe who will be thus tempted away muſt be of the baſeſt &amp; lewdeſt ſort of Seamen, &amp; ſuch as have not enough of Honor and Conſcience to qualifie them for any Gallant performance.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another way to exonerate Seamen is, to put great numbers of Land-men upon Ships of War in order to bring always Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but this courſe can't be effectual, not only for the abovementioned Antipathy between Land-men and Seamen, but alſo becauſe 'tis ſeen that men at Sea do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to Labour and Practice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more neceſſity then happens in over man'd Shipping. For where there are fifty men in a Veſſel that Ten can ſufficiently Navigate, the Supernumerary forty will improve little; but where there ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but one or two Supernumeraries, then neceſſity will often call upon every one to ſet his hand to the work, which muſt be well done at the Peril of their lives; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Seamen ſhifting Veſſels every ſix or twelve months, do ſometimes Sail in ſmall Barges, ſometimes in midlingſhips, and ſometimes in greater Veſſels of defence, ſometimes in Lighters, ſometimes in Hoyes, ſometimes in Ketches, ſometimes in three
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59749:361"/>
waſted Ships, ſometimes they go to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſometimes to the Southward, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they Coaſt, ſometimes they Croſs the Ocean; by all which Varieties of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they do in time compleat themſelves is every part and Circumſtance of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: Whereas thoſe who go out for a Summer in a man of War, have not the Variety of Practice, nor a direct neceſſity of doing any thing at all; beſides it is three or four Years at a medium that a Seaman muſt be made, neither can there be leſs then three Seamen to make the fourth of a Land<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man, conſequently the fifteen thouſand Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can increaſe but five thouſand Seamen in three or four Years, and unleſs their Trade ſhould increaſe with their Seamen in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, the King muſt be forced to be at the charge of this improvement, out of the quick Stock which is intolerable, ſo as the queſtion which now remains is whether the Shipping Trade of <hi>France</hi> is like to increaſe, upon which account it is to be conſidered, that <hi>France</hi> is ſtored with all kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries within it ſelf, as Corn, Cattle, Wine, Salt, Linnen-Cloth, Rape, Silk, Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As they need little Shipping to import more Commodities of Weight and Bulk, neither is there any thing of Bulk exported out of <hi>France</hi> but Wines and Salt,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59749:362"/>
the Weight whereof is under 1000,000. Tun <hi>per Annum,</hi> yielding not imployment to above twenty five thouſand Tun of Shipping, and theſe are for the moſt part <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who are not only already in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the ſaid Trade, but alſo are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitted to maintain it then the <hi>French</hi> are, or perhaps ever can be, and that for the following Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>French</hi> can't Victual ſo cheap as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> nor Sayl with ſo few Hands. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the <hi>French</hi> for want of good Coaſts and Harbours, can't keep their Ships in Port under the charge that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Hollanders</hi> can. Thirdly by Reaſon of the pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and diſtance of their Harbours one from another their Seamen and Tradeſmen relating to Shipping can't correſpond with, or Aſſiſt, one another ſo eaſily, cheaply, advantageouſly, as in other places; wherefore if their Shipping-Trade is not like to increaſe within themſelves, and much leſs to increaſe by their beating out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> from being the Carriers of the World, it follows then, their Seamen will not be increaſed by their increaſe of their Trade, wherefore and for that they are not like to be increaſed by any of their ſeveral ways above ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed, and for that their parts are not

                     <p>The aforenamed <hi>Fournier</hi> has Laboured to prove the contrary to all this in the ninety Second and ninety eight Page of his Hydrography, unto which I refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not thinking his Arguments of any Weight at all in the preſent caſe, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does he make his compariſon with <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Hollanders</hi> but with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who, nor the Grand Senior (the latter of whom has greater advantages to be Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at Sea then the French King) could never attain to any illuſtrious greatneſs in Naval Power, having after attempted but never ſucceeded in the ſame, nor is it eaſie to believe that the King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould for ſo many Years have continued in his Title to the Soveraignty of the narrow Seas, againſt his Neighbours ambitious enough to have gotten it from him, had not their impediments been natural and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and ſuch as we ſay do obſtruct the moſt Chriſtian King.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe Author of the State of <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many uſeful truths and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations he has, ſets down the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Territories of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to be, as thirty to eighty two; the which if it be true, then <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the Iſlands unto them belonging, will altogether be near as big as <hi>France</hi>; tho I ought to take all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for proving the Paradox in hand, I had rather grant that <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the Iſlands before mentioned, together with planted parts of new Found-Land, new <hi>England,</hi> new <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland, Virginy, Mary-Land, Caulin, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, Barmuda's, Barbado's,</hi> and all the reſt of the <hi>Carib</hi> Iſlands, do not contain more Territory then <hi>France,</hi> and what planted
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59749:363"/>
Land the <hi>French</hi> King has alſo in <hi>America</hi> a. And if any man will be Heterodox in behalf of the French Intereſt, I could be contented againſt my Judgment to allow the <hi>French</hi> King's Territories to be a ſeventh, ſixth, or fifth part greater then thoſe of the King of <hi>England,</hi> believing that both Princes have more Land then they do imploy to its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt uſe.</p>
                     <p>And here I beg leave among the ſeveral matters, I intend for ſerious, to interpoſe a jocular, and perhaps a Ridiculous digreſſion, and which I indeed deſire men to look upon rather as a Dream, then a rational Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Which is if that all the moveables and People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the High-lands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were tranſported into the Kingdom of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> that then the King and his Subjects, would thereby become more Rich and Strong; both offenſively and defenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then now they are.</p>
                     <p>Its true, I have heard many wiſe men ſay, when they were bewailing the vaſt Loſſes of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in preventing and ſuppreſſing Rebellions in <hi>Ireland</hi>; and conſidering how little profit has returned either to the King or Subjects of <hi>England</hi> for theſe five hundred Years doing and ſuffering in that Countrey; I ſay, I have heard Wiſe men in ſuch their Melancholies, wiſh that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59749:364"/>
of <hi>Ireland</hi> being ſaved, that that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland were ſunk under Water. Now it troubles me that the Diſtempers of my Mind in this point, carry me to Dream, that the Benefits of theſe Wiſhes may Practically be obtained without ſinking that vaſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Iſland under Water; which I take to be ſomewhat difficult, for altho <hi>Dutch</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers may drein its Bogs, yet I know no Artiſts that could ſink its Mountains.</p>
                     <p>If ingenious and Learned men, amongſt whom I reckon Sr. <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> and <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> have diſputed that we who think our ſelves awake, are, or may be really in a Dream: And if the greateſt abſurdity of Dreams, is but a Prepoſterous and Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary Contexture of Reallities, I will crave the umbrage of theſe great Men to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too, of this wild Conception, with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the better Judgments of all thoſe that can prove themſelves awake: If there were but one man Living in <hi>England,</hi> then the benefit of the whole Territories could be but the third Lively-hood of that one Man: But if another man were added, the Rent or Benefit of the ſame would be double, if three triple; and ſo forewards until ſo many were Planted in it, as the whole Territory could afford Food unto; for if a man would know what any piece
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59749:364"/>
of Land is worth, the true natural queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be; how many Men will it feed, and how many Men are there to be fed.</p>
                     <p>But to ſpeak more Practically, Land of the ſame quantity and quality in <hi>England,</hi> is generally worth three or four times as much as in <hi>Ireland</hi>? And but one quarter, and a third of what it is in <hi>Holland</hi>; becauſe <hi>England</hi> is four times ſo well Peopled as <hi>Ireland,</hi> and be a quarter ſo well as <hi>Holland</hi>: And moreover, where the Rent of Land is advanced, by reaſon of the multitude of People, there the number of years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for which the Inheritance may be ſold is alſo advanced, tho perhaps not in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Proportion; for twenty Shillings <hi>per Annum</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> may be worth but eight pound, and in <hi>England</hi> where Tithes are very ſure about twenty pound, in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> about thirty pound, I ſuppoſe that in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Highlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there may be above 1800,000 People, or about ⅕ part of what is in all the three Kingdoms. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt queſtion will be, whether <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Wales,</hi> or the <hi>Lowland</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> can't afford Food, that is to ſay, Corn, Fleſh, Fiſh, and Fowl, to a ⅕ more People then are at preſent planted upon it; with the ſame Labour that the ſaid ⅕ part does now take where they are, for if ſo, then what
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59749:365"/>
is propounded is naturally poſſible. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is to be inquired into, what the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables which upon ſuch removable, muſt be left behind are worth; for if they are worth leſs than the advancement of the price of Land in <hi>England</hi> will amount unto, then the Propoſal is to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the relict Land and the immovables left behind upon them may be ſold for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or if no other Nation ſhall dare to meddle with them without paying well for them, and if the Nation who ſhall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhall be leſs able to prejudice and annoy the Tranſplanters into <hi>England</hi> then before; then I conceive the whole propoſal will be a pleaſant Dream indeed.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt part, whether <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Lowlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> will mantain one fifth more then they now do, that is to ſay, nine Millions of Souls in all, I ſay, firſt that the ſaid Territories of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain about thirty ſix Millions of Acres, that is four Acres for every Head, Man, Woman and Child, but the united Provinces do not allow ½ Acre, and <hi>England</hi> it ſelf, reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Wales,</hi> has but three Acres to ever Head according to the preſent State of Tillage and Husbandry. Now if ſo conſidered that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> having but three Acres to a Head, do ſo abound in Victuals as that it makes Laws
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59749:365"/>
againſt the importation of Cattle, Fleſh and Fiſh from abroad, and that the Drein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Fens, improving of Forreſts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing of Commons, Sowing of cinque-Foyl and Clover-Graſs be grumbled againſt by Landlords, are the way to depreſs the price of Victuals, then it plainly follows, that till then three Acres improved, as it may be, will ſerve the turn, and conſequently that four will Suffice abundantly. I could here ſet down the very number of Acres that would bear Bread and Drink, Corn, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Fleſh, Butter, and Cheeſe, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Victual nine Millions of Perſons, as they are Victualled in Ships and regular Families; but I ſhall only ſay in general that 12,000,00. will do it, with ſuppoſing that Roots, Fruits, Fiſh, and Fowl, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary profit of Lead, Tin, Iron-Mines, and Woods would piece up any defect that may be found. As to the ſecond I ſay that the Land and Houſing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the preſent Merchant-Rates, are not worth ten Millions of money, nor would the actual charge of making the Tranſplantation amount to two Millions more; ſo then the queſtion will be whether the benefit expected from this Tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will exceed two Millions.</p>
                     <p>To which I ſay that the advantage will
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59749:366"/>
probably be ſix times the laſt mentioned Summ, or about ſeventy two Millions. For if the rent of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> and the low Land of <hi>Scotland</hi> be above nine Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions <hi>per Annum</hi>; and if this fifth part of the people be Superadded unto the preſent inhabitants of theſe Countries; then the rent will amount to 10,800,000. and the number of Years purchaſe will riſe from ſeventeen ½ to ⅕ more which is twenty one, ſo that the Land which is worth but nine Millions at ſeventeen ½ Years purchaſe mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hundred fifty ſeven Millions and a half will then be worth 10,800,000. at one and twenty Years purchaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 226,800,000. that is, 69,300,000. more then was before; and if any Prince willing to enlarge his Territories will give three Millions for the ſaid relinquiſhed Land and Houſing, which were eſtimated to be worth ten Millions, then the whole profit will be above 72,000,000. or ſix times the value as the ſame was above computed; but if any man ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that will be dangerous unto <hi>England</hi> to be put into the Lands of any other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I anſwer in ſhort that that Nation who ever ſhall purchaſe it being divided by means of the ſaid purchaſe, ſhall not be more able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <hi>England</hi> then now in it's united condition.</p>
                     <p>Now if any man ſhall deſire a more clear
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59749:366"/>
explanation how and by what means the Rents of Lands ſhall riſe by this cloſer coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of people above deſcribed, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the advantage will ariſe in Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting about eighteen thouſand people from the Poor and Miſerable Trade of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, to more Beneficial Handicraft; for which the Superaddition is to be made, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little addition of Husbandry to the ſame Lands will produce a fifth part more Food; conſequently the additional Hands earning but forty Shillings <hi>per Annum</hi> more, (as they may very well to eight pound <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> at ſome other Trade; the ſuperlucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be above 3,600,000. pound, which at twenty Years purchaſe is ſeventy two Millions. Moreover as the Inhabitants of Cities and Towns ſpend more Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and make greater conſumption then thoſe who live in wild thin Peopled Countries; ſo when <hi>England</hi> ſhall be thicker Peopled in manner before deſcribed, the very ſame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall then ſpend more then when they lived more ſordidly, inurbantly and further aſunder, and more out of the ſight, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Emulation of each other; every man deſiring to put on better Apparel when he appears in company, then when he has no occaſion to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>I further add to the charge of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59749:367"/>
Civil, Military, and Eccleſiaſtical, would be more cheap, ſafe and effectual, in this condition of cloſe habitation then otherwiſe, as not only Reaſon, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the united Provinces do demonſtrate. But let this whole digreſſion paſs from a meer Dream, I ſuppoſe will ſerve to prove that in caſe the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories ſhould be a little leſs then thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> King, that foraſmuch as neither of them are over Peopled, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not material to the queſtion in Hand; wherefore ſuppoſing the French Kings ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to be little or nothing in point of Territory, we come next to examine and compare the number of Subjects which each of thoſe Monarchs do govern. The Book called the State of <hi>France</hi> makes the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom conſiſt of twenty ſeven Pariſhes; and another Book written by a Subſtantial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who profoundly enquires into the State of the Church and Church-men of <hi>France,</hi> ſets down as an extraordinary caſe, that a Pariſh in <hi>France</hi> ſhould have ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souls, where I ſuppoſe the ſaid Author who has ſo well examined the matter, is not of opinion that every Pariſh one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother has above five hundred, by which reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the whole people of <hi>France</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirteen Millions 500,000: Now the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59749:367"/>
people of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> with the Iſlands adjoyning, by computation from the number of Pariſhes (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly have more people in Proteſtant Churches then in Popiſh Countries) as alſo from the Hearth-money, Poſt-money and Exciſe, do amount to above nine Millions; there are in new-<hi>England</hi> about fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men muſtered in Arms, about eighty thouſand able to bear Arms, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently about five hundred thouſand in all; but this laſt I leave to every man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and I ſee no Reaſon why in all the reſt of the Plantations there ſhould not be five hundred thouſand more, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently I ſuppoſe the King of <hi>England</hi> hath above ten Millions of Subjeſts, <hi>ubivis terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum orbis.</hi> Altho it be very material to know the number of Subjects, belonging to each Prince; yet when the queſtion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Wealth and Strength, it is alſo material to examine how many of 'em do get more then they ſpend, and how many leſs: in order whereunto, it is to be conſidered, that in the King of Englands do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions there are twenty thouſand Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but in <hi>France,</hi> as the aforementioned Author of theirs does aver who ſets down the particular number of each Religious order, there are about 270000. <hi>viz.</hi> 250000.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59749:368"/>
more then we think are neceſſary; that is to ſay, two hundred and fifty thouſand with-drawn out of the World; now the ſaid number of adult and able-Bodyed Perſons are equivalent to about double the ſame number of the Promiſcuous Maſs of Mankind; and the ſame Author affirms that the ſaid Religious Perſons do ſpend one with another above eighteen pence <hi>per diem</hi> which is Triple to what a Labouring man requires: Wherefore the ſaid two hundred &amp; fifty thouſand Church-men, living as they do make the <hi>French</hi> King 13,500. thouſand to be really no better then twelve Millions or thereabouts. In the next place it is to be conſidered that the inhabitants of the inner parts of <hi>France</hi> remote from the Sea can't be probably Superlucrators. Now if there be two Millions in the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Dominions more then in the French Kings who earn more then they ſpend, or if ten men in <hi>England</hi> earn more then twelve in <hi>France,</hi> then the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> are as effective as to the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wealth and Riches as thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> and if Ten men can defend themſelves as well in Iſlands as twelve men upon the Continent, then the ſaid Ten being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to increaſe their Territory by the invaſion of others are as effectual as the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59749:368"/>
twelve in point of Strength alſo; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there are more Superlucrators in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> then in the <hi>French</hi> Dominions, we ſay as followeth. There be in <hi>England Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> about ſixty Millions Seamen, in <hi>France</hi> about a quarter ſo many; but one Seaman earns as much as three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Husbandmen; wherefore this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Seamen added to the account of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Subjects, the equivalent of 90,500,000. Husbandmen.</p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> ſix thouſand Tuns of Shipping, worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 4500,000. 4 ½. and the actual charge of maintaining the Shipping aforeſaid by new building and reparation is about ⅓ of the ſaid Summ, which is the wages of 150. Husbandmen, but it is not the wages of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ⅓ ſo many Artiſans as are imployed upon Shipping of all ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights, Calkers, Joyners, Carvers, Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Blockmakers, Rope-makers, Maſtmak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Smiths of ſeveral ſorts, Flagmakers, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsmakers, Brewers, Bakers, and all ſorts of Victuallers, all ſorts of Tradeſ-men relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Guns and Gunners-Stores; wherefore there being four times more of theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans in <hi>England</hi> then in <hi>France,</hi> they further add to the account of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Subjects the equivalent 80 m. Husbandmen more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:59749:369"/>The Sea line of <hi>England Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> and the adjacent Iſlands is about 3,800. Miles, according to which length and the whole content of Acres the ſaid Land would be an oblong or Parallelogram Figure of 3,800. long, and twenty five Miles broad, and conſequently every part of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> is one with another but about twelve Miles from the Sea; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>France</hi> containing but about one thouſand Miles of Sea line is like the computation above ſixty five Miles from the Sea-ſide, and conſidering the paucity of Ports in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to what are in the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Dominions as good as ſeventy Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from a Port; upon which grounds it is clear that <hi>England</hi> can be ſupplyed with all Groſs and Bulky Commodities of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign growth and manufacture at far cheaper rates then <hi>France</hi> can be; <hi>viz.</hi> above four Shillings <hi>per Annum</hi> Rent cheaper the Land carriage; for the difference (betwen <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France</hi>) of the diſtance from a Port being ſo much or near thereabouts, now to what advantage this convenience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts upon the importation and expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Bulky Commodities, can't be leſs the Labour of one thouſand of People, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Bulky Commodities all ſort of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Blank and Staves for Cask, and all Iron,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59749:369"/>
Lead, Stones, Brick, and Tiles for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; all Corn, Sart and Drink, all Fleſh and Fiſh, and indeed all other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, wherein the gain and loſs of four Shillings <hi>per cent.</hi> is conſiderable. Where note the like Wines are ſold in the inward parts of <hi>France</hi> for four or five pounds a Tun which near the Ports yield ſeven pound.</p>
                     <p>Moreover upon this principal the decay of Timber in <hi>England</hi> is no very formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing; as the rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> and of the Ships waſted by the Dutch-War, do clearly manifeſt: nor can there be any want of Corn or other neceſſary proviſion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> unleſs the Weather has been univerſally unſeaſonable for growth of the ſame, which ſeldom or never happens; for the ſame cauſe which makes dearth in one place, does after cauſe plenty in another, wet-weather being propitious to Highlands, which drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the low.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved that the poor of <hi>France</hi> have generally leſs wages then in <hi>England,</hi> and yet their Victuals are generally dearer there, which being ſo, there may be more Superlucration in <hi>England</hi> then in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly I offer it to the conſideration of all thoſe who have travelled through <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> whether the Plebeian of <hi>England,</hi> for they conſtitute the Bulks of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59749:370"/>
any Nation; do not ſpend one ſixth more then the Plebeian of <hi>France</hi>; and if ſo it is neceſſary they muſt firſt get it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that Ten Millions of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Subjects are equivalent to twelve of the French Kings, and upon the whole matter to the thirteen ½ Millions, at which the <hi>French</hi> Nation was eſtimated.</p>
                     <p>It will be here objected that the Splendor and Magnificences of the French King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing greater then thoſe of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> that the Wealth of <hi>France</hi> muſt be proportionably greater then that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but that does not follow forasmuch as the apparent greatneſs of the King does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the quarter parts of the peoples Wealth which he levieth from them; for ſuppoſing the People are equally Rich; if one of the Sovereigns levy fifth part, and the other fifteenth, the one ſeems actually thrice as Rich as the other, whereas potentially they are both equal.</p>
                     <p>Having now dicourſed of the Territory, People, Superlucration and defenſibleneſs of both Dominions, and in ſome meaſure of the Trade, ſo far as we had occaſion to mention Ships, Shipping and nearneſs to Ports, we come next to enlarge a little further upon the Trade of each, ſome have eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated that there are not above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59749:370"/>
Millions of people in the whole World, whether that be ſo or no is not very material to be known; but I have fairer Ground to conjecture, and would be glad to have it more certainly, that there are not above eighty thouſand with whom the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have commerce, no <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans</hi> I know of Trading directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly where they do not ſo as the whole commercial World or World of Trade con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of eighty thouſand of Souls as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                     <p>And I further eſtimate that the value of all the Commodities, yearly exchanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, does not exceed fourty five thouſand; now the Wealth of every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſting chiefly in the ſhare which they have in forreign Trade with the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial World; rather then in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Trade of ordinary Meat, Drink, Cloth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And which brings in little Gold, Silver, Pearls and other univerſal Wealth; we are to conſider the Subjects of the King of <hi>England</hi> (Head for Head) have not a greater ſhare hereof then thoſe of <hi>France.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. V. That the Impediments of <hi>England</hi>'s Greatneſs are contingent and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</head>
                     <p>THe firſt impediment of Englands Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, the Territories thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing are too far aſunder and divided by the Sea into ſo many ſeveral Iſlands and Countries; and I may ſay into ſo many Kingdoms and different Governments, <hi>viz.</hi> There be three diſtinct Legiſlative Powers in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the which of inſtead of uniting together do often croſs one and others Intereſt, putting Bars and Impediments upon one and others Trades; not only as they were forraigners to each other, but ſometimes as Enemies.</p>
                     <p>The Iſlands of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Man</hi> are under juriſdictions diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe either of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Government of <hi>New-England</hi> (both civil and Eccleſiaſtical) do ſo differ from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59749:373"/>
that of his Majeſties other Dominions, that it is hard to ſay what may be the Conſequence of it.</p>
                     <p>And the Government of the other Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations do alſo differ very much from any of the Weſt, altho there be naturally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Reaſons for the Situation, Trade and Condition of the People, why there ſhould be ſuch differences; from all which it comes to paſs the ſmall divided remote Governments being ſeldom able to defend themſelves, the Burthen of the Protecting them all, muſt lye upon the chiefeſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi>; and all the ſmall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Dominions, inſtead of being addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are really diminutions.</p>
                     <p>The Wealth of a King is three-Fold, one is the Wealth of Subjects, the ſecond is the quota parts of his Subjects Wealth given him for the Publick Defence, Honour and Ornaments of the people, and to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſuch undertakings for the common good as no one, or a few private men, are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for.</p>
                     <p>The third ſort are the quota of the laſt mentioned quota parts which the King may diſpoſe of as his own Perſonal inclination and diſcretion ſhall direct; now it is moſt manifeſt that the aforementioned diſtance and differences of Kingdoms, and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59749:373"/>
are great impediments to all the ſaid ſeveral ſorts of Wealth, as may be ſeen in the following particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In caſe of War with forraign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>England</hi> commonly beareth the whole Burthen and charge, whereby many in <hi>England</hi> are utterly undone.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>England</hi> ſometimes prohibiting the Commodities of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> (as of late it did the Cattle, Fleſh, and Fiſh, of <hi>Ireland,</hi>) did not only make Food, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Labour, dearer in <hi>England,</hi> but alſo has forced the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> to fetch theſe commodities from <hi>France, Holland</hi> and other places which before was ſold them from <hi>England,</hi> to the great Prejudice of both Nations.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It occaſions an unneceſſary trouble and charge in collecting of Cuſtoms upon Commodities paſſing between the ſeveral Nations.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is a dammage to our <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and other American Trades, that the Goods, which might paſs thence immediately to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the World, and be ſold at moderate Rates, muſt firſt come into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and there pay Duties, and afterwards (if at all) paſſing to thoſe Countries whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might have gone immediately.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Iſlands of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey</hi>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:59749:374"/>
are protected at the charge of <hi>England,</hi> nevertheleſs the Labour and Induſtry of that People (which is very great) redound moſt to the profit of the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. In <hi>New-England</hi> there are vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of able Bodied Engliſh-men imployed chiefly in Husbandry, and in the meaneſt part of it (which is) breeding of Cattle, whereas <hi>Ireland</hi> would have contained all thoſe Perſons, at the worſt would have afforded them Lands in better Terms then they have them in <hi>America,</hi> if not ſome other better Trade withal, then now they can have.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Inhabitants of the other Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, altho they do indeed Plant commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which will not grow ſo well in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it graſping at more Land then it will ſuffice to produce the ſaid exotics in a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity to ſerve the whole World, they do therein but diſtract and confound the effects of their own Indeavours.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. There is no doubt that the ſame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple far and wide diſperſed muſt ſpend more upon their Government and Protection then the ſame living compactly, and when they have no occaſion to depend upon the Wind, Weather, and all the Accidents of the Sea.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond impediment to the greatneſs of <hi>England,</hi> is the different underſtanding of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59749:374"/>
ſeveral material points, <hi>viz.</hi> The Kings Prerogative, Priviledges of Parliament, the obſcure differences between Law and Equity, as alſo between Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, doubts whether the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> has Power over the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> beſides the wonderful Paradox, that the Engliſh-men lawfully ſent to ſuppreſs Rebells in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould (after having ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the ſame) be (as it were) disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed, and looſe that intereſt in the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Power which they had in <hi>England,</hi> and pay Cuſtomes as forraingers for all they ſpend in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whither they were ſent for the Honour and Benefit of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third impediment is that <hi>Ireland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conquered Country, and containing not the Tenth part of as many <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſtives as there are <hi>Engliſh</hi> in both Kingdoms, that natural and firm Union is not made between the two Peoples by Tranſplantation and proportionable Mixture, ſo as there may be a Tenth part of <hi>Iriſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the ſame Proportion in <hi>England,</hi> whereby the neceſſity of maintaining an Army in <hi>England</hi> at the expence of the quarter of all the Rents of that Kingdom may be taken away.</p>
                     <p>The fourth impediment is that the Taxes in <hi>England</hi> are not levied upon the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59749:375"/>
but the whole Eſtate, not upon Lands, Stock and Labour, but chiefly upon Land alone, and that not by any equal and indifferent Standard, but the caſual Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy of Parties and Factions; and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that theſe Taxes are not levied with the leaſt trouble and charge, but let out to Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who alſo let them from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without explicit knowledge of what they do, but ſo are to conclude the poor people pay twice as much as the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives.</p>
                     <p>Now the fifth impediment is the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Shires, Dioceſſes, Pariſhes, Church-livings, and other Precincts, as alſo of the Repreſentations of the people in Parliament, all which do hinder the operations of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in the ſame manner as a Wheel irregularly made, and excentrically hung neither moves ſo eaſily, nor performs it's work ſo timely, as if the ſame were duly framed and poiſed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whether it be an impediment that the Power of making War and raiſing money be not in the ſame hand much may be ſaid; but that I leave to thoſe who may more properly meddle with Fundamental Laws. None of theſe impediments are natural but did ariſe as the irregularities of Buildings do by being built part at one time and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59749:375"/>
part at another, and by the changing of the State of things from what they were at the reſpective times, when the Practice we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of were firſt admitted, and perhaps are but the warpings from the rectitude of the firſt inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>As theſe Impediments are contingent ſo they are alſo removable, for may not the Land of Superfluous Territories be ſold, and the people with their moveables be brought away? may not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>American</hi> Plantations who Plant Tobacco, Sugar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> compute what Land will ſerve their turns, and then contract their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to that proportion, for quantity and quality? As for the people of <hi>New England</hi> I can but wiſh they were Tranſplanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to old-<hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of their own, made within this twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years, altho they were allowed more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience then they allow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>May not the three Kingdoms be united into one, and equally repreſented in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? might not the ſeveral Species of the Kings Subjects be equally mixt in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations? might not Pariſhes and other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts be better equaliz'd? might not juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Pretences of Powers be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and aſcertained? might not Taxes be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59749:376"/>
equally aplotted and directly applyed, to their ultimate uſe? might not diſſenters in Religion be indulged, they paying a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent force to keep the Publick-Peace? I humbly venture to ſay all theſe things may be done; if it be thought fit by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power, becauſe the like has often and Succesfully been done already at Several Places, and Times.</p>

                  <div n="6" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. VI. That the Power and Wealth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has increaſed theſe laſt forty Years.</head>
                     <p>IT is not much to be doubted but that the Territories under the Kings Dominions have increaſed, for as much as <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Virginy, Barbados,</hi> and <hi>Jamaica, Tangier,</hi> and <hi>Bombay,</hi> have ſince that time been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added to his Majeſties Territories, or improved from a deſert condition to abound with the People, Building, Shipping, and the Production of many uſeful commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59749:376"/>
And as for the Land of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> as it is not leſs in quantity then it was forty Years ſince, ſo it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that by Reaſon of dreining of Fens, Watering of dry Grounds, improving of Forreſts, and Commons, making of Heaths and barren Grounds to bear Cinquefole, and Clovergraſs, meliorating and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying ſeveral ſorts of Fruits and Garden-ſtuff, making ſome Rivers Navigable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay it is manifeſt, that the Land in it's preſent condition is able to bear more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and commodities then it was forty Years ago.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Altho the People of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which have Extraordinarily Periſhed by the Plague and Sword with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this laſt forty Years, do amount to about three hundred thouſand, above what have dyed in the ordinary way, yet the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry increaſe by Generation of Ten Millions, which doubles in two hundred Years, as has been ſhewn by the obſervations upon the Bills of Mortality, may in forty Years (which is a fifth part of the ſaid Time) have increaſed near a fifth part of the whole number or two Millions. Where note by the way, that the acceſſion of <hi>Negroes</hi> to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> Plantations, being all men of great Labour and little Expence, is not conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59749:377"/>
Beſides it is hoped that <hi>New-England,</hi> where few or no Women are Barren, and muſt have many Children, and where peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple live long and Healthfully, has produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced an increaſe of as many people as were deſtroyed in the late tumults in <hi>Ireland.</hi> As for Houſing theſe Streets of <hi>London</hi> it ſelf ſpeaks it, I conceive it double in value in that City to what it was forty Years ſince; and for Houſing in the Country, they have increaſed at <hi>Briſtol, New-Castle, Yarmouth, Norwich, Exeter, Portsmouth, Cowes, Dublin, Kingſale, Londondary, Coolervin</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> far beyond the Proportion of what I can learn has been dilapidated in other places; for in <hi>Ireland</hi> where the ruine was greateſt, (the Houſing taken altogether) is now more valuable then forty Years ago; nor is this to be doubted, ſince Houſing is now more ſplendid then in thoſe days, and the number of Dwellers is increaſed by near a fifth part, as in the laſt Paragraph is ſet forth.</p>
                     <p>As for Shipping, his Majeſties Navy is now triple, or quadruple to what it was forty Years ſince, and before the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign was Built; the Shipping-Trading to <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> which are now about eighty thouſand Tuns could not then be above a quarter of that quantity; firſt becauſe the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59749:377"/>
City of <hi>London</hi> is doubled; ſecondly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the uſe of Coal is alſo at leaſt dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, becauſe they were heretofore ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom uſed in Chambers as now they are; nor were there ſo many Bricks Burned with them as of late, nor did the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on both ſides the <hi>Thames</hi> make uſe of them as now; beſides, there are imployed in the <hi>Guinny</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Trades above forty thouſand Tun of Shipping, which Trade in thoſe days was inconſiderable, the quantity of Wines imported was not near ſo much as now, and to be ſhort, the Cuſtoms upon imported and exported com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities did not then yield a third part of the preſent Value; which ſhews, that not only Shipping, but Trade it ſelf has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſomewhat near that Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As to money the intereſt thereof, was within theſe fifty Years at Ten pound <hi>per cent.</hi> forty Years ago at eight pound, and now at ſix pound, no thanks to any Laws which have been made to that purpoſe; for as much as thoſe who can give good ſecurity may now have it leſs, but the natural fall of intereſt, is the effect of the increaſe of money.</p>
                     <p>Moreover if Rented Lands and Houſes have increaſed, and if Trade has increaſed alſo, it is certain that money, which pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59749:378"/>
thoſe Rents and driveth on Trade, muſt have increaſed alſo.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly I leave it to the conſideration of all obſervers, whether the number and Splendor of Coaches, Equipage, and Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Furniture have not increaſed ſince that time. To ſay nothing of the poſtage of Letters, which have increaſed from one to twenty, which argues the increaſe of Buſineſs and Negotiation; I muſt add that his Majeſties Revenues is near tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore the means to pay and Bear the ſame has increaſed alſo.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII. That one tenth Part of the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is ſufficient to maintain one hundred thouſand Foot, forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and forty thouſand men at Sea, and defray all other Charges of the Government; both ordinary, and extraordinary, if the ſame were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly Taxed and raiſed.</head>
                     <p>TO clear this point we are to find out what is the middle Expence of each Head in the Kings Dominions between the higheſt and the loweſt; to which I ſay it is not probably leſs then the Expence of a Labourer, who earns about eight pence a day, for the wages of ſuch men is four Shillings a Week without Victuals, or two Shillings with it; wherefore the value of his Victuals is two Shillings <hi>per</hi> Week, or five pound four Shillings <hi>per Annum.</hi> Now the value of Cloaths can't be leſs then wages given to the Pooreſt Maid-Servant in the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59749:379"/>
Country, which is thirty Shillings <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> nor can the charge of all other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries be leſs then ſix Shillings <hi>per Annum</hi> more, wherefore the whole charge is ſeven pound.</p>
                     <p>It is not likely that this Diſcourſe will fall into the Hands of any that lives at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven pound <hi>per Annum</hi>; and therefore ſuch will wonder at this Suppoſition; but if they conſider how much the number of the Poor and their Children is greater, then that of the Rich, altho the perſonal Expence of ſome Rich men ſhould be above twenty times more then that of a Labourer; yet the expence of a Labourer above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, may well enough ſtand for the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the expence of the whole Maſs of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>Now if the expence of each man one with another be ſeven pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> and if the number of the Kings Subjects be Ten thouſand; then the tenth part of the whole Expence will be ſeven thouſand; but about five thouſand, or a very little more will amount to a years pay for one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot; forty thouſand Horſe, and forty thouſand men at Sea, Winter and Summer, which can rarely be neceſſary, and other ordinary charge of the Government in the time of deep and ſecute peace was not 600000 <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59749:379"/>Where a People thrive there the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come is greater then the Expence; and conſequently the tenth part of the Expence is not the tenth part of the Income. Now for men to pay a tenth part of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in a time of greateſt exigency (for ſuch it muſt be when ſo great forces is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite) can be no hardſhip, much leſs a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable conditon, for to bear the tenth part, a man muſt needs ſpend a twentyeth part leſs, and Labour a twentieth part more for half an hour <hi>per diem</hi> extraordinary; both which in common Experience are very Tolerable, here being very few in <hi>England,</hi> who do not eat by a twentieth part more then does them good: and what Miſery were it, inſtead of wearing Cloaths of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Yard to be contented with that of nineteen Shillings, few men having skill enough to diſcern the difference?</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. That there are ſpare Hands enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to earn two Millions <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> more then they now do, and that there are alſo Imployments ready, proper and ſufficient, for the purpoſe.</head>
                     <p>TO prove this point, we muſt inquire how much all the People could earn if they were diſpoſed or neceſſitated to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and had work whereupon to imploy themſelves, and compare the Summ with that of the Total Expence abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; deducting the Rents and profit of their Land and Stock, which properly ſpeaking ſaveth ſo much Labour. Now the proceed of the ſaid Land and Stock in theſe Countries is about three parts of ſeven of the whole Expence; ſo as where the expence is ſeventy thouſand, the Rent of the Land and profit of all Perſonal Eſtate, intereſt of money <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be about thirty thouſand, and conſequently the value of the Labour forty
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59749:380"/>
thouſand; that is, four pound <hi>per</hi> Head; but it is to be noted, that about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Maſs of Mankind are Children Males and Females under ſeven Years old, from whom little Labour is to be expected; it is alſo to be noted that about another tenth part of the whole people are ſuch as by Reaſon of their great Eſtates, Tythes, Dignities, Offices, and profeſſions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from that kind of Labour; we now ſpeak of their buſineſs being or ought to be to Govern, Regulate, and direct the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Actions of others, ſo that of Ten Millions there be about ſix thouſand &amp; a half, or two thirds which if need requires might actually Labour, and of theſe ſome might earn three Shillings a Week, ſome five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ſome ſeven Shillings, that is, all of them might earn five Shillings a Weak at a <hi>medium</hi> one with another, or at leaſt Ten pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> allowing for Sickneſs and other Accidents whereby the whole might earn fifty ſix thouſand pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> that is, twenty five more then the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
                     <p>The Author of the State of <hi>England</hi> ſaies that the Children of <hi>Norwich</hi> between ſix and ſixteen Years old do earn twelve thouſand pound <hi>per Annum</hi> more then they ſpend. Now for as much as the people of <hi>Norwich</hi>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59749:381"/>
are a three hundredth part of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>England</hi> (as appears by the Accompt of Hearth-money) and about the five hundredth part of all the Kings Subjects throughout the World, it follows that all his Majeſties Subjects between ſix and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years old might earn five thouſand <hi>per Annum</hi> more then they ſpend. Again forasmuch as the number of People above ſixteen Years old are double the number of thoſe between ſix and ſixteen, and that of each men can earn double to each of the Children, it is plain that if the men and Children every where did do as they do in <hi>Norwich</hi> they might earn twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound <hi>per Annum</hi> more then they ſpend; which eſtimate grounded upon matter of Fact and Experience, agrees with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                     <p>Altho as has been proved the people of <hi>England</hi> do thrive, and that 'tis poſſible they might Superlucrate twenty five thouſand pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> yet 'tis manifeſt they do not nor twenty three which is leſs by two thouſand herein meant; for if they did Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlucrate twenty five thouſand, then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or ſix Years time the whole Stock and Perſonal Eſtate of the Nation would be double, which I wiſh were true, but find no manner of Reaſon to believe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59749:381"/>
if they can Superlucrate twenty five, but not actually Superlucrate twenty three, nor twenty, nor ten, nor perhaps five, I have then proved what was propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are ſpare hands among the Kings Subjects to earn two Millions more then they now do.</p>
                     <p>But to ſpeak a little more particularly concerning this matter, it is to be noted, that ſince the fire of <hi>London,</hi> there was earned in four Years by Tradeſmen (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to building only) the Summ of four Millions, or one Million <hi>per Annum</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leſſening any other ſort of Work La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or Manufacture, which was uſually done in other four Years before the ſaid occaſion; but if the Tradeſmen relating to Building only, and ſuch of them as wrought in and about <hi>London</hi> could do one Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-worth of Work extraordinary, I think that from thence and from what has been ſaid before, that all the reſt of the ſpare Hands might very well double the ſame, which is as much as was propounded. Now if there were ſpare Hands to Superlucrate Millions of Millions, they ſignifie nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there were Imployment for them, &amp; may as well follow their Pleaſures and Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as Labour to no purpoſe; therefore the more material point is to prove that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59749:382"/>
there is two Millionsw-orth of Work to be done, which at the preſent the Kings Subjects do neglect.</p>
                     <p>For the proof of this there needs little more to be done than to compute how much money is paid by the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Subjects to Forreingers for freight of Shipping.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> gain by their Fiſhing-Trade Practiſed upon our Seas.</p>

What the value of all the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities imported into and ſent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which might by diligence be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Manufactured, here to make ſhort of this matter upon peruſal of the moſt authentick accompts relating to theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particulars I affirm that the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth to above five Millions whereof I propounded but two Millions.</p>
                     <p>For a further proof whereof Mr. <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Fortry</hi> in his ingenious diſcourſe of Trade exhibited the particulars, wherein it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Goods imported out of <hi>France</hi> only amount yearly to 2600,000. pounds, and I affirm that the Wines, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Cork, Roſin, and Capers, and a few other Commodities which <hi>England</hi> can't produce, do not amount to one fifth part of the ſaid Summ; from whence it follows that (if Mr. <hi>Fortry</hi> has not erred) the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59749:382"/>
two Millions here mentioned may ariſe from <hi>France</hi> alone, and conſequently five or ſix Millions from all the three Heads laſt above ſpecifyed.</p>

Now it was obſerved by the general conſent of Caſheers that the ſaid money (being by frequent revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons well mixed with the Gold) was about a ſeventh part thereof, and that the ſaid money being called in was about 800,000. pound, and conſequently the whole 5600,000. pound or five Millions and a half, whereby 'tis probable (that ſome allowance being given for hoarded money) the whole Caſh of <hi>England</hi> was then about ſix Millions, which I conceive is ſufficient to drive the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59749:383"/>
Trade of <hi>England,</hi> not but that the reſt of his Majeſties Dominions have the like means to do the ſame reſpective fully.</p>
                     <p>If there be ſix Millions of Souls in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that each ſpendeth ſeven pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> then the whole expence is forty two Millions or about 800,000. pounds <hi>per</hi> Week; and conſequently if every man did pay his expence Weekly and that the money could circulate within the compaſs of a Week, then leſs then one Million could anſwer the ends propoſed. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the Rents of the Lands in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> which are paid half yearly are eight Millions <hi>per Annum,</hi> there muſt be four Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions to pay them; and forasmuch as the Rent of Houſing of <hi>England</hi> paid quarterly are worth about four Millions <hi>per Annum,</hi> there needs but one Million to pay the ſaid Rent; wherefore ſix Millions being enough to make good the three ſorts of Circulation above mentioned, I conceive what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed is proved, at leaſt till ſomething better be held forth to the contrary.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. X. That the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Subjects have Stock competent and convenient to drive the Trade of the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial World.</head>
                     <p>NOw for the further Incouragement of Trade, as we have ſhewn, that there is Money enough in <hi>England</hi> to manage the affairs thereof, ſo we ſhall now offer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whether there be not competent and convenient Stock to drive the Trade of the whole commercial World. To which purpoſe it is to be remembred, that all the Commodities yearly exported out of every part of the laſt mentioned World, may be bought for forty five Millions, and that the Shipping imployed in the ſame World are not worth above fifteen Millions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that ſixty Millions at moſt will drive the whole Trade abovementioned without any truſt at all; but forasmuch as the Grovers of Commodities do commonly truſt them to ſuch Merchants or Factors as are worth but ſuch a part of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59749:384"/>
full value of their Commodities as may poſſibly be loſt upon the ſail of them which is rather to be expected; it follows then leſs then a Stock of ſixty Millions, nay then half of the ſaid Summ is ſufficient to drive the Trade above mentioned; it being well known that any Tradeſemen of good Reputation worth five hundred pound will be truſted with above one thouſand pounds-worth of Commodities, where leſs then thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Millions will ſuffice for the ſaid purpoſe, of which Summ the Coyn, Shipping and Stock already in Trade do at leaſt make one half.</p>
                     <p>And it has been ſhewn how by the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Bank any Summ of money may be made equivalent in Trade unto near the double of the ſame. By all which it ſeems that even at preſent much is not wanting to perform what is propounded; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe twenty thouſand or more were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is not improbable that ſince the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Gentlemen and ſome Noble-men do put their Younger Sons to Merchandiſe, that they will ſee it reaſonable as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the number of Merchants ſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Magnitude of Trade, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to increaſe Stock; which may effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be done by in-banking twenty Mil. worth of Land not being above a ſixth or ſeventh part of the whole Territories of <hi>England,</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59749:384"/>
that is to ſay, by making a Bond of ſuch value, to the ſecurity for all Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties bought and ſold, upon the account of that Univerſal Trade above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                     <p>And thus it having appeared, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> having in it as much Land, like <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> as the ſaid two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces do themſelves contain, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of other Land, not inconvenient for Trade, and that there are ſpare Hands enough to earn many Millions of money, more then they now do; and that there are alſo Imployments to earn ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Millions (even from the Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf) it follows from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thence, and what has been ſaid in the laſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph about inlarging of the Stock both of Monies and Lands, that it is not impoſſible, may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Nor is it unſeaſonable to imitate this matter, foraſmuch as the younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of good Families of <hi>England,</hi> can't otherwiſe be provided for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo as to live according to their Birth and Breeding; for if the Lands of <hi>England</hi> are worth

eight Millions <hi>per Annum,</hi> then there be at a Medium about ten Millions. Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of about eight hundred pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> in each of which one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we may ſuppoſe there is a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brother, who in leſs then two or three hundred pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> will not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuitable to his Relations.

                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59749:385"/>Whereas doing the ſame between one and other does effect nothing, for he that turns all his Land into Money, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes himſelf for Trade, and he that parts with his money for Land does the contrary, but to ſell Land to Forreigners increaſeth both money and people, and conſequently Trade; wherefore it is to be thought, that when the Laws denying Strangers to purchaſe, and not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to Trade without paying Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Duties, were made, that then the Publick State of things, and Intereſt of the Nation were far different from what they now are.</p>
                     <p>Having handled theſe ten Principal Concluſions, I might go on with others <hi>ad infinitum</hi>; but what has been ſaid already, I look upon as ſufficient to ſhew what I mean by Political Arithmetick, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the uſes of knowledge of the true State of the Peoples Lands, Stock, Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly that the Kings Subjects are not in ſo bad a Condition, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented men would make them; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Demonſtrate the greateſt effects of Unity, Induſtry, and Obedience, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
