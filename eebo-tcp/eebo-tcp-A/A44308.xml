         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>YOU will find the following Letter to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and therefore I ſhall ſay little by way of <hi>Preface.</hi> But to advertiſe you, That this <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Petition for Peace</hi> was written <hi>A.</hi> 1661. the ſame year the <hi>Petition</hi> was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Non-conforming Commiſſioners,</hi> by his <hi>Majeſty</hi> impowered to treat with the <hi>Right Reverend Biſhops,</hi> touching ſome <hi>Alterations</hi> to be made in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy:</hi> and 'tis now onely tranſcribed and publiſhed without any material Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration: This if you carry in your Mind in the Reading thereof, 'twill
<pb facs="tcp:45592:3"/>
prevent divers Miſtakes, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may be made in the Miſ-timing it, and particularly about <hi>the pretended great Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> of which, in the <hi>Petition,</hi> they make loud and frequent, but falſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. The <hi>Epiſcopal Party</hi> having by them <hi>deeply ſuffered</hi> for many years. But the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> at that time, having not ſuffered in the leaſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as capable as the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> would they have ſubmitted to the wholeſome <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Favor and Preferment; unto which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> boaſts that himſelf was courted. As to my <hi>Remarks</hi> upon his <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> if he ſhall object, that he publiſhed to the World his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that Book may be look'd upon as <hi>Non Scriptus</hi>; and ſo he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the <hi>Seditious Theſes</hi> by him laid down, and by me laid open. I leave it to himſelf to judge whether ſuch an inſignificant <hi>Nothing</hi> (the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his Mouth after ſo black a Crime) be to him a <hi>ſufficient Purgation,</hi> to the World a <hi>ſufficient Satisfaction,</hi> and (which is moſt conſiderable) whether his bare Wiſh, his Book were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb facs="tcp:45592:3"/>
               <hi>be ſufficient to undeceive and bring to Repentance the many whom it may have corrupted and tempted to Rebellion.</hi> 'Tis the Wiſh of one of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own Party for him, what <hi>Nero</hi> wiſht for himſelf, <hi>That he had never known Letters.</hi> Truly it were to be wiſht, <hi>That,</hi> when (Labouring under Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as he ſaith) he had written his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Reſt, he had gon to it:</hi> He hath been ſo reſtleſs ever ſince, and ſo great a <hi>Troubler</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>deep Repentance</hi> of his <hi>dangerous Errors</hi> and <hi>Actings,</hi> I fear he will come ſhort of that <hi>Bleſſed Reſt.</hi> There goes a Story, That <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> riding in <hi>Querpo</hi> by <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Coach, in a great Rain, and he offered to lend him his Coat; he told him, <hi>He would not be in his Coat for a Thouſand Pound.</hi> Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I would not be in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for a Thouſand Worlds (hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his <hi>Principles</hi>) for all his great <hi>Pretenſions</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and frequent <hi>Appeals</hi> to the <hi>laſt Judgment</hi>; where thoſe who are <hi>contentious, uncharitable, fierce, heady, high-minded, who ſpeak evil of Dignities, and reſiſt the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> though they have the <hi>Form of
<pb facs="tcp:45592:4"/>
Godlineſs,</hi> will be condemned, as well as the <hi>openly ungodly</hi> and <hi>profane.</hi> If he think me ſevere, 'tis onely in order to his <hi>Repentance</hi> (which I heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) that I diſplay his <hi>Errors</hi> with ſome Plainneſs. And truly I judge Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and ſoft Words not fit for <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots</hi> and <hi>Perturbers</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and open <hi>Revilers</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> and the <hi>Government.</hi> I have oft wondred at and pitied an old <hi>Stateſman,</hi> who, when he might live in Honour and Peace, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Trouble, and cannot go quietly to his Grave. And I have the ſame Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> a <hi>Stateſman</hi> too, But the <hi>Salamander</hi> can live no where but in the <hi>Fire.</hi> And a Perſon who loves <hi>Suits,</hi> though they have waſted his whole <hi>Eſtate,</hi> if he had another, would ſpend it all in <hi>Law.</hi> I would ſome of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Friends could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to leave off <hi>Controverſies,</hi> and imploy the Remainder of his Life in writing <hi>Retractations,</hi> a Work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and neceſſary for him, if for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this quarreling and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Age. I have offered you ſome <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> why the <hi>Epiſcopal Commiſſioners</hi> thought not fit to make <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the
<pb facs="tcp:45592:4"/>
               <hi>Petition for Peace.</hi> The <hi>Reaſon</hi> why I have <hi>anſwered</hi> it is, To take down Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s confident and frequent <hi>Boaſtings</hi> in his late paſſionate <hi>Writings,</hi> as if it were <hi>unanſwerable</hi>; and, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; which, as one truly ſaith, whoſoever hath the Learning and Temper to conſider and underſtand, doth know to be the <hi>brighteſt Image</hi> of <hi>primitive Purity</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and the <hi>moſt perfect Conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>moſt ancient</hi> and <hi>moſt holy Faith,</hi> that, ſince the <hi>primitive Times</hi> of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> any man had ever the Honor of ſuffering for or defending. <hi>The God of Peace and Truth continue the True Religion with our Peace, and caſt out that Spirit of Contention, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and Diſobedience which poſſeſſeth the Diſſenters; and give them the Spirit of Meekneſs, Humility and Chriſtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto Authority.</hi>

            <p>IF this Paper ſhall doe any good or harm, you will have a ſhare of the praiſe or blame, ſince it had never ſeen the light, had it not been brought forth by your midwifery. Meeting lately with your <hi>Non-conformiſt Pleas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Writings of 61. A Petition for Peace to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which they never anſwered to this day.</note> I found the <hi>Petition for Peace</hi> often in them mentioned; and again, more than once in your <hi>Anſwer to</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi> and as oft as you name it, you are pleas'd to ſay, 'Twas never anſwered; whereby you would make the World believe 'tis unanſwerable: This brought to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that I had by me your <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for Peace,</hi> and had anſwer'd it the ſame year 'twas publiſhed, but kept it private, in expectation of an Anſwer from the Epiſcopal Commiſſioners, who were moſt able and moſt concerned; but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45592:6"/>
they not thinking fit to doe it, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beſt known to themſelves, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for ſome hereafter mentioned; and the Liturgy of the Church, with ſome Alterations of the Convocation, being ſhortly after by Law eſtabliſhed; I laid by my Anſwer as needleſs, and ſcarce thought of it more, till your bold and angry <hi>Plea</hi> cauſed me to ſeek it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many ſcattered Papers, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, tranſcribe, and expoſe it. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect (but without fear of its defenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) that you will quarrel at it; you are known to be of a polemical humour and temper, of a hot Brain and haſty Pen; the Hector of the Old Cauſe, the Non-conformiſts Pope: I wrong you not in the Appellation: You have more than proved it in Acting the Pope. Yours are the two Swords; and you have, with mighty valour, drawn them both. The temporal Sword you have drawn againſt the King in the late Rebellion, and you glory that you drew in with you many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: And in cold bloud, near twenty years after, you tell the World, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee you were miſtaken, nor dare you repent of it, nor forbear the ſame if it were to doe again in the ſame ſtate of

            <p>Bleſſed be God, who hath by Miracle taken from you the temporal Sword, and reſtored it to the King whoſe it is.</p>
            <p>But the ſpiritual Sword cannot be wreſted from you, and this you are ſo daring as to draw ſtill againſt the Church, upon which you are ever and anon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new Aſſaults: and here too you muſter your holy Army, Two thouſand Miniſters, and by the number of thoſe <hi>Centurions,</hi> we may gueſs how many are your Legions.

The other claim of higheſt Power over the whole Church you do in effect make, of being its univerſal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Head and Guide; where, you ſay,<note place="margin">Epiſt. to Non-con.

            <p>You will not believe the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the War though the King gives you a demonſtration of it; but you determine the Queſtion rarely well, in telling us, your ſelf begun it, and were the firſt Incendiary: <hi>The War,</hi> you ſay, <hi>was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in our Streets before the King or Parliament had an Army;</hi> and ſo you had the honour firſt to be a General of your own creating, before <hi>Eſſex,</hi> without Commiſſion from King or Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Parliaments cauſeleſs jealouſies you juſtifie; but the King's juſt Fears you ſlight. To the Objection, <hi>The Tumults at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>drove him away;</hi> you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Onely by diſpleaſing him, not by endangering him or medling with him.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:45592:14"/>
So the Parliaments Army, their Cannons and Muskets only affrighted, did not endanger him. You have all faith for the Parliament, but none for the King, who in his <hi>Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> tells you he was <hi>more than diſpleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>The Parliament did not raiſe War againſt the Perſon or Authority of the King.</hi> You might have as truly ſaid, Their Army did not fight where the King was in perſon; at <hi>Edghill, Newbery,</hi> and <hi>Naſeby.</hi> O but, <hi>Their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ran for King and Parliament, and their Souldiers, if askt who they were for, anſwered, for King and Parliament and the Solemn League and Covenant, all run for King and Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What talk you of Commiſſions, equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Covenants, and diſſembling Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; when you fought againſt the King's perſon, took him, impriſoned him, and, at laſt, murthered him. You may waſh your hands with <hi>Pilate,</hi> and tell us, Your horrid Cruelties were onely conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, not effects of the War: But the Bloud of the King, and his Loyal Subjects, which you ſpilt, will be upon you, unleſs you waſh it away by a deep Repentance. For your taking up Arms againſt the King, you rely upon the authority of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45592:15"/>
Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> who pleaded the Parliaments cauſe in revenge for his Ears, and in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for their releaſing and bringing him to <hi>London</hi> in triumph; of greeting one of a foreign Countrey and a great Common-wealths-man; of <hi>Barkly</hi> a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt: and indeed from them you learnt this wicked Doctrine. You might, had you been impartial, conſulted Judge <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> your friend <hi>Hales, Dudly Digs,</hi> and, the never to be anſwered, <hi>Royal Apology.</hi> Theſe would have taught you, that the Laws of God and the Land for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid in all caſes reſiſtance againſt the King, command ſubjection; but let theſe and your other ſhews and faint ſhadows of reaſon vaniſh.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſubſtantial one, which you chiefly urge and enlarge on, is, That the King is not (as all his good Subjects have been taught to believe) the Sovereign; but that the Parliament hath a part in the Supremacy; an Aſſertion directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> which you elſewhere confeſs ſecures the King's Title againſt all foreign Claims of Pope or any other, and conſequently againſt all home-bread <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, and every Member of Parliament takes that Oath, and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45592:15"/>
Long Parliament, even when making War againſt the King, confeſs themſelves in their Declarations his Majeſtie's moſt loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and humble Subjects.</p>
            <p>I dare not with you preſume to talk at pleaſure of Kings and Parliaments. I have all due veneration for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments next unto and under the King. But I never learnt, that they were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Supremacy, and, I believe, it would be a flattery as diſpleaſing to a Parliament, as injurious to the King, to aſcribe unto it a part of the Sovereignty. One of yours tells us that <hi>formerly the Name of a King was an Idol unto his Subjects;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſon</hi>'s Sermon of Thanks for defeat of the Earl of <hi>Derby.</hi>
                  </note> but now, by the courage of the Parliament, 'tis death to that man, and his father's houſe, that durſt name a King;</hi> and you make an Idol of the name of a Parliament, and dare to ſay, that if you had known the Parliament had been the Beginners, and in moſt fault; yet their Ruin is a Puniſhment greater than any fault againſt a King (his Murther, and the Ruin of his Family, and all his loyal Subjects) can from him deſerve. And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> your Audacity begets in me the Confidence to tell you, that your Rebellion was moſt foul, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45592:16"/>
the Arms you bare were againſt both King and Parliament, for that you call ſo was an idol, a nothing, no parliament; but onely ſome corrupted members of it, which had by tumults and threats frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away, as the King, ſo all the ſound and loyal Members of Parliament, both Lords and Commons, and that in ſo great a number, that they made a Parliament in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Now, ſeeing the Parliament thus divided, a part againſt the King, a part as great for him, Prudence and Loyalty might have taught you either to have ſat ſtill and bewailed the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py rupture and diviſion, and prayed for a cloſure and reconciliation; or to have joyned with the King and the loyal part of his Parliament: but of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of Parliaments enough. I pray God grant the King and kingdom may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore ſee the like to that you plead for, and ſerved under with ſuch a perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that, you ſay, <hi>you would doe it again in the ſame ſtate of things.</hi>

Valiant <hi>Sir,</hi> had your Arms been no ſtouter than your Arguments, you had forſaken the field, as you plainly do, when in the cloſe of your <hi>Reaſons for the late War</hi> you confeſs, that every one of your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

is not a ſufficient <hi>medium</hi> to infer your concluſion: But altogether ſhew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what grounds you proceed to diſpute the point: So that you juſtifie Treaſon upon the very ſame grounds on which the noble Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was condemned, on pretence of it. When none could be prov'd againſt him ſingle, he muſt die for Treaſon accumulative.</p>
            <p>I ſhall eaſe your patience upon this ſubject, when I have reminded you, that you have much miſ-timed your <hi>Holy Common-wealth</hi>: Therein you ſhew your ſelf a great Dictatour, but little a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titian, and leſs a Prophet; when you ſend it forth in the dark and diſmal night of confuſion, and could not ſtay to take a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the morning; when (the blazing and affrighting Comets peſtiferous matter being ſpent) the Sun was ariſeing in brightneſs and returning in glory. But your zeal for the reſtoring your prudent and pious <hi>Richard</hi> blinded your Eyes, and that heat put out the light, and ſo you thought the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> would bring him in again. Well, yet you were not wholly forſaken in your Politicks: but when, though late, you diſcovered the Protectorſhip and the Common-wealth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45592:17"/>
expiring, and the King like to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you expiated your little errours by a great merit; you preached to the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe of Commons in Parliament, and as in your <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and elſewhere you boaſt, <hi>God and they put upon you a great honour; the next morning after they acknowledged his Majeſtie's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:</hi> But ſurely, <hi>Sir,</hi> 'twas no effect of your <hi>Sermon,</hi> but their own Loyalty which wrought upon them to make that acknowledgment. You all along in your <hi>Sermon</hi> reflect on the Royal Party as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, and cenſuring the Puritans and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſians who dare not be ſo bad as they: Nay, you implicitly accuſe that Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe,<note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> as if there were ſome among them (and 'tis eaſie to gueſs whom you mean) that would take that man as a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan and Phanatick, who would employ half ſo much time for his Soul and the Service of the Lord, as they do in unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſports and pleaſures, and pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their fleſh. And you freely tell them that, <hi>God muſt have the precedency,</hi>

               <hi>and, as our Calamities began with Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencies in Religion, and ſtill, that's the Wound, that moſt needs cloſing; and, with grief and ſhame we ſee this

Work ſo long undone</hi>: Which plainly implies, you would have this Work done according to your Covenant by the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, before the King come in; and, putting a high value on your ſelf, and all of your mind, you declare, they ſhut you out, if they would enforce you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Sacraments without diſcipline, and the conduct of your own diſcretion; and, ſay you, <hi>Give firſt to God the things that are God's, and then give unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's:</hi> that is, <hi>firſt ſet up the Diſcipline before you admit Caeſar:</hi> This was the method of your Brethren in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And you here again caution and ſhare the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty. 'Tis right indeed as you ſay, <hi>A Papiſt muſt ceaſe to be a Papiſt, if he be truly and fully loyal to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign:</hi> and 'tis as true, A Presbyterian muſt ceaſe to be a Presbyterian, if he be truly and fully loyal to his Sovereign: but you hide him under the general name of <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and tell us, <hi>ſo a Proteſtant muſt ſo far ceaſe to be a Proteſtant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be diſloyal:</hi> (you ſhould have ſaid, a Proteſtant truly conformable to the Church of <hi>England</hi>) <hi>ſuch a one can never be diſloyal:</hi> But behold how rarely
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45592:18"/>
you prove your non-conforming Proteſtant cannot be diſloyal; <hi>for</hi> Rom. <hi>the 13th. is part of the Rule of his Religion: but unhappily there hath been a difference among us, which is the higher power, when thoſe which have their ſhares in the Sovereignty are divided? But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhould be ſubject to the higher power is no queſtion to us.</hi> Very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pure <hi>Jeſuitiſm. Sir,</hi> True Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were never ſo unhappy as to differ about the higher power. They all agreed it was the King; and that none did or ought to ſhare with him in the Sovereignty. 'Tis the Papiſt (whom you confeſs to be in your Counſels and Armies) and you who unhappily dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, which is the higher power. They ſay, not the King, but the Pope; you ſay, not the King, but the Parliament; and <hi>Rom.</hi> the <hi>13</hi>th. is part of the Rule of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as well as yours; and whether they ſhould be ſubject to the higher power is no more a queſtion with them than with you, and ſo you prove the Papiſts as good Subjects as your ſelves. This then is your argument for your Loyalty. 'Tis no queſtion with you, whether you ſhould be ſubject to the higher power; but unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45592:19"/>
you differ, and are ignorant who is the higher power, to whom you ſhould be ſubject? you did not know whether <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was a Kingdom or a Common-wealth, whether the King was higher than the Parliament, whom he hath power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and diſſolve when he thinks fit: who call themſelves his Subjects, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſe his Sovereignty, by ſwearing unto him allegiance: thus your unhappy and invincible ignorance, who was the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er power, hath led you more unhappily to take part with the lower, but ſtronger power, and to reſiſt and deſtroy the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. May your timely Repentance prevent the doom denounced <hi>Romans</hi> the <hi>13</hi>th. But this, and your other little ſlips in arguing, proceeded from your preſent want of advantages for ſtudy.</p>
            <p>Having and uſing Book but a <hi>Bible</hi> and a <hi>Concordance,</hi> as you ſay in your <hi>Epiſtle;</hi> How vain, how falſe, how rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmells it of the Phariſee? What want of advantages for ſtudy in <hi>London?</hi> Could not all the publick Libraries or Bookſellers ſhop furniſh you with Books for <hi>A Sermon of Repentance?</hi> But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages though you wanted, you needed not.

and cofeſs you have ſpoken well <hi>of Repentance,</hi> and home to diverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sins, and powerfully preſt ſeveral Duties: but that which was the Duty of the Day, to lay open the Sin and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Guilt of the late unparallel'd Rebellion, and the Murther of his late Majeſty, our moſt gracious and religious King, and the moſt injurious Expulſion of his preſent Majeſty from his Crown and Kingdoms, and to preſs his ſpeedy Reſtoration; this hath no place in your <hi>Sermon.</hi> Surely your topical Head, had your Heart been for it, and had you that reſpect for the King as for <hi>Richard,</hi> could from your <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Concordance</hi> alone have ſo laid open the Sin and laid home the Duty, as at once to have pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and bowed the hearts of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> forthwith to ſend unto the King, and ſay, <hi>Return thou and all thy ſervants:</hi> This, indeed, you faintly confeſs was ſome little part of your duty, to have minded your Auditours what Sins of the Land muſt be remembred and loathed in order to Peace and Healing, but your Glaſs forbad you. It ſeems your time for a whole hour was imployed in a Work more proper and neceſſary than that which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45592:20"/>
would conduce to the Peace and Healing of the Nation.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> I fear 'twas another kind of Glaſs forbad you, which would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected them on you with ſo ugly a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that you could not endure the ſight. The Sins of the Land you ſhould have minded them of were gainfull Sins, the Goods and Lands the Godly Party had won by the Sword from the Wicked and Delinquents, and to remember, ſo as to loath and vomit up theſe; oh, it would break their tender hearts ſhortly. Though in your other Tenets you are, they ſay, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, yet, as to your Politicks, you are conſtant to your ſelf: the very ſame in your <hi>Sermon</hi> as in your <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you are ſtill the ſame in your <hi>Plea for Peace:</hi> As the review of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and Cofuſions of the Church and State, after ſeventeen years, could work in you then no change, nor reconcile you to the baniſhed King and Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> ſo now, that for ſeventeen years more you have beheld the King and the Church reſtored, which was <hi>the Lord's doing,</hi> and even done by Miracle, <hi>and is marvelous in our eyes;</hi> it is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in yours; and, by a pretended <hi>Plea

But we have now (as you formerly had) jealouſies and fears from the timing of your <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> which you ſend forth after <hi>17</hi> years ſilence, and in the name of your Thouſands; in this critical conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of affairs; that there is ſome Deſign on foot more than ordinary; and for that you were reſolute to put it out, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your prudent Friends perſuaded you, ſilently to leave all to God, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you, it would but exaſperate: but perſuaded you would not be; and exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate you would, even by a <hi>Plea for Peace;</hi> and with your <hi>Pretious Balms</hi> you break our Heads; and while you embrace, you ſmite under the fifth Rib; and you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Doubts by your Quarrelling, and ſome of you Libelling the excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, a ſtrong Pillar of the Church, whom you once ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed.</p>
            <p>I have done with your <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and, as I told you, will not meddle with your <hi>Plea.</hi> Onely I ask you, Is this a likely <hi>Plea for Peace?</hi> wherein, not content to urge the old Objections, you ſtrain and ſet your wit and invention on the Rack,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45592:23"/>
to find out new Exceptions, and torture every joint and member of the Liturgy; and multiply little ſcruples againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, <hi>in infinitum;</hi> and the poor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar cannot ſcape you. To ſhew your skill in Aſtronomy, you pick quarrels with the Almanack, which, as your Con. Non. Non. Con. brother <hi>Cheny</hi> tells you, you had better let alone, and referre the matter to a Jury of Almanack-makers. But this was a piece of <hi>Savoy</hi> wit, and you will not pardon it in a Brother: He writing a very meek and modeſt Anſwer to your <hi>Plea,</hi> with all deference to your perſon and worth; you expoſe him,<note place="margin">Being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</note> deride him as a Coward for flying, and not daring as you to chooſe the Goal: you inſult over him, trample upon him, and render him the moſt pittifull thing that ever peept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in print: and, in your petulant Anſwer to him, you let fly alſo very bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Government: and yet, <hi>Sir,</hi> he is too hard for you in divers points of greater difference between you, as thoſe of Epiſicopacy, Re-ordination, Renunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on of the Covenant— And you in effect fly the field, and leave him the victory: and though you ſlight him, you confeſs you fear him. Being a Brother, though
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45592:24"/>
weak, yet you ſay, his conceſſions and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſo near the Truth doth give him more advantage againſt your Party than the ableſt of the Conformiſts, who will aſſault you with leſs ſucceſs than he: they having a kindneſs for him, will read him; but not the other, having againſt them a prejudice.</p>
            <p>And for that reaſon, the greater men, who you ſay are about to confute your Book, may ſpare their labour; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hope to doe good on your Party, as you cunningly inſinuatè, to prevent a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation; and truly, for another reaſon, they may let it alone; you having a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular way of writing (which your inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance with Schiſm hath taught you) to divide and ſubdivide <hi>in ſemper diviſibilia:</hi> you are a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and never march into the field but with hundreds following you; in your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Common-wealth,</hi> in your <hi>Pleas,</hi> firſt and ſecond, in your <hi>Anſwer</hi> to Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,</hi> and generally, in all your Books (beſides your very frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions to other matter) you do ſo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Quaeries, Propoſitions, and Aphoriſms, and have ſo many little heads and minute particulars, that thoſe who write againſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45592:24"/>
your Books muſt meaſure and number atoms to trace you <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which few will have the pleaſure to doe; and if they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make Remarks and Animadverſions, you will ſay, they do but nible and cavil, and dare not fairly attack you by a full and juſt Confutation. And I may add a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother reaſon: The excellent Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath done your work, and compleatly anſwered your <hi>Plea</hi> in two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his <hi>Sermon.</hi> Your whole buſineſs in your <hi>Plea</hi> is to make the world believe, you are bound in conſcience to preach and exerciſe your Office, as you call it, after your own mode, contrary to the Laws and Orders in the Church eſtabliſhed. He there moſt clearly demonſtrates your Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and with it that of the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I can not think that any pretence of Conſcience warrants any man that is not extraordinarily commiſſioned, as the Apoſtles and firſt Publiſhers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel were, and can not juſtifie that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by Miracles, as they did, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the eſtabliſhed Religion of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (though it be falſe) and openly to draw men off from the Profeſſion of it, in contempt of the Magiſtrate and the Law. All that perſons of a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45592:25"/>
can in ſuch a caſe reaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, is, to enjoy their private Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Exerciſe of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Religion; for which they ought to be very thankfull, and to forbear the open making of Proſelytes to their own Religion (though they be never ſo ſure they are in the right) till they have either an extraordinary Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God to that purpoſe, or the Providence of God make way for it, by the permiſſion of the Magiſtrate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this you call a Slip of his Pen, and pretend you have rectified it, telling us, <hi>'Tis the Duty of thoſe who are ſet apart to the Office of the Miniſtery, to preach the Goſpel by way of diſcharge of that Office: We have the Apoſtles expreſs authority and example for this, who when they were threatned and commanded to ſpeak no more in</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s name, have left us their anſwer upon record,</hi> We ought to obey God rather than man. <hi>We have alſo the Precedent of the firſt three hundred years after theſe Apoſtles, when the Goſpel was nevev preached, but contrary to the will of the Magiſtrate, that is, againſt the Laws and Edicts of the Emperors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:45592:25"/>Inſtead of mending a ſuppoſed Slip of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Pen, you have made a foul Blot with your own: his Poſition is, <hi>No man, unleſs he hath an extraordinary Commiſſion as the Apoſtles, ought to preach or make Proſelytes in affront to the eſtabliſhed Religion of a Nation, and in contempt of the Magiſtrate, and the Law prohibiting it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You affirm the contrary, <hi>That all who have an ordinary Call to the Office mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial, ought to preach, though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Laws and Edicts of the Magiſtrate.</hi> And the <hi>Medium</hi> you make uſe of to prove it is the example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who had an extraordinary Call and Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>This is your Argument, <hi>The Apoſtles (having an immediate and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Call and Commiſſion from</hi> Chriſt <hi>to preach the Goſpel) did preach it; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the commands and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Magiſtrate; therefore all Miniſters, having an ordinary Call, may preach, though by the Magiſtrate prohibited.</hi> Thus you confirm the Doctor's aſſertion, pretending to confute it. Having no proof or inſtance of ordinary Miniſters preaching contrary to the command of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45592:26"/>
Magiſtrate; you fly to the example of extra-ordinary Miniſters, the Apoſtles, the very thing that he aſſerts, that they may; others, not called as they, may not preach againſt the Laws and the Edict of the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>What you add of the Precedent of the firſt three hundred years after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, is as impertinent as the other is weak, and nothing parallel to this caſe. The Emperors then were Heathens, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of the Chriſtian Religion, made Laws againſt all preaching of the Goſpel; yet all the Miniſters preached notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe Laws and Edicts. The King is now a Chriſtian, the Defender of the Faith, commands by his Laws the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel; onely the Laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all Preachers to walk by the ſame Rule, and ſubmit to the ſame Order. You refuſe to preach according to Rule and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Communion with the Church; but will preach in Diviſion from the Church, and in Defiance of the Laws of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prince and the Orders in the Church establiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> In your <hi>Reply</hi> to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> You provoke any perſon to <hi>name that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple cheriſhing Rebellion which you have not renounced.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> I muſt tell you,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45592:26"/>
this Principle of the Obligation of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to preach and doe divine Offices af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own mode, in ſeparated Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, againſt the Laws of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrate and the Church, is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple cheriſhing Rebellion, and you have not renounced it. And, in the ſaid <hi>Reply,</hi> I do charge you of dilivering a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more than cheriſhing Rebellion, the very ſame with thoſe in your <hi>Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> and your <hi>Sermon to the Houſe of Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I pray the learned Doctors par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in thruſting my Sickle into their Corn, you will find them well able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt your angry aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults; I ſhall take the boldneſs onely to mention two or three of your exceeding Vanities, and Extravagances in your <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers</hi> to the worhty Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>You tell him, <hi>his logical faculty runs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably low;</hi> but, <hi>Sir,</hi> men think yours runs miſerably low, even to Dotage. When in your <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> you are ſo idle as <hi>to muſter up above twenty ſorts of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants too hard for you, of which, one you call the Univerſaliſt, who will prove you an Aſs, becauſe you are an Animal.</hi> Sure, by this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſaliſt, you

mean Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> who is a little too free with you in his Anſwer to your <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for Peace,</hi> which I doubt not you have ſeen, though you forget your ſelf, and call it unanſwered; he is a pleaſant Gentleman, and you, being now upon the merry pin, might eaſily prevail with him for an ingenious Deſcant upon the ſeveral Qualifications you give of your <hi>One and twenty Diſputants.</hi> Another ſort of thoſe Diſputants you tell us are, <hi>ſuch as will not reade or anſwer your fulleſt Defence already written, but look you ſhould begin a new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, <hi>Sir,</hi> we think you are greatly out in your account; we believe there are no Diſputants of this ſort; men are ſo far from looking you ſhould begin a new, that they wiſh you had never begun at all, and fear you will never end the world's Trouble and your own contentious Diſputing: and, How know you they will not or have not read your <hi>Defence?</hi> and if they will not read or anſwer it, Why are you angry? Are all men bound to read your Books? and if none will anſwer you, you have the laſt word, and you know whom that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

               <hi>We cannot but appeal to the Higher Powers to have it reviſed and judge— when we have been ordained already, as <hi>Timothy,</hi> by Laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, whether the Lawn be</hi> de eſſentia <hi>to the Ceremony, and the Hands avail nothing without the Sleeves on.</hi>

            <p>Important Quoeries all theſe verily, and fit to be reviſed and judged by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Powers, if you knew who they were; but alas you do not; as you complain in your <hi>Sermon</hi> to the <hi>Houſe of Commons.</hi> If then you would take my counſel, refer it Brother <hi>Cheny.</hi>

            <p>One thing I am mighty ſorry to ſee and ſay, This wiſe caſe is uſhered in with a groſs leaſing, when juſt before you affirm the caſe was ſuch, That there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Presbyterian Ordination to be had here in the late times. Truly, if your good will, might be taken for the deed, there was no other to be had.

And, Have they told you (for no body elſe could) what ſort of Non-conformiſtſ they would be? Thoſe of the firſt Edition in Forty two, or thoſe of the ſecond, in Sixty two. Would they,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45592:29"/>

Or, Would they now (having anſwered onely, the old Objections when alive) be ſo ſtagger'd with your new ones, that that one alone of the erroneous Kalendar would be a flaming Sword to keep them from entring? <hi>Sir,</hi> Hereafter talk things crediible; ſuch Romances become you not, What would your Cenſure be, ſhould we affirm, we are paſt doubt that Mr. <hi>Cartwright, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> were they now alive, would turn Conformiſts?</p>
            <p>One thing, in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to your <hi>Plea</hi> I omitted, is fit here to be remarked; your Complaint; that you have been called on to tell what it is that you would have; as if you had told it and we well knew it: But truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> 'tis a very hard Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which we think you neither have nor can tell.

vehement Accuſations, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpecious Zeal, cry out againſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip and Order to be reſtored: His Majeſty, imitating in the like caſe the example of that our Engliſh <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> was pleaſed to give Commiſſion for a Conference or Treaty between ſome ſelect perſons of the Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Judgment, to conſider of the Form of publick Worſhip, the Common Prayers of this Church; and, if occaſion be, to make ſuch reaſonable Alterations, Corrections and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therein, as ſhould be jointly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon to be needfull and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and doubtleſs for the ſame reaſon with that of King <hi>James: Not but that any thing in the Common Prayer contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned might very well have been born with by men who would have made a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable conſtruction of things. But for that in a matter concerning the Service of God we were nice or rather jealous that the publick Form thereof ſhould be free not onely from blame but from ſuſpicion, ſo as neither the common Adverſary ſhould have advantage to wreſt ought therein contained to other ſenſe than the Church of</hi> England <hi>intendeth, nor any trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45592:32"/>
or ignorant perſon of this Church be able to take the leaſt occaſion againſt it.</hi> The Treaty wanting that Iſſue his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and all good men deſired, and no Accommodation thereby effected, it is enquired and diverſly cenſured where the blame lies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Presbyterians charge the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Commiſſioners to be wholly in the fault; and ſay, They have peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the Biſhops, propoſed their Alterations, made their Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Liturgy, replied upon the Biſhops Anſwers; finally, have cleared themſelves, and given account to his Majeſty of the whole Tranſaction. But the Biſhops have anſwered nothing to their Petition, have not conſidered their Alterations, have ſaid little to their Objections, and granted as little by way of Conceſſion: Therefore they profeſs, the Diſappointment hath not been on their part, and that they have quiet in their minds, having diſcharged their duty, and been Seekers and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Peace. But for all this fair flouriſh, it will appear to any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is not foreſtalled, that 'tis on the ſcore of the Presbyterians, and for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45592:33"/>
the fault of their undue managing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that the Treaty hath proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; and this I ſhall manifeſt by, firſt, anſwering their pretenſions, and then conſidering their <hi>Petition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Biſhops anſwered not their <hi>Petition,</hi> it was for good cauſes; what they ask was not in the power of the Biſhops to grant, the matter was unreaſonable, the motives weak and not worthy an Anſwer, being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber many, but light in weight (as when they come to be examined will appear) and however directed to the Biſhops, the <hi>Petition</hi> was intended to gratifie the people of their own party, the deſign of it being popular, and the aim of it apparent to keep up their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they anſwer nothing to their new Form (which they call their <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>) a perfect Abolition of the Churches Form, was not their fault, but their favour. They were obliged to the Biſhops for their ſilence who might juſtly have convented them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of anſwering them; the very publiſhing of that Form being a high Attempt againſt the Laws and a plain
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45592:33"/>
Violation of his Majeſtie's Directions in his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they ſay little to their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections is, for that many of them had little in them, were trivial and ſtrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and little or nothing have they ſaid in their Objections, but what had been ſaid before by <hi>Cartwright</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and by Archbiſhop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Whitgift</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> abundantly anſwered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That they granted little by way of Conceſſion, they had great Reaſon, and great Precedents: Great Reaſon; for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Compilers of the Common Prayer Book were holy, able, zealous and orthodox Perſons; and ſuch an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration as they deſired (as I ſaid) in effect an Abolition, had been to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Piety and Ability, and to caſt Dirt in the Faces of thoſe venerable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Confeſſors and Martyrs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Common Prayer Book was reviſed, approved and confirmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Acts of Parliament and Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in ſeveral Princes Reigns; to alter it after their Model, had been alſo to caſt Dirt in the Face of Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to queſtion the Wiſedom and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45592:34"/>
Piety of the wiſeſt and moſt pious Kings and Parliaments.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It would have opened a gap to the Papiſts, who cry out againſt us for Novelty and Inconſtancy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was his Majeſtie's Order, That there ſhould be as little Alteration as might be, for that the people were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with and accuſtomed to the Form eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They had great Precedents; for, 1. In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, it being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, very few alterations or additions were made: and, 2. In King <hi>James</hi> his time alſo, who judged the Form ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, that he would have ſome ſmall things rather explained than changed: nay more, admoniſheth all men, That hereafter they ſhall not expect nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any farther Alteration.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For that the Biſhops have ſaid little, and the Presbyterians much, it makes nothing for the one nor againſt the other; they are not the fulleſt veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that make the greateſt ſound; 'tis not the beſt cauſe that is moſt clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; the Biſhops cauſe was not their own more than the King's, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Churches, having been
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45592:34"/>
by Law eſtabliſhed and continued (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the Popiſh and Presbyterian Perſecutions) ever ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore the Biſhops judged it needleſs to give themſelves and the World the trouble of any tedious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But the Presbyterians, pleading againſt the Laws and eſtabliſhed Order, thought it neceſſary to beſtir themſelves and to make long Apologies for ſo high an Attempt: Therefore they have left no Stone unturned, have ſent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per after Paper and poſted them through all parts of the Nation, to keep up their Intereſt in the Party, and their Party's prejudice againſt the Churches Liturgy. I ſuppoſe, it is hereby plain to all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Judges, that the Blame is not on the Biſhops, but the Presbyterians, that the Treaty had not its deſired ſucceſs. And to manifeſt it farther, ſince they juſtifie themſelves, and waſh their hands, and cry, We are innocent: They muſt be told, 1. That they have not duly prepared for an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the Treaty: 2. They have not demeaned themſelves candidly and ingeniouſly in the Treaty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They have not duly prepared for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45592:35"/>
an Accommodation before the Treaty. There is no hope of a fair Agreement between two diſſenting Parties, ſo long as on the one part there remain cauſes of Jealouſie which will not be removed. Now ſince the Prebyterians do lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Scandal of holding divers Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in reference to his Majeſty, Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and the Liturgy, to which if they ſtill adhere, they render themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of a Treaty; it highly concerns them to purge themſelves, by a full and free Declaration of their Judgments in thoſe particulars which have an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate influence upon the Treaty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Since the Presbyterians both from the Pulpit and the Preſs have taught, That it is lawfull to reſiſt Kings, and have ſtirred up the People to arm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their lawfull Sovereign upon pretence of Reformation in Religion; herein joyning with the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> That Heretical Kings may be reſiſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as many of their Books and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons declare. For the undeceiving of the People, and clearing themſelves of the guilt of that antichriſtian and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tenet, they were bound in duty and conſcience to have publickly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45592:35"/>
that Doctrine, and to have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the World, that they hold the Doctrine of our Church,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> That Kings are Sacred; above all coercive Power:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.17.</note> That they are Supreme; the Higheſt Powers: onely puniſhable by God; and not, upon any pretence of Liberty, Property, Law, or Religion, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſpecious, nay, be it never ſo real, to be reſiſted or oppoſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For that they maintain and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly teach, the Civil Magiſtrate not to be Superior to the Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.<note place="margin">Divine Right of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
               <hi>They were obliged to make a publick acknowledgment of the King's Supremacy in all cauſes, and over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Eccleſiaſtical</hi>; in ſhort, <hi>to have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take the Oath of Supremacy.</hi> The Denial of which is a ſecond Opinion wherein ſome of them ſymbolize with the Papiſts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For that they have in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſo publickly oppoſed the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government, covenanted againſt it, taken it away; and in the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſet up another Government; they ſhould expreſly have owned the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Government now reſtored, and have promiſed to be obedient unto it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:45592:36"/>4. For that they had caſt out and laid aſide all ſet forms of publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Ordination, and other Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (their <hi>Directory</hi> being a very cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, neither uſed by themſelves, nor impoſed upon any other,) every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter being left to his own dictates in publick holy Offices, they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly have declared their Judgments, that a ſet form of publick Prayer is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church neceſſary, to which all in that Church ſhould be obliged.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For that their Party have taken away the Form of Prayer by Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and forbidden all Miniſters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great penalty to uſe it; they ſhould have declared, that the ſubſtance of it was agreeable to God's Word, onely they judged it needed ſome Alteration, and that if his Majeſty with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould conſent to the Amendment of ſuch things as by their joint Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be thought needfull, they would ſubmit unto it, and be obliged ever to uſe it in their Miniſtrations.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were neceſſary ſhould have been precedaneous to the Treaty, and would much have conduced to an happy Accommodation: Such an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45592:36"/>
Confeſſion and Retractation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemed them, and would have melted his Majeſty and the Biſhops; and all good Chriſtians would have wept with them, and rejoyced for them, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them with the ſame Affection that <hi>Joſeph</hi> did his repenting Brethren; and indeed it was a wonderfull conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention in his Majeſty to appoint the Biſhops, and a high Obedience in the Biſhops to his Majeſty to treat at all with them without and before ſuch a Confeſſion. Surely till they do retract thoſe not onely erroneous, but ſome of them prodigious and moſt dangerous and unchriſtian Opinions, they in vain go about to perſuade the World that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ey cannot ſubmit to our Liturgy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Principles of Conſcience. 'Tis not Conſcience that ſwallows Camels, and ſtreins at Gnats: 'tis not Conſcience that ſees Motes, and winks at Beams: 'tis not Conſcience that neglects the weighty things of the Law, and tithes Mint and Cummin. Certainly they muſt have abundance of Charity that can believe (be their words never ſo ſmooth) that theſe men have no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive but Conſcience to oppoſe our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45592:37"/>
Church Ceremonies, do out of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſcruple at a Surplice, a Geſture, a Set form, a Word obſolete or improper, whoſe Conſcience could ſwallow Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Rebellion, could make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Sovereign King, could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn all Order both civil and ſacred, and fill the Church and State with Bloud and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>One thing more which evidences their Inſincerity as to an amicable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if they reſolved it ſhould take no effect, and feared leſt Duty, Piety, Conſcience and Reaſon ſhould work upon their Brethren to ſubmit to the Form of Worſhip now likely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; they ſent to all of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Nation, to ſend up wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Objections they could make againſt the Common-prayer, and adviſed them to hold off, and not to conform by any means, for their ſtanding out was the onely way to obtain their own terms and liberty, their numbers being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that, in caſe of their depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there were not Conformable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters enough to ſupply their places, and ſo the King and the Church muſt be forced to indulge and continue
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45592:37"/>
them. Surely this was not conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and diſcovered their Deſign, to continue a Diviſion and keep up a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Though herein their Politicks fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them; the Biſhops ſented the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and provided for the Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Vacancy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have not demeaned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves candidly and fairly in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which themſelves in their two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers (the <hi>Petition for Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Debate</hi>) do make appear to all who are impartial and unprejudicate: Their publiſhing them being directly againſt his Majeſtie's Commiſſion which is, <hi>Our Will and Pleaſure is, that when you, with the ſaid Archbiſhops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall have drawn your Conſultations to any Reſolution, that you forthwith certifie and preſent to us in writing under your ſeveral hands the matters and things whereupon you ſhall ſo determine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. His Majeſtie's Will and Pleaſure is, that what is done by virtue of this Commiſſion, ſhould be done jointly, by the Commiſſioners on both ſides; but the Presbyterian Commiſſioners ſet forth their Papers by themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe of the Epiſcopal.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:45592:38"/>2. That they ſhould certifie them in writing to his Majeſty: They wave his Majeſty, and ſcatter their Papers abroad in Print among the People.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they ſhould preſent them under their ſeveral hands; here are no hands, no names, but the general one of Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That they ſhould certifie when their Conſultations were drawn to any Reſolution, and preſent the Matters whereupon they ſhould determine.</p>
            <p>They, <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> like, run without their Errand, and preſume to certifie (us the people, not Us the King) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Reſoluſion, without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: Whether this be agreeable to the King's Commiſſion, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his Order and Appointment; let the World judge, let themſelves judge. Nay, whether it was not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from his Majeſty to thoſe of their own Party.</p>
            <p>But to cloſe with their Papers: and, firſt, I ſhall conſider the Objections they make againſt the Common Prayers in general in their <hi>Grand Debate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They ſay, They look upon the Common-prayer-book as an excellent
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45592:38"/>
and worthy Work for that time, and after they contradict themſelves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call their Charity, and ſtifle that Truth which brake from them; and ſay, As to our Conſciences, if we thought not the Common-prayer-book to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty — And again, We take it to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, diſorderly, inconvenient mode. What, excellent and worthy, and yet guilty and diſorderly, defective, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, —How are theſe conſiſtent? Yes, for that time excellent and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: but at this time guilty, defective, —But pray what's the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that time and this? muſt we change our Religion with the times? we have the ſame Doctrine, the ſame Sacraments, the ſame Government; and why ſhould not we have the ſame Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? muſt we have a temporizing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? muſt our Devotions as our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be changed after the new Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Modes of times? what Guilt hath our Liturgy contracted by time? O that the times and men were ſuch now for Zeal and Piety as when the Common Prayers were compoſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They make Objections againſt the whole as well as the parts: and, is this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45592:39"/>
fair, to object againſt the whole of that, ſome parts whereof they were onely to amend? Their Commiſſion was, <hi>That, if occaſion be, they ſhould make ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and neceſſary Alterations, Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Amendments therein as ſhall be agreed upon to be needfull and expedient, —with an expreſs Advice to avoid, as much as may be, all unneceſſary Abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Forms and Liturgy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the People are altogether acquainted, and have ſo long been received in the Church of</hi> England: where his Majeſty would have onely ſome parts amended and corrected, if need be, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Abbreviations of the Form a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, they fly at the whole; their uſual way of Reformation being Root and Branch. For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Inſtead of the old Book amended they offer us a new Model, not a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of the old in it; not one of the Churches Prayers is judged worthy to be joined with theirs: Theſe wiſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-builders can with leſs trouble and charge pull down the Houſe and build a new one, than repair the old; as if it had not one Room convenient, all muſt down to the ground, and not ſo much
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45592:39"/>
as one ſtone in the old Building muſt be uſed in the new.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They complain of the Length of the Common-prayer-book, and make theirs in the ordinary Offices much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but for this they have a <hi>Salvo,</hi> That it may be left to the diſcretion of the Miniſter to omit it as occaſion ſhall require.</p>
            <p>Behold their Liturgy, with a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he who will uſe it may, and he that will not may chooſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They would have it left to the Miniſters choice to uſe their new Form or the old, which is as much as to ſay, All of their Judgment ſhall be free from uſing the Common-prayer; for you will eaſily believe they will like this new Directory better; and then, what need this Treaty? and yet, give them their due, they have no great fancy to their own Form: for,</p>
            <p n="6">6. They will have a farther Liberty. They deſire there may be no ſuch Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Liturgy, as the Exerciſe of the Gift of Prayer be totally excluded in any part of God's Worſhip: So then, a Set Prayer there ſhall be in every part of God's Worſhip, and in every
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45592:40"/>
part the Miniſter may exerciſe his Gifts and ſhew his Parts, and ſtrive to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go this Set Prayer; and ſo the Prayer ſhall be deſpiſed, and his Gifts extolled. Is the Church a place, the Worſhip of God a ſeaſon to exerciſe ſuch Gifts in? Our Graces indeed ſhould be there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, which are beſt done in a Set-form. Gift of Prayer there is none ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. That which is cried up to be ſuch is nothing but an acquired Art or Habit of ready ſpeech, and tends more to Oſtentation than Edification. The Spirit of Prayer the Prophet tels us what it is,<note place="margin">Zach. 12. v. 10.</note> A Spirit of Grace and Supplication, looking on <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith and Love, whom by Sin and Unbelief we have pierced; and by a deep Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance mourning for our Sins, and beſeeching God's Grace to be delivered from them by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s moſt meritorious Sufferings. We may pray without the Spirit when we exerciſe the Gift of Prayer; we may pray with the Spirit when we uſe a Form of Prayer. Sure the Spirit doth not ever withdraw or deny the Aſſiſtence of his Grace to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion when we pray the Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Spirit of Prayer requires not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45592:40"/>
new words, but new affections. Should I make it my End, or any part of it, when I pray in publick, to exerciſe my Gifts, I ſhould juſtly fear to be judged of God, and Men (if they knew it) an abominable Hypocrite and Phariſee.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They object, The whole Body of the Common Prayer conſiſts very much of many Generals, as, to have our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers heard; to be kept from all Evil, from all Enemies and Adverſities; that we may doe God's Will; without any mention of the Particulars wherein theſe Generals do conſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. They make that an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is a Propriety and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The Common Prayers of the Church ſhould be for common and general Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of which the whole Church ſtands in need.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prayer for the Church in the Babylonian Captivity doth conſiſt not very much, but altogether of meer Generals, without any mention of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and yet it was graciouſly heard: and, do they not hereby accuſe our Lord himſelf? is not his Prayer made up of meer Generals? Sure ſo many grave Divines ſhould not make
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45592:41"/>
their Objections by Number, but by Weight, and due and ſober Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>How little they conſidered this will farther appear in that,</p>
            <p n="3">3. They confeſs their Objection to be untrue, when they tell us that the Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is for Grace, Peace, Rain, Fair-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and indeed I may challenge our Brethren to ſhew any Particulars needfull for the Church to petition at the hands of God in her publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip omitted in the Litany.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They deſire, That all obſolete words may be altered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi>That may be ſoon done; for few or no obſolete words are in the Liturgy: but doth not God, do not we underſtand old and plain words? muſt we coin new ones to pleaſe him and our ſelves? muſt we be rhetorical, quaint and curious; complement God in our Prayers? Let us take unto us thoſe words the Church hath from God's Word put into our mouths, and join with them our Hearts, and let us not doubt but God will hear us graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It troubles them, That the publick
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45592:41"/>
Worſhip of God may not be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by any that dares not wear a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Who are thoſe tender ones that dare not? What a frightfull Bugg is a Surplice, that you dare not wear it in the Adminiſtration of the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Nay, you dare refuſe to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in God's publick Worſhip, rather than wear a Surplice. Your Maſter <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> was not ſo timerous, or dainty, <hi>Mihi videtur Eccleſias minime deſerendas prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pileum, aut Veſtes, aut aliquid aliud hujuſmodi vere medium aut indifferens:</hi> To me it ſeemeth that we ought not to forſake the Churches for Caps, or Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or any other ſuch like thing of a nature mixt and indifferent. Mr. <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> was not ſo tender; could (as he profeſſed) willingly wear a Fool's-coat and Cap, ſo he might freely and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly adminiſter God's true and holy Worſhip. Are not different and decent Veſtures by God himſelf appointed to his Prieſts in their publick and holy Miniſtrations? and, why may not the Governors of the Church command un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel the like decent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Habits to Miniſters which God
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45592:42"/>
commanded under the Law? ſo as no Religion or Sanctity be placed in them, as we declare there is not; but they are onely enjoined for Comelineſs and Gravity, ſuitable to ſuch Solemnities: <hi>Solemn Actions of Royalty and Juſtice have their ſuitable ornaments enjoyned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hooker.</note> 
               <hi>and they are unto them a Beauty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get from the People a Veneration; Are they onely a Stain in Religion?</hi> Theſe general Objections againſt the Common Prayers in their <hi>Grand Debate</hi> I thought good to conſider, together with their Reaſons in their <hi>Petition of Peace,</hi> that they may ſee we do not ſlight nor fear any of their Forces, but dare encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their whole ſtrength. Their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Objections againſt the parts of the Liturgy are long ſince by Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and others ſo convincingly anſwered; thoſe which are old: and the new are ſo weak and inconſiderable that they deſerve not a ſober Animadverſion, and therefore I ſhall not give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the trouble of a Confutation. To expoſe a few of them is enough, and he may judge of the reſt by their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They deſire, the word Miniſter,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45592:42"/>
which is uſed in the Abſolution and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other places, may be uſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and not Prieſt and Curate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Confeſſion (they tell us) is very defective, not clearly expreſſing Original Sin, nor ſufficiently enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Actual Sins with their Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but conſiſting onely of Generals; whereas Confeſſion, being the Exerciſe of Repentance, ought to be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: This is already anſwered.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The often repeating the Lord's Prayer, and the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> comes within compaſs of thoſe vain Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions our Saviour condemns; a vain Objection—and may be as well made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 136. and againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other his Pſalms, as alſo againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Solomon,</hi> and our Saviour himſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They would have that Petition in the Litany, <hi>Good Lord deliver us from ſudden Death,</hi> to be altered thus, <hi>Good Lord deliver us from dying ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and unpreparedly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. They would have that Prayer, <hi>That it may pleaſe God to preſerve all that travel by Land or by Water,</hi> to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and expreſſed indefinitely, <hi>all that travel.</hi>

            <p n="6">
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:45592:43"/>6. They expreſs their diſlike of Kneeling at the Reading of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; did they never break any of them? and, is there not a Prayer ſubſequent to each of them? <hi>Lord have mercy upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. They are offended at that Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the firſt Prayer before Baptiſm, <hi>That God, by his Son our Saviour's being baptized in the River Jordan, hath ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified that and all other waters, to the myſtical waſhing away of Sin.</hi> To ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this nice Scruple, 'tis changed, and the word <hi>all</hi> left out. I ſhall no further purſue theſe trifles, profeſſing my great grief and aſtoniſhment, that perſons pretending to ſo great Gravity can poſſibly be guilty of ſuch Lightneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. 'Twas a piece of pride and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Calvin</hi> to charge our Liturgy as containing in it <hi>Tolerabiles Ineptias.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like light and trivial exceptions of our Brethren will to any ſober Judgment appear <hi>Ineptiae Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabiles.</hi> Leaving their <hi>Grand Debate,</hi> which I think, in the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſenſe, may without uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be affixed not onely as the Title, but is much the Subject and Deſign
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45592:43"/>
too of their Paper. I goe on to the Conſideration of their <hi>Petition for Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sweet is the name of <hi>Peace,</hi> and now, if ever, Sweet is the Peace of the State, after ſo long Civil War, and the Peace of the Church, after ſo long Diviſion and Perſecution. Peace is a Bleſſing of Bleſſings, not a ſingle, but a complicated Bleſſing. 'Tis Peace that puts us into, and keeps us in Poſſeſſion of all we enjoy. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels us of a <hi>Bond of Peace.</hi> Peace is the Bond of our Liberties, Properties, Eſtates and Lives, and of that which ſhould be to us dearer than all theſe, our Religion. 'Tis this Religious Peace for which they peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>O that they had hearkned to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of others before: But then they prepared for War, and ſounded the Trumpet to Battel: Then to talk of Peace and Accommodation was the mark of a Malignant: Then <hi>Curſe ye Meroz</hi> was the Text: And, O take heed of Treaties: Well 'tis happy if at laſt Thoughts of Peace may be entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But, my Brethren, why petition you for Peace? is it not Peace? if not,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45592:44"/>
where is the blame? who are thoſe which hinder Peace? Then is it Peace in the Church, when the Magiſtrate is at Peace with the Church and a <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Faith</hi>; when Miniſters are at Peace with themſelves and join regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in their holy Miniſtrations, when Miniſters and their People are at Peace, the one teaching, and the other embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſound Doctrine; when Magiſtrates, Miniſters and People do publickly, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, freely, uniformly profeſs and hold the true Chriſtian Religion, do join and unite in the publick Worſhip of God, ſerving him with one mind and with one mouth, having the ſame Doctrine, the ſame Worſhip, the ſame Government.</p>
            <p>Now conſider who they are which hinder this Peace. You need not peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Biſhops; 'tis in your own power to grant your own Petition; and truly a <hi>Petition for Peace</hi> though it have a pleaſing Sound, yet carries a ſad Suppoſition; it ſupoſes, 1. That you are not in Peace with the Church; and, 2. it implicitly accuſes his Majeſty of Perſecution. But to come to the matter of your Petition, two things you pray:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:45592:44"/>1. That the Biſhops will grant what you have in your <hi>Preface</hi> propoſed, and craved their Conſent unto, the Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Additions to the Liturgy now tendred unto them, that being inſerted as you have expreſſed, It may be left to the Miniſters choice to uſe one or other at his diſcretion, upon his Majeſtie's Approbation, according to his gracious Declaration concerning Eccleſiaſtical Affairs.</p>
            <p>Here they deſire, That it may be left to the Miniſters choice to uſe one or other, the new or the old Form, and 'tis not hard to judge which will be choſen; the old by all who are Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, the new by all the Presbyterians: So ſhall we have Altar againſt Altar; Common-prayer-book againſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer-book, confuſion in all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and Diviſion; thoſe who are for the old, if the new be read, will leave their Miniſter, and go where the old is read; and the like will they doe who are for the new: So ſhall there be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Conteſtations between Miniſters and Miniſters, People and People; one pleading for the old Form, and explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the new; the other arguing for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45592:45"/>
the new, and deſpiſing the old: Is this to petition for Peace? nothing can be more againſt Peace. Certainly we ſhall ever be two, and the Church divided, if we have two Liturgies. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they appeal to his Majeſtie's Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, his Majeſty ſpeaks plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough his meaning, and more plainly in his Commiſſion, that he intends not two Liturgies be eſtabliſhed, but onely ſome Alterations in one and the ſame Liturgy, ſome additional Forms to be left unto the Miniſters choice, to uſe one or the other at his diſcretion; and theſe Alterations and additional Forms not to be made by the one Part ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, as yours are; but by thoſe of both Perſuaſions.</p>
            <p>You farther Petition, ſince we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain the Form of Epiſcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment deſcribed by the late Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Primate <hi>Ireland,</hi> and approved by many Epiſcopal Divines, we may at leaſt enjoy thoſe Benefits of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Diſcipline, and that Freedom from Subſcription, Oaths and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which are granted in the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration by the means of your charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mediation and Requeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:45592:45"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Why did you not then (when it was in your Power, and the Staff in your hands) hearken to Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> and thoſe Epiſcopal Divines? did you not covenant againſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy? do you not ſtill judge your ſelves obliged to keep your Covenant? did not a prime Leader of your Party, in his Sermon at the Treaty at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> call Epiſcopacy and the Common-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-book, <hi>The Plague-ſoars of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> did not his late Majeſty of bleſſed memory offer as great condeſcentions as could be deſired to your Divines at the Iſle of <hi>Wight?</hi> and, did they not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and diſown all Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>Hear his Majeſty: <hi>I was willing to grant or reſtore to Presbytery what with reaſon or diſcretion it can pretend to in a conjuncture, with Epiſcopacy, but for that wholly to invade the Power, and by the Sword to arrogate and quite abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the authority of that ancient Order, I think neither juſt as to Epiſcopacy, nor ſafe for Presbytery, nor yet any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for this Church and State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold what his Majeſty was willing to doe in yieldance to Presbytery; ſo
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45592:46"/>
as Epiſcopacy might not be abrogated. Behold what the Presbyterians will doe, they will goe no lower than to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Epiſcopacy, and ſince they could not doe it by the Word, they will doe it by the Sword. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Have you now really changed your minds? are you in good earneſt? do you ſpeak <hi>Verbo Sacerdotum</hi> when you make us believe you deſire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Epiſcopacy? How doth this conſiſt with your Profeſſion in your <hi>Grand Debate?</hi> There you utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim all Epiſcopacy. Theſe are your words, <hi>We doubt whether men in the ſame Order do, by Divine appointment, owe obedience unto thoſe that gradually goe before them; and they may ſcruple whether ſuch making themſelves the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of their Brethren, make not themſelves indeed of a different Order or Office, and ſo incroach not upon the Authority of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>who onely maketh Officers purely Eccleſiaſtical, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be no diſloyalty to</hi> Chriſt, <hi>to own ſuch Officers: Again, 'tis a matter of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great doubt, whether a fixed Dioceſan, being the Paſtor of many hundred Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, be indeed a Governour of</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45592:46"/>
appointment or approbation; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Chriſt <hi>will give us any more thanks for owning them as ſuch, than the King will gives us for owning an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He who can reconcile their <hi>Petition for Peace</hi> with their <hi>Grand Debate,</hi> the one pretending for Epiſcopacy, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther renouncing all Epiſcopacy, <hi>Erit mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi magnus</hi> Apollo. But the Inſtance you might have let alone of <hi>owning an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper.</hi> Did you not own and ſet up an Uſurping Parliament againſt the King? and, will you not diſown the moſt Lawfull King that ſhall deny your Will and Way;<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Holy Common-wealth.</note> and own the Greateſt Uſurper that will ſet up and yield his Neck to your Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But if you cannot gain your own, you would be free from Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any other; <hi>That we may at leaſt enjoy freedom from Subſcription, Oaths, and Ceremonies, by the means of your charitable Mediation.</hi> A modeſt and merry Requeſt, That the Biſhops will mediate with his Majeſty, that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians may be free from Obedience to Epiſcopal Government. Were your Presbyterian Government ſet up, would you allow the Freedom you ask? You
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45592:47"/>
have preached and printed againſt Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: you would <hi>bind Kings with your Chains, and Nobles with Links of Iron</hi>; you would be very ſhy to give the Indulgencies and Diſpenſations your ſelves deſire: Nay, you refuſe them to your Independent Brethren.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond Petition is; <hi>Seeing ſome hundreds of able, holy and faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are of late caſt out, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Congregations in</hi> England, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> Wales <hi>are overſpread with lamentable ignorance, and are deſtitute of able, faithfull Teachers; and ſeeing too many that are inſufficient, negligent or ſcandalous are over the flocks, we take this opportunity earneſtly to beſeech you, that will contribute your endeavours to the removal of thoſe that are the ſhame and burthens of the Churches, and to the Reſtoration of ſuch as may be an honour and bleſſing unto them, and to that end that it be not imputed unto them as their unpardonable Crime, that they were born in an Age and Countrey which required Ordination by parochial Paſtors without Dioceſans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Is not this a Phariſaical ſtrain through all your Papers, To cry up
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45592:47"/>
your own Holineſs, Faithfulneſs, Piety and Painfulneſs, and to reproach the Conformiſts as Inſufficient, Negligent, the Shame and Burthen of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</p>
            <p>Compariſons are odious unto you, but we dare appeal to the World, and to him who can judge of Hypocriſie and Sincerity, that there are Epiſcopal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons many far more Able, Holy, Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Faithfull Miniſters than any of the Presbyterians; and many of the Presbyterians more Inſufficient, Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Scandalous than any of the Epiſcopal; and if Accuſations of others were a Vindication of our ſelves, we could write Centuries as well as your <hi>White,</hi> and name abundance of thoſe you count and call Godly who are the Shame and Burthen of Churches.</p>
            <p>And, to be plain with you, who truſt in your ſelves, <hi>that you are Righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 18.9.</note> 
               <hi>and deſpiſe others,</hi> you are all (none excepted) the Shame and Burthen of the Church: If to preach up Rebellion againſt the King, the Nurſing Father of the Church, to caſt off the Apoſtolical Government of the Church, to eject all the true Sons of the Church, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45592:48"/>
and poſſeſs your ſelves by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of all the Revenues of the Church be any Shame, or Sin, or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to your tender Conſciences; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or no, 'tis ſo certainly to all who are truly conſciencious; and God grant your deep Reſentment and timely Repentance may by God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy waſh away the Sin and Shame, and eaſe the Burthen, which if not now, you will one day feel very heavy and uneaſie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How can you tell us of hundreds of yours caſt out, and your guilt not fly in your faces? Did you not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee we could retort, that thouſands of Epiſcopal men were caſt out for their Loyalty and Conſtancy to the Religion in the Church of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhed, for not covenanting, for not contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Schiſm and Rebellion; we could name if need were thouſands whoſe Learning, Piety and Painfulneſs in their places Envy it ſelf cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. Their onely Crime being their ample Revenues and competent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Seeing ſome hundreds are of late caſt out, your Conſciences know you
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45592:48"/>
affirm an untruth, that there are none caſt out, but ſuch as were unjuſt Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into other mens Charges, thoſe who without and againſt Law were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, are now by Law reſtored, and if any of them be unworthy, the Law is open, and may they be proſecuted, and, if they deſerve it, impartially pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; we juſtifie not any that are ſcandalous. O that all were holy who ſerve in the holy Miniſtry; and here on my knees I beſeech the moſt Reverend Fathers of the Church, That thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who are Conformiſts, but whoſe Lives are vicious and ſcandalous, may notwithſtanding their Conformity fall under the ſevereſt Cenſures: Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie hath no ſuch great Enemies as theſe pretended Friends.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But why all this Complaint of your being caſt out by the Biſhops? as if they had caſt you out, when you know and the whole Nation knows, that they were caſt out by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (the Biſhops not ſitting in that Parliament) or rather removed from the unjuſt poſſeſſion of other mens Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the lawfull Incumbents reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So that you ſmite his Majeſty and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45592:49"/>
the Parliament through the Biſhops ſides.</p>
            <p>You go on; <hi>Being conſcious that we ſeek not great things for our ſelves or for our Brethren; that we are ambitious of no greater wealth and honour than our daily bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Do not thoſe ſeek great things for themſelves, in reſpect of Honour who would be co-ordinate with Kings, and who would not be ſubordinate to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, diſowning their Authority, their Ordination and Government, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging to themſelves an equal right to both? And for Wealth, you cannot but be conſcious that you have ſought great things; the greateſt Livings (though with the Ruin of the Lawfull Owners) the moſt wealthy places in Cities, Univerſities, and the Country. Many of you had a rich Benefice, and a fat Lecture, or a Government in ſome College: So that whatever you profeſs you lie as deeply under the Scandal of Ambition and Covetouſneſs as you would bring thoſe who are Epiſcopal.</p>
            <p>Theſe are their Requeſts; 1. That they may have a Government and a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie of their own, different from that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45592:49"/>
eſtabliſhed; and if not, that they may be free from that in the Church eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all Presbyterians may be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the choiceſt Livings, as holy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and faithfull; and that Epiſcopal men, as they have been by them caſt out, may be kept out of their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings as ſcandalous, negligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient. How can theſe Requeſts be denyed, in number ſo few, in nature ſo modeſt, religious and rational? for with twenty Reaſons are theſe two Requeſts enforced; yet, when well conſidered, will ſhrink up into almoſt as few as their Requeſts, and will prove as pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. They tell us, they dare not uſe a Croſs or Surplice, or worſhip God in a Form which they judge diſorderly, defective or corrupt, when they have better to offer him, <hi>Malachi,</hi> 1.13.</p>
            <p>To that Scruple of the Surplice I have already anſwered; and to that of the Croſs the Church hath anſwered, <hi>Canon,</hi> 30. and thoſe whom the Church cannot ſatisfie, 'tis in vain for any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon to attempt it; and, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſay their Form of Worſhip is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45592:50"/>
better than ours, we muſt give every one leave to have a love for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their own production, and the Text they alledge <hi>Malachi,</hi> 1.13. as the Reaſon why they judge our Form de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and their own better, ſpeaks alowd the fondneſs of their Affection, blinding their Judgment. Nothing could have been ſaid more for our Form or againſt their own (ſuppoſing the words any way applicable to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) Are not you they that ſay the Table of the Lord is polluted, his Meat is contemptible? Do not you ſay, What a wearineſs is it? And ye have ſnuffed at it, and ye have brought (inſtead of it your new Form) that which is torn, and lame, and ſick; thus ye have brought an Offering. The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Reaſons, we had all before in their Requeſt and are now repeated as the Reaſons of it, their Holineſs, their Ableneſs, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt out, their great Sufferings, their tender Conſciences. But though I have ſpoken to them before, I ſhall paſs on them ſome Remarks, leſt they ſhould judge we could not anſwer them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There are few Nations under the Heavens of God, as far as we can learn,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45592:50"/>
that have more able, holy, faithfull, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and truly peaceable Preachers of the Goſpel, proportionably then thoſe that are now caſt out in</hi> England; <hi>and are like in</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>to be caſt out, if the old Conformity be urged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, 3. <hi>Whether it be equal to bring upon ſo many of them ſo great Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>We would here remember you how great and conſiderable a part of the three Nations there is that muſt incur thoſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi> And again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>We may plead the Nature of their Cauſe, to move you to commiſerate your afflicted Brethren in their Sufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Biſhops and Epiſcopal and Loyal Clergy have learned by their own Sufferings to compaſſionate the Sufferings of others. But this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Presbyterians Sufferings is like that of Children who bite and cry, ſome can endure much and complain little, ſome will cry out for little or nothing; and they ſay they are moſt impatient in the leaſt Sickneſs who have lived long in health, not knowing what Sickneſs meant. Let me be bold to ask, Who of you are the men that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45592:51"/>
have ſuffered? what have you ſuffered? how long? and, under whom? who have been your Perſecutors?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who are the men? Are all the Presbyterians ejected and ſequeſtred? All the Biſhops and Loyal Clergy were generally caſt out; unleſs Poverty were their protection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What have they ſuffered? Have they been deprived of their Livings wherewith the Law inveſted them? Have they been ſilenced, plundered of their Goods, Books, Papers, ſhut up in Priſons, baniſhed, martyred? You know who ſuffered thus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How long? The Conformiſts have ſuffered in Silence and Patience near twenty years together, and your pretended ſufferings a few months (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a capacity to be reſtored when ever you will return to your duty) make more noiſe than all the Sufferings of all the Epiſcopal perſons all theſe years.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From whom? Have you ſuffered from your Brethren, from your fellow Subjects without and againſt Law? There are, you know, who have thus ſuffered: But you cannot ſay you have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45592:51"/>
ſuffered any thing but what the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, and ſurely that is no note of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Sincerity, as you inſinuate. If your Sincerity be no more than your Sufferings, you have as little cauſe to boaſt of that as to complain of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Non cruciatus, ſed Cauſa</hi>—Let it not diſpleaſe you, if I lay before you and the World a true and juſt account of your Sufferings and Calamities: 'Tis ſhortly this; You and your Party had by Arms and Violence, againſt all Law, Conſcience, Juſtice and Charity, ſeiſed and poſſeſſed your ſelves of the Eſtates of your King, divers of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, the Biſhops, Deans and Chapters, the Dignities and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of the Loyal Clergy, all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and wealthy Offices eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and civil by Sea and Land; theſe you held and enjoyed until God turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Captivity, and the King and the Church was happily reſtored, and then their Eſtates and Rights were reſtored, and you enforced to quit them without the demand of Arrears or Reſtitution for the time you enjoyed them, which was ſo long and the Revenues ſo large, that abundance of you, being good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45592:52"/>
and great Improvers, have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded well againſt a Storm and got out of your Sequeſtrations and Purchaſes plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Eſtates; ſo that of the Calamity of our ſuffering Brethren, and the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the reſtored King, Church and Laws, this is the moſt deplored and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable account; The King, the Church and the Suffering Loyal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will needs have their Rights again; and ſo the Godly Party who invaded them muſt no longer injoy them; The Prey is plucked out of their Teeth, and they muſt vomit up the ſweet morſell. You muſt pardon me if, againſt my <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> your loud and redoubled Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries of your mighty Sufferings enforce me to be plain with you, and tell you your own.</p>
            <p>In their Fifth, after their <hi>Preface</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning their Sufferings, and in their Sixth, they argue from the meanneſs of the things impoſed in the Judgment of the Biſhops, and the ponderouſneſs in their own.</p>
            <p>It is in your own account, <hi>But for refuſing Conformity to things indifferent, or at the moſt of no neceſſity to Salvation:</hi> It is in their account, <hi>for the ſake of</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:45592:52"/>
Chriſt. <hi>Do you think the Lord that died for Souls, and hath ſent us to learn what that meaneth,</hi> I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice, <hi>is better pleaſed with Re-ordination, Subſcription and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, than with the Saving of Souls by the means of his own appointment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Do you think that the Lord who died for Souls, and hath ſent us to learn what that meaneth, <hi>I will have mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi> is better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with your Refuſal to ſave Souls by the Means of his own appointment, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scruple of Ordination by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Ceremonies and Indifferent things, than he would be if, ſubmitting to them, you would preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and ſave Souls? Will this be a good Anſwer to the Lord at the great Day of Accounts? Lord, I would have preached the Goſpel, I would have endeavoured the Salvation of Souls; But I durſt not wear a Surplice, I durſt not uſe that declared Indifferent Ceremony of the Croſs, I durſt not kneel before thee at thy holy Table, I durſt not be obedient to my Lawfull Superiours who required theſe things, and though I know that neceſſity is laid
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45592:53"/>
upon me, yea, <hi>wo is unto me, if I preach not the Goſpel</hi>; yet I thought my ſelf obliged rather to diſpenſe with that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thou haſt laid upon me than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to thoſe indifferent things they would lay upon me againſt my Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty, and to let thouſands of Souls periſh, than hazard my own by Subſcription and Ceremonies. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Offence of Refuſing Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in things indifferent, is not to be meaſured according to the things unto which we are to conform, which the Church hath declared her Judgment in that they are not to be valued for their own ſakes. But 'tis Pride, Contempt, and Diſobedience to Lawfull Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to oppoſe its Orders, and theſe are not ſo ſlight faults as you imagin; it was but a light fault that <hi>Shimei</hi> made, in going out of the City, but he loſt his Head for it; it was but a light fault that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> made in touching the Ark, but he loſt his Life for it. But, ſay you, Though the Biſhops call the things they enjoin Indifferent, yet our Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are otherwiſe. 'Tis in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the ſake of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe we dare not conſent to that which we judge
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45592:53"/>
an Uſurpation of his Kingly power, and an Accuſation of his Laws, as inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis worth our Obſervation, that of Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> that all their Arguments againſt our Ceremonies are drawn from the Head of Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and then with the ſame Breath they deny them to be things indifferent, and often do they uſe this Topick in this Addreſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He and others have proved the things to be indifferent (as the Church declares them) which they can never diſprove.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis for the ſake of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that you diſobey the Command and Example of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; that you diſobey the Magiſtrates of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Government of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Orders of his Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You judge the Biſhops Injunction of things indifferent an Uſurpation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Kingly power, and Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Laws as inſufficient. But your Apoſtle, Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> judges otherwiſe, as do the Biſhops, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Laws for all things neceſſary in the Divine Worſhip. But as to things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to outward Order and Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45592:54"/>
he hath taught nothing expreſly. Thoſe he hath left to the Churches pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> given ſuch Laws? Open our eyes, ſhew us, and let us ſee them: (Hath he not) then, not the Governours of the Church, but you, who judge he ought, do accuſe <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Laws as inſufficient.</p>
            <p>In their fifth Reaſon they ſay, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they be miſtaken, in thinking the things to be ſo diſpleaſing to God: yet it is commendable in them to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in diſpleaſing him, and carefull to obey him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We ſee, be they right or wrong, whatever they opine and act is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. Suppoſe they miſtook in preaching us into Rebellion, in pulling down Biſhops, in taking away the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, in overturning the Foundations of Church and State, yet their Zeal is commendable. May not all Zealots plead thus? Suppoſe the Papiſts were miſtaken in their Fiery Zeal to blow up the King and Parliament, and in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacre, yet their Zeal was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, in deſigning to deſtroy thoſe they judged the Enemies of their Church. Suppoſe they be miſtaken in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45592:54"/>
worſhipping the Saints, and their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Reliques, yet, ſince they think they pleaſe God, 'tis commendable. Suppoſe the Quakers miſtaken in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and all Authority in Church and State, yet, in that they think they ſhould diſpleaſe God in owning thoſe Powers, 'tis in them commendable to diſown them. Is this the Counſel you would give to one who doubts and ſeeks your Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Will this ſatisfie and deliver him from doubting, to tell him, Suppoſe you were miſtaken; yet, if you think you are in the right, purſue your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis commendable? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is a better Caſuiſt, and gives other Counſel, <hi>Prove all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.21.</note> 
               <hi>hold faſt that which is good, abſtain from all appearance of evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. That, becauſe men are forbidden to preach unleſs they conform, they are tempted to infer, that Preaching being neceſſary to Salvation, and thoſe things called Indifferent, being made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Preaching, and preferred before it; therefore they are made neceſſary to Salvation, and preferred before that which God hath made neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:45592:55"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Accuſation is moſt untrue; thoſe Indifferent things are not made neceſſary to Preaching, much leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before it; and thoſe who are tempted thus to infer, becauſe men are forbidden to preach, unleſs they dare ſubſcribe and uſe thoſe things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe things (called Indifferent) are made neceſſary to Preaching, and preferred before it, are very weak Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians.</p>
            <p>Every thing that is required, is not required as neceſſary, as you have been often told. Many things are required as expedient, as decent, as comely, as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; ſo are our Ceremonies. Miniſters are forbidden to reade Prayers without the Surplice, to preach without a Gown: The Judges are forbidden to ſit in Judgment, till they reade their Commiſſion; and are required to ſit in their Scarlet; will any hence be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to infer, that the Surplice and Gown are made neceſſary to and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Prayer and Preaching; and reading a Commiſſion, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Scarlet Robes are made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to and preferred before doing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:45592:55"/>2. Every thing that is made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to any End or Action, is not thereby preferred before it. Methinks ſo many Learned Divines ſhould know, that though theſe Indifferent things ſhould be made neceſſary by the Command of the Church to Preaching, yet, it no way follows, they are preffered before it. The Means ſure is made neceſſary to the obtaining the End, yet is not preffered before it. 'Tis, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, juſtly forbidden, that Ordination ſhould be given to any without Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Impoſition of hands, or that any ſhould preached without Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet, I think, you are not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to infer, that Examination, Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands and Ordination it ſelf, though neceſſary, are to be preffered before Preaching.

Fence God hath yet raiſed againſt Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the World; and We are perſuaded they do with great Zeal wiſh it reſtored to its old Dignity and Veneration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee what Judgment the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches have paſſed upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and her former Proceedings, and thereby may take an Eſtimate, what Judgment they will paſs on her preſent Proceedings, and how the Churche's Cauſe and yours will be repreſented to them: They will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg and magnifie, with great Submiſſion and Reverence, the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if you dare believe his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and conſequently will cenſure you as Schiſmatical and Diſobedient, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſubmit unto it.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not miſrepreſent you your Submiſſion you profeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If after our Submiſſion to hiſ Majeſty's Declaration, and after our own Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of the primitive Epiſcopacy, and of ſuch a Liturgy as we here tender, we may not be permitted to exerciſe our Miniſtry, the Pens of thoſe moderate Biſhops will bear witneſs againſt you, that were once employed as the Chief Defenders of that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45592:60"/>
Cauſe, (we mean ſuch as Reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> Hall <hi>and</hi> Uſher) <hi>who have publiſhed to the World, that much leſs than this might have ſerved to our fraternal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> You before appealed to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches abroad, now unto two Biſhops of our own, and with like Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You ſay you have ſubmitted to his Majeſtie's Declaration, you ſhould have inſtanced wherein. His Majeſty there declares, That, <hi>having ſeen all the Liturgies that are extant and uſed in this part of the World, he eſteems that of the Church of</hi> England <hi>to be the beſt, and well knows the Reverence the moſt, or at leaſt the moſt Learned in the Reformed Churches, have for it; he heartily wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and deſires, until it be reviewed, and ſome Alterations and Additional Forms made, the Miniſters, who diſlike ſome Clauſes and Expreſſions, would not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore totally lay aſide the uſe of the Book of Common-prayer, but reade thoſe parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which there can be no exception, which would be the beſt inſtance of decly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe marks of diſtinction which his Majeſty ſo much labours and deſires to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:45592:61"/>Have you herein ſubmitted to his Majeſtie's Declaration? Have you read any thing of the Common Prayers, and thereby inſtanced your deſire in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his Majeſtie's, to remove and decline thoſe marks of diſtinction? What you can lay hold of to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in his Declaration, you greedily catch at, the reſt you paſs by.</p>
            <p>However you pretend to ſubmit to his Majeſtie's Declaration, he therein complains, your Party (of which you are the Leaders) <hi>have not dealt candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, that there are amongſt them unquiet and reſtleſs Spirits who continue their Bitterneſs againſt the Church, and indeavour to raiſe Jealouſies againſt his Majeſty, and have unſeaſonably printed, publiſhed and diſperſed a Declaration to his Majeſtie's Reproach; and ſince the printing this Declaration (you ſay you ſubmit to) ſeveral ſeditious Pamphlets and Quaeries have been publiſhed and ſcattered abroad, to infuſe Diſlike and Jealouſies into the Hearts of the People.</hi> Behold your Submiſſion to his Majeſtie's Declaration.</p>
            <p>You next tell us of your own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of the Primitive Epiſcopacy, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45592:61"/>
your own Liturgy. What your Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Epiſcopacy is, your <hi>Jus Divinum Miniſtrii Anglicani</hi> ſpeaks, That there is no Biſhop in the ſenſe of our Church, no <hi>Epiſcopus Paſtorum,</hi> but all Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are equally, and in a parity, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopi Gregis:</hi> and what your own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is, you have let us ſee ſuch a one as you would have for your ſelves, in oppoſition to that of the Church; and yet, though you would have it, you will not be bound to uſe it neither; which is as much as to ſay, If you may not have your own fancied frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and publick Worſhip, and that with Liberty too, to throw them off when your fancie changeth, you receive mighty wrong, and, as you ſaid before, all the Proteſtant Churches, ſo you ſay now, all the World will think it ſtrange. Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> you mentioned before, you now bring him in again after Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> and give them the Titles of Reverend, Learned and Moderate. 'Tis well Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> (now he is at reſt) hath from you ſo kind a Character: Time was when your combined Forces were bent ſingly againſt him; you fought neither with ſmall nor great, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45592:62"/>
onely with Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>; and when <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> was not able to diſpute him down, your <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> railed him down; and however you now comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him, you have ſhewn your preſent Eſteem of him and of the Primitive E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, in reprinting your <hi>Smectym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuus</hi> now, ſince his Majeſtie's Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if, as you ſay, he and Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> have publiſhed to the World, that much leſs than that would have ſerved to a fraternal Peace; you publiſh to the World, you have been obſtinate and averſe to Peace and Unity; who, when you had the Law in your hands, would not hearken to thoſe, by you confeſſed, Moderate Terms of Unity and Peace, and your own Pens will bear witneſs againſt you, that you are now juſtly repulſed, who would not yield when fair means of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were offered as to Re-ordination, which you often mention, and here it comes in again.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We deny your Presbyterian and Independent (ſo called) Ordination to be really and indeed any Ordination at all; and till you prove it ſuch, you charge the Biſhops falſely wih requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Re-ordination.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:45592:62"/>2. Many who have been under your hands have of themſelves (without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required) judging your pretended Ordination a Nullity, deſired Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Biſhops.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Canon (ſuppoſed) of the Apoſtles toucheth not this Caſe, nor our Biſhops, who neither do re-ordain nor allow it. Re-ordaining, rightly ſo called, being the Ordaining again of a Deacon or Prieſt by a Biſhop, who was by him known to have been by a Biſhop before ordained.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Biſhop <hi>Bancroſt</hi> ſpeaks of thoſe who were ordained by Presbyters, where were no Biſhops to ordain them, as in many of the Reformed Churches abroad.</p>
            <p>But we had Biſhops till you pull'd them down: Nay, bleſſed be God, we had Biſhops after you had pull'd them down, and till his Majeſty ſet them up again, and thoſe who would, in all the late times, might have had, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many had Ordination from their hands: 'tis therefore a moſt groſs Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and 'tis ſtrange, ſuch Godly men as you ſhould dare to utter and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it, That your young Preachers, by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45592:63"/>
the old Presbyters ſent, were born in an Age and Countrey which required Ordination by Parochial Paſtors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Dioceſans: if there had been no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, you might then have ſaid, the Age and Countrey required (leſt the Church ſhould fail) Ordination from Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Paſtors; but I ſay, and you to your Sorrow know, there were Biſhops all that time, divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> and alſo <hi>Scotiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Biſhops, who, though many of them were latent, yet were and might be addreſſed to, and did all along confer holy Orders: there are at leaſt five <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops living to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and you may know more, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Honour to be joyned with them in Commiſſion, which all good men are ſorry is not on your part ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged temperately and humbly, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and piouſly, to the Peace of the Church, by your ſelves chiefly (but for all our ſins) long and lamentably divided.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 11. Is a repeated Complaint of their Afflictions, and an Accuſation of the Biſhops as their Afflictors, which is already anſwered.</p>
            <p>The Twelfth and Fourteenth are the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45592:63"/>
ſame, and ſhall be conſidered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> is hammered on the ſame Anvil with the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; That they are the Godly party, and afflicted; the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal are cruel, and perſecute them for the Cauſe of <hi>Chriſt: How will</hi> Chriſt: <hi>take it of you to caſt out from the Miniſtery, or Communion of the Church, or to grieve and puniſh all that dare not conform to you in theſe Matters?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> How will <hi>Chriſt</hi> take it from you to caſt out all Biſhops and Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal men who durſt not conform to you in your Matters? The Biſhops Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are by gentle methods: 1. They Admoniſh; 2. Suſpend; 3. Silence; before they deprive any; and none are deprived, but for foul and incorrigible Crimes: but you eject at firſt, and total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for no Crime, for no Breach of the Laws and Orders, but even for that the Epiſcopal perſons ſtand for the Laws and Orders eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>You trod down the Stars of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> planting as the Stones in the ſtreet: All thoſe places of Scripture miſapplied by you, may againſt you be rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:45592:64"/>And whereas elſewhere they ſay to this purpoſe, Sad Experience tels the World, that if the Miniſters we are pleading for be laid aſide, there are not competent men enough to ſupply their room.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Their Care, that there be a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of competent men to ſerve the Church, is commendable and pious: But why did they not take that Care when it was in their power, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves laid aſide and caſt out Thouſands, to provide competent men to ſupply their rooms? Indeed for competent and great Livings they provided; but the places that were poor, if empty they filled them not, if full by perſons never ſo incompetent they amended it not. I believe it is a meaſured Truth, never were ſo many places unprovided, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many meanly provided, as in thoſe times ſince the firſt times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when competent Miniſters (as now required to be qualified) could not be had for many places; one indeed I have heard of, having in Zeal helped to eject his Miniſter out of a ſmall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, deſired the Clerk of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee for plundered Miniſters, to commend
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45592:64"/>
a Miniſter unto them; he anſwered, O, none of us will accept of that, you muſt provided as you can.</p>
            <p>The 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Reaſon, the ſame as I told you, and you may find with the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, tels us the Conſtitutions of the Church are againſt their Judgment; and they have not their Judgments at Command; and were they never ſo willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ought to obey them, they cannot therefore believe the Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lawfull becauſe they would, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect being not free.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> What is every body's Argument is no Argument. Thus may the <hi>Jew,</hi> the <hi>Turk,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> plead for their own, and againſt the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and thus your Independent Brethren have argued in their <hi>Pleas for Toleration,</hi> which once you oppoſed; but now you ſharpen your Goads at their Forges: You bring an Objection, as made by us, that we may ſay, 'tis your own fault, that your Judgments are not changed, and that the means have been ſufficient, to which you ſhape an Anſwer, ſuch as it is, but which may make your ſelves bluſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Sword can eaſilier take this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:45592:65"/>
for granted, than the Tongue or Pen of man prove.</hi> My Brethren, <hi>Quorſum haec?</hi> You might well have ſpared the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sword</hi>; Why do you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your own Miſcarriages to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the World? Who were thoſe that drew the Sword for Reformation? Who called to Arm? Who promiſed Heaven to all that would take up the Sword in that bleſſed Cauſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? when you were then told of the Word and of the Laws, you could anſwer with that <hi>Roman, Nunquamne nobis Gladiis ſuccinctis Leges recitare deſinetis?</hi> Tell you us, who have our Swords by our ſides, of the Laws? We tell you, we have drawn our Swords to cut in ſunder thoſe Gordian Knots, your Parchment Laws. So of late your Heroick <hi>Oliver</hi> to thoſe who pleaded the Laws and ancient Charters granted and confirmed by our Kings, <hi>Magna Charta, Magna Far</hi>—</p>
            <p>But, I pray you, what Sword do the Biſhops, whom you plead with, uſe, but the Spiritual? They are no Popes, who challenge <hi>Poteſtatem utriuſque Gladii</hi>; They are no Presbyterians, who are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Powers with Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45592:65"/>
and for their Tongues and Pens, you muſt ſtrike Sail, till you ſhall be able to encounter and conquer thoſe Worthies, Biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and many more ſuch Generals in the Lord's Hoſt, with whom your <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſham, Baines, Parker, Ames, Dod, Ball, Nichols,</hi> are not to be named the ſame day.</p>
            <p n="15">15. We crave leave to ask, Whether your ſelves do not in ſome things miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take?</p>
            <p>Good Leave have you, and you ask a wiſe Queſtion, with a Conſequence as wild: in your Covenant you yoake Popery with Prelacy, and now you wittily and merrily ask the Prelates, Whether they think themſelves, as the Pope, Infallible; and yet your Party proclaim themſelves next to Infallible. I need not remember you where they ſay, Loath we are to think that they who are moſt ſound in Doctrine ſhould miſtake in Diſcipline: Well, but the Prelates will confeſs, they may miſtake, are not infallible; What's the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? If you may miſtake in any thing, may it not be in ſuch great
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45592:66"/>
things as theſe? and in the ſame breath you ſay, Theſe great things are the ſmalleſt, Ceremonies and Circumſtances of Worſhip. I conceive you ſpeak this Ironically, otherwiſe your Inference is in you a foul miſtake: underſtanding men may miſtake in great things; <hi>ergo</hi> they may miſtake in ſmall things. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, on this Suppoſition you deſtroy all Power in men to make Laws in great or ſmall things, becauſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are men, and may err and miſtake in ſome things; <hi>ergo</hi> they may make Laws in nothing.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>Whether this be doing as you would be done by? would you be caſt out for every fault that is as bad as this? Put your ſelves in their caſe, and ſuppoſe you had ſtudied, conferred and prayed, and done your beſt to know whether God would have you to be re-ordained, and to uſe theſe Forms, Ceremonies, Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or not; and, having done all, you think that God would be diſpleaſed if you ſhould uſe them; would you then be uſed your ſelves as your diſſenting Brethren are now uſed or like to be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is their ſtrongeſt and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Argument, drawn from the general
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45592:66"/>
Rule of Equity and Charity, and 'tis eaſie to retort it, being much more ſtrong on the Biſhops part. Put your ſelves in the Biſhops caſe, and ſuppoſe you had ſtudied, conferred, prayed, and done your beſt to know whether God would have you to preach Reſiſtence againſt your Sovereign, renounce Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy, caſt out the Church Liturgy; and, having done all, you think (nay, are ſure, for thinking will not doe) that God would be diſpleaſed if you ſhould doe ſo; would you be uſed your ſelves as your party uſed the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops? impriſoned, beheaded, ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Reaſon is drawn from the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions cauſed by impoſing things unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and the Unity and Peace which would follow, if men might enjoy their Liberty, and might have leave to ſerve God as his Apoſtles did; and upon theſe they enlarge in four whole Pages: <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more affecteth us than to think of the lamentable Diviſions that have been cauſed and are ſtill like to be, while things unneceſſary are ſo impoſed; and on the contrary, how bleſſed an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Peace we might enjoy, if theſe occaſions
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45592:67"/>
of Diviſion were removed, and we might but have leave to ſerve God as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If it affect you ſo much to think upon the Diviſions, it ſhould affect you to think that you have been and are the chief cauſe of them, and you might, if your Will ſtood not in your way, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them; but you mightily miſtake both the Cauſe and Cure of our Diviſions, which are the direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what you ſurmiſe. The Cauſe of our Diviſions is the Liberty you deſire; the Cure would be your Obedience to the Churche's lawfull Impoſitions, and this not onely Reaſon but your own Experience might have taught you. You caſt off the Reins of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, you ſet your ſelves at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Did this Cure your Diviſions and create among you Peace and Unity? No, after you had divided from the Church, and caſt off its Rule and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; you ſubdivided among your ſelves, and broke all into pieces and parties; never did any Age ſee ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Diviſions in this Church and Nation. But you accuſe the Biſhops, as if they will not give you leave to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45592:67"/>
ſerve God as his Apoſtles did: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you this as falſe as foul an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Do not the Biſhops maintain, and the Church ſtedfaſtly continue in the Apoſtles Doctrine? Do they not againſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon us their Traditions in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Scriptures, aſſert the Scripture alone to be a moſt perfect Rule of Faith and Manners? Do they not ſerve God as the Apoſtles have taught? and ſo many you in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our Church. Truly if your meaning be, that they give you not leave to ſerve God as Apoſtles, and no leſs or lower will ſerve you, than to be as they, to give Laws to all the Churches, and to be under the Laws of none; you muſt prove your ſelves to be ſuch before you crave that leave: But though you are not Apoſtles, yet you are Prophets, you foreſee and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the Sufferings of your Innocent Party—Strange! What a Noiſe they make in almoſt every Paragraph, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and repeating their Sufferings? We are, againſt our wills, enforced as often to let them know, and I wiſh they would rightly reſent, and lay it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45592:68"/>
to heart, that the Biſhops and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Clergy have been really Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers for many years, and in the Loſs of all they had, and they the Cauſes of their Sufferings, and for all thoſe years enjoyed all Eaſe and Plenty, and at this time of their preſent loud Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint they have yet ſuffered nothing, and are certain they ſhall not doe, if they will return to their Duty, all their former Miſcarriages, being by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie's Mercy buried in oblivion; and if they will doe ſo, they may be received into Favour, and are as capable of all Preferments as any the trueſt Sons of the Church. I am unwilling to remark the other part of their Prophecie, rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up our Diviſions (by their Party raiſed and continued ever ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) they in effect threaten, they will be their Sons and Heirs, and that we muſt not expect Peace, but look for Miſery and Diviſion, unleſs they may have their Demands, to be as free and high as the Apoſtles: and here, as their manner is, they heap up a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Scriptures, you may judge how pertinently by the firſt they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 1 <hi>Philippians,</hi> 14. There St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:45592:68"/>
ſaith, <hi>Many of the Brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by his bonds, were much more bold to ſpeak the Word without fear.</hi> This Text they cite to prove that the Bonds and Burthens and Diſpleaſure which is upon them from their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, hinders them from ſerving the Lord without fear. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s bonds made theſe Brethren confident, and ſet them above fear. But our Brethren, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their meer fancy of Bonds and Burthens, are faint-hearted, and with fear even diſtracted. The other Scriptures make as little for them or againſt the Biſhops: and ſo I ſhall paſs them over.</p>
            <p>The 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Reaſons are of the ſame Bran, yet again and again they cry up their Abilities and their Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and cry out of their Sufferings and Perſecutions, and the Ungodlineſs of all who are not of their way. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive the Reaſon, why this one Topick of their Sufferings makes up more than Ten of their Twenty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and they bring it in over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo very often, but that they think no body knows or will believe they have ſuffered any thing, and therefore they ſay it ſo often; or elſe by the

loud and repeated Cry of their own, they would drown the loud Cry of the Biſhops Sufferings by them and their Party, which yet the Biſhops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves paſs by in Silence; but the World cannot but take notice of with much concernment.</p>
            <p>Let us yet hear them again.</p>
            <p>In the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> they call themſelves the <hi>Holy Seed,</hi> and ſo many able Miniſters laid aſide; and that many of them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and that the Ungodly add Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to their Affliction. And in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>So many truly fearing God, being caſt or trodden down, are tempted to think ill of that which themſelves and the Church thus ſuffer by; and when ſo many of the worſt befriend this way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it gratifieth them, it tendeth to make your Cauſe judged of, according to the qualities of its friends or adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> Of their Sufferings enough, and too much of their Godlineſs and the Ungodlineſs of all who are not of their Party.

            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:45592:69"/>The worſt, they ſay, befriend that way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That's no proof of the evil of that way, rather of the goodneſs which ſhines forth ſo apparently, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and even enforces the worſt of men to approve it, <hi>Video meliora, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bóque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Who are thoſe worſt? The King, the Parliament, and all the obedient Sons of the Church, of all Eſtates and Qualities. This is uſually their great proof, that themſelves truly fear God, their diſlike of eſtabliſhed Order; this their evidence, that others have not the fear of God, their Obedience to thoſe whom God hath ſet over them in Church and State. By the one they commend themſelves, by the other they condemn all but themſelves; and that this is no untrue Accuſation they have made appear, in that they made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the beſt and the worſt, but caſt out all of the Epiſcopal way: Nay, as one of them pleading before them the Sobriety and Unblameable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Life and Converſation, they told him to his effect, He ſhould fare the worſe for that, they liked not ſo

            <p n="2">2. They tell us they are tempted to think ill of that they ſuffer by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 'Tis eaſie to gueſs whence that Temptation is, a Criminal is tempted to think ill of the Law, becauſe he ſuffers by it; Ungodly men are tempted to think ill of God, and murmur at him, becauſe they ſuffer by his juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their Wickedneſs: You are taught otherwiſe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.44.</p>
            <p n="20">20. <hi>We repeat what formerly we have ſaid, That the Holy Ghoſt hath already ſo plainly decided the point in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the Inſtance of Meats and Days,</hi> Rom. 14.15. <hi>that it ſeemeth ſtrange to us that yet it ſhould remain a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45592:70"/>
ſo mighty Confidence, that they would make us believe it looks like a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. But 'tis ſcarce worthy the name of a Reaſon. They tell us, The Holy Ghoſt hath decided the Point in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between us — that they think it ſtrange 'tis yet a Controverſie. A ſtrange Preſumption, whereby they at once condemn all the Conformiſts and Non-conformiſts too in this Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince the Reformation. They think it ſtrange, 'tis a Controverſie; and yet know, 'tis the great Controverſie of theſe 100 years: What Volumes have been written <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, The Churche's Power in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different? their own it ſeems wanted the Illumination of the Holy Ghoſt, who could not ſee and ſhew that his plain Deciſion, and ſo were fain to argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Churche's Orders with their ſlender Probabilities: And ours, in theſe charitable mens Judgment, were Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Holy Ghoſt, in aſſerting the Churche's Power to command for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Order, the Holy Ghoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving plainly decided the Point againſt them, that they had no ſuch Power, the moſt reverend <hi>Whitgift, Morton,

Hall, Hooker, Maſon, Sanderſon.</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you did not demonſtrate to this laſt, Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> (who, I ſuppoſe, was a Commiſſioner on the Biſhops part) his wilfull Sin and Errour, in Preaching and Writing ſo earneſtly for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's Ceremonies, from this very 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Romans:</hi> we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as the great Caſuiſt of the Age; a moſt rare Preacher and Textuary; his Temper truly Chriſtian and primitive, charitable, humble, meek, modeſt even to diffidence; his Diſcourſes profound, and yet plain to the meaneſt capacity; nothing more clear, more clean, more cogent and convincing: And we judge thoſe two Sermons of his, one upon the firſt of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2.16. the other upon <hi>Romans,</hi> 14.23. do fully aſſert the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's Conſtitutions by the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts oppoſed, and fairly repreſent, and fully anſwer their Objections; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Hooker</hi> had with as much meekneſs and ſtrength done it before: you have Time and Numbers, if you reſolve to ſtand out, and not conform, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> point by point; your many hands may make the work light: but to make it ſhort and eaſie, I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

a whole <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> of you to anſwer onely Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſolidly and ſoundly, and I ſhall promiſe you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Conformity, and if you cannot (as I know you cannot) you are ſelf-condemned if you renounce not Non-conformity; and now I ſhall be as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confident as your ſelves, and ſhall affirm in a direct contradiction to yours, that the Holy Ghoſt hath ſo plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided the Point in Controverſie on the Churche's part, that ſhe hath Power to command things indifferent for Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Order in God's Worſhip, in the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> c. 14. v. 40. That 'tis ſtrange it ſhould be yet a Controverſie: Nay, the Church had that Power as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Order and Decency to appoint Rites and Ceremonies even when God himſelf had made Laws for Ceremonies, and thoſe ſo many, that we might have thought none could or might be added.</p>
            <p>The Religious Kings and Governors of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church enjoyned divers things concerning God's Worſhip which were not by God commanded.</p>
            <p>There was no Commandment of God aſſigning the Prieſts Order, Manner and Times of Attendance in the Service of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45592:72"/>
the Temple; yet <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> appointed them, and the Prieſts confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and obſerved them. There was no Commandment for Singers, Pſalteries, Organs, Cimbals, Harps; yet David ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Temple this Muſick vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and inſtrumental. There was no Commandment for the Feaſt of <hi>Purim</hi>; yet <hi>Mordecai</hi> enjoined it, <hi>Heſter</hi> ſet it forward, and the <hi>Jews</hi> eſtabliſhed it for ſucceeding Generations. There was no Commandment for the Feaſt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication; yet our Saviour obſerved it. If therefore the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, when God himſelf had inſtituted abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Ceremonies, might and did appoint others, beſides thoſe by God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, which were generally by all without contradiction obſerved; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>à fortiori,</hi> the Chriſtian Church, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Law of particular Ceremonies and Rites given by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (ſince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Religious Rites God cannot be publickly worſhipped in any orderly and decent manner) may, eſpecially having a general Law to authorize her, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> c. 14. conſtitute and appoint ſuch Rites, and we muſt obey her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions in things neither commanded
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45592:72"/>
nor prohibited. But to come cloſely to their 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Reaſon, ſince, <hi>ad Triarios ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt,</hi> 'tis their laſt, and that in which they place their greateſt ſtrength.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt (ſay they) hath plainly decided the Point in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the Inſtance of Meats and Days, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. &amp; 15. A weak brother that maketh an unneceſſary difference of Meats and Days is not to be caſt out, but ſo to be received.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here premiſe the weighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Dr. <hi>Sanderſon, O beware of miſapplying Scripture, it is a thing eaſily done; but not ſo eaſily anſwered. I know not any one gap that hath let in more and more dangerous Errours into the Church than this, that men take the words of the Sacred Text fitted to particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to the condition of the time wherein they were written, and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to themſelves and others, as they find them, without due reſpect had to the differences that may be between thoſe times and caſes, and the preſent. Sundry things ſpoken in the Scripture, agreeable to the infancy of the Church, would ſort very ill with the Church in her fulneſs of ſtrength and ſtature.</hi> This Caution, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45592:73"/>
me to tell the Petitioners, that the Point and Caſe in controverſie between us and them is hugely different from that <hi>Rom.</hi> c. 14. v. 15. in reſpect of the Time, the Perſons, and Matter in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Time; The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was now expiring, its Conſtitution diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, was in planting, in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; in this time, when the Church was not ſettled, and its Order not fully eſtabliſhed, the new Converts, being tender Plants, were to be tenderly uſed, and all ſorts, in pious Prudence, to be indulged; but not ſo in a Church plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſettled, then and there all its Members are obliged to obey its Orders, and not to caſt them off upon pretence of Conſcience or (Chriſtian Liberty; the Troubles at <hi>Francford</hi> they mention, though much to the hindrance of the Reformation, becauſe in the infancy and beginning of it; yet becauſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, that Party which oppoſed the new-made Conſtitutions of our Church were not ſo culpable as theſe Troublers, who, a hundred years after the Orders of the Church had obtained
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45592:73"/>
and happily flouriſhed, have invaded and overturned all Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and now, that 'tis reſtoring, keep up the ſame humour of oppoſing it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The caſe is different in reſpect of the Perſons differing about Meats and Days; The one Party were weak, the other ſtrong in Faith and Judgment of their Chriſtian Liberty: Now of whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endſort are our Non-conformiſts? The ſtrong, in modeſty, they will not call themſelves; and the weak, they will take it ill to be called, being the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Choſen ones of their Party, and giving themſelves the Title of Able and Godly, and who are now conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting with 20 Reaſons (and this laſt in their eſteem irrefragable) againſt the moſt Learned Defenders of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's Orders. But if (as they ſeem to inſinuate) they are the weak Brethren, then their weakneſs deſerves compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet for that very Reaſon (their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) owes ſubmiſſion to the better Judgment of the ſtrong, eſpecially, they being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut Subjects and private perſons, and obedience to the formerly eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and now to be reſtored Order: An yieldance there muſt be on the one
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45592:74"/>
part, and whether the weak ought to ſubmit to the ſtrong, and obey the Laws, or the ſtrong muſt ſubmit to the weak, and give them leave to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Laws under their feet, let the weakeſt judge. But how long will theſe Brethren be weak? Will they be Children of a Hundred years, after ſo long time and teaching, and means of Inſtruction?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Church</hi> (as ſaith the Excellent Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi>) <hi>hath ſufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and publiſhed the Innocency of her purpoſe and meaning in enjoyning the Ceremonies; nor ſo onely; but hath been content to hear, receive and admit the Objections and Reaſons of the Refuſers; and hath taken pains to anſwer and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the full all that ever could be ſaid in that behalf; and therefore it is vanity in theſe men to alledge weakneſs where all good means have been plentifully uſed for full information in the Points in doubt</hi>; ſo that we may, without breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, conclude from ſo plain Premiſſes, that not their weakneſs, but wilfullneſs is the real Cauſe of their Refuſal to conform.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The caſe is different in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45592:74"/>
and Thing it ſelf in controverſie. Thoſe Meats and Days about whoſe obſervation there was variance, <hi>Rom.</hi> c. 14. were once, and a long time, not indifferent, but under Divine Precept, the one commanded, the other prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but our Ceremonies were alwaies indifferent, never under any Divine Precept, nor commanded, nor prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited: The Reaſon why thoſe weak Brethren obſerved the Days and abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the Meats was, They knew there was a Law of God for it, and they knew not that it was aboliſhed: But our weak Brethren have no ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to refuſe the Ceremonies by the Church enjoined, ſince they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by any Law of God forbidden. Thoſe weak Brethren feared to ſin where God had made a Law; our weak Brethren fear to ſin where God hath made no Law, or rather, where he hath made a general and ſtanding Law, that we ſhould obey our Governours in their Ordinances which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Laws. Let me add, the Point is greatly different in this reſpect alſo; That the Apoſtle gives a Liberty onely for a time, to uſe or not to uſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45592:75"/>
thoſe Legal Ceremonies, for afterwards he cuts off that Liberty, and forbids thoſe Legal Obſervations to the <hi>Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and that with great Severity: They were before <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> and allowed a decent Burial: But now, after full Inſtruction that they were nailed to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Croſs and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Grave, they were <hi>Mortifera,</hi> 'twas deadly to raiſe or revive them; and now, upon ſecond thoughts, our Brethren, I hope, will ſee they have cauſe to abate their Confidence; the Point in Controverſie being very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent about the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of our Church.</p>
            <p>Herein we cannot but diſcern and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to be like; In that, Firſt, Thoſe Brethren, who judged the other, were weak, and ſo are theſe, though their Reaſon ſtronger by much, they having the Law for them, theſe no Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe weak Brethren were in the Errour, ſo are ours.</p>
            <p>But, Thirdly, The Errour of thoſe directly contrary to the Errour of theſe. Thoſe Brethren were zealous for the Ceremonies, theſe Brethren are zealous againſt the Ceremonies. I ſhall end this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45592:75"/>
Point in that ſolid and convincing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> to this their 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Reaſon, and I beſeech them to reade and weigh it without prejudice to his perſon and manner of writing; he is ſmart and pleaſant, and doth, I confeſs, <hi>Ludere cum Sanctis,</hi> (I mean onely with ſuch Saints as our Brethren,) but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to themſelves whether he be not here ſerious, and hath not rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the place, and ſtated the caſe, and determined the Point in controverſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Would our Divines perſuade us, that the caſe of Meats and Days, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, is of the ſame nature with that of Ceremonies which we are now debating, or that a weak Brother is not to be diſtinguiſhed from a peeviſh? See how vaſt a difference lies between them, under the Law God himſelf put a difference between Meats and Days, which difference ceaſt upon the coming of our Bleſſed Saviour: Some thought it ſtill a point of Conſcience to obſerve the Law, and theſe the Apoſtle calls, Weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Others again, that knew the Law was abrogated, quitted theſe Scruples; and of theſe it is that St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaies,</hi> We which are ſtrong ought to bear the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45592:76"/>
of the weak: <hi>now mark, That which was formerly impoſed is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a thing indiffrent, that is, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the ſtrong and knowing, not to thoſe who were not convinc'd of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the former Ty and Duty; and this is the true ground of the Apoſtle's Tenderneſs here concerning Scandal,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy not him with thy meat for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>See how their caſe now matches ours; They durſt not eat, becauſe they knew that once they were bound, and they did not know likewiſe that they were now diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Let our Reformers ſhew as much for Ceremonies; Either that humane Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions (for Decency and Order he means) were ever forbidden, or that thoſe practis'd in our Church are in themſelves unlawfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They next would father an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Aſſertors of the Churche's Orders and Impoſitions—If you ſay— Rulers, Impoſition maketh Indifferent things ceaſe to be indifferent—We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer—But till they ſay as you would make them, you may ſave your Anſwer, they are not obliged to a Reply; you may ſee the Churche's ſenſe to be quite
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:45592:76"/>
another thing than this you would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon them, in Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s Sermon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p>To what you add from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Ruler of the Church him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and yet would deny his own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty rather than offend the weak: So far was he from taking away the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others. The Anſwer is made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, the Caſe being foreign, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our Controverſie; The ſame now mentioned about <hi>eating Meats of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Idols</hi> wherewith the weak were offended. What is this to the Point in controverſie? We muſt deny our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty rather than offend the weak, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> the Church may not preſcribe Rules about Indifferent things; and that invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and reflecting Paſſage added— So far was he from taking away the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of others—is as little to your purpoſe; you have been taught, and might learn, that the Church, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Indifferent things, takes away no man's Liberty: The things preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed are in their own nature, and in the Judgment both of the Impoſer and the intelligent Obſerver of them the ſame they were before, Indifferent. I obey
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45592:77"/>
the Church, yet preſerve my Liberty, ſtill judging the thing Indifferent which it commands; and I obey not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as any neceſſary part of Religion, but as the Church commands it, which I am bound to obey for Decency and Order. <hi>They that make Laws concerning Indifferent things have no intention at all to meddle with the nature of them, they leave that</hi> in medio <hi>as they found it; but onely for ſome reaſons of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, order the uſe of them, the Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of their nature ſtill being where it was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are very unhappy in alledging that Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes directly for the Church, againſt them, we may tell them in their own words, the Holy Ghoſt hath there ſo plainly decided the Point in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that it ſeems ſtrange to us, that yet it ſhould remain a controverſie; they have here thrown down all they have built; all their 20 Reaſons fall and are broken in pieces, as <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark.</p>
            <p>This Chapter acquaints us, that ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> though converted to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith and embracing the Goſpel,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45592:77"/>
yet thought themſelves bound to the Obſervation of the whole <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, and they thought the converted Gentiles ſo bound alſo, and told them that, except they were circumcized, and kept the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could not be ſaved. Hereupon ariſes Diſſention and Diſputation, and an Appeal is made to a Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which upon the hearing and debating the Queſtion determines, That the converted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould not be obliged to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion nor to the Ceremonial Law, but in yieldance to the converted <hi>Jews,</hi> who were zealous of the Law, and to keep Peace with them, they ſhould abſtain from ſome few things in their nature indifferent, but neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Peace and Charity, <hi>from Meats offered to Idols, from Bloud, and from things ſtrangled.</hi> Behold here the Firſt and Greateſt Council that ever was in the Chriſtian Church, to compoſe a Difference, meets, and makes a Law of Abſtinence from ſome things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and otherwiſe in themſelves law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. This is plainly the Caſe, the Act of the Council and Deciſion of the Queſtion, and yet theſe men alledge
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45592:78"/>
the Act of the Council to prove the quite contrary. I am amazed to ſee how they change and clip the words, and pervert the ſenſe of the Scripture they cite for their ends, and, I fear, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Conſcience. They ſay, the Apoſtles and Elders, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.28. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto the Churches, that it ſeemed good unto the Holy Ghoſt and them to lay upon them no greater Burthen than neceſſary things; Do the Apoſtles and Elders ſo declare? then we yield the Cauſe. Do they not? then ought they with Sin and Shame to yield it. They leave out the word <hi>(Theſe)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know it made againſt them; limiting the Churche's Order to ſome few particular things, there preſently named, <hi>Things offered to Idols, Bloud,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now whereas the Church makes a temporary Order for ſome particular things, and declares thus, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us to lay upon you no greater Burthen</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary beſides theſe things or <hi>(theſe) neceſſary things:</hi> They leave out that word <hi>(theſe)</hi> of main importance, and hugely againſt them, and would make a ſtanding Canon of their own,

and father it upon the Apoſtles: That the Church ought to impoſe no other then neceſſary things, and yet too by their own confeſſion, theſe things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed were not ſimply in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unchangeably neceſſary, but by accident, <hi>pro tempore &amp; loco</hi>; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſay, the Council impoſed them, becauſe antecedently neceſſary, The contrary is moſt true: Theſe things were not antecedently neceſſary, but onely, as themſelves ſay, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> for the time. There being at this time a difference riſen about the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, it was not neceſſary before the Council now ſo determined, That the converted Gentiles ſhould <hi>abſtain from things offered to Idols, ſtrangled, and Bloud</hi>; that Law belonging onely to the <hi>Jews,</hi> never to the Gentiles. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how rarely well theſe men argue, To prove Church-Governours may not determine in things indifferent for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Unity, but all ought to be left to their own Liberty: They produce a Scripture which proves moſt plainly, That Church-Governours have, and may determine and reſtrain thoſe under them from the uſe of things indifferent; All
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45592:79"/>
the things touching which the Council they produce do give order being indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, except one, Fornication, which is of another nature, but with theſe prohibited, for that the Gentiles allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in it, and ſcarce looked on it as a Sin: This of their 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and laſt Reaſon which I have thus at large conſidered, for that they lay ſo much weight upon it, though it prove, as the reſt, light in the Balance; I ſhall, for a Concluſion of all, clearly evidence the Churche's Power to preſcribe external Rites and Ceremonies for Order and Decency, and our Obligation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto them from the Judgment of two ancient Fathers, for whom I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Brethren have ſome Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and if thoſe cannot move them, from the Judgment of a modern Father, for whom I am ſure they have a high Veneration; 'Tis St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Rule, <hi>Prudenti Chriſtiano eo modo agendum eſſe quo agit Eccleſia ad quam devenerit,</hi> and his Mother having uſed, when ſhe was in <hi>Africk,</hi> to faſt on the Saturday, and coming to <hi>Millan,</hi> where that Faſt was not obſerved, was doubtfull what to doe; hereupon her Son conſulted Saint
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45592:79"/>
               <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who thus anſwered, When I am here at <hi>Millan,</hi> I do not faſt on the Saturday; when I am at <hi>Rome,</hi> I do faſt on the Saturday; and unto what Church ſoever ye come, keep the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of it, if you be willing neither to give nor take Scandal: From which Rule of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and Advice of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> a Learned perſon maketh theſe Remarks: 1. That divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, profeſſing the ſame Religion, may have divers Ceremonies. 2. That in Churches Independent one is not bound of neceſſity to follow another. 3. That 'tis the Duty of every private perſon to conform himſelf to the laudable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Conſtitutions of the Church wherein he liveth or wherever he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. You have heard the Judgment of theſe ancient Fathers. Will you hear your modern Father Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and he delivers his Judgment ſo fully, and with ſo much ſtrength and clearneſs aſſerts the Churche's Power to ordain exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rites and Ceremonies, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Hooker</hi> himſelf could not ſay more or better.</p>
            <p>Whereas many unskilfull men, when they hear that Conſciences are wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45592:80"/>
bound, and God Worſhipped in vain, by the Traditions of men, do at once blot out altogether all Laws whereby the Order of the Church is ſet in frame. Therefore it is convenient alſo to meet with their Errour. Verily in this point it is eaſie to be deceived, becauſe at firſt ſight it doth not by and by appear what difference there is between the one ſort and the other: But I will ſo plainly in few words ſet out the whole matter that the Likeneſs may deceive no man. Firſt let us hold this, That if we ſee in every Society of men ſome Policy to be neceſſary which may ſerve to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh common Peace, and to retain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, if we ſee that in the doing of things there is alwaies ſome orderly Form which is behoofefull for publick Honeſty, and for very Humanity not to be refuſed, the ſame ought chiefly to be obſerved in Churches, which are both beſt maintained by a well framed diſpoſition of all things, and without Agreement are no Churches at all. Therefore, if we will have the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church well provided for, we muſt altogether diligently procure that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth, <hi>That
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45592:80"/>
all things be done comely and according to order.</hi> But foraſmuch as there is ſo great diverſity in the Manners of men, ſo great variety in Minds, ſo great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements in Judgments and Witts; neither is there any Policy ſtedfaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, unleſs it be ſtabliſhed by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Laws; nor any orderly Uſage can be obſerved, without a certain appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Form: therefore we are ſo far off from condemning the Laws that are profitable to this purpoſe, that we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that when theſe be taken away, Churches are diſſolved from their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ewes, and utterly deformed and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abroad; for this which St. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, <hi>That all things be done decently and in order,</hi> cannot be had, unleſs the Order it ſelf and Comelineſs be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, with Obſervations adjoyned as with certain Bonds. But this onely thing is alway to be excepted in thoſe Obſervations, That they be not either believed to be neceſſary to Salvation, and ſo bind Conſciences with Religion, or be applied to the worſhipping of God, and ſo Godlineſs be repoſed in them. We have therefore a very good and moſt faithfull mark, which putteth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45592:81"/>
difference between thoſe wicked Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances by which we have ſaid, That the True Religion is darkned, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſubverted, and the lawfull Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the Church, if we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the lawfull Obſervations tend alway to one of theſe two things or to both together, that in the Holy Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Faithfull all things be done comely, and with ſuch dignity as beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and that the very common Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of men ſhould be kept in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as it were by certain Bonds of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and Moderation; for when it is once underſtood that the Law is made for publick Honeſty's ſake, the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition is now taken away, into which they fall that meaſure the Worſhiping of God by the Inventions of men. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when it is known, that it pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to Common uſes, then that falſe opinion of Bond and Neceſſity is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, which did ſtrike a great Terror into Conſciences when Traditions were thought neceſſary to Salvation; for herein is nothing required, but that Charity ſhould with common dutifull doing be nouriſhed amongſt us. But it is good yet to define more plainly what
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45592:81"/>
is comprehended under that Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth, and alſo what under Order. The end of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is partly, that when ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are uſed as may procure a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to Holy things, we may by ſuch Helps be ſtirred up to Godlineſs; partly alſo, that the Modeſty and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity which ought to be ſeen in all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Doings may therein principally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. In Order this is the firſt Point, That they which govern may know the Rule and Law to govern well, and the People which are governed may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to obeying of God, and to right Diſcipline: Then that the ſtate of the Church being well framed, Peace and Quietneſs may be provided for. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily becauſe the Lord hath in his Holy Oracles both faithfully contained and clearly ſet forth both the whole Sum of true Righteouſneſs, and all the parts of the Worſhipping of his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and whatſoever was neceſſary to Salvation; therefore in theſe things he is onely to be heard as our Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. But becauſe in outward Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Ceremonies his Will was not to preſcribe each thing particularly,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45592:82"/>
what we ought to follow, becauſe he foreſaw this to hang upon the ſtate of Times, and did not think one Form to be fit for all Ages, herein we muſt flee to thoſe general Rules which he hath given, that thereby all thoſe things ſhould be tried which the neceſſity of the Church ſhall require to be commanded for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Comelineſs; finally, foraſmuch as he hath therefore taught nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, becauſe theſe things are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, and according to the manners of every Nation and Age ought diverſly to be applied to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Church: Therefore as the Profit of the Church ſhall require, it ſhall be convenient as well to change and abrogate thoſe that be uſed, as to inſtitute new. I grant indeed, that we ought not raſhly, nor oft, nor for light cauſes to run to Innovation, but what may hurt or edifie, Charity ſhall beſt judge, which if we ſuffer to be the Governeſs, all ſhall be ſafe.</p>
            <p>Now it is the Duty of Chriſtian Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to keep ſuch things as have been ordained according to this Rule with a free Conſcience, and without any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, but yet with a godly and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45592:82"/>
eaſie readineſs to obey, not to deſpiſe them, nor to paſs them over with careleſs Negligence; ſo far is it off, that they ought by Pride and Obſtinacy openly to break them. What manner of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience, wilt thou ſay, may there be in ſo great obſervation and wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Yes, it ſhall ſtand excellently well; when we ſhall conſider that they are not ſtedfaſt and perpetual ſtayed Laws whereunto we are bound, but outward Rudiments for the weakneſs of Men, which though we do not all need, yet we do all uſe them; becauſe we are mutually bound to one another to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Charity among us. Thus Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> delivers his Judgment directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to yours, perfectly conſentient to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and we find his Practice according with his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he put the Yoke of Diſcipline upon the Neck of the Senate and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and bound them to it with an Oath; and he declares for a Form of Prayers and Eccleſiaſtical Rites, and greatly approves that it be fixed, from which it may not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Paſtors to depart in their Function: you may now go and accuſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45592:83"/>
Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> (with our Church) as jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and acting contrary to <hi>Romans</hi> 14. and to the Decree of the Apoſtolical Council, laying both upon Paſtors and People a great Burthen of things not neceſſary; and if you pleaſe to take a view of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Diſcipline,<note place="margin">Firſt and Second Book of Diſcipline.</note> you will find there alſo a huge and heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, abundance of things which you dare not ſay are neceſſary.</p>
            <p>And to come home.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the long Parliament upon the whole Kingdom, and taken I doubt not by your ſelves, is a moſt heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of things, ſo far from neceſſary, that they are not lawfull, nay highly ſinfull; and if you have ſtill the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to ſay the matter of it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yet you cannot affirm it of the Ceremonies enjoyned with ſtrictneſs at the taking of it, which are more than all the Ceremonies by the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the People in the whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy: They are no leſs than Five. Thoſe who took the Covenant were ordered, 1. to ſtand; 2. uncovered; 3. with the hand lifted up; 4. the right hand; 5. and that bared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:45592:83"/>And may I here preſume to ask you, Suppoſe a weak Brother, whoſe tender Conſcience could not ſwallow theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Rites, ſhould affirm 'twas ſinfull in the Parliament to lay upon them the Burthen of theſe not neceſſary things, and that he could not take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, unleſs you would allow him his Chriſtian Liberty to doe it without theſe ſuperstitious Ceremonies; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would you and the Parliament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge him for his Tenderneſs, or reject and ſequeſter him (if well fleeced) for his Non-conformity? But whatever becomes of this Caſe, you have in a ſolemn part of God's Worſhip (for ſo you judge the <hi>Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>) ſtrictly enjoyned ſeveral unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Rites and Ceremonies, and ſo you muſt neceſſarily condemn your ſelves, and renounce at leaſt the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of your Covenant, or ceaſe for ever to declaim againſt the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England.</p>
