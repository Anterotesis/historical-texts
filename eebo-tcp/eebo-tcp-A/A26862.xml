         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Never well understood their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who crave Patronage to their
Writings from the meere great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the times. If they need or
desire a borrowed honour, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
they quite mistake their way, and go
for water to the top of <hi>Teneriffe,</hi> which they
should seek in the valleys or stillflowing
Springs. To give them our Writings to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them, is agreeable to our Office and
duty: but to submit them to their censures,
or crave the protection of their Greatnesses,
and prefix their names as the Signatures of
Worth, as if Truth did ever the more dwell
within, where this gilded sign is hang'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
this seemeth to me, to be as needlesse,
as absur'd. The self-idolizing sin of Pride is
so naturall to all men, especially when fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by dignities and wordly pomp, that
they are apt enough without a tempter, to
take themselves for the <hi>summum genus</hi> in every
<pb facs="tcp:106762:3"/>
Predicament as well as their owne. A little
help wil mount them above their Teachers,
and a little more above Ordinances; but the
top of the ambition is to be above God; that
on them as the <hi>Alpha</hi> all may depend, and to
them as the <hi>Omega</hi> all may ascribe. I think it a
more needfull work (not for our honour, but
their own safety) to make them understand,
that Princes and Parliaments are Schollers in
that Schoole where Christ is the Master, and
we his Ushers: and that (at least) in respect of
our Nuncupative, Declarative power, we are
their Rulers in spirituals, whom they are
bound to obey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. 17. and that all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are Bishops or Overseers in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the holy Ghost, <hi>Act. 20. 28. Phil.</hi> 1.
1. &amp;c. and not the servants or pleasers of men,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 11. 10.</p>
                  <p>They leave us the bare name of their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
so that we will teach them nothing but
what they have taught us first, and leave out
the hard sayings, which they cannot beare.
For my part, though I have found as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
from such as most, yet have I known very
few of the most Religious great ones, but if I
would deal but half as plainly as my commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and patterns doe require, I should quickly
turne their respect into indignation. If the
old round dealing Prophets and Apostles were
among us, I doubt some pious Gentlemen
<pb facs="tcp:106762:3"/>
would take them for sawcy, proud, pragmatical
fellowes; and would think their tongues
(though not their revenues) did need a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
All this is no blemish to Magistracie,
the Ordinance of God, but to humane nature,
that for the most part can as ill beare a high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
as a mans brains can endure to stand on
the pinacle of a steeple. Nor is this to blame
any due honor to such, but to excuse my
selfe, that I employ not my breath to fill any
empty bladder. For you who are low, and
full, I suppose the acknowledgement of your
worth is lesse dangerous. As I am more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to Reason and Religion, then to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
so doe I feel them command my esteem
and affections most powerfully. Your names
therefore have I chosen to prefix to this paper.
1. As acknowledging you indeed fit censors
of my Doctrine; having alwayes valued the
judgement of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in Philosophy before
<hi>Alexanders;</hi> and thinking your approbation
more considerable then all the Lords or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in the Land. If you approve, I shall
be the more confirmed (and so will my people
for whom I write it, who know and honour
you.) If you disallow, (for I cannot conceit
that there is nothing to be disallowed) I shall
suspect, and search againe.</p>
                  <p>2. I desire also hereby to acquaint the world
with the reverend esteem I have of you, and
<pb facs="tcp:106762:4"/>
to shew the contemners of the ministry some
examples for their confutation: That they
who think that <hi>England</hi> hath not as learned,
holy, experimentall, judicious, humble, heart-piercing
Preachers, as any other Nation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
may look upon you and confesse their
errour: That for all the dissentions that have
so wasted both Church and State, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in you, wee had some that were lovers
of peace; and if all had been so minded, our
wounds had bin heal'd. That our ignorant
yonglings that rush upon the Ministry (who
may see themselves in that glasse, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6.
may consider their distance from such as you,
and be humbled. That those who wonder at
the spreading of errors in our people, may see
in you, we had some that taught them better;
And <hi>Alexander</hi> did unjustly hang <hi>Ephestions</hi>
Physitian because hee dyed. And that our
Authors or defenders of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> worship,
whose fingers itch to be doing with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
that gain say them, may see what manner
of men they have to deale with, whose worth
is sufficient to disgrace the proudest persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and make their names hatefull to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations:

any action how good soever otherwise
it be, or honorably carryed. To such ends as
these have I here prefixed your names; and
not to interesse you in the dishonour of the
imperfections of this slender Tractate.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He slow progresse of knowledge, and the small
addition that each age doth make to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going,
both in common Sciences and Divinity,
doth seem a wonder to many. Among many
others, these foure are no small impediments to
this desirable increase.</p>
                  <p>1. Every ignorant, empty braine (which usually hath the
highest esteem of it selfe) hath the liberty of the Presse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
(through the common itch that pride exciteth in men, to
seeme somebody in the world) the number of bookes is grown
so great, that they begin with many to grow contemptible; and
a man may bestow a great many yeares to find out the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
weaknesse, and that his books have nothing in them but
common; and so many must be tossed over before we find out
those few that are cleare and solid, that much of our lives are
spent in the discovery: And yet he is thought to scape well that
onely loseth his time and labour and gets no more hurt by
them. Some think the truth will not thrive among us, till e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man have leave to speak both in Presse and Pulpit that
please: God forbid that we should ever see that day! If ten
mens voyces be louder then one, then would the noyse of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
drown the voyce of Truth: Ignorance is usually clamorous
and loud, but Truth is modest, though zealous: One Orthodox
faithfull Teacher, would scarce be seen or finde room for the
crowd of seducers: For the godly, compared with the ungodly,
are not neer so few as the men of cleer understanding, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the ignorant: And they are most forward to speake,
that know least.</p>
                  <p>2. Others there are of much like understanding and ends as
the former, who yet take the contrary meanes to obtaine those
ends. They know no such way to be the onely men, as magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially
to silence all contradictors: If it were onely for apparent
and weighty truths, I should commend their zeale: But the
mischiefe is, that they will bee Creed-makers themselves, or
put their Commentaries into the Text, or so conjoyne them, as
the Rhemists, that the Text may not walk in the day-light
<pb facs="tcp:106762:5"/>
alone: And so the Creed of many, who have a quicke and easie
faith is swelled as big almost as <hi>Aquinas</hi> Summes. If one of
the Primitive Martyrs were alive among us, and professed but
what was in his ancient Creed, hee would scarce be taken by
many for a Christian. I am not all so narrow in my Creed, as
Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> urgeth: but I have observed more of this sort
of men contemne his arguments, then are able to answer them.
These men themselves beleeve so much (<hi>fide humana</hi>) that
they know but little; and yet they would have no body know
more then they, or no body speake that saith not as they. They
would have nothing said but what is said already; and then it is
better (in print) say nothing. They think it a reproach to
change our opinions, or hold them with reserves: <hi>Pudet haec
opprobria nobis, &amp;c.</hi> But O that these men could tell us how
to remedy it! To cry down that ignorance which dwelleth in me,
is more to the credit of Knowledge then of me. But these men
are like many superficiall Schollars, who when they have spent
many yeares in the Vniversities, have no way to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
proficients, but to extoll Learning, and cry down the
unlearned, that so they may cast the suspition from themselves
upon others: Even so doe these in crying down errours. I know
this small Tract will not rellish well with these mens pallats,
neither is it ambitious of their favour, or yet so quarrelsome as
purposely to provoke them; though some words may not be cut
meet to their conceits. As I abhorre the project of <hi>Iulian</hi> to
destroy the Christian Faith, by giving all Sects a liberty of
contending; so am I loath that any such monster should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by nature who should be a professed enemy to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement
of Reason; or should presume to bound that sea of
Knowledge which God hath promised shall cover the earth; and
to say, hitherto shalt thou go, and no further: For my part, I
must say as <hi>Burgersdicius in praefat. ad secundam edit.

onely names and words, in stead of things. Both in Sciences
and Divinity this hath debased mens understandings. Men get all
the termes of Art, and Theologicall definitions, Distinctions,
Axiomes, &amp;c. at their fingers end; but to study the nature of
the things themselves, they are utterly carelesse. Their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And (which is the killing effect of this venome) these Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
usually teach their people a Christianity suitable to their
owne Theologie, which consisteth in repeating certaine words,
and formes, and using certain ceremonious actions, and then they
are as good Christians as they themselves are Divines.</p>
                  <p>4. And yet were there no miscarriage in our studies, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
could not make that happy progresse which some expect: For
it is not in studies as it is in Manufactures, that one man may
begin where another left; but every man must fetch it from the
very principles himselfe: Neither can we take the words of those
that have studied it before us; for that is neither a sound, nor satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
knowledge: whence it comes to passe, (saith <hi>Pemble
Vind. Grat. p.</hi> 168.) that while wee are busie in examining our
forefathers inventions, and posterity imployed in trying our
examinations, neither we nor they have much time to adde any
thing for the increase of Learned Knowledge: Whence you may
guesse at one cause, why many Sciences, for some thousands of
yeares have kept one pitch, and not growne above that dwarfish
stature that they had in their infant invention: and also what the
reason is that many that read most, prove not the deepest Schollers;
for no greater impediment to exact Learning then to make use
of other mens understandings, and neglect our owne.</p>
                  <p>I speak not this, as if I had overcome these impediments any
more then others; but because I have perhaps more beene hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by them, and so take my selfe bound to warne thee of the pit
that I have falne in: And with all to let thee know, that if godly
men themselves while they lye in these snares, shall oppose any
truth in this Tract, it is no wonder, but a thing to be expected.</p>
                  <p>To give thee the History of the conception and nativity of these
<hi>Aphorismes,</hi> &amp; the reason why I trouble the world with more
Bookes, which I blame in others; understand, that this is but an
Appendix to another Treatise going to the Presse on a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Subject: Also, that having occasion therein to touch upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 35. I was desired to explaine in what sence it is,
that Christ giveth the reason of his sentence in judgement from
mens works: In answer hereto (and to cleare some other incident
doubts of the like nature) I wrote these Positions or Aphorismes?
<pb facs="tcp:106762:7"/>
which when some had got, they complained of obscure bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and desired some fuller explication; which when I
had done, that which before was but two or three leaves,
annexed as an Appendix to the fore-mentioned Treatise, did
swell to this bignesse, that I was faine to let it goe alone.
Could I have got Copies enow for my owne friends, whom I
am bound to instruct, other men had not beene like to have
been troubled with it; If thou please, thou mayest let it passe
without thine observation: If otherwise, it is so small, that
it will take up but little of thy time to read it, nor adde
much to the common burden. Some few passages here are
which I am not so cleare and confident in my selfe; As the
nature of the Death threatned in the first Covenant; The
necessity of the punctuall performance or execution of all
threatnings; The interest of Christs Active Obedience to
those Laws which did binde men in innocency, in the work
of satisfaction, as conjoyned with his Passive Obedience to
make up the same price. But as these are but few, so I am
not utterly at a losse concerning them, but seeme to discerne
a strong probability of what I have written therein,</p>
                  <p>For you, my Friends, whom Christ hath committed to my
Teaching and Oversight, as to an unworthy Vsher under him
in his Schoole, and Steward in his House, and of his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries;
I publish this for your sakes and use:</p>
                  <p>1. Because I have still thought that points controverted
are better written than preached, and read than heard; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
where the greatest part of the Auditory is uncapable
of understanding them.</p>
                  <p>2. Yet is this Doctrine of so great concernment, and so
neer the Foundation, that of all the controversies agitated
in the Church, there's few that doe better deserve your study,
and few that I am so loath you should be ignorant of. It is
my exceeding joy, that God hath kept you in his distracted
age, from doting about questions that engender strife, and
hath given you to cleave to the most fundamentall, undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and practicall Truths, and to spend your time in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and peace, and promoting the salvation of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb facs="tcp:106762:7"/>
about you, when others are taken up in censuring their
brethren, renting the Church, opposing the truth, or wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about lesser things; which are quite above their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.
Hold on this way; and if you have not in it more
Communion with Christ, more growth in Grace, and on
your Death-beds a more comfortable review of your lives,
and at last a better reckoning made thereof, then the other,
then say, I have deceived you. Yet, as I would have you
neglect no truth, so especially what time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and some great, which I knew you had not time to read;
and if you did, perhaps would lose much of your labour, as
I have done: Therefore I desired to set the most necessary
part before you in a narrower compasse. I never intended the
full handling of the Doctrine of justification, these Aphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes
being but for the Answering of a particular Question:
Especially what is in Master <hi>Bradshaw</hi> I omit, because I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that you will read and study him, the Book being so
small, and of such singular worth, containing as much as
the greatest Volumes. In some places I have omitted the
proofe of my Assertions, partly because they seemed plaine,
or to be the evident consectaries of former Positions; partly
for brev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

I am (yet) at hand to cleare what you doubt of; and who,
I hope, doe understand, that to take upon trust from your
Teachers what you cannot yet reach to see in its owne evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is lesse absurd, and more necessary than many doe
imagine. Moreover, knowing, that I must shortly put off
this Tabernacle, and be taken from you, I thought good to

                     <p>THis distinction of the Will of God into
his Will of Purpose and his Will of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
is very commonly used by Divines,
and explained by some, especially Doctor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106762:9"/>
                        <hi>Twisse</hi> frequently, and Doctor <hi>Edward Reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>
in his Sermons on the Humiliation
dayes, on <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. Yet is not the exceeding
necessity and usefulnesse of it discerned by
many, nor is it improved accordingly by any
that I have read: It is near of kin to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
distinction of <hi>Voluntas signi, &amp; Benepla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citi,</hi>
but not the same: The Tearm [<hi>signi</hi>]
being more comprehensive, yet (in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
lesse proper and convenient then this
[Legislative Will, or <hi>voluntas Praecepti:</hi>] As
the old verse shews, <hi>Praecipit ac prohibit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit,
consulit, implet.</hi> Two of these Acts, to
wit, Permission and Operation, fall under
the Will of Purpose, as they are the effects and
revelation of it; but not under the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Will: And indeed the Schoolmen by their
<hi>Voluntas signi,</hi> do intend not other Will, but
the same which they call <hi>Beneplaciti,</hi> whose
Object is event, as it is uncertainly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to us by those five signes: And because
they are such uncertain signes (the contrary
to what they seem to import; being frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
certain;) therefore they tell us that this
is but metaphorically called the Will of God;
<hi>viz.</hi> by a speech borrowed from the manner of
men, who signifie their Will by such kinde of
Actions; see <hi>Aquin. sum. 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>e. Quest. 19. Art.</hi>
11. 12. And <hi>Schibler. Metaph.</hi> of this.</p>
                     <p>But that which I call the Legislative or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106762:9"/>
Preceptive will, hath another object, <hi>viz.</hi> not
event but duty; and is Metonymically rather
then Metaphorically called Gods Will, it
being the effect and revelation of his reall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
will. For God doth not seeme to Will
that this or that shall be our duty, and so
speake after the manner of men (according to
the sense of their <hi>Voluntas signi</hi>) but hee willeth
it unfeignedly,</p>
                     <p>Neither is this Distinction the same with
that which differenceth Gods revealed Will
from his secret. For his revealed Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
also part of the Will of his purpose,
and all the will of precept: The meere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,
and also the promises and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
so far as they point out future event,
are the Revealed part of the Will of Gods
purpose. <hi>Tilenus</hi> himselfe in his conference
with <hi>Camero</hi> seemes to approve of this Dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inction;
where he distinguisheth of Gods Will
according to its Object, <hi>viz. vel quod ipse vult
facere, vel quod a nobis vult fieri:</hi> If in this last
branch he speake not <hi>de officio</hi> &amp; of this precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
will, rather then <hi>de eventu</hi> and of the will of
purpose, then he can meane it onely of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall
will of purpose.</p>
                     <p>As we use to distinguish betwixt the legall
will of the King publickly manifesting our
duty in the Laws, and his personall private
will; so must we do here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106762:10"/>
The necessity of this distinction is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great, that but little of the doctrinall
part of Scripture can be well understood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. The verity of it is also unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
for none but the grosely ignorant will
deny, that Event and Duty, Purpose and
Law, are truly distinct, or that both these last
are called in Scripture and common custome
of speech, The Will of God.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is a sencelesse Objection,
that wee hereby make two wills in God, and
those contradictory. For first, we only make
them two distinct Acts of one &amp; the same will:
whereof that of purpose is lesse revealed, and
doth lesse concern us, yet is most properly
called his will, as being such as in man we call
the Elicite Act of it: but that of precept is all
revealed and doth more concerne us; yet as
it is in his Law it is onely Metonymically called
his Will, as being only the discovery of his
Will properly so called.</p>
                     <p>And 2ly Contradiction there is none; for
they are not <hi>de eodem;</hi> they have to do with
severall Objects; To Will that it shall be
<hi>Abrahams</hi> duty <hi>pro hoc tempore</hi> to sacrifice his
son; and yet that <hi>de eventu</hi> it shall not be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
are far from contradictory. To Will
that it shall be the <hi>Iewes</hi> duty, not to kill
Christ, and yet that eventually they shall
kill him, is no contradiction. To will that it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106762:10"/>
shall be <hi>Pharaohs</hi> duty to let <hi>Israel</hi> go; and yet
that in poynt of event hee shall not let them
go, is no contradiction. Indeed, if God had
willed, that he shall let them go, and he shall
not eventually, or that it shall be his duty,
and it shall not; either of these had been a
contradiction undoubted.</p>
                     <p>But I have largely explained and more fully
improved this Distinction under the Dispute
about Universall Redemption, and therefore
shall say no more of it now.</p>

                  <p>First, Praedestination, Election, Reprobation, or

                  <div type="explanation">
                     <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
                     <p>IT is of very great use to understand which
of these Wills every one of Gods particular
words or works do fall under.</p>
                     <p>1. That Predestination, Election, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
are under this Will of Purpose
only, is undoubted.</p>
                     <p>2, Divines use to mention a Covenanting
between the Father and the Son about the
work of Redemption: It is called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106762:11"/>
but improperly, speaking after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men. Properly it is but the Decree of
God concerning Christs Incarnation, his
work, and his sufferings, and the successe of
these, and what God will further do thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This therefore falls under this Genius,
and so doth the Fathers giving the Elect to
Christ, which is but part of this.</p>
                     <p>3. Those promises of taking the hard heart
out of us, and giving hearts of flesh, one heart,
a new heart, and of putting his fear in us,
that wee shall not depart from him, &amp;c. are
generally taken to be Absolute promises (for
here is no Condition expressed or intimated)
made to all the Elect and onely them, as not
yet regenerate; and so not to any either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or qualified persons. These are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fulfilled upon condition of our Faith, or
made ours by beleeving, as other promises
are: For Faith is part of the thing promised,
and the persons are unregenerate, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
unbeleevers when these promises are
fulfilled to them. Therefore these Absolute
promises are but meere gratious predictions
what God will do for his Elect, the comfort
whereof can be received by no man till the
benefit be received, and they be to him ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled:
Therefore as all meer predictions, so
also these promises do fall under the Will of
Purpose, and not of Precept.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106762:11"/>
4. So also doth the fulfilling of these to
particular persons: the actuall chusing or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of some while others are past by: The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
of that faith which is the condition
of the Covenant: The giving of perseverance:
And all the passages of speciall, effectuall,
differencing Grace. The knowledge of this
is of great use in expediting the Arminian
Controversies, as you shall perceive after:
Some parts of Scripture do in severall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
belong to both these Wills; such are
some promises and threatnings conditionall,
which as they are predictions of what shall
come to passe, do belong to the will Purpose,
but as they are purposely delivered and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the commands and prohibitions for
incitement to Duty, and restraint from Sin,
(which was indeed the great end of God in
them) so they belong to the Will of Precept:
For the promise of Reward, and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Punishment, are reall parts of the Law
or Covenant, so of History. All this is only
a preparative to the opening more fully the
nature of the Legislative Will, and what falls
under it: For the Will of Purpose, and what
is under it, I have no intention any further to
handle.</p>

directive) but not usually any reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to the obeyers: It is sufficient that
the Subject know his Soveraignes pleasure,
which he is bound to observe without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Meere Laws are enacted by Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Meere Covenants are entred by equalls,
or persons dis-engaged to each other in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the contents of the Covenants, and
therefore they require mutuall consent. These
therefore made by God, are of a mixt nature;
neither meere Laws, nor meere Covenants,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106762:12"/>
but both. He hath enacted his Laws as our
Soveraigne Lord, whithout waiting for the
Creatures consent, and will punish the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
whether they consent or no: But as it is
a Covenant, there must be a restipulation
from the Creature; and God will not performe
his conditions there expressed, without the
Covenanters consent, engagement, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of theirs.</p>
                     <p>Yet is it called frequently in Scripture (a
Covenant,) as it is offered by God, before it
be accepted and entered into by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
because the condescention is only on
Gods part; and in reason there should be no
question of the Creatures consent, it being so
wholly and only to his advantage. <hi>Gen. 9. 12
17. Exod. 34. 28. Deut. 29. 1. 2 Kings</hi> 23. 3
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>There are some generall obscure Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
annexed to the prohibitions in the Law
of Nature; that is, Nature may discerne that
God will punish the breakers of his Law,
but how, or with what degree of punishment
it cannot discern: Also it may collect that
God will be favourable and gratious to the
Obedient: but it neither knows truly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
nor the nature or greatnesse of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
nor Gods engagement thereto. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as it is in Nature, it is a meer Law; and not
properly a Covenant. Yea to <hi>Adam</hi> in his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106762:13"/>
perfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the forme of the Covenant was
known by superadded Revelation, and not
written naturally in his heart.</p>
                     <p>Whether the threatning and punishment
do belong to it only as it is a Law, or also as it
is a Covenant, is of no great moment; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is really mixt of both. It is called in
Scripture also, the curse of the Covenant:

                     <p>THe promise of life is not expressed, but
plainly implyed in the threatning of
death. That this life promised was onely
the continuance of that state that <hi>Adam</hi> was
then in in Paradice, is the judgement of most
Divines: But what death it was that is there
threatned, is a Question of very great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and some moment. The same damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that followeth the breach of the New
Covenant, it could not be: no more then the
life then enjoyed is the same with that which
the New Covenant promiseth. And I cannot
yet assent to their judgement, who think it
was onely that death which consisteth in a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106762:13"/>
meer separation of soule and body: or also
in the annihilation of both. <hi>Adams</hi> separated
soule must have enjoyed happinesse, or endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
misery: For that our soules when sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
are in one of these conditions, and not
annihilated or insensible, I have proved by
twenty Arguments from Scripture in another
booke. As <hi>Adams</hi> life in Paradise was, no
doubt incomparably beyond ours in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
so the death threatned in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was a more terrible death then our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
death. For though his losse by a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
death would have bin greater then ours
now; yet hee would not have bin a Subject
capable of privation, if annihilated; nor
however capable of the sense of his losse. A
great losse troubleth a dead man no more
then the smallest. Therefore as the joy of
Paradise would have bin a perpetuall joy, so
the sorrow and pain it is like would have bin
perpetuall, and wee perpetuated capable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
See <hi>Barlow exercit. utrum melius sit mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serum

the deliverance that Christs Death procured,
was onely from a temporall death or annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larion:

(2) The Will of the Father and the Son
are one: The Son was a voluntary undertaker
of this task: it was not imposed upon him by
constraint: when he is said to come to do his
Fathers Will (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. 9.) it doth also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
his own Will. And where he is said to
do it in obedience to the Father, as it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of a voluntary obedience, so is it spoken
of the execution of our Redemption, and
in regard to the humane nature especially;
and not of the undertaking by the divine
Nature alone. Not only the consent of Christ
did make it lawfull that he should be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
being innocent, but also that speciall
power which as he was God he had over his
own life more then any creature hath: <hi>Ioh. 10.
18.</hi> I have power <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> saith Christ, to lay
down my Life.</p>
                     <p>(3.) No meere creature was qualifyed for
this worke: even the Angels that are righteous
do but their duty, and therefore cannot su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogate
or merit for us. Neither were
they able to beare and overcome the penalty.</p>
                     <p>(4.) It must therefore be God that must sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
God; both for the perfection of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
for dignifying of the duty and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
for to be capable of meriting, for the
bearing of the curse, and for the overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of it, and doing the rest of the workes
of the Mediatorship, which were to be done
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106762:15"/>
after the Resurrection. Yet meere God it must
not be, but man also: or else it would have
been forgivenesse without satisfaction, seeing
God cannot be said to make satisfaction to
himselfe. Many other reasons are frequently
given by Divines to prove the necessity of
Christs Incarnation, <hi>Act. 20, 28. Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>(5.) Had not Christ been perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
himselfe he had not been capable of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
for others: Yet is it not necessary that
he must be in all respects a fulfiller of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
before he begin the work of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
or that his righteousnesse and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
be so distinct, as that the same may not
be both righteousnesse and satisfactory.</p>
                     <p>Though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many great Divines do so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between <hi>Iustitiam personae, &amp; Iustitiam
meriti,</hi> as that the former is only a preparatory
to the latter; yet I cannot see any reason but
the same obedience of Christ to the whole
Law may be both personall and meritorious,
(of the righteousnesse of the Divine nature,
or the habituall righteousnesse of the humane
nature, I do not now dispute.) Therefore I do
not mean that all Christs personall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
was only preparatory to his satisfaction
and merit, when I speak of his being furnished
with a personall Righteousnesse, though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
I was long of that judgement. See more
after at pag. 45.</p>

(6.) The undertaking of the Son of God to
satisfie, was effectuall before his actuall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying:
As a man that makes a purchase, may
take possession and enjoy the thing purchased
upon the meere bargaine made, or earnes paid,
before he have fully paid the sum. To this
purpose most understand that in <hi>Rev. 13. 8.
whose names were not written in the book of life,</hi>
of the lambe slaine from the foundation of the
World: But I doubt not but <hi>Weemse</hi> his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
is the plaine truth; that the words
<hi>[from the foundation of the World]</hi> have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the writing of their names in the
book of Life, and not to the slaying of the
Lambe, as being thus to be read, <hi>whose names
were not written in the book of life of the slain
Lambe, from the foundation of the World.</hi> It hath
the same sence with <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 8. which doth
expound this in leaving out the mention of
the slaying of the Lambe.</p>
                     <p>(7.) I know mans guilt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>igation to
suffer, is but Metaphorically called his debt.
Therefore when we would search into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of these things exactly, wee must rather
conceive of God as the Lawgiver and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the World, then as a creditor, lest the
Metaphor should mislead us. Yet because it is
a common &amp; a Scripture phrase, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
expresseth our Obligation to beare the
penalty of the violated Law, I use it in that sense.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106762:16"/>
But here we are cast upon many and weighty
and very difficult Questions. Whether Christ
did discharge this debt by way of solution or
by way of satisfaction? 2. whether in his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and our escape the threatning of the Law
was executed or dispensed with? 3. And if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed
with, how it can stand with the truth
and justice of God? 4. And whether sinners
may thence be encouraged to conceive some
hope of a relaxation of the threatnings in the
Gospell? 5. And whether the faithfull may not
feare lest God may relaxe a promise as well as
a threatning? 6. And lastly whether if the Law
be relaxable, God might not have released his
Son from the suffering, rather then have put
him to so great torment, and so have freely
pardoned the offendours? I shall briefly answer
to all these.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Meere and proper solution or pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, when the very same thing is paid
which w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> in the obligation, or suffered which
was threatned. This payment the creditor
cannot refuse; nor the Ruler refuse this suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
nor to acquit the person that hath so
payed or suffered.</p>
                     <p>Satisfaction is the paying of somewhat that
was not directly in the Obligation, but is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to satisfye the creditor in stead of the
debt, which payment the Creditor may
chuse to accept; and if hee do not consent to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106762:17"/>
accept it, though it were paid, yet the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
should not be acquit. So also in regard
of suffering.</p>
                     <p>Here we take payment and satisfaction in
the strict legall sence and not in the large sence
wherein they are confounded. And now the
Question is, whether Christs suffering were
the payment of the very debt, or of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
else in its stead? The resolving of this
depends upon the resolving of two other quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
both great and difficult.</p>
                     <p>1. What it was which the Law did threaten
2. What it was that Christ did suffer?</p>
                     <p>1. Various are the judgements of Divines
about the former; and exceeding difficult it
is to determine, because it hath pleased the
Holy Ghost to speake of it so sparingly: and
who can here understand any more then is
written? 1. Whether <hi>Adams</hi> soule and body
should immediatly have bin annihilated, or
destroyed so as to become insensible? 2. Or
whether his soule should have bin immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly
seprarated from his body as ours are at
death, and so be the only sufferer of the paine?
3. Or if so, whether there should have bin any
Resurrection of the body after any certaine
space of time, that so it might suffer as well
as the soule? 4. Or whether soule and body
without separation should have gone downe
quick together into Hell? Or into any place
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106762:17"/>
or state of torment short of Hell? 5. Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
both should have lived a cursed life on
Earth through everlasting, in exclusion from
Paradise, separation from Gods favour and
gratious presence, losse of his image, &amp;c?
6. Or whether hee should have lived such a
miserable life for a season, and then be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated,
or destroyed? 7. And if so, whether
his misery on Earth should have bin more
then men doe now endure? And the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
are these Questions of, because of
some other that depend upon them. As 1.
what death it was that Christ redeemed us
from? 2. And what death it is that perishing
infants die, or that our guilt in the first trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
doth procure? For it being a sinne
against the first Covenant only, will be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with no other death then that which is
threatned in that Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Much is said against each of these exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of that first threatning.</p>
                     <p>1. Against the first I have said somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
And that in 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. seems to be
much against it: <hi>Iesus that delivered us from the
wrath to come:</hi> This wrath was either the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the threatning of the Covenant of
works, or of the Covenant of grace: not the
latter, for Christ saveth none who deserve it,
from that: therefore it must needs be the wrath
of the first Covenant, and consequently that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106762:18"/>
Covenant did threaten a future wrath to all
sinners, which, if the world or <hi>Adam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
had been destroyed, or annihilated im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
upon his fall, we had not been capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of.</p>
                     <p>2. Against the second sense, it seemeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
that the soule should suffer alone, and
the body lie quietly in the dust, because the
body did sinne as well as the soule, and the
senses were the soules inticers and betrayers.</p>
                     <p>3. Against the third there is no intimation
of a Resurrection in the Scripture as part of
the penalty of the Covenant of works, or as
a preparative to it. That <hi>Adam</hi> should have
risen againe to be condemned or executed if
Christ had not come, no Scripture speakes;
but rather on the contrary, Resurrection is
ascribed to Christ alone, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. 21. 22.</p>
                     <p>4. Against the fourth it seemeth evident by
the execution, that the separation of soule
and body was, at least, part of the death that,
was threatned, or else how comes it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted?
and the Apostle saith plainly, that in
<hi>Adam</hi> all dye, <hi>viz.</hi> this naturall death, 1 <hi>Cor.
15.</hi> 22.</p>
                     <p>5. Against the fift the same Argument will,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erve.</p>
                     <p>6. Concerning the sixth &amp; seventh they lye
open to the same objection as the second.</p>
                     <p>It is hard to conclude peremptorily in so
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106762:18"/>
obscure a case. If wee knew certainly what life
was the reward of that Covenant, we might
the better understand what death was the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.
<hi>Calvin</hi> and many more Interpreters
think that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, he should
after a season have been translated into Heaven
without death, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> but I know
no Scripture that tells us so much. Whether in
Paradise terrestriall or celestiall I certainly
know not; but that <hi>Adam</hi> should have lived in
happinesse and not have dyed, is certain;
seeing therefore that Scripture tells us on the
one hand, that death is the wages of sinne; and
one the other hand, that Jesus delivered us
from the wrath to come; the 2, 6, and 7. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
doe as yet seem to me the most safe,
as containing that punishment whereby both
these Scriptures are fulfilled: Beside that they
much correspond to the execution, <hi>viz.</hi> that
man should live here for a season a dying life,
separated from God, devoid of his Image,
subject to bodily curses and calamities, dead
in Law, and at last his soule and body be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated;
his body turning to dust from
whence it came, and his soule enduring ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
sorrowes, yet nothing so great as those
that are threatned in the new Covenant.</p>
                     <p>The Objection that lyeth against this sense,
is easier then those which are against the other.
For though the body should not rise to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106762:19"/>
yet its destruction is a very great puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment:
And the soule being of a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and durable nature, is likely to have had
the greater and more durable suffering: And
though the body had a chief hand in the sin,
yet the soule had the farre greater guilt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it should have commanded and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the body; as the fault of a man is far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the same in a beast.</p>
                     <p>Yet I do not positively conclude, that the
body should not have risen againe; but I finde
no intimation of it revealed in the Scripture;
but that the sentence should have been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
executed to the full, or that any such
thing is concluded in the words of the threat
<hi>In the day thou eatest thou shalt die the death.</hi> I doe
not thinke; for that would have prevented
both the being, the sinne, and the suffering of
his posterity; and consequently Christ did not
save any one in the world from sinne or suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
but <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> which seems to me a
hard saying (though I know much may be said
for it.)</p>
                     <p>Thus we see in part the first Question resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
what death it was that the Law did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?
Now let us see, whether this were the
same that Christ did suffer? And if we take the
threatning in its full extent, as it expresseth
not only the penalty, but also its proper sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and its circumstances, then it is undenya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106762:19"/>
that Christ did not suffer the same that was
threatned; For the Law threatned the death
of the offender, but Christ was not the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<hi>Adam</hi> should have suffered for ever, but
so did not Christ; <hi>Adam</hi> did dy spiritually,
by being forsaken of God, in regard of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as well as in regard of comfort, and so
deprived at least of the chief part of his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
so was not Christ.</p>
                     <p>Yet it is disputable whether these two last
were directly contained in the threatning, or
not? whether the threatning were not fully
executed in <hi>Adams</hi> death? And the eternity of
it were not accidentall, even a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of <hi>Adams</hi> disability to overcome
death and deliver himself, which God was not
bound to doe? And whether the losse of Gods
Image were part of the death threatned, or
rather the effect of our sinne onely, executed
by our selves, and not by God? Many Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
say, that God did not take away his Image,
but man thrust it away: So <hi>Capell of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
pag. 8. &amp;c. Though most judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
because the same power must annihilate
that must create.</p>
                     <p>I conclude then, that in regard of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
penalty, Christ did suffer a paine and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of the same sort, and of equall weight
with that threatned; but yet because it was
not in all respects the same, it was rather satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106762:20"/>
then the payment of the proper debt,
being such a payment as God might have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
to accept.</p>
                     <p>The 2. Question was, Whether the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was executed, or relaxed and dispensed
with?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Answer to this is plaine in the
answer to the former.</p>
                     <p>In regard of the meer weight of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
considered as abstracted from person
&amp; duration, it was executed &amp; not relaxed; yet
taking the threatning intirely as it was given
out, and we must say it was dispensed with; for
mankinde doth not suffer all that is there
threatned.</p>
                     <p>Yet some, who think that the death threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
did consist in out present miseries and
temporal death onely, do also think that the
threatning is fully executed upon the sinners,
and that Christ hath onely delivered us from
the accidentall duration of it, but not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the execution.</p>
                     <p>If I could think that the threatning inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no punishment to the soule further, after
it is separated from the body, then I should
think as they.</p>
                     <p>The 3. Question is, How it can stand with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Truth and Justice of God to dispense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:106762:20"/>
with his Threats? Concerning his Justice, the
question is not difficult, &amp; I shall say nothing
to that; all the question is, how to reconcile
this dispensation with Gods truth. Here you
must distinguish, 1. Betwixt the letter of the
Law and the sense. 2. Between the Law and
the end of the Law. 3. Between a Threat with
exception either expressed or reserved, and
that which hath no exception. 4. Between a
threatning which onely expresseth the desert
of the sinne, and what punishment is due,
and so falleth only under the will of precept,
and that which also intendeth the certaine
prediction of event, and so falleth under the
will of purpose also. And now I answer:</p>
                     <p>1. The end of the Law is the Law, and that
end being the manifestation of Gods Justice
and hatred of sinne, &amp;c. was fulfilled, and
therefore the Law was fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>2. Most think that the Threatning had this
reserved exception, [<hi>Thou shalt dye, i. e.</hi> by
thy selfe, or thy surety.] And though it be
sinfull in man to speak with mentall reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
when he pretends to reveale his mind,
yet not in God, because as he is subject to no
Law, so he is not bound to reveale to us all his
minde, nor doth he indeed pretend any such
thing.</p>
                     <p>3. So that the sense of the Law is fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>4. But the speciall answer that I give, is this,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106762:21"/>
When Threatnings are meerly parts of the
Law, and not also predictions of event and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoveries
of Gods purpose thereabouts, then
they may be dispensed with without any
breach of Truth: For as when God saith,
[<hi>Thou shalt not eate of the Tree &amp;c.</hi>] the meaning
is onely [It is thy duty not to eate] and not
that eventually he should not eate: So when
he saith (<hi>Thou shalt die the death</hi>) The meaning
is, (Death shall be the due reward of thy sinne,
and so may be inflicted for it at my pleasure)
and not that he should certainly suffer it in
the event. And I judge, that except there be
some note added whereby it is apparent, that
God intended also the prediction of event, no
meer Threatning is to be understood other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
but as it is a part of the Law, and so speaks
of the duenesse of punishment onely, as the
Precept speaks of the duenesse of obeying.</p>
                     <p>If this be <hi>Grotius</hi> his meaning, I assent, that
<hi>Omnes minae quibus non adest irrevocabilitatis
signum, intelligendae sunt ex suâpte naturâ dejure
comminantis ad relaxandum nihil imminuere, (viz.)</hi>
so farre as they are no predictions of event;
otherwise Gods bare prediction is a note of
irrevocability: And his two notes, <hi>viz.</hi> An
Oath, and a Promise, are not the onely signes
of irrevocability: Gods Word is as sure as his
Oath, and a Threatning as true as a Promise,
and when it falls, under <hi>Voluntas propositi,</hi> will
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106762:21"/>
as surely be fulfilled. See <hi>Grotius de satisfactione
Christi, cap. 3. &amp; Vossium ejus defenforem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 4. Question is, whether sinners may
not hence be encouraged to conceive some
hope of a relaxation of the Threatnings in the
New Covenant? To this I answer.</p>
                     <p>1. No: For God hath fully discovered that
it is his purpose and resolution to execute
those Threats, and not to relax or reverse
them; that he will come in flaming fire to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
vengeance on them that know not God,
and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Iesus
Christ, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 7, 8. That there is no
more sacrifice for sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27. And hath
revealed the manner how they shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
                     <p>2. If there were any hope of this, yet were
it unexpressable madnesse to venter ones ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
state on that, when we see that God did
not remit the penalty of the first Covenant
wholly, but would have his justice satisfied,
though by the suffering of his Sonne Christ:
And yet that it also cost the offendors so deare
themselves.</p>
                     <p>The 5. Question is, May we not feare lest
God may dispense with his Promises as well as
his Threats? I answer:</p>
                     <p>1. He did not dispense with his Threatning,
but upon a valuable consideration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106762:22"/>
2. No; for though the Promise as well as
the Threat doe belong to the Law, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
what is due, rather then what shall come
to passe, yet the thing promised being once
our due, cannot be taken from us without our
consent: and so, as <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, <hi>Ex promisione
jus aliquod acquiritur ei cui facta est promtssio;</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
bindeth to give all to another that is his
due, but not alwayes and absolutely to inflict
upon an offender as much punishment as he
deserveth.</p>
                     <p>3. Beside, God hath revealed it to be the
will of his purpose also to confer the things
promised in the Gospel upon all Beleevers.</p>
                     <p>The 6 and last Question was. If the Law be
relaxable, whether God might not have freely
remitted the offence, and have spared his Son
his satisfactory sufferings? I answer.</p>
                     <p>1. It yet remaines under dispute whether
the Threat speak not <hi>de eventu,</hi> as to the sinne,
though but <hi>de jure,</hi> as to the sinner? And then
the Truth of God would forbid a dispensation
as to the sinne,</p>
                     <p>2. Though the Threatning doe not flatly
determine of the execution <hi>de eventu;</hi> yet it
intimates a strong probability of it, &amp; seemes
to tell the world, that ordinarily the Law-giver
will proceed according thereto, and gives
the sinner strong grounds to expect as much.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106762:22"/>
Therefore if God should relax his Law,
much more if he should wholly dispence with
it by remission, the Law would seem to lose
much of its authority, and the Law-giver be
esteemed mutable.</p>
                     <p>3. Besides, as no good Lawes are lightly to
be reversed, so, much lesse such as are so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to order, and the nature of God and
so solemnly enacted as this was.</p>
                     <p>4. Though GOD did dispense with his
Law as to our impunity, because else mankind
would have utterly perished, and because he
is abundant in mercy and compassion (<hi>Exo.
34. 7. Psal.</hi> 103. 8. &amp; III. 4, 5. &amp; 145. 8. <hi>Isa.
55. 7. Ier. 31. 20. Luk 6. 36. Rom.</hi> 2. 4.) yet he
is also holy and just, and a hater of sinne;
and how would those his Attributes have
been manifested or glorified, if he had let
so many and great sinnes goe wholly unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
(<hi>Prov. 11. 20. Psal.</hi> 5. 5. &amp; 45. 8. <hi>Heb. 11. 2.
Rom.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                     <p>5. It would have encouraged men to sin
and contemne the Law, if the very first breach
and all other should be meerly remitted; but
when men see that God hath punished his Son
when he was our surety, they may easily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that he will not spare them, if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
rebells.</p>
                     <p>6. The very end of the Law else would have
been frustrated, which now is fulfilled by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106762:23"/>
Christs satisfaction: For <hi>Proxima sunt idem &amp;
tantundem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. Besides the exceeding love of God that
is manifested in this suffering of his Son, and
the great engagemens that are laid upon the
sinner.</p>
                     <p>They that will avoid all the supposed incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of this Doctrine of Gods dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
with his Threatnings, must needs affirme,
that the offenders do suffer as much, and the
same which was threatned.</p>
                     <p>(8.) Whether we are justified onely by
Christs Passive Righteousnesse, or also by his
Active, is a very great dispute among Divines.
By his Passive Righteousnesse is meant not
onely his death, but the whole course of his
humiliation, from the Assumption of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature to his Resurrection. Yea, even his
Obedientiall Actions so far as there was any
suffering in them, and as they are considered
under the notion of Suffering, and not of
Duty or Obedience. By his Active Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is meant the Righteousnesse of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as they were a perfect obedience to
the Law. The chiefe point of difference and
difficulty lyeth higher, How the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christ is made ours? Most of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Divines say, that Christ did as properly
obey in our roome and stead, as he did suffer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106762:23"/>
in our stead; and that in Gods esteem and in
point of Law wee were in Christ obeying and
suffering, and so in him wee did both perfectly
fulfill the Commands of the Law by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and the threatnings of it by bearing
the penalty; and thus (say they) is Christs
Righteousnesse imputed to us, <hi>viz.</hi> his Passive
Righteousnesse for the pardon of our sins and
delivering us from the penalty; his Active
Righteousnesse for the making of us righteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
and giving us title to the kingdom: And
some say, the habituall Righteousnes of his
humane nature instead of our own habituall
Righteousnesse; yea some adde the righteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snes
of the divine nature also.</p>
                     <p>This opinion (in my judgement) contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
a great many of mistakes.</p>
                     <p>1. It supposeth us to have been in Christ,
at least in legall title, before we did beleeve,
or were born; and that not onely in a generall
and conditionall sense as all men, but in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
as the justified; indeed we are elected in
Christ before the foundation of the world,
but that is a terme of diminution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth not prove that we were then in him;
Neither Gods Decree or foreknowledge gives
us any legall title.</p>
                     <p>2. It teacheth imputation of Christ Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
in so strict a sense, as will neither
stand with reason, nor the Doctrine of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106762:24"/>
much lesse with the phrase of Scripture
which mentioneth no imputation of Christ or
his Righteousnesse to us at all; and hath given
great advantage to the Papists against us in
this Doctrine of Justification.</p>
                     <p>3. It seemeth to ascribe to God a mistaking
judgement, as to esteem us to have been in
Christ when wee were not, and to have done
and suffered in him, what we did not.</p>
                     <p>4. It maketh Christ to have paid the <hi>Idem,</hi>
and not the <hi>Tantundem;</hi> the same that was due,
and not the value; and so to justifie us by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the proper debt, and not by strict
satisfaction. And indeed this is the very core
of the mistake, to think that we have by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation
paid the proper debt of <hi>Obedience</hi> to
the whole Law, or that in Christ we have
perfectly obeyed; whereas; 1. It can neither be
said, that we did it; 2. And that which Christ
did, was to satisfie for our non-payment and
disobedience.</p>
                     <p>5. So it maketh Christ to have fulfilled the
preceptive part of the Law in our stead and
roome in as strict a sense, as he did in our room
beare the punishment, which will not hold
good (though for our sakes he did both.)</p>
                     <p>6. It supposeth the Law to require both
obedience and suffering in respect of the
same time and actions, which it doth not.
And whereas they say, that the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106762:24"/>
suffering for what is past, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
for the future; this is to deny that
Christ hath satisfied for future sinnes. The
time is neere when those future sins will be
past also; what doth the Law require then? If
we doe not obey for the future, then we sin;
if we sin, the Law requires nothing but suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for expiation.</p>
                     <p>7. This opinion maketh Christs sufferings
(by consequence) to be in vain, both to have
been suffered needlesly by him, and to be
needless also now to us: For if we did perfectly
obey the Law in Christ, (or Christ for us,
according to that strict imputation,) then the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere
is no use for suffering for disobedience.</p>
                     <p>8. It fondly supposeth a <hi>medium</hi> betwixt
one that is just, and one that is guilty; and a
difference betwixt one that is just, and one
that is no sinner; one that hath his sin or gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t
taken away, and one that hath his unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
taken away: It is true, in bruits and
insensibles, that are not subjects capable of
justice, there is a <hi>medium</hi> betwixt just and
unjust, and innocency and justice are not the
same. There is a negative injustice which dene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth
the subject <hi>non-justum,</hi> but not <hi>injustu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
where Righteousness is not due: But where
there is the <hi>debitum habendi,</hi> where Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
ought to be, &amp; is not, there is no negative
unrighteousness, but primative: As there is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106762:25"/>
no middle betwixt strait and crooked, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
between Conformity to the Law, (which
is Righteousness,) and Deviation from it,
which is unrighteousness.)</p>
                     <p>9. It maketh our Righteousness, to consist
of two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The putting away of our
guilt, and the Imputation of Righteousness,
<hi>i. e.</hi> 1. Removing the crookedness; 2. Making
them streight.</p>
                     <p>10. It ascribeth these two supposed parts
to two distinct supposed causes; the one to
Christs fulfilling the Precept by his actual
Righteousness, the latter to his fulfilling the
threatning by his passive Righteousness: As
if there must be one cause of introducing
light, and another of expelling darkness; or
one cause to take away the crookedness of a
line, and another to make it streight.</p>
                     <p>11. The like vain distinction it maketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
delivering from death, and giving title
to life, or freeing us from the penalty, and
giving us the reward; For as when all sin of
omission and commission is absent, there is no
unrighteousness; so when all the penalty is
taken away, both that of pain, and that of
loss, the party is restored to his former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
Indeed there is a greater superadded
decree of life and glory procured by Christ
more then we lost in <hi>Adam:</hi> But as that life is
not opposed to the death or penalty of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106762:25"/>
Covenant, but to that of the second; so is it
the effect of Christs passive, as well as of his
active Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>So you see the mistakes contained in this
first Opinion, about the Imputation of Christs
Righteousness to us.</p>
                     <p>The maintainers of it (beside some few able
men) are the vulgar sort of unstudyed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
who having not ability or diligence to
search deep into so profound a Controversie,
do still hold that opinion which is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and in credit.</p>
                     <p>If you would see what is said against it, read
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Wotton, Pareus, Piscator,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Bradshaw</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                        <hi>Gataker,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Io: Goodwin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other opinion about our Participation
of Christs Righteousness is this, That God
the Father doth accept the sufferings and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of his Son as a full satisfaction to his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Law, and as a valuable consideration
upon which he will wholy forgive and acquit
the offenders themselves, and receive them
again into his favour, and give them the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a more excellent happiness also, so they
will but receive his Son upon the terms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>This Opinion as it is more simple and plain,
so it avoydeth all the fore-mentioned incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
which do accompany the former.
But yet this difference is betwixt the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106762:26"/>
of it: Most of them think, that Christs
Passive Righteousness (in the latitude before
expressed) is the whole of this Satisfaction
made by Christ, which they therefore call
<hi>Iustitia Meriti,</hi> and that his Actual Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is but <hi>Iustitia Personae,</hi> qualifying him to
be a fit Mediator. Of this judgment are many
learned and godly Divines, of singular esteem
in the Church of God, (the more to blame
some of the ignorant sort of their adversaries,
who so reproach them as Hereticks: I have
oft wondered when I have read some of them,
(as M. <hi>Walker,</hi> &amp;c.) to see how strongly they
revile, and how weakly they dispute.) Sure if

Orthodox; and if they be not mistaken all
antiquity is on their side, beside <hi>Calvin, Vrsine,</hi>
and most other modern Divines that writ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Controversie was agitated; and sure
they are neither unlearned nor ungodly that
have in our own Country maintained that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion;

Some others (though few) do think, that
though Christs Righteousness be not imputed
to us in that strict sense as the first Opinion
expresseth, but is ours under the fore-explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
notion of Satisfaction only, yet the Active
Righteousness considered, as such is part of
this Satisfaction also, as well as his Passive,
and <hi>Iustitia Meriti, as</hi> as well as <hi>Iustitia Personae;</hi>
and though the Law do not require both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
and suffering, yet Christ paying not
the <hi>Idem,</hi> but the <hi>Tantundem,</hi> not the strict
debt it self, but a valuable Satisfaction, might
well put the merit of his works into the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The chief Divines that I know for this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
(as it is distinguished from the two
former) are judicious and holy M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Bradshaw,</hi>
and <hi>Grotius,</hi> (if I may call a Lawyer a Divine.)</p>
                     <p>And for my own part I think it is the truth,
though I confess I have been ten years of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mind for the sole Passive Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
because of the weakness of those grounds
which are usually laid to support the opinion
for the Active and Passive; till discerning more
clearly the nature of Satisfaction, I perceived,
that though the sufferings of Christ have the
chief place therein, yet his obedience as such
may also be meritorious and satisfactory. The
true grounds and proof whereof you may
read in <hi>Grotius de Satisfact. cap.</hi> 6. and <hi>Bradshaw</hi>
of Justification in Preface, and <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</p>

The chief Objections against it are these;</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Object.</hi> Christs Passive Righteousness
being as much as the Law required on our
behalf, as satisfaction for its violation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Active is needless, except to qualifie
him to be a fit Mediator. I answer, This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is grounded upon the forementioned
Error, That Christ paid the <hi>Idem,</hi> and not the
<hi>Tantundem:</hi> whereas it being not a proper pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the debt, but satisfaction, therefore
even his meritorious works might satisfie.
Many an offender against Prince or State hath
been pardoned their offence, and escaped pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
for some deserving acceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that they have done, or that some of their
predecessors have done before them. And so
<hi>Rom. 5. 19. By the obedience of one, many are made
righteous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. It is objected, That Christ being once
subject to the Law, could do no more but his
duty, which if he had not done, he must have
suffered for himself; and therefore how could
his obedience be satisfactory and meritorious
for us? I answer, 1. You must not here in your
conceivings abstract the Humane Nature, which
was created, from the Divine; but consider
them as composing one person: 2. Nor must
you look upon the Works of Christ, as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their valuation and denomination from
the Humane Nature alone or principally. 3.
Nor must you separate in your thoughts the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106762:27"/>
time of Christs servitude and subjection, from
the time of his freedom before his incarnation
and subjection. And so take these Answers. 1.
Christ Jesus did perform severall works which
he was not obliged to perform, as a meer Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
Such are all the works that are proper to
his office of Mediator, his assuming the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, his making Laws to his Church,
his establishing and sealing the Covenant,
his working Miracles, his sending his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to convert and save the world, enduing
them with the Spirit, his overcoming Death
and rising again, &amp;c. What Law bindeth us to
such works as these? And what Law (to speak
properly) did binde him to them? Yet were
the works in themselves so excellent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to his Fathers Will, (which he was
well acquainted with) that they were truly
meritorious and satisfactory.</p>
                     <p>2. Some works he performed which were
our duty indeed, but he was not bound to
perform them in regard of himself: Such as
are all the observances of the Ceremonial Law,
his Circumcision, Offering, and so his Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptism,
&amp;c. <hi>Luke. 2. 21, 24. Gal. 4. 4. Isa. 53.
12. Ioh. 7. 2, 10. Mat. 26. 17, 18, 19. 20. &amp;</hi> 3.
13. 10. These were the proper duties of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
which he was not: These two are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by Mr <hi>Gataker,</hi> and most others.</p>
                     <p>3. Even his obedience to the Moral Law
was not his duty, till he voluntarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106762:28"/>
it: It being therefore upon his consent
and choyce, and not due before consent, must
needs be meritorious. And though when he
was once a servant he is bound to do the work
of a servant, yet when he voluntarily put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the state of a servant, and under the
Law, not for his own sake, but for ours, his
work is nevertheless meritorious. Suppose
when a Soulder hath deserved death, his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
should offer himself to the General to do
the duty of the private Souldier, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
some rare exploit against the Enemy,
though he lose his life in the Service, and all
this to ransom the Souldier: when he hath
undertaken the task, it becomes due, but yet
is nevertheless satisfactory. As he (saith <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi>)
who to satisfie for another, becomes
a slave to men; doth in and by all those acts,
which the Laws binde a slave unto, make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
yea, though they be such acts, as
he, becoming a slave, is bound upon pain of
death to undergo: so Christ, &amp;c. and the
greater was the bond that he did undergo
for the doing of them, the greater was the
merit. <hi>Isa. 42. 1. &amp; 53. 11. Phili. 2. 7. Luk. 2.
20. Isa. 53. 9, 10. Gal. 4. 4. 2 Corinth. 5. 11.
Heb. 7. 26. 1 Pet. 2. 22, 24. &amp; 3. 18. 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                     <p>4. Even some works that are due may yet
be so excellent for matter and manner, and so
exceeding pleasing to him that commands
them, that they may give him satisfaction for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106762:28"/>
former injuries, and he may think it his part
to encourage the Actor with some reward. So
<hi>Ionathans</hi> delivering <hi>Israel</hi> by that rare exploit
did save him from death: <hi>Abners</hi> bringing in
the Kingdom to <hi>David</hi> would have covered his
former service against him: Many of <hi>Ioabs</hi>
faults were long covered by his good service:
Such were the actions of <hi>David</hi> in bringing in
the fore-skins of the <hi>Philistins;</hi> and of his
Worthies, in fetching him of the waters of
<hi>Bethlehem. 1 Sam. 14. 44, 45, 2 Sam. 2. 3. 1 Sam.
18. 26, 27. 2 Sam.</hi> 23. 16. It was not onely the
suffering or hazard in these actions that was
meritorious, but also the excellency of the
actions themselves.</p>
                     <p>5. The interest of the Divine Nature, in all
the works of Christ, maketh them to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
meritorious, and so satisfactory.</p>

                     <p>(1) FOr Explication of this there are several Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
to be debated.</p>
                     <p>1. Whether the extolling of Christ the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
or the restoring and saving of the offendors,
were Gods more remote end, and principal intention?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:106762:29"/>
2. Whether this Authority and Dignity of Christ, be
by Original Natural Right? or by Donation? or by
Purchase?</p>
                     <p>3. Whether Christs Lordship over all, do imply or
prove his redeeming of all? or of all alike?</p>
                     <p>4. Whether God hath delivered things out of his own
power in any kinde, by delivering them into the power
of his Son? or whether it be only the substituting him to
be Vicegerent to the Father?</p>
                     <p>To the first, I answer: That the saving of sinners
was the end both of the Father and the Son, is plain
through the Gospel and that the exalting of Christ to
his Dominion was another end, is plain in <hi>Rom</hi> 14. 9.
But which of these was the principal end, I think is an
unwarrantable question for man to propound: I dare
not undertake to assert a natural priority or posterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in any of Gods Decrees, <hi>de mediis ad finem ultimum;</hi>
much less to determine which hath the first place, and
which the second, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                     <p>To the second question I answer: 1. The Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Christ being one with the Godhead of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
had an absolute soveraignty over all things from
their first being: and so derivately had the humane
nature as soon as assumed by vertue of the Hypostatical
Union.</p>
                     <p>2. But there is further a power given him as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to dispose of all at his pleasure, to make new laws
to the world, and to deal with them according to the
tenor of those laws: This power is partly purchased,
and partly given (but not <hi>gratis:</hi>) that is, Though God
might have refused the tendered fatisfaction, and have
made the sinner bear the punishment yet he willingly
accepted the merits of his Son as a full ransom, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up all to the Purchaser as his own: And so well
was he pleased with the work of Redemption, that
he also gave a further power to his Son, to judge his
Enemies: and save his people with a far greater Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Salvation. So that this power may be said to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106762:29"/>
be [given] Christ, as it was the free act of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
constraint: and yet to be [purchased,] because it
was given upon a valuable consideration.</p>
                     <p>To the third Question, I answer. This Authority of
Christ implieth the purchasing of all things under his
power or dominion, as is explained in the last: But
what redemption or benefit is procured to the party,
I shall shew you more, when I come to treat of universal
Redemption by it self.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth Question, I answer. This is more then
a substituting of Christ to be the Fathers Vicegerent.
It is also a power of prescribing new terms of Life and
Death, and judging men according thereto, as is said
before. Yet is nothing properly given out of the Fathers
power or possession: but a power to suspend or dispense
with the strict Covenant of Works is given to the Son;
and so God having parted with that advantage which
his Justice had against the sinning world, and having
relaxed that Law, whereby he might have judged us,
is therefore said to judge no man, but to give all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Son. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 22, 27.</p>

                     <p>THe Questions that are here to be handled for the

                     <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the redeemed are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106762:30"/>
upon the price payd, delivered from any of the
curse of the Law? if not from all?</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the sufferings of the Elect before
conversion are in execution of any part of the curse of
the Law?</p>
                     <p>3. Whether the sufferings of Beleevers are from the
curse of the Law? or only afflictions of Love, the curse
being taken off by Christ?</p>
                     <p>4. Whether it be not a wrong to the Redeemer, that
the people whom he hath ransomed are not immediately
delivered?</p>
                     <p>5. Whether it be any wrong to the redeemed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
                     <p>6. How long will it be till all the curse be taken off
the Beleevers, and Redemption have attained its full
effect?</p>
                     <p>To the first Question I answer:</p>
                     <p>In this case the undertaking of satisfaction had the
same immediate effect upon <hi>Adam,</hi> as the satisfaction
it self upon us, or for us: To determine what these are,
were an excellent work; it being one of the greatest and
noblest questions in our controverted Divinity, <hi>What
are the immediate effects of Christs Death?</hi> He that can rightly
answer this, is a Divine indeed; and by the help of this,
may expedite most other controversies about Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Justification. In a word, The effects of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
undertaken, could not be upon a subject not yet
existent, and so no subject, though it might be for them:
None but <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were then existent. Yet as soon
as we do exist, we receive benefit from it. The suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the rigorous execution of the sentence of the
Law, is the most observable immediate effect of Christs
death; which suspension is some kinde of deliverance
from it. Of the other effects elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>To the second Question. The Elect before conversion
do stand in the same relation to the Law and Curse as
other men, though they be differenced in Gods Decree,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>2.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:106762:30"/>
To the third Question. I confess we have here a knotty
Question. The common judgment is, That Christ hath
taken away the whole curse (though not the suffering)
by bearing it himself; and now they are only afflictions
of Love, and not Punishments. I do not contradict this
doctrine through affectation of singularity, the Lord
knoweth; but through constraint of Judgement: And
that upon these grounds following.</p>
                     <p>1. It is undenyable, that Christs taking the curse upon
himself did not wholly prevent the execution upon the
offendor, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                     <p>2. It is evident from the event, seeing we feel part of
the curse fulfilled on us: We eat in labour and sweat;
the earth doth bring forth thorns and bryars; women
bring forth their children in sorrow; our native pravity
is the curse upon our souls; we are sick, and weary, and
full of fears, and sorrows, and shame, and at last we
dye and turn to dust.</p>
                     <p>3. The Scripture tells us plainly, that we all dye in
<hi>Adam,</hi> (even that death from which we must at the
Resurrection be raised by Christ,) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22.
And that death is the wages of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. And
that the sickness, and weakness, and death of the
godly is caused by their sins, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30, 31. And if
so, then doubtless they are in execution of the threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
of the Law, though not in full rigor.</p>
                     <p>4. It is manifest, that our sufferings are in their own
nature evils to us, and the sanctifying of them to us
taketh not away their natural evil, but only produceth
by it, as by an occasion, a greater good: Doubtless so
far as it is the effect of sin, it is evil, and the effect also
of the law.</p>
                     <p>5. They are ascribed to Gods anger, as the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them is ascribed to his love, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 5. and a
thousand places more.</p>
                     <p>6. They are called punishments in Scripture, and
therefore we may call them so, <hi>Lev. 26. 41, 43. Lam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
3. 39. <hi>&amp; 4. 6, 22. Ezra 9. 13. Hosea 4. 9. &amp; 12. 2. Lev.</hi>
26. 18, 24.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:106762:31"/>
7. The very nature of affliction is to be a loving pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
a natural evil sanctified, and so to be mixt of
evil and good, as it proceedeth from mixt causes: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to say that Christ hath taken away the curse and
evil, but not the suffering, is a contradiction, because
so far as it is a suffering it is to us evil, and the execution
of the curse. What reason can be given, why God should
not do us all that good without our sufferings, which
now he doth by them, if there were not sin, and wrath
and Law in them? Sure he could better us by easier
means.</p>
                     <p>8. All those Scriptures and Reasons that are brought
so the contrary do prove no more but this, That our
afflictions are not the rigorous execution of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Law, that they are not wholly or chiefly in
wrath; but as the common Love of God to the wicked
is mixt with hatred in their sufferings, and the hatred
prevaileth above the love, so the sufferings of the godly
proceed from a mixture of love and anger, and so have
in them a mixture of good and evil; but the Love over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Anger, therefore the good is greater then
the evil, and so death hath lost its sting, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 55,
56.</hi> There is no unpardoned sin in it, which shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
further judgment, and so no hatred, though there
be anger.</p>
                     <p>9. The Scripture saith plainly, That death is one of
the enemies that is not yet overcome, but shall be last
conquered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 26, and of our corruption the
case is plain.</p>
                     <p>10. The whole stream of Scripture maketh Christ to
have now the sole disposing of us and our sufferings,
to have prevented the full execution of the curse, and to
manage that which lyeth on us for our advantage and
good; but no where doth it affirm that he suddenly
delivereth us.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth Question: It can be no wrong to
Christ, that we are not perfectly freed from all the curse
and evil as soon as he had satisfied: 1. Because it was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106762:31"/>
not the Couenant betwixt him and the Father. 2. It is
not his own will, <hi>&amp; volenti non fit injuria.</hi> 3. It is his
own doing now to keep us under it, till he see the fittest
time to release us. 4. Our sufferings are his means and
advantages to bring us to his Will. Mankind having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
his life, is cast into prison till the time of full
execution: Christ steppeth in, and buyeth the prisoners,
with a full purpose, that none of them yet shall scape but
those that take him for their Lord. To this purpose he
must treat with them, to know whether they will be his
subjects, and yield themselves to him, and his terms.
Is it not then a likelier way to procure their consent, to
treat with them in prison, then to let them out, and then
treat? and to leave some of the curse upon them, to
force them to yield, that they may know what they must
expect else, when the whole shall be executed.</p>
                     <p>To the fift Question: It is no wrong to the sinner to
be thus dealt with; 1. Because he is but in the misery
which he brought upon himself. 2. No man can lay claim
to the Satisfaction and Redemption upon the meer
payment, till they have a word of promise for it. 3. Their
sufferings, if they will be ruled, shall turn to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                     <p>To the sixth Question: The last enemy to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
is death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 26. This enemy will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
perfectly at the Resurrection; then also shall we
be perfectly acquit from the charge of the Law, and
accusation of Satan: Therefore not till the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
and Judgment, will all the Effects of Sin and
Law, and Wrath be perfectly removed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24.</p>

                     <p>(1) WHether Man were only the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious

or also the Efficient, is a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
but of no great moment; as long
as we are agreed that Man is the only faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

or whether God took it from him
for sin? whether God only could anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate
it? Or whether Man may annihilate a
Quality, though not a Substance? I will not
meddle with. But too sure it is, that we are
naturally deprived of it, and so disabled to
fulfill the Law. If Christ therefore should have
pardoned all that was past, and renewed the
first violated Covenant again; and set Man in
the same estate that he fell from, in poynt of
guilt, yet would he have fallen as desperately
the next temptation: yea though he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to him his primitive strength and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
yet experience hath shewed on how
slippery and uncertain a ground his happiness
would have stood, and how soon he was likely
to play the Prodigal again with his stock.</p>

(2) God the Father and Christ the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
who have one will, did therefore resolve
upon a more suitable way of happines.</p>
                     <p>(3) This way, as the former, is by both a
Law and Covenant. As it is a Law, it is by
Christ, prescribed, and flatly enjoyned; and
either obedience, or the penalty shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.
As it is a Covenant, it is only tendered
and not enforced. It is called a Covenant as it
is in Scripture written and offered (as is said
before) improperly, because it containeth the
matter of the Covenant, though yet it want
the form: Even as a Bond or Obligation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the sealing or agreement is called a Bond:
Or as a form of prayer as it is written in a book,
is called a prayer, because it containeth the
matter that we should pray for: though to
speak strictly, it is no prayer, till it be sent up
to God, from a desiring Soul.</p>
                     <p>(4) Though without Grace we can no more
beleeve, then perfectly obey, (as a dead man
can no more remove a straw then a mountain)
yet the conditions of the Gospel considered
in themselves, or in reference to the strength
which God will bestow, are far more facile
then the old conditions. <hi>Mat. 11. 29, 30.
1 Ioh.</hi> 5. 3. And more abasing they are to the
sinner, in that he hath far lesse to doe in the
work of his salvation: And also in that they
contain the acknowledgement of his lost
estate, through his own former self destro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106762:33"/>
folly.</p>
                     <p>(5) Such incomprehensible amazing Love
of God the Father, and of Christ, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
in this New Covenant, that the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
thereof doth seem to be the main end
in this design. Oh sweet and blessed End?
should not then the searching into it be our

admiring it, be our main employment? <hi>Rom.
5. 8. Tit. 3. 4. 1 Ioh. 4. 9. Eph. 3. 18. 19. Ioh. 15.

when he could make it an occasionall prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

                     <p>I Shall here explain to you, in what sence,
and how far the Law is in force, and how
far not: and then prove it in and under the
next head.</p>
                     <p>You must here distinguish betwixt,</p>
                     <p>1. The repealing of the Law, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing
of it. 2. Between a dispensation ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and respective. 3. Between the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Law, and the alteration of
the Subjects relation to it. 4. Between a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scharge
conditional, with a suspension of
execution, and a Discharge absolute. And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106762:34"/>
so I resolve the question thus;</p>
                     <p>1. The Law of Works is not abrogated,
or repealed, but dispensed with, or relaxed.
A Dispensation is (as <hi>Grotius</hi> defineth it) an
act of a Superior, whereby the obligation of
a Law in force is taken away, as to certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and things.</p>
                     <p>2. This Dispensation therefore is not total
or absolute, but respective. For, 1. though
it dispence with the rigorous execution, yet
not with every degree of execution. 2. Though
the Law be dispenced with as it containeth
the proper subjects of the penalty, <hi>viz.</hi> the
parties offending, and also the circumstances
of duration, &amp;c. Yet in regard of the meer
punishment abstracted from person and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
it is not dispenced with: for to
Christ it was not dispenced with: His satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
was by paying the full value.</p>
                     <p>3. Though by this Dispensation our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
may be as full as upon a Repeal, yet the
Alteration is not made in the Law, but in our
estate and relation to the Law.</p>
                     <p>4. So far is the Law dispenced with to all,
as to suspend the rigorous execution for a
time; and a Liberation or Discharge condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
procured and granted them. But an
absolute Discharge is granted to none in
this life. For even when we do perform the
Condition, yet still the Discharge remains
conditional, till we have quite finished our
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106762:34"/>
performance. For it is not one instantaneous
Act of beleeving which shall quite discharge
us; but a continued Faith. No longer are we
discharged, then we are Beleevers. And where
the condition is not performed, the Law is
still in force, and shall be executed upon the
offender himself.</p>
                     <p>I speak nothing in all this of the directive
use of the Moral Law to Beleevers: But how far
the Law is yet in force, even as it is a Covenant
of Works; because an utter Repeal of it in this
sence is so commonly, but inconsiderately
asserted. That it is no further overthrown, no
not to Beleevers, then is here explained, I
now come to prove.</p>

                  <p>IF this were not so, but that Christ had abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the first Covenant, then it would follow, 1.
That no sin but that of <hi>Adam,</hi> and final Vnbelief,
is so much as threatned with death, or that death
is explicitely (that is, by any Law) due to it or
deserved by it. For, what the Law in force doth not
threaten, that is not explicitely deserved, or due
by Law. 2. It would follow, That Christ dyed
not to prevent or remove the wrath and curse
so deserved or due to us for any but <hi>Adams</hi> sin,
nor to pardon our sins at all: but only to prevent
our desert of wrath and curse, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to prevent our need of pardon. 3. It would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106762:35"/>
That against eternal wrath at the day of
Iudgment, we must not plead the pardon of any
sin, but the first, but our own non-desert of that
wrath, because of the repeal of that Law before the
sin was committed. All which consequences seem to
me unsufferable, which cannot be avoyded if the Law
be repealed.</p>
                  <div type="explanation">
                     <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
                     <p>WHen God the absolute Soveraign
of the World shall but command,
though he expresly threaten no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
to the disobedient, yet impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
it may be said to be due; that is, the
offence in it self considered, deserveth some
punishment in the generall: for the Law of
Nature containeth some generall Threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
as well as Precepts, (as I shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;)
Whether this Dueness of punishment,
which I call implicite, do arise from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the offence only, or also because of
this generall threat in the Law of Nature, I
will not dispute. But God dealeth with his
Creature by way of legall government? and
keepeth not their deserved punishment from
their knowledge no more then their duty;
it being almost as necessary to be known for
our incitement, as the Precept for our dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Gods laws are perfect laws fitted to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106762:35"/>
the attainment of all their ends: And by these
laws doth he rule the world; and according
to them doth he dispose of his rewards and
punishments: So that we need not fear that
which is not threatened: And in this sence
it is that I say, That what no law in force
doth threaten, that sin doth not explicitely
deserve: Not so deserve as that we need
to fear the suffering of it. And upon this
ground the three fore-mentioned consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
must needs follow. For the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
threateneth not Death to any sin but
final unbelief, or at least, to no sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
final unbelief: And therefore if the old
Covenant be abrogated, then no law threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth
it: And consequently, 1 Our Sin
doth not deserve it (in the sence expressed.)
Nor Christ prevent the wrath deserved, but
only the desert of wrath. 3. And therefore
not properly doth he pardon any such sin,
(as you will see after when I come to open the
nature of pardon.) 4 We may plead our non
deserving of death for our discharge at judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
5. And further, then Christ in satisfying
did not bear the punishment due to any sin
but <hi>Adams</hi> first: For that which is not threatened
to us, was not executed on him. This is a clear,
but an intolerable consequence. 6. Scripture
plainly teacheth, That all men (even the Elect)
are under the Law till they beleeve &amp; enter into
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106762:36"/>
the Covenant of the Gospel. Therefore it
is said, <hi>Ioh. 3. 18. He that beleeveth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
already:</hi> And <hi>the wrath of God abideth
on him,</hi> ver. 26. And we are said to beleeve
for Remission of sins. <hi>Acts 2. 38. Mark 1.
4. Luk. 24. 47. Act. 10. 43. &amp;</hi> 3. 19. Which
shew, that sin is not before remitted, and
consequently the Law not repealed, but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended,
and left to the dispose of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
Else how could the Redeemed be
by nature the children of wrath? <hi>Ehp.</hi> 2. 3.
The circumcised are debters to the whole
Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3, 4. and Christ is become
of none effect to them. But they that are
led by the Spirit are not under the law, and
against such there is no law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 18, 23.
The Scripture hath concluded all under Sin
(and so far under the Law no doubt) that
the promise, by faith in Jesus Christ, might
be given to them that beleeve. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. We
are under the Law when Christ doth redeem
us. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5. See also <hi>Iam. 2. 9, 10. 1 Tim. 18.
1 Cor. 15. 56. Gal.</hi> 3. 19, 20, 21. Therefore
our deliverance is conditionally from the
curse of the Law; <hi>viz.</hi> if we will obey the
Gospel. And this deliverance, together
with the abrogation of the Ceremonial
Law, is it which is so oft mentioned as a
priviledge of beleevers, and an effect of
the blood of Christ: which deliverance from
the curse, is yet more full when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106762:36"/>
form the Conditions of our freedom: And
then we are said to be dead to the Law. <hi>Rom.
7.</hi> 4. And the Obligation to punishment dead
as to us. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. But not the Law void or dead
in it self.</p>
                     <p>7 Lastly, All the Scriptures and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>pag.</hi> 60. 61. which prove, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
are punishments, do prove also,
that the Law is not repealed: For no man
can suffer for breaking a repealed Law, nor
by the threats of a repealed Law; yet I know
that this Covenant of Works continueth not
to the same ends and uses as before, nor is it
so to be preached or used. We must neither
take that Covenant as a way to life, as if now
we must get salvation by our fulfilling its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
nor must we look on its curse as lying
on us remedilesly.</p>

But either it is called the new Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                     <p>IF we understand not what Righteousnes is,
we may dispute long enough about Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to little purpose: you must know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Righteousness is no proper reall
Being, but a <hi>Modus Entis,</hi> the Modification of a
Being, The subject of it is, 1. An Action,
2. Or a Person: An Action is the primary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and so the Disposition; and the Person
secondary, as being therefore righteous,
because his disposition and actions are
so.</p>
                     <p>Righteousness is the conformity of Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106762:39"/>
and Actions, and consequently the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to the Rule prescribed.</p>
                     <p>It is not a being distinct therefore from the
Dispositions and Actions, but their just and
well being.</p>
                     <p>This finition is onely of the Creatures
Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>God is the <hi>Primum Iustum,</hi> and so the Rule
of Righteousness to the Creature, and hath
no Rule but himself, for the measuring of his
Actions.</p>
                     <p>Yet his Essence is too far above us, remote
and unknown to be this Rule to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
therefore hath he given us his Laws,
which flow from his perfection, and they
are the immediate Rule of our Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Actions and so of our Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>Here carefully observe, That this Law
hath two parts; 1. The Precept and Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
prescribing and requiring Duty: 2. The
Promise and Commination determining of
the reward of Obedience, and penalty of
Disobedience. As the Precept is the principall
part, and the Penalty annexed but for the
Precepts sake; so the primary intent of
the Law-giver is the obeying of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and our suffering of the Penalty is
but a secondary for the attaining of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                     <p>So is there accordingly a two-fold Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
or fulfilling of this Law, (which is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106762:40"/>
the thing I would have observed:) the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
most excellent and most proper Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
lyeth in the conformity of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the precept: The secondary, less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Righteousness) yet fitly enough so
called) (see <hi>Pemble</hi> of <hi>Iustificat. pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi>) is, when
though we have broke the precepts, yet we
have satisfied for our breach, either by our
own suffering, or some other way.</p>
                     <p>The first hath reference to the Commands
when none can accuse us to have broak the
Law: The second hath reference to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty;
when though we have broke the law, yet
it hath nothing against us for so doing, because
it is satisfyed. These two kinds of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
cannot stand together in the same person,
in regard of the same Law and Actions: he
that hath one, hath not the other: he that hath
the First, need not the Second; There must be
a fault, or no satisfaction; this fault must be
confessed, and so the first kind of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
disclaimed, before Satisfaction can be
pleaded: and Satisfaction must be pleaded,
before a Dilinquent can be justified. This well
understood, would give a clearer insight into
the nature of our Righteousness, and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
then many have yet attained. The great
Question is, of which sort is our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
whereby we are justified? I answer, of the
second sort, which yet is no derogation from
it: for though it be not a Righteousness so
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106762:40"/>
honouring our selves, yet is it as excellent in
Christ, and honourable to him. And this first
kinde of Righteousness as it is in Christ,
cannot retaining its own form, be made ours.
And to that the Papists arguments will hold
good. The Law commanded our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
obedience, and not another for us;
We did not so personally obey, we did not
really obey in Christ: and God doth not
judge us to do, what we did not; If we had,
yet it would not have made us just: for one sin
will make us unjust, though we were never so
obedient before and after; Therefore if we
had obeyed in Christ, and yet sinned in our
selves, we are breakers of the Law still. And so
our Righteousness cannot be of the first sort.
This Breach therefore must be satisfied for,
and consequently, our Righteousness must
be of the second sort: seeing both cannot
stand in one person as beforesaid. Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
had both these kinds of righteousness,
<hi>viz.</hi> the righteousness of perfect Obedience;
and the righteousness of Satisfaction, for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.
But the former only was his own
personall Righteousnes, not communicable to
another under that notion, and in that form of
[a Righteousness by obeying:] The latter,
was his righteousness, as he stood in our room,
and was by imputation a sinner: and so is also
our Righteousness in and through him. Yet
the former (as I have proved before &amp;c.) is ours
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106762:41"/>
too, and our Righteousness too (though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Divines think otherwise:) but how? Not as
retaining its form, in the former sence: but
as it is also in a further consideration, a part of
the Righteousness by Satisfaction: seeing that
Christs very personall obedientiall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was also in a further respect satisfactory.
I intreat thee Reader, do not pass over this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
representation of Righteousness, as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or needless; for thou canst not tell how
thou art righteous or justified without it. Nor
do thou through prejudice reject it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound,
till thou have first well studied the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Righteousness in generall, and of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Righteousness in speciall.</p>

the externall part of the Morall Law, that no

                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. There are degrees of Sin. He
that is not yet a sinner in the highest degree, is
he not so far Righteous by a personall Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness?
Christ satisfied only for our sin; so
far as our actions are not sinfull, so far they
need no pardon nor satisfaction. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
Christs righteousness and our own
works, do concur to the composing of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteousness. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
doth puzle some, as if there were
no escaping this Popish self-exalting Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
yet by the help of the fore-going
grounds, the vanity of it may be easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
And that thus.</p>
                     <p>1. An Action is not righteous, which is
not conformable to the Law; if in some res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
it be conformable, and in some not, it
cannot be called a conformable or righteous
Action. So that we having no actions, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly:
conformed to the Law, have therefore
no one righteous action. 2. If we had; Yet
many righteous Actions, if but one were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
will not serve to denominate the
person Righteous, according to the Law of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106762:42"/>
Works. And that these joyned with Christs
Righteousness, do not make up one Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for us, is plainthus; The Righteousness
which we have in Christ, is not of the same sort
witht his pretended partial Righteousness: For
this pretendeth to be a Righteousness (in part)
of the first kinde mentioned formerly <hi>viz.</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiall
consisting in conformity to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
Now, Christs Righteousness imputed to
us, being only that of the second sort (<hi>viz.</hi> By
satisfaction for nonconformity, or for our
disobedience,) cannot therefore possible be
joyned with our imperfect Obedience, to
make up one Righteousness for us. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that some actions of ours, may in
some respects be good, though that respect
cannot denominate it (strictly in the sence
of the old Covenant) a good Work. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
also, that so far it is pleasing to
God: yet the Action cannot be said to please
him (much less the person,) but only that
respective Goodness. Also that Christ dyed
only to satisfie for our actions so far as they
were sinfull, and not in those respects wherein
they are good and lawfull. Yet that these
good works (so commonly called) can be
no part of our Righteousness, I think is
fully proved by the fore-going Argument.
Though I much question, whether they that
stand for the imputation of Christs moral
Righteousness in the rigid rejected sence (as if
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106762:43"/>
(as if in him we had paid the primary proper
debt of perfect obedience) can so well rid
their hands of this objection.</p>

at the expressions, as if they had conteined
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106762:43"/>
some self-exalting horrid doctrine; I shall say
somthing hereto, Though for my part, I do
so much wonder that any able Divines should
deny them: that me thinks they should be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of our Creed, and a part of Childrens
Catechisms, and understood and believed
by every man that is a Christian: I mean the
matter of them, if not the Phrase; though I
think it to be agreeable to the matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</p>
                     <p>That there may be no contention about
words, you must take my phrase of <hi>[Legall and
Evangelicall Righteousness]</hi> in the sence before
explained, <hi>viz.</hi> as they take their name from
that Covenant which is their rule, and I know
not how any righteousness should be called
[Legall or Evangelicall in a sence more strict
and proper, nor whence the denomination
can be better taken then from the formall
reason of the thing: Yet I know that the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Law of Ceremonies, and the seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of life by the works of the Law, are both
commonly called Legall Righteousness, but in
a very improper sence in a comparison of this.
I know also that Christs Legall Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
imputed to us is commonly called
[Evangelicall Righteousness,] but that is
from a more aliene extrinsecall respect; to
wit, because the Gospel declareth and offereth
this Righteousness, and because it is a way to
Justification, which only the Gospel revea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106762:44"/>
I do not quarrel with any of these forms
of speech, only explain my own, which I knew
not how to express more properly, that I be
not mis-understood. The Righteousness of
the new Covenant then being, the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of its conditions, and its conditions
being our obeying the Gospel or beleeving,
it must needs be plain, That on no other terms
do we partake of the Legal Righteousness of
Christ. To affirm therefore that our Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
or new Covenant-Righteousness is in
Christ and not in our selves, or performed by
Christ and not by our selves, is such a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
piece of Antinomian doctrine, that no
man who knows the nature and difference of
the Covenant can possibly entertain, and which
every Christian should abhor as unsufferable.</p>
                     <p>For 1. It implyeth blasphemy against
Christ, as if he had sin to repent of, or pardon
to accept, and a Lord that redeemed him to
receive and submit to; for these are the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the new Covenant.</p>
                     <p>2. It implyeth, that Jews, and Pagans, and
every man shall be saved. Do not say that I
odiously wring out these consequences; they
are as plain as can be expected: For if any be
damned, it must be either for breaking the
first Covenant or the second: If the former be
charged upon him, he may escape by pleading
the second fulfilled: If the latter, the same
plea will serve; so that if Christ have fulfilled
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106762:44"/>
both Covenants for all men, then none can
perish. If they say, that he hath performed the
new Covenant conditions only for the elect;</p>
                     <p>3. Then this followeth howsoever, That
they are righteous, and justified before they
beleeve, (which what Scripture doth speak?)</p>
                     <p>4. And that beleeving is needless, not only
as to our Justification, but to any other use:
For what need one thing be so twice done? If
Christ have fulfilled the new Covenant for us,
as well as the old, what need we do it again?
Shall we come after him to do the work he hath
perfected? Except we would think with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,
and as Sir <hi>Kenolm Digby,</hi> That Christ
was but our pattern to follow, and but set
us a copy in obeying according to right
Reason.</p>
                     <p>5. That the saved and the damned are alike
in themselves, but the difference is only in
Election, and Christs intention. For the saved
have broke the old Covenant, as well as the
damned; and if it be not they, but Christ, that
fulfill their conditions of the new, then the
difference is all without them.</p>
                     <p>6. It confoundeth Law and Gospel, it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthroweth
all the Laws &amp; Precepts of Christ,
by removing their end, it contradicteth the
whole scope of the Scripture, which telleth us,
That Christ was made under the Law, (&amp; not
under the Gospel,) fulfilled the Law, (but not
the Gospel Covenant) bore the curse of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106762:45"/>
(but not of the Gospel,) and which imposeth
a necessity of fulfilling the conditions of the
Gospel themselves upon all that will be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and saved. To quote the Scriptures that
assert this, would be to transcribe almost all
the doctrinall part of the New Testament.
What unsavory stuff then is that of Mr. <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marsh,</hi>
of free Grace, <hi>pag.</hi> 83. 84. Who direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
those that doubt of their Gospel sincerity
to see it in Christ, because Christ hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
perfectly, he hath sorrowed for sin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
he hath repented perfectly, he hath
obeyed perfectly, he hath mortisied sin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
and all is ours, &amp;c. If this be meant of
Gospel-beleeving, repenting, sorrowing, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and mortifying, then it is no uncharitable
language to say, It is blasphemy in its clear
consequence; as if Christ had a Saviour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in for pardon and life, or sin to repent
of, and sorrow for, and mortifie: But if he
meant it of legall beleeving in God, or repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sorrowing for, mortifying of sin in us, and
not in himself; then is it no more to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he hath in hand then a Harp to a Harrow,
as they say, It is not legall beleeving, which is
the evidence doubted of, or enquired after;
and sure Christs repenting and sorrowing for
our sin, is no clearing to us, that we repent of
our own, nor any acquitting of us for not
doing it: And for his mortifying sin in us,
that is the doubt, whether it be done in the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106762:45"/>
doubting soul or not? If he mean it of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the guilt of sin meritoriously on the
Cross, that is but a strange evidence of the
death of it in a particular soul: except he
think (as divers that I met with in <hi>Glocester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>

sprung up among us, who think all things be
but one; and those branches or beams of Gods
Essence, which had their Being in him before
their Creation, and shall at their dissolution
return into God again; and so the souls of
men are but so many parcels of God given out
into so many bodies; or at least but beams
streaming from him by a fancyed Emanation.
These men will say, not only that it is Christ
in us that doth beleeve, but the meer God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
in essence considered. But it sufficeth
sober men to beleeve that Christ dwelleth in
us; 1. By his graces or spirituall workings: 2.
By our constant love to him, and thinking of
him: as the person or thing that we are still
affectionately thinking on, is said to dwell in
our mindes or hearts (because their <hi>idea</hi> is still
there,) or our mindes and hearts to dwell
upon them. But in regard of the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
which is every where, as it dwells no
otherwise (for ought I know or have seen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
in the Saints, then in the wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;
so I think; as Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> thinks of
the Soul; That the Body is more properly
said to be in the Soul, then the Soul in the
Body, so we are more properly said to live,
and move &amp; have our Being in God, then God
to live, and move, and have his Being in us.</p>

                     <p>That men are sometime called righteous,
in reference to the Laws and Judgments of
men, I acknowledge: Also in regard of some
of their particular actions, which are for the
substance good: And perhaps sometimes in
a comparative sense, as they are compared
with the ungodly: As a line less-crooked
should be called streight in comparison of
one more crooked: But how improper an
expression that is, you may easily perceive.
The ordinary phrase of Scripture hath more
truth and aptitude then so. Therefore it must
needs be that men are called Righteous in
reference to the new Covenant only; Which
is plain thus: Righteousness is but the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of our actions or persons, as they
relate to some rule. This rule when it is the
Law of man, and our actions suit thereto, we
are then righteous before men. When this
Rule is Gods Law, it is either that of Works,
or that of Grace: In relation to the former,
there is none righteous, no not one: for all
have sinned, and come short of the glory of
God. Only in Christ, who hath obeyed and
satisfied, we are righteous. But if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
our actions and persons in relation to
the rule of the new Covenant, so all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
are personally righteous, because
they all perform the conditions of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106762:47"/>
and are poperly ponounced righteous
thereby. Neither can it be conceived how
the works of Beleevers, should either please
God, or be called righteousness, as they relate
to that old Rule, which doth pronounce
them unrighteous, hatefull, and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                     <p>Two sorts among us therefore do discover
intolerable Ignorance in this point. 1. Those
that commonly use and understand the words
[Righteous, and Righteousness] as they relate
to the old Rule: as if the Godly were called
righteous (besides their imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
only because their Sanctification and
good Works have some imperfect agreement
to the Law of Works: As if it were a streight
line which is in one place streight and another
crooked; much less that which is in every part
crooked in some degree, I have been sorry
to hear many learned Teachers speak thus;
most they say to maintain it, is in this simple
objection. If we are called holy, because of
an imperfect Holiness: then why not righteous,
because of an imperfect Righteousness? <hi>Ans.</hi>
Holiness signifieth no more but a Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to God, either by separation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or by qualifying the subject first, with
an aptitude to its Divine imployment,
and then separating or devoting it: as in
our Sanctification. Now a person im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly
so qualified, is yet truly and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106762:48"/>
really so qualified; and therefore may truly
be called holy so far. But Righteousness signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
a Conformity to the Rule; and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
with a <hi>quatenus,</hi> or an imperfect Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
being not a true Conformity or Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
at all (because the denomination is of
the whole Action or Person, and not of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
part or respect therefore imperfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
is not Righteousness, but Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
It is a contradiction in <hi>adjecto. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
But, is our personal Righteousness per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as it is measured by the New Rule? <hi>Ans.</hi>
Yes: as I shall open to you by and by.</p>
                     <p>I could here heap up a mulitude of ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Writers, that do call our personall Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
by the title of [Evangelicall] as sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
from what Rule it doth receive its
Name.</p>
                     <p>The second sort that shew their gross igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
of the nature of Righteousness, are the
Antinomians, (and some other simple ones
whom they have misled) who if they doe but
hear a man talk of a Righteousness in himself;
or in any thing he can do, or making his own
duty either his Righteousness, or conducible
thereto; they startle at such Doctrine, and
even gnash the teeth, as if we preached flat
Popery, yea as if we cryed down Christ, and
set up our selves: The ignorant wretches not
understanding, the difference between the
two sorts of Righteousness; that of the old
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106762:48"/>
Covenant, which is all out of us in Christ;
and that of the New Covenant, which is all
out of Christ in our selves: (though wrought
by the power of the Spirit of Christ.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> But how then is <hi>Ahabs</hi> and <hi>Nineve's</hi>
humiliation accepted, and such other works
of those that are not in Christ, seeing they are
yet under the Law?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. No man is now under the Law as
<hi>Adam</hi> was before the new Covenant was made;
that is, not so under the Law alone, as to
have nothing to do with the Gospel; or so
under the old Covenant, as to have no benefit
by the new. 2. So that wicked men may now
find that tender and mercifull dealing from
God, that even those works which are less
unjust and sinfull, and draw neerest to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude
required by the Gospel, shall be so far
accepted as that, for their further encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
some kind of reward or suspension
of wrath shall be annexed to them, and God
will countenance in them that which is good,
though it be not so much as may denominate
it a good work. 3. But yet the best of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
mans works have more matter in
them to provoke God then to please him,
and he never accepteth them as Evangelically
Righteous; for they that are in the flesh, and
are without faith, cannot possibly so please
God, <hi>Rom. 8. 8. Heb.</hi> 11. 6. As their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is but a less degree of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106762:49"/>
and therefore is most improperly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
righteousness; so their pleasing God is
but a lower degree of displeasing him,
and therefore but improperly called plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him.</p>

from what is said before, that I need to
add no more to prove it. For 1. I have
cleared before, that there must be a personall
Righteousness, besides that imputed, in all
that are justified. And that 2. The fulfilling
of the conditions of each Covenant is our
Righteousness, in reference to that Covenant:
But Faith is the fulfilling of the conditions of
the new Covenant, therefore it is our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
in relation to that Covenant. I do
not here take Faith for any one single Act, but
as I shall afterward explain it.</p>

                        <hi>Quest.</hi> In what sence then is Faith said to be

Righteousness it self?</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Plainly thus; Man is become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
by breaking the Law of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that was given him; Christ fully satisfieth
for this transgression, and buyeth the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
into his own hands, and maketh with
them a new Covenant, That whosoever will
accept of him, and beleeve in him, who hath
thus satisfied, it shall be as effectual for their
Justification, as if they had fulfilled the Law of
Works themselves. A Tenant forfeiteth his
Lease to his Landlord, by not paying his rent;
he runs deep in debt to him, and is disabled to
pay him any more rent for the future, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he is put out of his house, and cast into
prison, till he pay the debt; his Landlords son
payeth it for him, taketh him out of prison,
and putteth him in his house again, as his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
having purchased house and all to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
he maketh him a new Lease in this Tenor,
that paying but a pepper corn yearly to him,
he shall be acquit both from his debt, and from
all other rent for the future, which by his old
Lease was to be paid; yet doth he not cancel
the old Lease, but keepeth it in his hands to
put in suite against the Tenant, if he should
be so foolish as to deny the payment of the
pepper corn. In this case the payment of the
grain of pepper is imputed to the Tenant, as
if he had payed the rent of the old Lease: Yet
this imputation doth not extoll the pepper
corn, nor vilifie the benefit of his Benefactor,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106762:50"/>
who redeemed him: Nor can it be said, that the
purchase did only serve to advance the value
and efficacy of that grain of pepper. But
thus; A personall rent must be paid for the
testification of his homage; he was never redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be independent as his own Landlord
and Master: the old rent he cannot pay; his new
Landlords clemency is such, that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
this grain shall serve the turn.</p>
                     <p>Do I need to apply this in the present case
or cannot every man apply it? Even so is our
Evangelicall Righteousness, or Faith, imputed
to us for as reall Righteousness, as perfect
Obedience. Two things are considerable in
this debt of Righteousness; The value, and the
personall performance or interest: The value
of Christs Satisfaction is imputed to us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the value of a perfect Obedience of
our own performing, and the value of our
Faith is not so imputed: But because there
must be some personall performance of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
therefore the personall performance of
Faith shall be imputed to us for a sufficient
personall payment, as if we had paid the full
rent, because Christ whom we believe in, hath
paid it, &amp; he will take this for satisfactory ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
so it is in point of personall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and not of value that Faith is imputed.</p>

either in regard of the matter and the
acts denominated righteous, or else in
respect of the form which gives them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination:
Also our Faculties and Actions
are considerable, either in regard of their
Being, or of their Quality.</p>
                     <p>1. The perfection of the Being of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
or Acts is nothing to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as falling under a physicall consideration
only.</p>
                     <p>2. In regard of their Quality they may
be called perfect or imperfect in severall
sences.</p>
                     <p>1 As Perfection is taken for the transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
perfection of Being so they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                     <p>2. And as it is taken for the compleat
number of all parts, it is perfect.</p>
                     <p>3. But as it is taken for that which is
perfect, <hi>Efficienter</hi> or <hi>Participaliter,</hi> that is, for a
work that is finished for the Author, so our
holiness is still imperfect here.</p>
                     <p>4. And as it is taken for accidentall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
(so called in Metaphysicks, when it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106762:51"/>
wants nothing which beyond the Essence, is
also requisite to the integrity, ornament and
well being of it,) so our holiness is here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</p>
                     <p>5. As perfection is taken, <hi>pro sanitate,</hi> for
soundness, so our holiness is imperfect.</p>
                     <p>6. And as it is taken, <hi>pro maturitate,</hi> for
ripeness, so it is imperfect.</p>
                     <p>7. In respect of the admixture of contrary
qualities, our holiness is imperfect.</p>
                     <p>8. But whether all this imperfection be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
and sinfull, or meerly negative; and only
our misery, whether it be a privation, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
or morall, is a question that will be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
when I come to shew the extent of the
Commands or Rule.</p>
                     <p>But not any of these kinds of perfection is
that which I mean in the Position: Holiness is a
quality, &amp; may be intended and remitted, in
creased &amp; decreased; but it is the relative consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of these qualities of our faculties and
acts, as they are compared with the Rule of the
new Covenant; &amp; so it is not the perfection of
our holiness that we enquire after, but of our
righteousness; which righteousness is not a
quality as holiness is, but the modification of
our acts as to the Rule, which is not varyed,
<hi>secundum majus &amp; minus:</hi> See <hi>Schibl. Metaph.
li. 2, c. 9. Tit. 7. Art.</hi> 2. Therefore our Divines
usually say, That our Justification is perfect,
though our Sanctification be not; and then
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106762:51"/>
I am sure our Righteousness must be perfect.</p>
                     <p>A two-fold perfection is here implyed. 1.
A Metaphysical Perfection of Being. 2. A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Sufficiency in order to its end.</p>
                     <p>1. The being of our Righteousness formally
consisting in our relative conformity to the
rule, either it must be perfect, or not at all.
He that is not perfectly innocent in the very
point that he is accused, is not innocent tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but guilty. Sincerity is usually said to be
our Gospel-Perfection: not as it is accepted
in stead of perfection, but as it is truly so; for
sincere Faith is our conformity to the Rule of
Perfection, <hi>viz.</hi> the new Covenant as it is a
Covenant; yet as it is sincere Faith, it is only
materially our Righteousness and Perfection,
but formally as it is relatively our conformity
to the said Rule.</p>
                     <p>2. Our Righteousness is perfect as in its
Being, so also in order to its end. The end is,
to be the condition of our Justification, &amp;c.
This end it shall perfectly attain. The Tenor
of the new Covenant is not, <hi>Believe in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree, and you shall be justified;</hi> But <hi>believe
sincerely, and you shall be justified;</hi> so that our
Righteousness 1. formally considered, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the condition of the new Covenant,
is perfect or none. 2. But considered mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially
as it is holiness, either in reference to
the degree it should attain, or the degree
which it shall attain, or in reference to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106762:52"/>
excellent object which it is excercised about,
or in reference to the old Covenant, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective,
(and in some sence) the preceptive part
of the new Covenant; in all these respects it is
imperfect.</p>
                     <p>I speak not all this while of that perfection
in Christs Satisfaction, which is also our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteousness, because few will question
the perfection of that.</p>

                     <p>1. IT is improper in the best sence: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is contrary to the Scripture
use of the word [<hi>Iustifying</hi>]: which is
the acquitting of us from the charge of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Law, and not from the charge of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the new Covenant, 2, It is against the
nature of the thing; seeing Justification (as you
shall see anon) implyeth Accusation; but
the esteeming of a righteous action to be as
it is, doth not imply any accusation. 3. This
speech, joyning Justification of Persons and
Actions together, doth seem to intimate the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106762:52"/>
same kinde of justification of both, and so
doth tend to seduce the hearers to a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
error. 2. For if it be understood in the
worst sence, it will overthrow the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ imputed, and the whole scope of
the Gospell, and will set up the doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by Works. For if God do justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our Works from any legall Accusation, (as
he doth our persons,) then it will follow, That
our Works are just and consequently we are
to be justified by them. There is no room
for Scripture-justification where our own
Works are not first acknowledged unjusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable:
because there is no place for Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Justification thereby from another,
where we plead the Justification of our own
Works in respect of the same Law. Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Works is a sufficient ground for Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Works: seeing the justness of his

strict sence, be said to merit the reward: seeing there
is nothing in the value of it, or any benefit that
God receiveth by it, which may so entitle it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106762:53"/>
meritorious; neither is there any proportion betwixt
it and the reward. (2) But in a larger fence, as
Promise is an Obligation, and the thing promised is
called Debt; so the performers of the Condition are
called Worthy, and their performance Merit. Though
properly it is all of Grace, and not of Debt. (1) Rom.

                     <p>IN the strictest sence he is said to Merit, who perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
somewhat of that worth in it self to another,
which bindeth that other in strict justice to requite
him. This work must not be due, and so the performer
not under the absolute soveraignty of another? for else
he is not in a capacity of thus Meriting. It is naturall
Justice which here bindeth to Reward. All that we can
merit at the hands of Gods naturall Justice is but these
two things. 1. The escape of punishment in that respect
or consideration wherein our actions are not sinfull: or
the not punishing of us in a greater degree then sin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves:
(Though indeed it is questionable whether we
are capable of suffering more.) 2. Our actions thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the honour of acknowledgment of that good which
is in them; yea, though the evil be more then the good.
As a merciful Thief that gives a poor man half his mony
again, when he hath robbed him, as he deserveth a less
degree of punishment, so that good which was in his
action deserveth an answerable acknowledgment and
praise, though he dye for the fact.</p>
                     <p>But this is a poor kinde of meriting, and little to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106762:53"/>
honour or benefit of the party: And is more properly
called a less desert of punishment, then a desert of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>2. The second kind of Merit, is that whereby a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
for the promoting of the ends of Government,
is obliged to reward the Obedience of the Governed:
That when Disobedience is grown common, the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may be encouraged, and a difference made. Among
men even Justice bindeth to such reward; at least to
afford the obedience the benefit of protection and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
though he do no more then his duty: But that is
because no man hath an absolute soveraignty <hi>de jure</hi> over
his subjects, as God hath; but is indebted to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as well as they are to him. If our obedience were
perfect, in respect of the Law of Works, yet all the
Obligation that would lie upon God to reward us (any
further then the foresaid forbearing to punish us, and
acknowledging our obedience) would be but his own
wisdom; as he discerneth such a Reward would tend to
the well-governing of the World, working morally with
voluntary agents agreeable to their natures. And when
we had done all, we must say, we are unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
we have done nothing but what was our duty.
Therefore this Obligation to reward from the wisdom
of God, as it is in his own brest known to himself alone,
so is it drawn from himself, and not properly from the
worth of our Works, and therefore this is improperly
called Merit.</p>
                     <p>3. The third kinde of Meriting is sufficiently explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Position: where the Obligation to reward, is
Gods ordinate Justice, and the truth of his Promise: and
the worthiness lieth in our performance of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on our part. This is improperly called Merit: This
kinde of Meriting is no diminution to the greatness or
freeness of the gift or reward: because it was a free and
gracious Act of God to make our performance capable
of that title; and to engage himself in the foresaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to us; and not for any gain that he expected by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106762:54"/>
us, or that our performance can bring him.</p>

                     <p>THerefore it is one thing to ask, whether
the Covenant of Works be abolished?
and another thing, whether the Morall
Law be abolished? Yet that no one Precept
of either Morall or Ceremoniall Law was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
without reference to one of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
is very evident. For if the breach of
that Command be a sin, and to be punished,
then either according to the rigorous threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
of the old Covenant, or according to
the way and justice of the new. For the Law,
as it was delivered by <hi>Moses,</hi> may be reduced
in several respects to each of these Covenants,
and cannot constitute a third Covenant, wholy
distinct from both these; and therefore <hi>Camero</hi>
doth more fitly call it a subservient Covenant,
then a third Covenant. For either God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in that Covenant to proceed with sinners
in strict rigor of Justice, for every sin; and
then it is reducible to the first Covenant: Or
else to pardon sin upon certain conditions,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106762:55"/>
and to dispence with the rigor of that first
Covenant: And then it must imply satisfaction
for those sins; and so be reducible to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Covenant: (For I cannot yet digest the
Doctrine of <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Vossius,</hi> concerning sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction

without subordination to the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

to savour of the language of the severall
Covenants, (as indeed it doth;) that is because
they are yet both in force; and in severall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
it is reducible to both. So that when
we demand, whether the Morall Law do yet
binde, the question is ambiguous, from the
ambiguity of the term [Binde.] For it is one
thing to ask, whether it binde upon the old
Covenant terms? another, whether upon new
Covenant terms? and a third, whether as a

                     <p>1 <hi>Quest.</hi> How could the Precepts delivered

                  <p>THere is no sin prohibited in the Gospel which is
not a breach of some Precept in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue:
and which is not threatned by the Covenant
of Works, as offending against, and so falling under
the Iustice thereof. For the threatening of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
extendeth to all sin that then was, or after
should be forbidden. God still reserved the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
of adding to his Laws, without altering the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
terms; else every new Precept would imply a
new Covenant: And so there should be a multitude of
Covenants.</p>
                  <div type="explanation">
                     <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
                     <p>1. THough the Decalogue doth not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
each particular duty in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
yet doth it command obedience
to all that are or shall be specified; and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the <hi>genus</hi> of every particular duty. And
though it were not a duty from the generall
precept, till it was specified in the Gospel, yet
when it once is a duty, the neglect of it is a sin
against the Decalogue. For instance; The
Law saith, Thou shalt take the Lord for thy
God, and consequently beleeve all that he
saith to be true; and obey him in all that he
shall particularly command you: The Gospel
revealeth (what it is that is to be beleeved, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106762:56"/>
saith, <hi>This is the work of God, that ye beleeve in him
whom the Father hath sent. Ioh.</hi> 6. 28, 29. The
affirmative part of the second Commandment
is, Thou shalt worship God according to his
own institution: The Gospell specifieth some
of this instituted Worship, <hi>viz.</hi> Sacraments, &amp;c.
So that the neglect of Sacraments is a breach
of the second Commandment: And Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
is a breach of the first. This may help
you to answer that question, Whether the
Law without the Gospell be a sufficient Rule
of Life? <hi>Answ.</hi> As the Lords Prayer is a
sufficient Rule of Prayer: It is sufficient in its
own kinde, or to its own purposes: It is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
generall Rule for duty; but it doth not
enumerate all the particular instituted spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
Yet here, the Gospell revealing these
institutions, is not only the new Covenant it
self; but the doctrine of Christ, which is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
of that Covenant also.</p>
                     <p>2. That every sin against the precepts of
the Gospell and decalogue, are also sins against
the Covenant of Works, and condemned by
it, will appear thus. 1. The threatening of that
Covenant is against all sin, as well as one,
(though none but eating the forbidden fruit
be named:) But these are sins; and therefore
threatned by that Covenant. The major ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the recitall afterwards; Cursed is he
that doth not al things written. 2. I have proved
before, that the old Covenant is not repealed,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106762:57"/>
but onely relaxed to Beleevers upon Christs
satisfaction; And then it must needs be in
force against every sin. 3. The penalty in that
Covenant is still executed against such sins.
So that every sin against the Gospel is a breach
of the Conditions of the Law of Works: But
every sin against that Law, is not a breach of
the Conditions of the Gospel. And it hinders
not this, That the Morall Law by <hi>Moses,</hi> and
the Gospel by Christ, were delivered since the
Covenant with <hi>Adam.</hi> For though that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
did not specifie each duty and sin: yet
it doth condemn the sin when it is so speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
But the great Objection is this: How
can Unbelief be a breach of the Covenant of
Works, when the very duty of beleeving for
pardon is inconsistent with the Tenor of that
Covenant, which knoweth no pardon? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.
Pardon of sin is not so contradictory to the
truth of that Covenant, but that they may
consist upon satisfaction made. Though it is
true, that the Covenant it self doth give no
hopes of it; yet it doth not make it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
2. Unbelief, in respect of pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
is a Sin against the Covenant of Works,
not <hi>formaliter,</hi> but <hi>eminenter.</hi> 3. Not also as it
is the neglect of a duty, with such and such
ends and uses, but as it is the neglect of duty
in the generall considered; and so as it is a sin
in generall, and not as it is a sin consisting in
such or such an act or omission. The form of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106762:57"/>
the sin lieth in its pravity or deviation from
the Rule: So far Unbelief is condemned by
the Law: The substrate act is but the matter,
(improperly so called.)</p>
                     <p>The review of the comparison before lay'd
down will explain this to you: A Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
a Lordship upon a Slave, and maketh
him a Lease of it, the tenor where of is, That
he shall perform exact obedience to all that is
commanded him; and when he fails of this,
he shall forfeit his Lease: The Tenant diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth,
and maketh the forfeiture; The Son
of this Prince interposeth, and buyeth the
Lordship, and satisfieth for all the damage
that came by the Tenants disobedience: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon
the Land and Tenant and Lease are
all delivered up to him, and he becomes Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord.
He findeth the Tenant (upon his forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
dispossessed of the choycest rooms of
the house, and chief benefits of the Land, and
confined to a ruinous corner; and was to have
been deprived of all, had not he thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
Whereupon he maketh him a new Lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e
in this Tenor, That if in acknowledgment of
the favour of his Redemption, he will but pay
a pepper corn, he shall be restored to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
possession, and much more.</p>
                     <p>In this case now the non-payment of the
pepper corn, is a breach of both Leases: Of
the old, because though he had forfeited his
title to the benefits of it, yet he could not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106762:58"/>
disanull the duty of it, which was obedience
during his life: especially when the penalty was
not fully executed on him, but he was permitted
still to enjoy some of the benefits. So that as it
is an act of disobedience in generall, his non-payment
is a further forfeiture of his old Lease:
But as it is the non-payment of a pepper-corn
required of him in stead of his former Rent,
so it is a breach of his new Lease only. Even
so is Unbelief a violation of both Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>

                     <p>THat the Morall Law is yet in force, I will
not stand to prove, because so many
have written of it already. See Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
Burgesses</hi> Lectures: But to what ends, and
in what sence the Gospell continueth that Law,
and commandeth perfect obedience thereto,
is a Question not very easie.</p>
                     <p>1. Whether Christ did first repeall that Law,
and then re-establish it to other ends? So some
think.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:106762:58"/>
2. Or whether he hath at all made the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Law to be the preceptive part of the new
Covenant? And so whether the new Covenant
do at all command us perfect obedience? or
only sincere?</p>
                     <p>3. Or whether the Morall Law be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
only as the precepts of the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and so used by the new Covenant, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for a directive Rule?</p>
                     <p>To the first I answer; 1. That it is not repealed
at all I have proved already, even concerning
the Covenant of Works it self; and others
enough have proved at large of the Morall
Law. 2. Yet that Christ useth it to other ends,
&amp; for the advantage of his Kingdom, I grant.</p>
                     <p>To the other second Question, I answer;
1. That the Morall Law, as it is the perceptive
part of the Covenant of works, is but delivered
over into the hands of Christ, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the sence before expressed, seems plain
to me.</p>
                     <p>2. That the same Morall Law doth there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
so continue to command even believers
and that the perfect obeying of it is therefore
their duty, and the not obeying their sin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the death threatened in that Covenant.</p>
                     <p>3. That Jesus Christ hath further made use
of the same Morall Law, for a direction to his
Subjects, whereby they may know his Will.
That whereas your sincere subjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Christ, is part of the condition of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106762:59"/>
new Covenant; that we may know what his
Will is, which we must endeavour to obey, and
what Rule our actions must be sincerely fitted
to, and guided by, he hath therefore left us
this Morall Law as part of this direction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
added a more particular enumeration of
some duties in his Gospel. That as when the
old Covenant said, Thou shalt obey perfectly;
the Morall Law did Partly tell them, wherein
they should obey: So when the new Covenant
saith, Thou shalt obey sincerely; the Morall
Law doth tell us, wherein, or what we must
endeavour to do.</p>
                     <p>4. But that the Morall Law, without respect
to either Covenant, should command us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
obedience; or that Christ, as the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the new Covenant, should command
us not only sincere, but also perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Morall Law, and so hath made it a
proper part of his Gospel, not only as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory
and Instruction, but also as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
I am not yet convinced, (though I will
not contend with any that think otherwise,)
my Reason is, because I know not to what end
Christ should command us that obedience
which he never doth enable any man in this
life to perform. If it were to convince us of
our disability and sin, that is the work of the
Law, and the continuing of it upon the old
terms, as is before explained, is sufficient to
that.</p>

Covenant, which are not also against the old; or
if any sins be considerable in any of their respects, as

to satisfie for any such sins so considered: For where
no death is threatened, there none is explicitely due,
nor should be executed; and where it is not so due to
the sinner, nor should have been executed on him,
there it could not be required of Christ, nor executed
on him: But the Gospel threateneth not death to any
sin, but final unbelief and rebellion, (and for that
Christ never dyed, as I shall shew anon,) therefore
Christ died not for any sin as against the Gospell, nor
suffered that which is no where threatened.</p>

                     <p>A Sin may be said to be against the Gospel,
1. As Christ and his Gospel are the object
of it; 2. Or as it breaketh the conditions
of the Gospel: In the latter sence only I here
take it. To prove the point in hand, there
needs no more then the Argument mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
For to all that unbelief, and other sins of
the godly, which are forgiven, the Gospel
doth no where threaten death; and therefore
Christ could not bear it, as to satisfie the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-threatening.
Though I confess I have been

                     <p>THat Christ did not fulfill the conditions
of the new Covenant for us: I have proved
already: That he hath not satisfied for its
violation, I think to the considerate will need
no proof: If you think otherwise, consider, 1.
Christ is said to be made under the Law, &amp; to
have born the curse of the Law, &amp; to have freed
us from the curse of it, but no where is this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
of him in respect of the Gospel.
2. There be terms by him propounded upon
which men must partake of the benefits of
his Satisfaction; but these terms are onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the new Covenant, therefore he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
satisfied for the non-performance of those
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106762:60"/>
conditions. 3. If he did, upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
is that satisfaction enjoyed by us?
4. But the Question is out of doubt, because
that every man that performeth not the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-conditions,
doth bear the punishment
himself in eternall fire, and therefore Christ did
not bear it: So that as it was not so grievous
a death which was threatened in the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
as that is which is threatened in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
so it was not so grievous a kind of death
which Christ did bear, as that is which finall
unbelievers shall bear, (except as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of sins of so many might increase it,)
Therefore when we say, That Christ suffered
in his Soul the pains of hell, or that which is
equall; we must not mean the pains which is
threatned in the Gospell, and the damned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers
must endure; but only of that death
which the Law of Works did threaten. Wo
therefore to the rebellious unbelieving world,
that must bear this second death themselves:
For of how much soever punishment shall
they be thought worthy, who tread under
foot the blood of the Covenant? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.</p>

1. Both because the punishment, which

But specially because the old Covenant condemning
all sin, is yet unrepealed, which would be executed

the efficacy of CHRISTS Satisfaction dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose,

                     <p>THe true definition of Pardon, and of
Justification doth much conduce to the
understanding of this whole mysterious
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106762:62"/>
Doctrine. The former I have here laid down
as neer as I can. I shall briefly explain the
whole Definition,</p>
                     <p>1. I call it an <hi>Act of God;</hi> for so the
Scripture ordinarily doth. <hi>Mat. 6. 12. 14, 15.
Mar. 11. 24. 26. Luk. 23. 34. Ephes.</hi> 3. 32. Some
may object; If all things be delivered into the
hands of Christ the Redeemer, and all Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
committed to the Son, as is shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
then the Son should forgive rather then
the Father. I answer. 1. So the Son is said
to forgive also, <hi>Mar. 2. 7, 10. Luk.</hi> 5. 24. 2. I
shewed you before, That the Father giveth
not away any power from himself by giving it
to the Son; but onely doth manage it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way upon other terms. 3. As the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
is a middle person, interposing between
God and the world for their reconciliation, so
the Acceptance, Pardon and Kingdom
of the Mediator, is, as it were a Mean or
step towards the Pardon, Acceptance, and
Kingdom of God. First Christ doth
cleanse men by his Spirit, and Blood, and
then offereth them blameless and undefiled,
without spot or wrinkle to God, who so
accepts them at his hands, and even the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
also will he deliver up to the Father,
<hi>Ephes. 5. 27. Col. 1. 22, 28. Iude 24. 1 Cor. 15.
24.</hi> Therefore the Sons pardoning and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
being first in order of Nature, and so
but a mean to Gods pardoning and accepting
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106762:62"/>
where the whole work is compleatly perfected,
(when the sinner is fully brought home by
Christ to God, from whom he first fell, the act
of pardoning is therefore most usually and
fitly ascribed to the Father, (that being the
ultimate perfecting pardon,) and we are said
to ask it of him through Christ.</p>
                     <p>2. I call this Pardon, <hi>a gracious Act;</hi> For if
it were not in some sort gratuitous, or free, it
were no Pardon. Let those think of this, who
say, We have perfectly obeyed the Law in
Christ, and are therefore righteous. If the
proper debt either of obedience or suffering
be payd, either by our selves, or by another,
then there is no place left for Pardon: For
when the Debt is payd, we owe nothing (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
obedience <hi>de novo;</hi>) and therefore can have
nothing forgiven us. For the Creditor cannot
refuse the proper Debt, nor deny an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
upon receit thereof. But Christ having
payd the <hi>Tantundem</hi> and not the <hi>Idem,</hi> the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
and not the strict Debt, this satisfaction the
Father might have chosen to accept, or
to have discharged us upon Christs suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
which yet because he freely doth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is his gracious Act properly called Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                     <p>The ignorant Antinomians think, it cannot
be a Free Act of Grace, if there be any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on our part for enjoying it. As if in
the fore-mentioned comparison, <hi>pag.</hi> 153.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106762:63"/>
the Tenants redemption were the less free,
because his new Lease requires the Rent of a
pepper corn in token of homage! As if when
a pardon is procured for a condemned Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
upon condition that he shall not reject
it when it is offered him, but shall take him
that procured it for his Lord, that this were
therefore no free pardon! Indeed if we payd
but a mite in part of the debt it self, so far our
pardon were the less free. But I will not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trouble the Reader with these senceless
conceits, the confutation whereof is so easie
and obvious.</p>
                     <p>3. I call this Act [<hi>a Discharging</hi>] as being
the proper term in Law to express it by. We
were before charged by the Law: we are by this
Act discharged.</p>
                     <p>4. I call it a discharge of [<hi>the Offender:</hi>] For
an offender is the only capable object or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient
of it. There can be no pardon where
there is no offender.</p>
                     <p>5. I call it a discharging [<hi>from the Obligation
to Punishment.</hi>] For. 1. You must look at this
whole process as legall, and not as referring
chiefly to Gods secret judgment or thoughts.
Therefore when it is called a freeing man from
the wrath of God, you must understand it
onely of the wrath threatened in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and so from [the obligation to Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.]
You must not conceive of the change
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106762:63"/>
in God, but in the sinners relation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
in the sence and sentence of the Law,
as to him. 2. The common word by which this
<hi>terminus a quo,</hi> or rather the evil which this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
doth directly free us from, is expressed,
is Guilt. But because the word <hi>Guilt</hi> is variously
used, sometimes referring onely to the Fact,
sometimes to the desert of Punishment, and
sometime to the dueness of Punishment or
the Laws obliging the Offendor to bear it; I
have therefore here taken it in this last expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
because I think that Guilt is taken away
only in this last sence; as I shall further open
anon. Therefore many define Guilt only in
this last sence, <hi>Reatus est Obligatio ad Poenam.</hi>
This Obligation though expressed only in the
Covenant, yet ariseth also from the Fact: For
if the Covenant had not been broken, it had
not obliged to suffering; but still to duty
only.</p>
                     <p>6. I call it a Discharging <hi>[by the Gospell-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
or grant:]</hi> (It is called a Promise in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the benefit as future, but more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a Grant in reference to the benefit as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or past; either in the conferring, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
conferred.) This I do for these Reasons.
1. To clear the nature of this Act. 2. To di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
your thoughts from Gods secret judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where most suppose this Act performed;
and to turn them right, and free God from
the imputation of change.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:106762:64"/>
A great question it is, Whether Remission
and Justification be immanent or transient
Acts of God? The mistake of this one point
was it that led those two most excellent, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Divines. Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> to
that error and pillar of Antinomianism, <hi>viz.</hi>
Iustification from Eternity. For (saith Dr.
<hi>Twisse</hi> often) All Acts immanent in God, are
from Eternity: but Justification and remission
of sin are immanent Acts: therefore, &amp;c. by
[immanent in God] they must needs mean
Negatively, not Positively. For Acts have
not the respect of an Adjunct to its subject,
but an effect to its cause. Now whether all
such immanent Acts are any more eternall
then transient Acts, is much questioned: As
for God to know that the world doth now
exist; That such a man is sanctified, or just, &amp;c.
Gods fore-knowledg is not a knowing that
such a thing is, which is not; but that such a
thing will be, which is not. Yet doth this make
no change in God: no more then the Sun is
changed by the variety of Creatures which
it doth enlighten and warm; or the Glass by
the variety of faces which it represents; or the
eye by the variety of the colours, which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth:
(For whatsoever some say, I do not
think that every variation of the object ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a reall change in the eye, or that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of ten distinct colours at one view,
doth make ten distinct acts of the sight, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106762:64"/>
on it: Much less do the objects of
Gods knowledg make such alterations.) But
grant that all Gods immanent Acts are Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
(which I think is quite beyond our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to know:) Yet most Divines will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Minor; and tell you that Remission and
Justification are transient Acts; Which is true:
But a Truth which I never had the happiness
to see or hear well cleared by any. For to
prove it a transient act, they tell us no more,
but that it doth <hi>transire in subjectum extraneum,</hi>
by making a morall change on our Relation,
though not a reall upon our persons, as Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
doth. But this is only to affirm and
not to prove; and that in generall only; not
telling us what Act it is that maketh this
change. Relations are not capable of being
the Patients or subjects of any Act: seeing they
are but meer <hi>Entia Rationis,</hi> and no reall Beings.
Neither are they the immediate product or
effect of any Act: but in order of Nature are
consequentiall to the direct effects. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
effect of the Act is to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
from whence the Relation doth arise.
And the same Act which layeth the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth cause the Relation, without
the intervention of any other. Suppose
but the <hi>subjectum fundamentum &amp; terminus,</hi>
and the Relation will unavoydably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
by a meer resultancy. The direct effect
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106762:65"/>
therefore of Gods Active Justification must
be a reall effect, though not upon the sinner,
yet upon something else for him; and thence
will his Passive Justification follow. Now what
transient Act this is, and what its immediate
reall Effect, who hath unfolded? I dare not be
to confident in so dark a point: but it seemeth
to me, that this justifying transient Act is the
enacting or promulgation of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
wherein Justification is conferred upon
every Beleever. Here, 1. The passing and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacting
this Grant is a transient Act. 2. So may
the continuance of it (as I think.) 3. This Law
or Grant hath a morall improper Action, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may be said to pardon or justifie; which
properly is but virtuall justifying. 4. By this
Grant God doth, 1. Give us the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, to be ours when we beleeve: 2.
And disableth the Law to oblige us to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or to condemn us: 3. Which reall Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
being thus layd, our Relations of [Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
and Pardoned in title of Law] do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
result.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But this Act of God, in granting
Pardon to Beleevers, was performed long ago:
But our Justification is not till we beleeve.
<hi>Answ.</hi> Though the effects of Causes as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
do follow them immediately, yet as
Morall they do not so: but at what distance the
Agent pleases sometimes. A man makes his
son a Deed of Gift of certain Lands, to be his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106762:65"/>
at such an age, or upon the performance of
some eminent Action. Here the Deed of gift is
the fathers instrument by which he giveth
these Lands: The passing this Deed is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Act and time of Donation: Yet the son
hath no possession till the time prefixed, or
till the Condition be performed: At which
time, the conditionall Grant becoming abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
and giving him right to present posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
it is not unfitly said, that his father doth
even then bestow the Lands: though by no
new intervening act at all, but only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of the former Deed of gift in force.
So here, the conditionall grant of Pardon &amp; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
doth then absolutely pardon and
justifie us, when we perform the Condition.
Hence is the phrase in Scripture of being <hi>[Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by the Law:]</hi> which doth not only si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
[by the Law as the Rule to which men
did fit their actions;] but also [by the Law, as
not condemning, but justifying, the person
whose actions are so fitted:] In which sence
the Law did justifie Christ: or else the Law
should not justifie as a Law or Covenant,
but only as a Direction: which properly is
not Justifying, but only a means to discover
that we are Justifiable. As the Word of Christ
shall judge men at the last day, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 28. So
doth it virtually now, And if it judge, then
doth it condemn and justifie. So <hi>Rom. 2. 12. Iam.
2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 12. We shall be judged by the Law of Liberty.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106762:66"/>
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. 4, 23. In the same sence, as the Law is
said to convince and curse (<hi>Iam. 2. 9. Gal. 3.
13.</hi>) it may be said that the Gospell or new
Law doth acquit, justifie and bless. <hi>Rom. 8. 12.
The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Iesus, hath made
me from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> As the Law
worketh Wrath, and where is no Law, there is
no Transgression, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 4. 15.) And as sin is
not imputed where there is no Law, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 5. 13.
and the strength of sin is the law, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 56
So the new law is the strength of Righteousness,
and worketh Deliverance from Wrath; and
were there no such new Covenant, there would
be no Righteousness inherent or imputed:
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 51.</p>
                     <p>So that I conclude, That this transient Act
of God, pardoning and justifying <hi>(constitutive)</hi>
is his Grant in the new Covenant; by which as a
Morall Instrument, our Justification and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
are in time produced, even when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve:
the Obligation of the Law being then by
it made void to us.</p>
                     <p>And this is the present apprehension I have of
the nature of Remission and Justification: <hi>Si
quid novisti rectius, &amp;c.</hi> (yet I shall have occasion
afterwards to tell you, That all this is but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and Justification in Law and Title,
which must be distinguished from that which
is in Judgment or Sentence; the former being
vertual in respect of the Actuality of the latter)</p>
                     <p>2. The second kinde of Gods Acts, which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106762:66"/>
may be called Justifying, is indeed Immanent;
<hi>viz.</hi> his knowing the sinner to be pardoned
and just in Law; his Willing and Approving
hereof as True and Good: These are Acts in
Heaven, yea in God himself; but the former
sort are on earth also. I would not have those
Acts of God separated which he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn;
as he ever doth these last with the
former: But I verily think that it is especially
the former transient legall Acts which the
Scripture usually means when it speaks of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
and (constitutive) Justifying: and not
these Immanent Acts: though these must
be looked on as concurrent with the former.
Yet most Divines that I meet with, seem to look
at Pardon and Justification as being done
in heaven only and consisting only in these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Immanent Acts: And yet they deny Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to be an Immanent Act too: But how
they will ever manifest that these celestiall Acts
of God, <hi>(viz.</hi> his Willing the sinners Pardon,
and so forgiving him in his own brest; or his
accepting him as just,) are Transient Acts, I
am yet unable to understand. And if they
be Immanent Acts, most will grant that they
are from Eternity: and then fair fall the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians.
Indeed if God have a Bar in
Heaven before his Angels, where these things
are for the present transacted, as some
think; and that we are said to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

the proper meritorious and impulsive cause: 2. So the
Satisfaction, as pleaded by Christ the intercessor, is also
an impulsive cause. 3. The Satisfactious Acceptance by
the Sinner (that is Faith,) and the pleading of it with
God by the sinner (that is praying for pardon,) are but
the Conditions, or <hi>Causae sine quo.</hi>

                  <p>IVstification is either 1. in Title and the Sence of

                     <p>I Will not stand to mention all those other
Distinctions of Justification which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in others, &amp; not so necessary or perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to my purposed scope. You may finde
them in <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bradshaw, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iohn Goodwin,</hi> and
<hi>Alstedius</hi> Distinctions and Definitions, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The difference between Justification in Title
of Law, and in Sentence of Judgment, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
at the first view: Therefore I need not
explain it. It is common, when a man hath a
good cause, and the Law on his side, to say,
The Law justifieth him, or he is just in Law, or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106762:67"/>
he is acquit by the Law; and yet he is more
fully and compleatly acquit by the sentence
of the Judge afterward. In the former sence we
are now justified by faith, as soon as ever we
beleeve: In the latter sence we are justified at
the last Judgment. The title of [Declarative]
is too narrow for this last: For the sentence of
judiciall absolution doth more then barely to
declare us justified. I call the former [virtuall]
not as it is in it felf considered, but as it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in relation to the latter.</p>
                     <p>All those Scriptures, which speak of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
as done in this life, I understand of
Justification in Title opf Law: So <hi>Rom. 5. 1.
Being justified by faith, we have peace with God.
Rom. 4. 2. Rom. 5. 9. Being now justified by his
blood, &amp;c. Iames 2. 21, 25. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Justification in Judgment, as it is the
compleating Act, so is it most fitly called Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;
and I think the word in Scripture
hath most commonly reference to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
day; and that Justification in Title is
called [Justification] most especially, because
of its relation to the Justification at Judgment;
because as men are now in point of Law, so
shall they most certainly be sentenced in
Judgment.</p>
                     <p>Therefore is it spoken of many times as a
future thing, and not yet done: <hi>Rom. 3. 30
Mat. 12. 37. Rom.</hi> 2. 13. But these may be
called [Justification by Faith,] for by Faith
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106762:68"/>
we are justified, both in Law Title. and at
Judgment.</p>

                  <p>IVstification, in Title of Law, is a gracious Act of

                     <p>HEre you may see 1. That pardon of sin, and
this Iustification in Law, are not punctually and
precisely alone: 2. And yet the difference is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
small. The chief difference lyeth in this, That the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minus
a quo</hi> of Remission, is the obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but the <hi>Terminus</hi> of Iustification, (or the evil that
it formally and directly doth free us from,) is the Laws
Accusation and Condemnation: Now though the
difference between these two be very narrow, and rather
respective then reall, yet a plain difference there is: For
though it be one and the same Commination of the
Law, by which men are both obliged to punishment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
as guilty, and condemned for that guilt, yet these
are not all one, though it is also true, that they all stand
or fall together.</p>
                     <p>That pardon is most properly the removing of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation,
and that Iustification is the removing of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
and Condemnation in the Law, will be evident
to those that have read what Divines have written at
large concerning the signification of the words, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
such that have skill in Law, which is a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in this doctrine of Iustification: Therefore as Mr.
<hi>Wotten,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> do a little mistake in making
pardon of sin to be the formall cause of Iustification,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106762:68"/>
(though they are far neerer the mark then their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.)
So Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> doth a little too much straiten the
form of it, making it to lye only in Apology or Plea. It
consisteth in both the Acts; 1. Apology, in oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
Accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; thus Christ our Advocate doth principally ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
us: 2. In Sentence, (virtuall or actuall,) &amp; so it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
both to Accusation and Condemnation; so Christ
the Mediator as Iudge, and the Father as one with him,
and as the supream Iudge, doth justifie: But this latter is
the chief Act. The rest of the Definition is sufficiently
opened under the foregoing Definition of Pardon, and
will be more after.</p>

                  <p>WHen Scripture speaketh of Iustification by Faith,
it is to be understood primarily and directly of
Iustification in Law title, and at the bar of Gods
publique Iudgment; and but secondarily and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially
of Iustification at the bar of Gods secret
judgment, or at the bar of Conscience, or of the

                     <p>1. THat Justification by Faith is <hi>in foro-Dei,</hi>
and not <hi>in foro conscientiae</hi> primarily, see
Dr. <hi>Downam's</hi> Appendix to Covenant
of Grace against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Pemble.</hi> Conscience is but
an inferiour, petty, improper Judge: The work
must be transacted chiefly at a higher Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
View all the Scriptures that mention Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by Faith, and you shall finde by
the Text and Context that they relate to the
bar of God, but not one directly to the bar of
Conscience. It is one thing to be justified, and
another thing to have it manifested to our
Consciences that we are so.</p>
                     <p>2. That it is not directly at the bar of the
World, all will acknowledge.</p>
                     <p>3. That it is not directly at the bar of Gods
secret Judgment, in his own brest, may appear
thus: 1. That is not a bar at which God dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
with sinners, for Justification or Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in any known or visible way; No Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106762:69"/>
intimateth it. 2. We could not then judge
of our Justification. 3. They are immanent
Acts; but Justification is a transient Act: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Downame</hi> in the place before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
hath proved against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Pemble,</hi> that
Justification is not from Eternity. And (as I
judge by his following Tract of Justification)
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Pemble</hi> himself came afterwards to a soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Judgment in the nature of Justification. 4.
God dealeth with man in an open way of Law,
and upon Covenant terms, and so will try him
at a publique Judgment according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of his Covenants. There secrets of his brest
are too high for us. By the word will he judge
us: That must justifie or condemn us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when you hear talk of the Bar of God,
you must not understand it of the immanent
Acts of Gods Knewledg or Will, but of his
Bar of publique Judgment, and in the sence
of the Word, Some think that Justification by
Faith is properly and directly none of all these
yet, but that it is a publique Act of God in
heaven before his Angels. I think this opinion
better then any of the three former, which
would have it at the Bar of Gods secret Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or of Conscience, or of the World; and
I know no very ill consequence that followeth
it; But that God doth condemn or justifie at
any such Bar. I find no Scripture fully to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
or perswade me. Those places, <hi>Rom. 2.
13. Heb. 9. 24. Luke 12, 8, 9. &amp;</hi> 15. 10. which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106762:70"/>
are alledged to that purpose, seem not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ch thing, as that to be the Bar
where Faith doth most properly justifie: Yet I
acknowledge that in a more remote sence we
may be said to be justified by Faith at all the
four other Bars, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Immanent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and before the Angels, and before
Conscience, and the World: For God and
Angels do judge according to Truth, and take
those to be just, who are so in Law and in deed:
and so do our Consciences, and Men when
they judge rightly; and when they do not, we
cannot well be said to be justified at their Bar.
Therefore I think they mistake, who would
have Works, rather then Faith, to justifie us
at the Bar of the World, as I shall shew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when I come to open the conditions of
Justification.</p>

Covenant, and so having no part in Christs Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
here we must be justified only by our Faith,
or personall Gospell-Righteousness, and not by any
thing that Christ hath done or suffered: For in all
false accusations we must defend our innocency and
plead not guilty.</p>

                     <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
                     <p>BUt because there is no danger to us from
false accusation before the all-knowing
God, therefore Scripture saith nothing
of any such Justification, Yet at the bar of men
it is frequently usefull, where false accusations
may be heard; &amp; therefore <hi>David, Iob, &amp;c.</hi> do
plead their Innocency against their accusers.
Also at the bar of our own erroneous Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
this kind of Justification is frequently
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106762:73"/>
full; for there Satan hath more hope that his
false accusations may take place, then at the
Bar of God: Wherefore he more usually accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Christians to themselves of being grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and unbeleevers, and impenitent, and
of having no part in Christ, then of breaking
the Law by their sins. And in such cases, when
the accusation is false, we have no way to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it, but by pleading not guilty, &amp; casting
back the accusation as a lying slander, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
our Faith and Gospel-Obedience, or
what ever grace we are accused to want: And
so it is that our own graces and duties may be
properly our comfort: It will be but a senceless
shift in such an accusation to shew Christs Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
Righteousness in stead of our own Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
Righteousness. To tell Satan, that
Christ hath fulfilled the Law for us, when he
is accusing us of not fulfilling the Gospell;
silly women are made beleeve by Antinomian
Teachers, that this is a solid way of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
But Satan is a better Logitian then to
take <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and to be baffled with such
arguing. And as silly, and more false a shift it
will be, to tell him, that Christ hath beleeved,
repented and fulfilled the Gospell-Conditions
for us, as I have shewed before. The best is,
these Teachers do but spoyle the comforts of
beleevers, and not their safety; for in the
case in hand, we suppose the accusation to be
false: But yet by such grounds they may very
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106762:73"/>
easily overthrow the safety also of unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
while they teach them how to comfort
themselves without Faith, or to look at all out
of themselves in Christ, and so to silence the
accusation of both Covenants, by producing
only the Righteousness of one.</p>

affirmeth as much, though some take it for hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
doctrine. 1. That the fact should be done, and
not done, is a contradiction. 2. So is it, That the fact
should be sinful, and not sinful. 3. Or that it should
deserve death, and not deserve it: Or that it should be a
sin against that threatening Law, and yet not deserve
the penalty threatened. Besides, if any of these three
could have been taken off, what need Christ have dyed?
But that which Remission and Justification freeth us
from, is the dueness of punishment to our persons, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the dueness of it to the sin; because what
is due to the sin, is inflicted on the person of another al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
even Christ. So that you see in what sence Christ
taketh away sin and guilt, which you must observe, lest
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106762:74"/>
you run into the Antinomian conceit, That God seeth
not sin in his justified ones. When we say therefore that
God looketh on our sins as if they had never been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
the meaning is, that, in regard to punishment,
they shall have no more power to condemn us, then if
they had never been committed.</p>

                  <p>THe offending of God, and the desert and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing

of sin, as some make them; nor is the removal of the

                     <p>THis is plain, because Gods displeasure against our
persons (for his dislike of the sin is never taken
off) is a chief part of our punishment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be distinguished from it, but as the Species
from its <hi>Genus.</hi> And so when all the punishment is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
then Gods displeasure, or the loss of his favour,
must needs be removed: Therefore that Justification in
this differs from Remission of sin, I cannot yet think,
(as that godly and learned Servant of Christ, whom I

doth,) That Justification, besides the pardon of sin,
doth connote a state that the subject is put into, <hi>viz.</hi> a
state of favour, being reconciled with God. Because
even Remission it self doth connote that state of favour:
For if the loss of Gods favour be part of the punishment,
and all the punishment be remitted, then the favour
which we lost must needs be thereby restored. Indeed
there is a two-fold Favour of God, 1. That which we
lost in the fall; 2. More super-added by Christ, besides
the former restored: Of these in the following Position.</p>

                  <p>BY what hath been said, it is apparent, That
Iustification in Title may be ascribed to sever all
Causes. 1. The principall efficient Cause is God. 2.
The Instrumentall is the Promise or Grant off the new
Covenant. 3. The Procatarctick Cause, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o far as
God may be said to be moved by any thing out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
speaking after the manner of men,) is four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.
1. And chiefly the Satisfaction of Christ. 2. The
Intercession of Christ, and supplication of the sinner.
3. The necessity of the sinner. 4. The opportunity and
advantage for the glorifying his Iustice and Mercy.
The first of these is the Meritorious Cause; the second
the morall perswading Cause; the third is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective,
and the fourth is the Occasion. 2. Materiall
Cause properly it hath none: If you will improperly
call Christs Satisfaction the remote matter, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not. 3. The formall Cause is the acquitting of
the sinner from Accusation and Condemnation of the
Law, or the disabling the Law to accuse or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him. 4. The finall Cause is the Glory of God,
and of the Mediator, and the deliverance of the sinner.
5. The <hi>Causa sine quâ non;</hi> is both Christs Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and the Faith of the justified.</p>
                  <div type="explanation">
                     <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
                     <p>HEre it will be expected, that I answer to
these Questions. 1. Why I call the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the Instrumentall Cause? 2. Why I
call Christs Satisfaction the meritorious Cause,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106762:76"/>
and the <hi>Causa sine quâ non?</hi> 3. Why I make not
Christs Righteousness the materiall Cause? 4.
Why I make not the Imputation of it the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
Cause? 5. Why I make not Faith the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall
Cause? 6. Why I make it only the
<hi>Causa sine quâ non?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the first Question: As a Lease or Deed of
Gift is properly a mans Instrument in convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the thing leased or given; and as the
Kings Pardon under his Hand and Seal is his
proper Iustrument of pardoning &amp; justifying
the Malefactor, so is the new Covenant Gods
Instrument in this case, or, as it were, his
Mouth, by which he pronounceth a beleever
justified.</p>
                     <p>To the second Question: Christs Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
hath severall ways of causing our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
1. That it is the Meritorious Cause, I
know few but Socinians that will deny. 2 That
it is besides properly a <hi>Causa sine qua non,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed by any that consider, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth
those great Impediments that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
our Justification. And what if a man
should say, that because impulsive and proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarcticall
Causes have properly no place with
God, that therefore the greatest part of the
work of Christs Satisfaction is to be the <hi>Causa
sine qua non principalis?</hi> But because my assigning
no more to Christs Satisfaction but merit, and
this improper causality, doth seem to some to
be very injurious thereto; I desire them so long
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106762:76"/>
to lay by their prejudice &amp; passion while they
consider of this one thing, That we are not
in this business considering which cause hath
the preheminence, in regard of physicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
but which in morall respect deserveth
the highest commendation. In point of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the greatest praise is seldom due to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
naturall strength, or to the strongest na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
causation. In Physicks the efficient hath
the greatest part of the glory; but in Morals
the Meritorious Cause hath a singular share:
As <hi>Diogenes</hi> said, <hi>Quare me non laudas qui dignus
sum ut accipiam? plus enim est meruisse quam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disse
beneficium.</hi> The like may be said of some
Causes <hi>sine qua non:</hi> That they deserve far
greater praise in morall respect, then some that
have a proper causality do. It is agreed, that
<hi>removens impedimentum quâ talis, is Causa sine
quâ non:</hi> And doth not the greatest part of a
Phisitians skill lye there? That which taketh
away the offending humor, and clenseth out
the corruption, and removeth all hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
shall have the greatest share in the glory
of the cure, of any artificiall cause. Suppose
a man be condemned by Law for Treason,
one payeth one thousand pound for his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and thereby procured it under the broad
Seale; hereby he suspendeth, and afterward
disableth the Law, as to the offender; This
man is the efficient of those happy effects,
from which the justification of the Traytor
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106762:77"/>
will follow: But as to his justification it self,
he is but the <hi>Causa removens impedimenta,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the force of the Law, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Majesty, and whatsoever els did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the justification of the offender. And yet
I think he deserveth more thanks then either
the Laywer that justifieth him by Plea, or the
Judge that justifies him by Sentence. So here;
If you had rather: you may call it a necessary
Antecedent. Or, if any man think fitter to
call these Causes by another name, I much
care not, so we agree concerning the nature
of the thing.</p>
                     <p>To the third question. Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
cannot be the materiall cause, of an Act
which hath no matter. If any will call Christs
Righteousness the matter of our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
though yet they speak improperly, yet
farre neerer the truth, then to call it the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of our Justification.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth Quest. That Imputation is
not the Form, is undenyable. The form gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
the name: especially to Actions, that have
no matter. Imputation and Justification de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
distinct Acts: And how then can Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
be the Forme of Justifying. Though
I mention not Imputation in the Definition,
nor among the Causes here, yet it is implyed
in the mention of Satisfaction, which must
be made ours, or else we cannot be Justified
by it. Though therefore, the Scripture do not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106762:77"/>
speak of imputing Christs Righteousnesse or
Satisfaction to us; yet if by Imputing, they
mean no more but, [Bestowing it on us, so
that we shall have the Justice, and other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of it as truely as if we had satisfied our
selves,] in this sence I acknowledge Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christs satisfactory Righteousness.
But I beleeve that this Imputing, doth in
order of nature, go before Justifying: And
that the Righteousness so Imputed, is the
proper ground whence we are denominated
Legally righteous, and consequently why the
Law cannot condemn us. It is a vaine thing
to quarrell about the Logicall names of
the Causes of Justification, if we agree in the
matter.</p>
                     <p>To the fifth Question. Perhaps I shall be
blamed, as singular from all men, in denying
Faith to be the Instrument of our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
But affectation of singularity leades
me not to it. 1. If Faith be an Iustrument, it
is the Instrument of God or man: Not of
man: For man is not the principall efficient;
he doth not justifie himself. 2. Not of God:
For 1. It is not God that believeth; though
its true, he is the first Cause of all Actions.
2. Man is the <hi>Causa secunda,</hi> between God
and the Action: and so still man should be
said to justifie himselfe. 3. For (as <hi>Aquinus</hi>)
The Action of the principall Cause and of
the Instrument is one Action: and who dare
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106762:78"/>
say, that Faith is so Gods Instrument? 4.
The Instrument must have influx to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of the effect of the Principall cause
by a proper Causalitie. And who dare say,
that Faith hath such an influx into our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But some would evade thus: It is
(say they) a Passive Instrument not an Active.</p>
                     <p>To which I Answer. 1 Even Passive Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are said to help the Action of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Agent, (<hi>Keckerm. Logick pag.</hi> 131.) He
that saith, Faith doth so, in my judgement,
gives too much to it. 2. It is past my capacity
to conceive of a Passive Morall Instrument. 3.
How can the Act of Believing (which hath no
other being, but to be an Act) be possibly a
Passive Instrument? Doth this Act effect by
suffering? Or can wise men have a grosser con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of this. 4. I believe with <hi>Schibler,</hi> that
there is no such thing at all as a passive Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The examples that some produce (as
<hi>Burgersdicius</hi> his <hi>Cultor &amp; gladius</hi>) belong to
Active Instrument. And the Examples that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
bring, (as <hi>Keckermans Iurus instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
fabricationis, mensa &amp; scamnum accubitus,
terra ambulationis</hi>) are no Instruments: except
you will call every Patient or Object, the
Instrument of the Agent. The Instrument is
an Efficient Cause. All efficiencie is by acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that which doth not Act, doth not
effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indeed, as some extend the use of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106762:78"/>
the word instrument, you may call, almost,
any thing an Instrument, which is any way
conducible to the production of the Effect
under the chief Cause; And so you may call
Faith an Instrument.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> But though Faith be not the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Justification; may it not be called
the Instrument of receiving Christ who Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
us?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I do not so much stick at this speech
as at the former: yet is it no proper or fit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
neither. For 1. The Act of Faith,
(which is it that justifieth) is our Actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of Christ, and therefore cannot be
the Instrument of Receiving. To say our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
is the Instrument of our Receiving,
is a hard saying. 2. And the seed or habite
of Faith cannot fitly be called an Instrument.
For, 1. The sanctified faculty it self cannot
be the souls Instrument; it being the soul it
self and not any thing really distinct from
the soul: (nor really distinct from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as <hi>Scotus, D'Orbellis Scaliger, &amp;c.</hi>
D. <hi>Iackson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> think: and Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>
questions.) 2. The holinesse of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
is not their Instrument. For, 1. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but themselves rectified: and not a
Being so distinct as may be called their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
2. Who ever called Habits, or Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
the souls Instruments? The apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of a Cause to produce its effect, cannot
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106762:79"/>
be called the Instrument of it: you may
as well call a mans Life his Instrument of Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or the sharpnesse of a knife, the knives
Instrument, as to call our holiness, or
habituall faith, the Instrument of receiving
Christ.</p>
                     <p>To the sixth and last Question, I Answ.
Faith is plainly and undeniably the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Justification. The whole Tenour
of the Gospell shews that. And a condition is
but a <hi>Causa sine quâ non;</hi> or a <hi>medium,</hi> or a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Antecedent. Here by the way take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the same men that blame the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of Faith so high, as to be our true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
Righteousnesse. <hi>Posit.</hi> 17. 20. and to be
inputed in proper sence, <hi>Posit</hi> 23. do yet,
when it comes to the triall ascribe far more
to Faith, then those they blame: making it
Gods Instrument in justifying. 1. And so to
have part of the honour of Gods own Act; 2.
And that from a reason intrinsecall to faith it
self; 3. And from a Reason that will make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Graces to be Instruments as well as Faith.
For Love doth truly receive Christ also. 4.
And worst of all, from a Reason that will make
man to be the <hi>Causa proxima</hi> of his own Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
For man is the <hi>Causa proxima</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
and receiving Christ, and therefore
not God but man is said to beleeve. And yet
these very men do send a <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Crie</hi> after
the <hi>Tò credere,</hi> for robbing Christ of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106762:79"/>
glory of Iustification, when we make it but a
poor improper <hi>Causa sine qua non.</hi> (And yet I
say as before, that in Morality, yea, and in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turality,
some <hi>Causae sine qua non,</hi> do deserve
much of the honour; but that Faith doth not
so, I have shewed in the 23. Position.) Some
think that Faith may be some small low Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive
Cause: but I will not give it so much:
though if it be made a Procatarctick Objective
Cause, I shall not contend.</p>

                  <p>IT is the Act of Faith which justifieth men at age,
and not the habit: yet not as it is a good work, or
as it hath in it's self any excellency in it above other
Graces: But 1. In the neerest sence, directly and
properly as it is, [The fulfilling of the Condition of the
New Convenant:] 2. In the remote and more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
sence, as it is [The receiving of Christ and his
satisfactory Righteousnesse.]</p>
                  <div type="explanation">
                     <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
                     <p>1. THat the habit of Faith doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and properly justifie, appeares
from the tenour of the Covenant:
which is not [He that disposed to beleeve
shall be saved] But [he that believeth.]</p>
                     <p>2. That Faith doth not properly justifie
through any excellency that it hath above
other Graces, or any more usefull property,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106762:80"/>
may appear thus: 1. Then the praise would be
due to Faith. 2. Then love would contend
for a share, if not a priority. 3. Then Faith
would justifie, though it had not been made
the Condition of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Let those therefore take heed, that make
Faith to justifie, meerely because it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
Christ: which is its naturall, effentiall
property.</p>
                     <p>3. That it is Faith in a proper sence that
is said to justifie, and not Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
onely which it receiveth, may appear
thus. 1. From the necessity of two-fold righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which I have before proved, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the two-fold Covenant. 2. From
the plain and constant Phrase of Scripture,
which saith, He that beleeveth shall be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
and that we are justified by Faith: and that
faith is imputed for righteousnesse. It had
been as easie for the Holy Ghost to have said,
that Christ onely is imputed, or his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
onely, or Christ onely justifieth, &amp;c. If
he had so meant. He is the most excusable in
an error, that is lead into it by the constant
expresse phrase of Scripture. 3. From the
nature of the thing: For the effect is ascribed,
to the severall Causes (though not alike) and
in some sort to the Conditions, Especially,
me-thinks they that would have Faith to be the
Instrument of Iustification, should not deny
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106762:80"/>
that we are properly justified by Faith as by
an Instrument: For it is as proper a speech to
say [our hand and our teeth feed us,] as to say,
[our meet feedeth us.]</p>
                     <p>4. That Faith doth most directly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
justifie [as its the fulfilling of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the New Covenant] appeareth thus.
1 The new Covenant onely doth put the
stamp of Gods Authority upon it, in making it
the Condition. A two-fold stamp is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to make it a current medium of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
1. Command. 2. Promise. Because
God hath neither Commanded any other
meanes, 2. Nor promised Justification to
any other, therefore it is, that this is the onely
condition; and so only thus Justifieth. When
I read this to be the tenour of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
[Whosoever believeth shall be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:]
doth it not tell me plainly why Faith
Justifieth? even because it pleaseth the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
and Covenant-maker to put Faith into
the Covenant, as its condition. 2. What
have we else to shew at Gods barr for our
Justification, but the New Covenant? The
Authority and Legality of it must bear us out.
It is upon point of Law that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
and it must be by Law, that we
must be Justified. Therefore we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
because the Law which we break
did threaten death to our sin: If we had
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106762:81"/>
committed the same Act, and not under a Law
that had threatned it with death, we might not
have dyed. So therefore are we Justified,
because the New Law doth promise Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to our faith. If we had performed the
same Act under the first Covenant, it would
not have Iustified. As the formall Reason,
why sin condemneth is, because the Law hath
concluded it in its threatning: so the formall
Reason, why Faith justifieth, is, because the
New Law of Covenant hath concluded it, in its
Promise. And as where there is no Law, there
is no Transgression nor Condemnation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
sin is formally a transgression of the Law,
and Condemnation is but the execution of its
Threatning: so where there is no fulfilling the
new Law, there is no Righteousnesse nor Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
because Righteousnesse is formally
a conformity to the Law of Righteousnesse,
and Iustification is but the performing of part
of its Promise.</p>
                     <p>5. That Faith's receiving Christ and his
righteousnesse, is the remote of secondary,
and not the formall Reason, why it doth Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
appeareth thus. 1. I would ask any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter
this Question. Suppose that Christ had
done all that he did for sinners, and they had
believed in him, thereupon, without any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
promising Iustification to this faith:
Would this faith have justified them? By what
Law? Or whence will they plead their Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106762:81"/>
at the barr of God? Well: but suppose
that Christ having done what he did for us,
that he should in framing the New Covenant
have put in any other Condition; and
said [whosoever loveth God shall by vertue
of my satisfaction be Iustified.] Would not
this love have Iustified? No doubt of it. I
conclude then thus: The receiving of Christ,
is as the silver of this coin: the Gospell-promise
is as the Kings stamp which maketh it
currant for justifying. If God had seen meet
to have stamped any thing else, it would have
passed currantly. Yet take this. Faith is, even
to our own apprehension, the most apt and
suitable condition that God could have
chosen: (for as far as we can reach to know;)
There cannot be a more Rationall &amp; apt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of delivering a redeemed Malefactor
from Torment, then that he thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the pardon, and favour of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and hereafter take his Redeemer for
his Lord.</p>
                     <p>So that if you ask me [what is the formall
Reason, why Faith Iustifieth?]</p>
                     <p>I answer. Because Christ hath made it the
condition of the New Covenant, and promised
Iustification upon that Condition.</p>
                     <p>But, 2. If you ask me further, Why did
Christ chuse this rather then any thing else
for the Condition?</p>
                     <p>I. Answer. 1. To ask a Reason of Christs
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106762:82"/>
choice and commands is not alway wise or
safe. 2. But here the reason is so apparent,
that <hi>a posteriore,</hi> we may safely adventure to
say: That this is the most self-denying, and
Christ advancing work: Nothing could be
more proportionable to our poverty, who
have nothing to buy with, then thus freely to
receive: Nothing could be more reasonable,
then to acknowledge him who hath redeemed
us, and to take him for our Redeemer and
Lord: many more such Reasons might be
given. In a word, then Faith Justifieth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
and properly, as it is the Condition of
the New Covenant, (that is the formall reason.)
And secondarily, remotely, as it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of Christ and his righteousnesse: (that
is the aptitude of it to this use to which it hath
pleased Cod to destinate it.)</p>
                     <p>I stand the more on this, because it is the
foundation of that which followeth.</p>

it being as I shewed before, an Act of
God by his Gospell: Now 1. God still
continueth that Gospell-Covenant in force. 2.
That Covenant still continueth Justifying Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
3. God himself doth continue to esteem

continuall use, and not to be laid by, when we

Condition, and the other but the less principall: And
so as a whole Country hath of its name from the chief
City; so may the Conditions of this Covenant from
Faith: 2. Because all the rest are reducible
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106762:84"/>
to it; either being presupposed, as necessary Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
or means; or contained in it as its parts, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

                     <p>SUbservient Actions are in common speech
silently implyed in the principall. If the
besieged be bound by Articles to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Town to the besiegers at such a time; it
need not be expressed in the Articles, that they
shall withdraw their Guards, and cease resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and open the gates, and yeeld up this
house, or that street, &amp;c. All this is implyed
clearly in the Article of surrender.</p>
                     <p>If a redeemed gally-slave be freed, upon
condition that he take him for his Redeemer
and Master that did deliver him; it need not
be expressed, that he shall leave the gallies, and
his company, and employment there, and
go with him that bought him, and do what he
bids him do: All this is plainly implyed in
the foresaid words, of his Conditions.</p>
                     <p>So here, the great condition of Beleeving
doth include or imply all the rest.</p>
                     <p>I confess it is a work of some worth and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
to shew how each other part of the
Condition is reducible to Beleeving; and in
what respect they stand towards it. I dare not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106762:84"/>
determine too peremptorily here, but I think
they stand thus. 1. Hearing the Word, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
conviction, godly sorrow, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from dead works, are implyed as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
means antecedents. 2. Knowledge of
Christ, and Assent to the Truth of the Gospell
are at least integrall parts of flat necessity, if
not essentiall parts of Faith. 3. Subjection,
Acceptance, Consent, cordiall covenanting,
self-resigning, are the very proper essentiall,
formall Acts of Faith.</p>
                     <p>4. Esteeming Christ above all in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
preferring him before all in the Will,
loving him above all; I say this preferring of
Christ above all in Judgement, Will, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
is (in my Judgement (the very <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia
fidei maxime propria quae de ea essentialiter
praedicatur, &amp; sic pars ejus essentialis;</hi> the very
essentiall property of true Faith diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing
it from all false Faith, and so an
essentiall part of it. I know this is like to
seeme strange; but I shall give my reasons of
it anon.</p>
                     <p>5. Sincerity and perseverance are the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Modifications of Faith: and not any
thing really distinct from its Being.</p>
                     <p>6. Assiance and sincere obedience, and
works of Love, are the necessary imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
inseparable products of Faith; as heat
and light are of fire; or rather as Reasoning is
the product of Reason: or yet rather as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106762:85"/>
actions most properly conjugall, are the effects
of Conjugall contract. And as Faith is in
some sort more excellent then Affiance &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
as the cause is better then the effect:
so in some sort they may be more excellent
then Faith; as the effect may be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its Cause; the Act before the habit; as
being that which is the end of the habit, for
whose sake it is; and to which it tendeth as to
its perfection.</p>
                     <p>7. The praying for forgivenesse, the
forgiving of others, the pleading of Christs
satisfaction, are both parts of this obedience,
and necessary consequents of Faith, and Acts
subseruient to it for the attaining of its
Ends.</p>
                     <p>8. The denying and humbling of the flesh,
the serious, painfull, constant use of Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
Hearing, Praying, Meditating, &amp;c.
are both parts of the foresaid obedience, and
also the necessary means of continuing and
exercising our Faith.</p>
                     <p>9. Strength of Grace; Assurance of Pardon
and Salvation; Perswasion of Gods favour;
setled peace of Conscience; Ioy in this Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Peace; the understanding of Truths
not fundamentall, or necessary in practice; All
these are no properties of the Condition of
the Covenant; but separable adjuncts of Faith;
tending to the Well-being of it; but neither
tending to, nor necessary, proofs of the Being
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106762:85"/>
of it; which a Believer should have, but
may possibly want.</p>
                     <p>I shall give you some reason of severall of
these Assertions, when I have first made way
by the Definition of Faith.</p>
                     <p>So then, as when you invite a man to your
House, it is not necessary that you bid him
come in at the doore, or bring his head, or
his legs, or armes, or his clothes with him;
(though these are necessary) because all these
are necessarily implyed: even so when we are
said to be justified by Faith onely; or when it
is promised, that he that beleeveth shall be
saved, all those forementioned duties, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed

conditions of the Gospell, and not formally and
strictly the whole: But as Love is the fulfilling of the
Law, so Faith is the fulfilling of the new Law; or
as taking the Lord for our only God, is the sum of the
Decalogue, implying or inferring all the rest, and so
is the great Commandment; so taking Christ for our
only Redeemer and Lord, is the sum of the conditions
of the new Covenant, including, implying or infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all other parts of its conditions, and so is the
great Command of the Gospell.</p>

                     <p>The full subjection to the Authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,
doth imply and infer subjection
to the particular Commands: therefore God
doth still make this the sum of the conditions
of the Law, that they take him only for their
God, or that they have no other Gods but
him: And when he contracteth his Covenant
into an Epitome, it runs thus, <hi>I will be thy
God, and thou shalt be my people, Exod. 20. 3.

Deut. 26. 16, 17, &amp;c.</hi> And as Gods promise of
taking us for his people doth imply his besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
upon us all the priviledges and blessings
of his people, and so is the sum of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Covenant on his part. Even so
our taking the Lord for our God, and Christ
for our Redeemer and Lord, doth imply our
sincere obedience to him; and is the summe
of the Conditions on our part. And so as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
is that violation of the law of Nature,
which doth <hi>eminentér,</hi> containe all the rest
in it; So is Unbeliefe in respect of the Law
of Grace. And as the formall Nature of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
lyeth in disclayming God, from being
God, or form being our God, or from
being our alone God: Even so the formall
nature of Unbeliefe lyeth in disclaiming
Christ, either from being a Redeemer and
Lord, or from being Our Redeemer and Lord,
or from being Our onely Redeemer and Lord.
This being well considered, will direct you
truly and punctually, where to find the very
formall being and nature of Faith? Not in
beleeving the pardon of sin, or the favour of
God, or our salvation; nor in Affiance or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency,
(though that be a most immediate
product of it,) Nor in Assurance, (as Divines
were wont to teach 80. yeares agoe.) Nor in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
or following of Christ as a guide to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106762:87"/>
Heaven, or as a Captaine, or meere Patterne
and Law-giver (as the wretched <hi>Socinians</hi> teach.)
But in the three Acts above mentioned.
1. Taking Christ for a Redeemer and Lord;
which is by Assent. 2. Taking him for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
Saviour and Lord; which is by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
3. Taking him for our onely Redeemer,
Saviour and Lord; which is the Morall since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the former: And the essentiall differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
property of it: Not whereby Faith is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced
from Love or joy, &amp;c. But whereby
that faith in Christ, which is the Gospell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
is differenced from all other Faith in
Christ. So that as <hi>Corpus &amp; Anima, &amp; Rationale,</hi>
doe speake the whole essence of man: Even so
this Assent, Consent, and Preference of Christ
before all others; do speak the whole Essence
of Faith.</p>
                     <p>For the common opinion, that justifying
Faith, as justifying, doth consist in any one

                  <p>NOr is Christs person considered as such, or for

of Christ as cloathed with his Office and Authority is
this Object.</p>
                  <div type="explanation">
                     <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
                     <p>I Put all these together, as ayming at one
scope: &amp; I shall now explain them distinctly.
(To the 65.) First, that Faith is not taken
for any one single Act, I prove thus. 1. If it
were but one single Act (I mean specifically,
not numerically) then it could not (according
to the common opinion of <hi>Philosophers</hi>) be
the Act of the whole Soul: But Faith must
be the Act of the whole Soul; or else part
of the Soul would receive Christ, and part
would not; and part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of it would entertain
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106762:88"/>
him, and part not. Some think the soul is as
the body, which hath a hand to receive things
in the name, and for the use of the whole. But
it is not so, Christ is not onely taken into the
hand: But as the blood and spirits, which are
received into every living part. (Though I
intend not the comparison should reach to
the manner of receiving.) Neither is the soul
so divisible into parts, as the body is; and
therefore hath not severall parts for severall
offices. 2. The most of our accurate studious
Divines of late, doe take Faith to be seated in
both faculties, Understanding and Will: But
if so; according to the common Philosophie,
it cannot be any one single Act.</p>
                     <p>Neither Secondly, is it in various Acts of
one single faculty: For, 1. It will (in my jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement)
never be proved, that the soul hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
which are really distinct from it self, or
from each other. These Faculties are but the
soul it self, able to doe thus and thus from its
naturall being. <hi>Vide Scaliger Exercit. 107. Sect.</hi> 3.
Understanding and Willing are its immediate
Acts: And perhaps those very Acts, are more
diversified or distinct in their objects, then
in themselves. The souls apprehension of an
objects as true, we call Understanding; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of its Metaphysicall Truth, it is a simple
apprehension; as we receive this Truth upon
the word of another, it is Assent and Beliefe;
as this Object is considered as Good, our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106762:88"/>
toward it, is called, Willing; if absent,
Desiring, Hoping; if present, Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Joying; when we Will a thing as Good,
any thing strongly, and apprehend its Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
any thing cleerely, this we call Love,
&amp;c. But whether all these be really distinct
kinds of Acts of the Soul, is very doubtfull:
Much more, whether they proceed from
distinct Faculties. As I am not of my Lord
<hi>Brook's</hi> minde concerning the Unity of all
things: So neither would I unnecessarily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of any division: especially in so spirituall
and perfect a piece as the Sould; knowing how
much of Perfection lyeth in Unity; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> curse of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Two, because it was the first that durst
depart from Unity: <hi>&amp; frustra fit per plura &amp;c.</hi>
2. But if it were proved that the Souls Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are really distinct; yet both these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are capable of receiving Christ; and
Christ is an Object suited to both: and then
what doubt is it whether Faith be in both?</p>
                     <p>1. For the Will no man will question it,
that it is capable of receiving Christ; and
Christ a suitable Object for it.</p>
                     <p>2. And for the Understanding, it doth as
much incline to Truth, as the Will to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and as truely receive its Object under
the notion of True, as the Will doth receive
its Object as Good. If you would see it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
fully, That Assent is an Essentiall part
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106762:89"/>
of justifying Faith, read Dr. <hi>Downame</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi>
on that Subject: and his <hi>Appendix</hi>
to the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> in Answer to Mr.
<hi>Pemble:</hi> Where though his Argument will
not reach their intended scope, to prove that
Assent is the onely proper Act of justifying
Faith, yet they do conclude, that it is a
reall part. And he well confuteth his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
though he do not well confirm that his
own opinion.</p>
                     <p>3. Consider further, that Christ doth not
treat of Faith, <hi>in sensu Physico sed morali &amp; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litico,</hi>
not as a Naturall Philosopher, but as
a Law-giver to his Church. Now in Politicks,
we doe not take the names of Actions in so
narrow and strict a sense, as in <hi>Physicks</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke.</hi>
If a Town doe agree to take or receive
such a man for their Mayor; or a Kingdome
take or receive such a one as their King: The
words <hi>[Take,</hi> or <hi>Receive]</hi> here doe not note
any one single Act of soul or body alone; but
a compound, as it were, of Actions; which
yet do all take their name from the Principall,
which is <hi>[Consent.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the 66. That Christ as a Saviour onely,
or in respect of his Priestly Office onely, is
not the Object of justifying Faith; but that
Faith doth as really and immediatly Receive
him as King; and in so doing, Justifie: this I
prove thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:106762:89"/>
1. The Gospell doth not reveale Christs
Offices as separated: But as they are revealed,
so they must be believed.</p>
                     <p>2. Neither doth it Offer Christ in his Priestly
Office onely, as separated from his Kingly:
though it may sometime presse our Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of him in one respect, and sometime
in another: But as he is offered, so must he be
received.</p>
                     <p>3. Scripture no where tyeth Justification to
the receipt of him as our Priest onely, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must not doe so.</p>
                     <p>4. How commonly doth Scripture joyn his
Offices together, calling him usually, <hi>Our
Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. If we receive him not as King, we receive
him not as an entire Saviour: For he saveth
us, not onely by dying for us, but also by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
us really into communion with God,
and guiding us by his Laws, and protecting
and perfecting us by his Government, and
subduing our enemies.</p>
                     <p>6. His Kingly Office is a true part of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Office of Mediatorship: Now the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Acts in Morall respects, lyeth in their
true suitableness to the nature of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
As God is not truely loved, except he
be loved entirely: so neither is Christ truely
received, if you receive him not entirely. It
is a lame, partiall Faith, and no true Faith,
that taketh Christ onely in the Notion of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106762:90"/>
from guilt and punishment, without
any accepting of him, as our Lord and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.
Though I beleeve that the hope of
being pardoned &amp; saved is the first thing that
moveth men to receive Christ, yet do they,
being so moved, receive him as their Lord also,
or else they doe not receive him sincerely.</p>
                     <p>7. The exalting of his Kingly Office, is as
principall an end of his dying, &amp; of his becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Mediatour, as is the saving of us, and
the exalting of his Priestly Office. See the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Psal.</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. To this end he both
dyed, rose and revived, that he might be Lord
both of the dead, and the living. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the receiving of him as Priest alone, is not
like to be the Condition of our Justification.
So that if Christ put both into the Condition,
we must not separate what he hath joyned.
But the main ground of their Error, who
think otherwise, is this: They think Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the mercy offered, doth make it ours
immediately in a naturall way, as the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a thing from men; And so as if he that
accepted pardon, should have it, and he that
accepted sanctitie should have it, &amp;c. But
Christ (as I have shewed) establisheth his
Offices and Authority, before he bestow his
mercies; and though Accepting be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
condition, yet doth it not conferre the
title to us, as it is an accepting primarily, but
as it is the Covenants Condition: If we should
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106762:90"/>
take possession when we have no title in Law,
God would quickly challenge us for our bold
usurpation, and deale with us, as with him
that intruded without the Wedding garment;
There is more adoe then come in: and sit
down, and take what we have a mind to: God
hath put all his Sons Offices into the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be received and submitted to: either
all or none, must be accepted: And if All be
in the Condition, then the receiving of all
must needs Justifie upon the grounds that I
have laid down before.</p>
                     <p>To the 67. That the promises or benefits
are not the immediate proper object of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
Faith, is evident from the gorunds
already layd down: As also from the constant
language of the Gospell, which maketh Faith
to lie in receiving, believing in him, and in
his name, &amp;c. still making Christ himself the
immediate object. Therefore if Mr <hi>Cotton</hi> say
as the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> represents him, That Faith
can be nothing but a laying hold of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
which God hath made; (in his <hi>Tract. of
Truth and Vni. pag.</hi> 152.) it is a foul error in so
weighty a point; as is also his other, of Faith
justifying and saving only declaratively. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that first less principall Act of Faith, which
we call Assent, hath the truth of the Gospell
revelation for its neerest and most imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
object; but (I think, by the leave of
those who contradict) not its onely nor chief
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106762:91"/>
object: The truth of the proposition is but a
means to the apprehending of the truth of the
thing proposed; nor the truth of the history,
but a glass to shew us the truth of the Acts
which it relateth. So that even the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it self doth apprehend the person and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Christ in their Metaphisicall Verity,
by means of its apprehension of the Logicall
and Morall verity of the Relation: and though
the truth of the Word be the neerest object of
Assent, yet the truth of Christs person, nature
and offices is the more principall: Or if about
these, it may not have the name of Assent, yet
shall it have the same nature still.</p>
                     <p>To the 68. I think none will contradict it,
and therefore there need nothing be said.</p>

                     <p>IN this brief definition, you have nothing
but what is essentiall to it.</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>genus</hi> I need not mention; when it
is the Act of Faith which I define, you know
the <hi>genus</hi> already.</p>
                     <p>2. The Understandings apprehension of
Christ as a true Redeemer and Saviour, which
in severall respects is called Knowledg or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106762:91"/>
I do imply this, and not express it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though I take it for a real part of Faith,
yet not the most principall and formall part.
And as we use to imply <hi>Corpus,</hi> and not express
it when we define man to be <hi>Animal rationale;</hi>
because the form, or principall essentiall part
part giveth the name: So here (though I
know Assent is not properly a materiall cause)
yet being the less principall Act, it giveth not
the denomination.</p>
                     <p>3. That Christ, as Lord and Saviour is the
proper object, I have proved before. His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
Office whereby he is the Teacher of
his Church, Jimply in both these, because
it may in severall respects be reduced to these:
For he teacheth by his Laws and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and his spirits teaching and governing
are scarce distinguishable, and he saveth by
teaching. Also his Office of Husband, and
Head, are in these implyed; they signifying
more the future benefits and priviledges of a
beleever, which he shall receive from Christ
beleeved in, then the primary offices which he
is to acknowledg in beleeving.</p>
                     <p>4. The proper formall act of justifying
Faith, which is most principally essentiall to
it of all other is [accepting:] If I must needs
place it in one only, it should be this.</p>
                     <p>My Reasons are, 1. Because the Scripture
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106762:92"/>
maketh unbelief, and not receiving Christ,
all one, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 11. and beleeving and receiving
Christ, all one, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. So it proclaims this
as the great work of the Gospell, to Take, Eat,
Drink, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. The Gospell is the offer of Christ (and
his benefits to them that first accept himself;)
Therefore Faith must be the accepting of the
thing offered. Both these are plain in <hi>Rev. 22.
17. Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life
freely:</hi> There is the free offer, upon condition
of coming and taking, or accepting.</p>
                     <p>3. The will is the commanding faculty of
the soul, therefore its act is the principall act,
and that is accepting.</p>
                     <p>4. Christ is presented to us in the Gospell,
as a Suitor, beseeching us by his Spirit and
Embassadors, and wooing us to himself, and
the enjoying of him, which this driveth at, is
called our Marriage to him, and we his Spouse,
and he our Husband: Now you know that
which tyeth the knot of Marriage is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
or Consent.</p>
                     <p>5. Yea the very nature of a Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
this. Consent maketh it a compleat
Covenant. Therefore I said before <hi>pag.</hi> 219.
That <hi>Acceptance, Consent, Heart-Covenanting, and
Self-resigning,</hi> are the proper essentiall Acts of
this Faith. For all these are the Wills acts to
this their object, which are of flat necessity to
the very tying of the Covenant or Marriage
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106762:92"/>
knot. <hi>Rom. 10. 10. With the heart man beleeveth
unto Righteousnesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here let me minde you of one usefull
observation more.</p>
                     <p>The Covenanting on our part, is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
part of the Conditions of the Covenant.
Though this may seem strange, that a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
and performing Conditions, should
be all most all one. But that is the free nature
of the Grace of the Covenant. As if you mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a poor woman that hath nothing, you will
give her your self, and all you have, meerly
upon Condition that she will Consent to have
you: And that Consent is all the Condition
on her part, for obtaining present possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(I say, <hi>Acceptance, Consent, Covenanting, Self-resigning;</hi>
which are in a manner all one
thing:) But because the end of the marriage is
the faithfull performance of Marriage duties,
though meer Consent were the onely Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the first possession, and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of her Consent is the chief Condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of continuing her possession; yet the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of those Marriage duties, and not
going into others, is part of the Condition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of that continuance: So it is in the present
case of Justification.</p>
                     <p>5. Let me here also tell you, that I take love
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106762:93"/>
to Christ as our Saviour and Lord, to be essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
to this Acceptance: and so some degree of
Love to be part of Justifying Faith, and not
properly a fruit of it, as it is commonly taken.
My reasons are,</p>
                     <p>1. The Wills serious apprehension of a thing
Good, which we call at earnest Willing it, and
Accepting it, is (in my judgement the same
thing as Love, in an other name. Love is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but such an earnest Willing, choosing
and Accepting it as it is Good.</p>
                     <p>It is generally acknowledged, that the
Affections are but the Motions or Acts of the
Will. And if Love be an Act of the same Will,
and have the same Object with Consent, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
Acceptance, &amp;c. Why should it not
then be the same Act? Onely Acceptance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth
its Object as offered; Election consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
it, as propounded with some other
competitor; Consent considereth it, as we are
perswaded and invited to it: But all these are
extrinsecall considerations: They all consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Object as Good, and so doth Love.</p>
                     <p>You may object. 1. Then Desire and Hope
may be essentiall to Faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I Answ.</hi> That Love which they imply in
them is: but Desire and Hope, as such, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
consider their object as absent, which
this Justifiing Faith doth not.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Object.</hi> Scripture oft distinguisheth
Faith and Love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:106762:93"/>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Sometime Faith is taken for Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall
faith, or Faith of Miracles, and then it
may be distinguised. 2. Sometime true
Faith is taken in the strictest sence, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
larglier, as I shall shew anon. 3. But
especially; so do I distinguish of Love, as it is
considered by it self, and as it is an essentiall
part of this Acceptance. Love respecteth its
Object meerly as Good, in it self and to the
Lover. But Consent and Acceptance have
severall other respects, as is expressed: And
yet there may be Love in all such Acceptance;
though not properly Acceptance in all Love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Then Love Justifieth as well as
Faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I Answ.</hi> When it is thus considered in
Faiths Acceptance, it is not called by the name
of Love, but loseth its name, as a lesser River
that falleth into a greater; therefore it is not
said that Love Justifieth; but Faith that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(even in its essentiall work of Accepting)
by Love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But Love is the greater Grace, and
shall out-live Faith, and Faith should rather
then be swallowed up in Love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Love considering its object onely
as Good, shall continue for ever, because the
Goodness of its object shall so continue: But
Acceptance, Consent, &amp;c. have other additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
considerations in their Objects which will
vanish. But which is the chiefest Grace in it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106762:94"/>
self, is not the question, but which is the
chiefest in the present work. Now seeing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
Acceptance, &amp;c. are the chief as to Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that Love which is essentially in them
may well lose its name here: seeing in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
of Justifying it is considered but as an
essentiall part of the main duty.</p>
                     <p>My next-Reason is, because Christ doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it in the Gospel, as of the same necessity,
with the same promises annexed to it, <hi>Io. 16. 27.
For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have
loved me, and beleeved, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 14. 21. <hi>He that
loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love
him, and shew my self to him.</hi> Jam. 1. 12. &amp; 2. 5.
<hi>The Crown and Kingdom is prepared for them that
love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 22. <hi>If any man love not the
Lord Iesus Christ, let him be Anathema Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natha,</hi>
Ephes. 6. 24. In a word, Faith is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
duty, containing divers Acts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this seemeth to me to be part: Neither can
I yet conceive, how there can be a cordiall
Acceptance of Christ, as our only Saviour, and
Love not to be an essentiall part of that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance:
but if a finer wit can apprehend the
difference better; yet as (I said) Faith being
considered here in Morall and Politick
respects, and not in its strict naturall quiddity,
may essentially be an Affectionate Acceptance,
for all that.</p>
                     <p>If any think fitter to make a wider diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the nature of Faith and Love
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106762:94"/>
to Christ, I will not contend; for the matter is
not great: that both are necessary to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
is doubtless: and that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
in, apprehending Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>: And that Love
is a part of the Condition of the Covenant, is
also undoubted and therefore will have some
hand in the business of Justification, as I shall
further clear.</p>
                     <p>6. I put in the word <hi>onely</hi> in the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
because (as is said before) I take the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of Christ before all others, and
taking him for our Onely Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
to be the essentiall difference of true
Faith. There is a two-fold Verity or Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in our duties requisite. 1. The verity
of their naturall Being, which is called
their Metaphysicall Truth. 2. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or sincerity of them as Duties or
Graces, which is their Morall sincerity:
This last consisteth in the true suiting of the
Act to its Object. For example, one
man pretendeth to love his wife, and doth
not: There is neither Naturall nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Truth. Another doth love her, but
not half so well as other women: There
is the Metaphysicall Truth, but not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
A third loveth her as a wife above others:
There is both Metaphysicall Truth and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                     <p>So it is in our Love to God: To Love him
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106762:95"/>
as the chief Good, is to love him as he is: And
he that loveth him never so much, and yet
loveth any thing else, as much or more;
though his Love have a Metaphysicall Truth
of Being, yet it hath no Morall sincerity at all:
So that the Preferring God before all, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him for our Onely God, is the very point
of sincerity of Love. Why, just so it is about
our Faith: The taking him unfeignedly for
our onely Lord and Saviour, is the very point
of the sincerity of our Faith in Christ. As Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
is the most proper violation of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Covenant, except actuall renouncing
and deserting: So the taking of any other
Lord or Saviour besides Christ, or conjunct
with him, is the most apparent violation of the
bond of our Covenant, and most contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the nature and Essence of Justifying
Faith: except onely the Actuall renouncing
Christ, and the Covenant it self, by full Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
which is an unpardonable sin, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6.
&amp; 10. 26. Yet in subordination to Christ, we
may have other Lords and Saviours, but not in
competition and co-ordination. Some of his
Government he exerciseth by Ministers, and
some by Magistrates under him (for I cannot
consent to them that say, the Magistrate is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Officer of God as Creator, and not of
Christ the Mediator; because all things are
delivered into his hands, and he is made head
over all.) Some also of his saving works, he
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106762:95"/>
performeth by instruments and means: And
what they so perform under him, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
without any derogation from
him at all.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps some may think that the
Scripture Phrase seemeth rather to intimate,
that Faith is an Assent, and not such an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
and Consent, as is before mentioned;
because it oft times requireth but this, To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;
he that should come into the world, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To which I answer, 1. This proveth onely,
that this Knowledg or Assent is part of Faith:
but not that it is the whole. 2. It is the use
of Scripture to drive at that duty which is
most unknown, neglected, or resisted; and to
speak little of others, where there was then
lesse need to speak, though perhaps the duty
be in it self more weighty: Therefore Christ
and the Apostles did spend most of their pains
to perswade the Jewes to this Assent: That the
Messias should come, be their deliverer, they
all knew: Even the poor woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>
could tell that, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 25. And so ready were
they to Receive him, if they had known him,
that it was the generall expectation, and desire
of the people, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. But to perswade them
that Jesus was the Christ, here lay the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Therefore as Dr. <hi>Ames Medull. cap. 3. §.</hi> 20.)
though sometime Assent to the Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God and Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 50. be taken
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106762:96"/>
for true Faith; yet the speciall Election or
Apprehension (for that the meanes by <hi>Fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia
§.</hi> 13.) is still included; and those words
do but determine and apply that <hi>Fiducia</hi> to
Christ, which is presupposed to be already to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Messiah.</p>
                     <p>And let me conclude this with one more
practically usefull observation. From this
definition of faith, now men may see what to
enquire after in their searching of their
estates. As faith, being the Gospell-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is the main thing to be looked for; So
here you see what that faith is. The ignorance
of this deceiveth and troubleth multitudes.
Some think it lieth in Assurance: Some, in a
quieting their hearts in confidence on Christ:
Some think, as M. <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> That it is nothing
else but a perswasion more or less of Gods
love: And then when poor troubled souls
do feel neither assurance, confidence, nor
perswasion of that love, they conclude that
they have no Faith. And how will these
mistaken Teachers help them to comfort?
Why, as Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> doth: sometime to tell
them, Christ hath beleeved for them; and
sometime to tell them plainly, that he can but
commend them to the Lord, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and finisher of Faith: and sometime to
tell them, that they should not question their
faith, any more then Christ himself. Thus
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106762:96"/>
their first way of comfort is to tell them, they
do ill to question their faith: If that would
serve, all the world might have comfort, and
there needs no more. If that will not do,
then Christ hath beleeved for them: Yet if that
will serve, there is as much comfort for one as
another. But what if they say still, I cannot
beleeve, (that is, as you expound Belief:) why,
then he confesseth plainly, he is at a loss; he can
drive on the work of comforting no further;
he can do no more but pray for them. <hi>pag.
31.</hi> Is it not a wonder that this lamentable
Comforter should be so valued by the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
spirits? I was many years my self under
perplexing doubts: If I had heard such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
words as these, they would sooner
have driven me to dispair then to comfort. He
that hath not so much wit as to discern so
gross fallacies, may assoon be comforted by
a false and impertinent argument, as by a
sound one. <hi>Quest.</hi> But how would you
comfort such a one, that faith he cannot
beleeve? <hi>Ans.</hi> Why, I would first make him
know, that the very essentiall form of faith
lieth in the Will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> acceptance of an offered
Christ: Then would I know of him,
whether he be willing thus to have Christ
both for Lord and Saviour, or not?
If he say, He is willing: I shall answer, That
then he doth beleeve; and then he is
Justified: for his Willingness is his very
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106762:97"/>
Consent or Acceptance (and that Consent is
true Faith: Christ expecteth no more to make
up the match. If the match break, it must be
either, because Christ is unwilling, or because
he is unwilling: not Christ; for he is the Suitor,
and Intreater, and Offerer: Not himself; for he
confesseth that he is willing. If he say, I am
not willing: I should ask; Why then do you
look after it, or regard it? Do men enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, and lament the want of it, which they
are not willing to have? either temptation or
melancholly maketh you not know your
own minde; or else you do but dissemble in
pretending trouble and sad complaints. If you
be indeed unwilling, I have no comfort for
you, till you are willing; but must turn to
perswasions to make you willing: I should
answer, The Condition of the Covenant is not
the Perfection, but the sincerity of Faith or
Consent: which way goes the prevailing bent
or choyce of your will. If Christ were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, would you accept him, or reject him?
If you would heartily accept him for your
only Lord and Saviour, I dare say, you are a
true Beleever.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see the comfortable use of right
understanding, what justifying faith is; and the
great danger and inconvenience that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the common mistakes in this point.</p>

                  <p>FAith in the largest sence, as it comprehendeth all

of the Law, the truth of its threatening, the
evill of his own sin, and the greatness of his misery
hereupon, and with all of the Nature and Offices,
Sufficiency and Excellency of Iesus Christ, the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

his free offer to all that will accept him for their Lord

Gospell, and accept of Christ as his only Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
to bring them to God their chiefest good, and
to present them pardoned and just before him, and to
bestow upon them a more glorious inheritance, and
do accordingly rest on him as their Saviour, and
sincerely (though imperfectly) obey him as their
Lord, forgiving others, loving his people, bearing
what sufferings are imposed, diligently using his
means and Ordinances, and confessing and bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their sins against him, and praying for pardon;
and all this sincerely, and to the end.</p>

                     <p>THis is the Condition of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
at large, That all this is sometime
called Faith, as taking its name from
the primary, principall, vitall part, is plain
hence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:106762:98"/>
1. In that Faith is oft called <hi>the Obeying of
the Gospell</hi> but the Gospell commandeth all
this, <hi>Rom. 10. 16. 1 Pet. 1. 22. &amp; 4. 17. 2 Thes.
1. 8. Gal. 3. 1. &amp; 5, 7. Heb.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
                     <p>2. The fulfilling of the Conditions of the
new Covenant is oft called by the name of
Faith, &amp; so opposed to the fulfilling the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the old Covenant, called works;
But these forementioned are parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the new Covenant, and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
or included in Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12, 23, 25.
Not that Faith is properly taken for its fruits,
or confounded with them, but (as I told you
before) it is named in the stead of the whole
Condition, all the rest being implyed as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to it, in some of the respects mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
under the 62 Position.</p>
                     <p>It may be here demanded, 1. Why I do
make affiance or recombency an immediate
product of Faith, when it is commonly taken
to be, the very justifying Act?</p>
                     <p>I answer: 1. I have proved already, that
Consent or acceptance is the principall Act,
and Affiance doth necessarily follow that. 2.
For the most of my Reasons; that Affiance is
a following Act, and not the principall, they
are the same with those of Dr <hi>Downame</hi> against

                     <p>I Know this will hardly down with many.
But I know nothing can be said against it,
but by denying the Antecedent, <hi>viz.</hi> That
Faith as it Accepteth Christ for Lord and King
doth Justifie. But that I have proved before.
If it be one Faith, and have the Object enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
propounded as one, and be one entire
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106762:100"/>
principall part of the Covenants Condition;
then sure it cannot be divided in the work of
Justifying. This may be easily apprehended,
if men will but understand these three things.
1. That Faith is no Physicall or naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Receiving of Christ at all: But meerly a
morall <hi>Receiving</hi> though performed by a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
Act of <hi>Accepting:</hi> For thy Will doth not
naturally touch and take in the person of
Christ; That is an impossible thing, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Transubstantiation, men may say:
(Though the Essence of the Godhead is every
where.) 2. That this accepting which is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Receiving doth not, nor possibly can,
make Christ ours immediately and properly,
as it is a Receiving; But mediately and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
onely: The formall cause of our
interest, being Gods Donation by the Gospell
Covenant. 3. That this Covenant maketh a
whole entire Faith its Condition: A Receiving
of whole Christ with the whole soul: It is, as
<hi>Amesius, Actio totius hominis;</hi> And if the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
doe make Christ as King, the object of
that Faith which is its Condition, as well as
Christ, as a Deliverer or Priest; Then may it
be as fit a <hi>Medium</hi> for our Justification, as the
other.</p>
                     <p>That Obedience is as neere a fruit of Faith,
as Affiance, is evident; if you take it for the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of the Soul, in Acts that are no more
remote from the heart then Affiance is: And
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106762:100"/>
so is the Obedience of our Actions externall
in its formall respect (as Obedience): though
not in its materiall, because the imperate Acts
are not all so neer the fountain as the Elicite.
I take it here for granted, that Dr <hi>Downames</hi>
arguments in the place fore-cited, have proved
Affiance to be but a fruit of the principall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
Act of Faith.</p>

                  <p>FRom what hath been said, it appeareth in what
sence Faith only justifieth; and in what sence
Works also justifie: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Faith only justifieth, as
it implieth and includeth all other parts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the new Covenant: and is so put in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Works of the Law, or the personall Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
of the old Covenant. 2. Faith only justifieth
as the great principall master duty of the Gospell or
chief part of its Condition, to which all the rest are
some way reducible. 3. Faith onely doth not justifie
in opposition to the Works of the Gospell; but those
Works do also justifie, as the secondary, less principall
parts of the condition of the Covenant.</p>

loudest out-cries raised against it: and will-make
some cry out, <hi>Heresie, Popery, So<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cinianism!</hi> and what not? For my own part the
Searcher of hearts knoweth, that not singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
affectation of novelty, nor any good
will to Popery, provoketh me to entertain
it; But that I have earnestly sought the Lords
direction upon my knees, before I durst ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
on it: And that I resisted the light
of this Conclusion as long as I was able. But
a man cannot force his own understanding,
if the evidence of truth force it not; though
he may force his pen, or tongue, to silence or
dissembling.</p>
                     <p>That which I shall do further, is, to give

some Objections. Though, if the foregoing

obedience must justifie in the same way as

and all other the like places, the Apostle doth profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
exclude the Works of the Law only from Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
but never at all the Works of the Gospell as
they are the Condition of the new Covenant.</p>

                     <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
                     <p>IN opening this I shall thus proceed: 1. I
will shew the clearness of that in <hi>Iames</hi> for
the point in question. 2. That <hi>Paul</hi> is to be
understood in the sence expressed. 3. How
this differeth from the Papists Exposition of
these places: and from their doctrine of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Works. 4. And how from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian
doctrine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:106762:102"/>
1. The ordinary Expositions of St. <hi>Iames</hi>
are these two: 1. That he speaks of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before men, and not before God. 2. That
he speaks of Works, as justifying our Faith,
and not as justifying our persons: or (as Mr.
<hi>Pembles</hi> phrase is) the Apostle when he saith
Works justifie, must be undestood by a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonimy,</hi>
that a working Faith justifieth. That
the former Exposition is falfe may appeare
thus.</p>
                     <p>1. The worlds Justification freeth us but
from the Worlds Accusation, to which it is
opposed: And therefore it is but either a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
from the Accusation of humane
Lawes; Or else a particular Justification of us
in respect of some particular facts; or else an
usurped Judgement and Justification: For
they are not constituted our Judges by God:
And therefore we may say with <hi>Paul, It is a
small thing with me to be judged of you, or of mans
Iudgement:</hi> And so a small thing to be Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by men from the Accusations of the Law
of God.</p>
                     <p>But the Justification in <hi>Iames</hi> is of greater
moment: as appeares in the Text. For, 1. It
is such as: salvation dependeth on; <hi>vers.</hi> 14. 2.
It is such as followeth onely a living Faith: but
the world may as well Justifie us when we have
no Faith at all.</p>
                     <p>I therefore affirme, 1. The World is no
lawfull Judge of our Righteousness before
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106762:102"/>
God, or in reference to the Law of God. 2.
Neither are they competent or capable Judges.
They cannot possibly passe any certaine true
sentence of our Righteousness or unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.
3. If they could, yet Works are no
certain <hi>medium,</hi> or evidence, whereby the
world can know us to be Righteous: For there
is no outward work which an Hypocrite may
not perform: and inward works they cannot
discern: nor yet the principles from which, nor
the ends to which our works proceed and are
intended. There is as much need of a divine
heart-searching knowledge, to discern the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of Works, as of Faith it self. So that if it
be not certain, that the Text speaks of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
before God, I scarce know what to be
certain of.</p>
                     <p>Once more: 1. Was <hi>Abraham</hi> justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men for a secret Action! 2. Or for such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Action as the killing of his onely Son would
have been? 3. Was not he the justifier here,
who was the imputer of Righteousness? But
God was the imputer of Righteousness, <hi>vers
23.</hi> therefore God was the Justifier, So I leave
that interpretation to sleep.</p>
                     <p>2. That it is the Person and not his Faith
onely, which is here said to be justified by
Works, is as plain in the Text almost as can be
spoken, <hi>vers. 21. Abraham</hi> (not his faith)
is said to be justified by works. <hi>Vers.</hi> 24.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106762:103"/>
By Works <hi>a man</hi> is justified: If by <hi>a man</hi> were
meant, <hi>a mans Faith,</hi> then it would run thus
sencelessely: By Works a mans Faith is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and not by Faith onely, so <hi>Vers</hi> 25,</p>
                     <p>3. For Mr. <hi>Pembles</hi> interpretation, That by
<hi>Works</hi> is meant <hi>a Working Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Answer, I dare not teach the holy Ghost
to speak; nor force the Scripture; nor raise
an exposition so far from the plain importan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the words, without apparent necessity:
But here is not the least necessitie: There
being not the least inconvenience, that I Know
of, in affirming Justification by Works, in the
fore-explained sence. Men seldom are bold
with Scripture, in forcing it; But they are first
bold with Conscience inforcing it. If it were
but some one Phrase dissonant from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
language of Scripture, I should not
doubt but it must be reduced to the rest. But
when it is the very scope of a Chapter, in plain
and frequent expressions, no whit dissonant
from any other Scripture; I think he that may
so wrest it, as to make it unsay what it saith,
may as well make him a Creed of his own
let the Scripture say what it will to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
what is this but with the Papist to make
the Scripture a Nose of wax? If Saint <hi>Iames</hi>
speak it so oft over and over; that Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is by works, and not by Faith onely,
I will see more cause before I deny it; or say,
he meanes a Working Faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:106762:103"/>
If he so understand <hi>a Working Faith</hi> as that
it justifieth principally as Faith, and lesse prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
as working, then I should not differ
from him, only I should think the Scripture
Phrase is more fafe and more propert; But
he understandeth it according to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
assertion and exposition, that <hi>Fides so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
justificat, non autem fides sola:</hi> Faith alone
justifieth, but not that faith which is alone.
The question therefore is, Whether Works
do concur with Faith (as part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition)
in the very businesse of Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
or whether they are onely Concomitants
to that Faith which effecteth the business
without their assistance? The ground of the
mistake lyeth here: They first ascribe to
much to Faith; and then because that <hi>nimium</hi>
which they give to Faith is not found agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Works, therefore they conclude, that
we are not justified by works at all. They
think that Faith is an Instrumentall efficient
cause of Justification (which that properly it is
not, I have proved before:) when if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that it justifieth but as <hi>a Causa sine
quanon,</hi> or condition, they would easily yeeld,
that Works do so too. I will not say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Works do effectually produce our
Justification (For faith doth not so: Nor that
they justifie as equall parts of the condition:
For faith is the principall. But that they justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
as the secondary lesse-principall part of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106762:104"/>
the Condition, (not onely proving our Faith
to be sound, but themselves being in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation
as well as Faith, and justifying in the
same kind of causality or procurement as
Faith, though not in equality with it) I prove
thus: 1. When it is said that we are <hi>Iustified
by Works</hi> the word <hi>By,</hi> implyeth more then an
Idle concomitancy: If they only stood by,
while Faith doth all, it could not be said, that
we are Justified by Works.</p>
                     <p>2. When the Apostle saith, <hi>By Works, and not
By Faith onely,</hi> he plainly makes them conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant
in procurement, or in that kind of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality
which they have: Especially, seeing he
saith not, as he is commonly interpreted, <hi>not By
Faith which is alone;</hi> but <hi>not, by Faith only,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>3. Therefore he saith that <hi>Faith is dead
being alone,</hi> Because it is dead as to the use and
purpose of Justifying: for in it self it hath a life
according to its quality still. This appears
from his comparison in the former verse 16.
that this is the death he speaks of. And so
Works make Faith alive, as to the attainment
of its end of Justification.</p>
                     <p>4. The Analysis which <hi>Piscator</hi> and <hi>Pemble</hi>
give, contradicteth not this Assertion. If in
stead of <hi>a Working Faith,</hi> they will but keep the
Apostles own words, I shall agree to most of
their Analysis. (Though conclusious drawn
from the Analysis are often weak, it is so easie
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106762:104"/>
for every man to feign an Analysis suited to
his ends) onely the explication of the 22.
<hi>vers.</hi> they seem to fail in. For when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
saith, that Faith did, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
work in and with his works, it cleary
aimeth at such a working in, and with, as
maketh them conjunct in the work of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying:
And when he saith that <hi>Faith was
made perfect with Works,</hi> it is not (as
they and others interpret) only a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting
to be perfect. But as the habit
is perfected in its Acts, because they
are the end to which it tendeth; And
as Marriage is perfected <hi>per congressum &amp;
procreationem:</hi> or any Covenant when its
conditions are performed. Faith alone is
not the entire perfect Condition of the
New Covenant: but Faith with Repentance
and sincere Obedience, is; A condemned
Gally-slave being Redeemed, is to have
his deliverance upon condition that he
take his Redeemer for his Master: This
doth so directly imply, that he must obey
him, that his conditions are not perfectly
fulfilled, except he do obey him as his
Master: And so taking him for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
and Master, and obeying him as
his Master, do in the same kind procure
his continued freedom. Indeed his meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and consent doth procure his first deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
but not the continuance of it. So I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106762:105"/>
that the very first point of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is by Faith alone, without either the
concomitancy or co-operation of Works; for
they cannot be performed in an instant: But
the continuance and accomplishment of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is not without the joynt procurement
of obedience. As a woman is made a mans
wife, and instated in all that he hath, upon
meer acceptance, consent, and contracts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
conjugall actions, affection, the forsaking
of others, &amp;c. are implyed in the Covenant,
&amp; expressed as the necessary for future; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if there be no conjugall actions, affections
or fidelity follow, the Covenant is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
nor shall the woman enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
expected. It is so here, especially seeing
Christ may dis-estate the violaters of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
at pleasure.</p>
                     <p>This sheweth us how to answer the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of some: 1. Say they, <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith
was perfect long before. <hi>Answ.</hi> Not as it is
a fulfilling of the Covenants Condition,
which also requireth its acting by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Abraham</hi> (say they) was justified long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Isaac</hi> was offered, therefore that could
be but a manifesting of it. <hi>Answ.</hi> Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a continued Act. God is still justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
and the Gospell still justifying. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
Justification was not ended before.</p>
                     <p>3. Mr <hi>Pemble</hi> thinks, that as a man cannot
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106762:105"/>
be said, <hi>[to live by Reason]</hi> though he may be
said, <hi>to live by a reasonable soul,</hi> and as a plant
liveth not <hi>per augmentationem, &amp; si per animam
auctricem:</hi> So we may be said to be justified by
a working Faith, but not by Works.</p>
                     <p>I Answ. Both Speeches are proper. And
his simile doth not square or suit with the
Case in hand: For Justifying is an extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
consequent, or product of Faith, and no
proper effect at all: Much lesse an effect flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from its own formall essence, as the life
of a man doth from a Reasonable soul, and the
life of a Plant from a Vegetative. I hope it
may be said properly enough, that a Servant
doth his work, and pleaseth his Master, by
Reason, as well as by a reasonable soul: And
a Plant doth please the Gardiner by augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as well as <hi>per animam austricem.</hi> So that a
man pleaseth God, and is Justified by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Obedience, as well as by a working
Faith.</p>
                     <p>3. How this differeth from the Papists
Doctrine, I need not tell any Scholar who
hath read their writings.</p>
                     <p>1. They take Justifying for Sanctifying:
so do not I. 2. They quite overthrow and
deny the most reall difference betwixt the
Old Covenant and the New: and make them
in a manner all one: But I build this Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Doctrine, chiefly upon the clear diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing
and opening of the Covenants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:106762:106"/>
3. When they say, We are Justified by
VVorks of the Gospell; they mean only, that
we are sanctified by Works that follow Faith,
and are bestowed by Grace, they meriting our
inherent justice at Gods hands. In a word,
there is scarce any one Doctrins, wherein
even their most learned Schoolmen are more
sottishly ignorant then in this of Justification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so that when you have read them with profit
and delight on some other subjects; when they
come to this, you would pitty them, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
their ignorance.</p>
                     <p>They take our Works to be part of our
Legall Righteousness: I take them not to be
the smallest portion of it: But onely a part of
our Evangelicall Righteousness; or of the
Condition upon which Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shall be ours.</p>
                     <p>5. But what difference is there betwixt it
and the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrin of Justification?
<hi>Answ.</hi> In some mens mouths, <hi>Socinianisme</hi> is
but a word of reproach, or a stone to throw
at the head of any man that saith not as they.
Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> is a <hi>Socinian,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and why not <hi>Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,
Pareus,</hi> &amp;c. if some zealous Divines
know what <hi>Socinianisme</hi> is. But I had rather
study what is Scripture-truth, then what is
<hi>Socinianisme:</hi> I do not think that <hi>Faustus</hi> was so
<hi>Infaustus,</hi> as to hold nothing true: That which
he held according to Scripture is not <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianisme.</hi>
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:106762:106"/>
For my part, I have read little of
their writings; but that little gave me
enough, and made me cast them away with
abhorrence. In a word: The <hi>Socinians</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
not that Christ had satisfied the
Law for us; and consequently is none of our
Legall Righteousness: but onely hath set us
a copy to write after, and is become our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
and that we are Justified by following
him as a Captain and guide to heaven: And
so all our proper Righteousness is in this
obedience. Most accursed Doctrine! So
farre am I from this, that I say, The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
which we must plead against the
Lawes accusations, is not one grain of it
in our Faith of Works: but all out of
us in Christs satisfaction. Onely our
Faith, Repentance, and sincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
are the Conditions upon which we
must partake of the former. And yet
such Conditions as Christ worketh in us free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by his Spirit.</p>
                     <p>6. Lastly, let us see whether St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or
any other Scripture do contract this. And,
for my part, I know not one word in the Bible
that hath any strong appearance of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to it. The usuall places quoted are
these, <hi>Rom. 3. 28. &amp; 4. 2. 3. 14. 15. 16. Gal. 2. 16.
&amp; 3. 21. 22. Ephes. 2. 89. Phil.</hi> 3. 8. 9. In all
which, and all other the like places, you shall
easily perceive. 1. That the Apostles dispute
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106762:107"/>
is upon the question, What is the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which we must plead against the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of the Law? or by which we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as the proper Righteousness of that Law?
And this he well concludeth, is neither
Works nor Faith. But the Righteousnesse
which is by Faith; that is, Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>But now St. <hi>Iames</hi> his question is, What is
the Condition of our Justification by this
Righteousness of Christ? Whether Faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
or Works also?</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Paul</hi> doth either in expresse words, or in
the sence and scope of his speech, exclude
onely the works of the Law, that is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Conditions of the Law our selves.
But never the fulfilling of the Gospell-Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that we may have part in Christ. Indeed,
if a man should obey the Commands of the
Gospell, with a Legall intent, that it might be a
Righteousnesse conform to the Law of Works;
this Obedience is not Evangelicall, but Legall
obedience: For the form giveth the name.</p>
                     <p>3, <hi>Paul</hi> doth by the word, <hi>Faith,</hi> especially
direct your thoughts to Christ beleeved in;
For to be justified by Christ; and to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by receiving Christ is with him all
one.</p>
                     <p>4. And when he doth mention Faith as the
Condition, he alwayes implyeth obedience to
Christ. Therefore <hi>Beleeving</hi> and <hi>obeying</hi> the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106762:107"/>
                        <hi>Gospell,</hi> are put for the two Summaries of the
whole Conditions. The next will clear
this.</p>

                  <p>THat we are justified by sincere obedience to

                     <p>THe Antecedent is manifest, in that Scripture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Faith a Condition of both Iustification and
Salvation: and so it doth Obedience also, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
explained. Therefore we are justified, that we may
be saved. It would be as derogatory to Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
if we be saved by works, as if we be justified
by them. Neither is there any way to the former but
by the latter. That which a man is justified by, he is
saved by. Though Glorification be an adding of a
greater happinesse then we lost, so justification is not
enough thereto: Yet on our part, they have the same
Conditions.</p>
                     <p>Yet here I say still, <hi>Our full Iustification</hi> because, as I
have shewed our first possession of it is upon our meer
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106762:108"/>
Faith or Contract with Christ. But I think our Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
will be acknowledged to have the same Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with our finall Iustification at the barre of Christ.
And why not to our entire continued justification on
earth? You may Object. Perseverance is a condition
of our Glorification; but not of our Iustification here.
I Answer, 1. Perseverance is nothing but the same
Conditions persevering. 2. As the sincerity of Faith
is requisite to our first possession of justification; so the
perseverance of Faith, is the Condition of persevering
Iustification. See <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                     <p>2. That Obedience is a Condition of our Salvation
is undoubted, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. 6. Christ is the Author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Salvation to all them that obey him; so fully, <hi>Rom.
2. 7. 8. 9. 10. Revel. 22. 14. Blessed are they that do his
commandements, that they may have Right to the tree of
Life, and may enter by the Gates into the City.</hi> And hath that

                     <p>I Have proved this before, <hi>Posit.</hi> 20. I shall
here onely Answer some objections. <hi>Object.</hi> 1.
Christ was baptized because he must fulfill
all Righteousness: But that was no part of the
Legall Righteousness. <hi>Answ.</hi> The Priests were
to be washed when they entred upon their
office: There were many Ceremonious wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
then in force: Either Christs Baptisme
was Legall; or else by <hi>[fulfilling Righteousnesse]</hi>
must needs be meant, The fulfilling all the
works of his own office: whereof one was, the
instituting of Church Ordinances: and he
thought meet to institute this by Example
as well as Doctrine. He that will affirm,
that Christ hath fulfilled Evangelicall Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
for us, as well as Legall, shall
overthrow the office of Christ, and the nature
of Christianity. <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> and
most others say, That he received the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Supper, <hi>Ans.</hi> Wholly without book.
I beleeve not that ever he did it: for the
Scripture no where speaks it: And many absurd
consequences would hardly be avoided: All
the probability for it, is in those words, <hi>I will
drink no more of the fruit of, &amp;c. Answ.</hi> 1. That
may be a Reason why he would not drink
now; and doth not necessarily imply that he
did. 2. But clearly, <hi>Luke</hi> who speaketh distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:106762:109"/>
of the two Cups (which the other do not)
doth apply, and subjoyn these words to the
first Cup, which was before the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
                     <p>2. If it were granted that Christ did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament; yet he never did as an
obedientiall Act to his own Gospell precepts?
Did he obey a Law not yet made? or his own
Law, and so obey himself? Much lesse did he
perform it as a part of the New Covenant
Condition on our part. But as a Law-giver
and not an Obeyer thereof: It was a Law-making
Action, (if any such had been.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> If sincere obedience be a part of
the Condition, then what perplexities will it
cast us into to finde out, when our obedience
is sincere? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This difficulty ariseth
also, if we make it but the Condition of our
Salvation: &amp; yet few, but <hi>Antinomians,</hi> will deny
that. 2. Why is it not as hard to discern the
sincerity of faith as of Obedience. 3. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is then sincere, when Christ is cordially
taken for our onely Lord; and when his Word
is our Law, and the main desire and endeavor
is to please him; and though through preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
of the flesh we slip into sin, yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
part of our will is against it, and we
would not change our Lord for all the
world.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> thinketh, that because we
have so much sin with our Obedience, all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106762:109"/>
have cause to suspect it; and so cannot
conclude Justification from it. As if sincerity
might not stand with infirmity! Or could not
be discerned where there is any remaining im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection!
Might not <hi>Paul</hi> conclude of the
sincerity of his Willingness to obey Christ,
because he did the evill which he would not?
And might he not conclude his Justification
from that Willingness to obey? Read <hi>Ball</hi> of
the Covenant <hi>chap.</hi> 11.</p>

                  <p>TO conclude: It is most clear in the Scripture, and
beyond all dispute, that our Actuall, most proper,
compleat Iustification, at the great Iudgement, will
be according to our Works, and to what we have
done in flesh, whether Good or Evill: which can be
no otherwise then as it was the Condition of that
Iustification. And so Christ, at that great Assize,
will not give his bare Will of Purpose, as the Reason
of his proceedings: but as he governed by a Law; so
he will judg by a Law: and will then give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his Publique Sentence from mens keeping or
breaking the Conditions of his Covenant; that so
the mouths of all may be stopped, and the equity of
his Iudgment may be manifest to all; and that he
may there shew forth his hatred to the sins, and
not onely to the persons of the Condemned; and his
Love to the Obedience and not onely to the persons of
the Iustified.</p>

                     <p>HEre I have these things to prove: 1.
That the Justifying Sentence shall pass
according to Works, as well as Faith. 2.
That the Reason is, because they are parts of
the Condition.</p>
                     <p>For the first, see <hi>Mat. 25. 21, 23. Well done,
good and faithfull servant! Thou hast been faithfull
over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many
things: Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> And
most plain is that from the mouth of the Judg
himself, describing the order of the process at
that day, <hi>Mat. 25. 34, 35. Come ye Blessed! in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> [For] <hi>I was hungry, &amp;c.</hi>
So 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 17. Who without respect of persons judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
according to every mans work.</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 10.
We must all appear before the Iudgment seat of
Christ, that every one may receive the things done in
his body, according to that he hath done, whether
good or bad.</hi> So <hi>Rev. 20. 12. 13. They were judged
every man according to his Works. Heb. 13. 17. Phil.
4. 17. Mat. 12. 36. &amp;c.</hi> But this is evident already.</p>
                     <p>2. As it is beyond doubt that Christ will
then justifie men according to their Works: So
that this is not onely to discover the sincerity
of their Faith, is as evident; but that it is also,
as they are parts of that Evangelicall Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
which is the Condition of their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
1. The very phrases of the Text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
as much, <hi>Mat. 25. 21, 23. Well done good &amp;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106762:110"/>
faithfull servant, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 25. 34, 35. [For] <hi>I
was hungry, &amp;c.</hi> And in the rest <hi>[According] to
their Works.</hi> Can any more be said of Faith,
then that we are justified or judged to Life,
both [for] it, and [according to] it?</p>
                     <p>2. If Works be not then considered as part
of the Condition; how then? 1. Not as the
Righteousness which the Law requireth: For
so shall no man living be justified in the sight
of God, <hi>Rom. 3. 20. Psa.</hi> 143. 2. 2. Not as a meer
sign whereby God doth discern mens faith: For
he seeth it immediately and needeth no sign,
3. Not as a meer sign to satisfie the justified
person himself: For 1. There is no such inti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mation
in the Text. 2. Then it should be no
further usefull then men remain doubtfull of
their sincerity. 3. The godly then know
the sincerity of their Faith. 4. Neither is the
business of that Day, to satisfie the doubting
about the sincerity of their Faith, by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
drawn from their former works: But to
judg and justifie them, and so put them out of
doubt by the Sentence, and by their Glory.</p>
                     <p>4. But the common opinion is, That it is
to satisfie the condemned World of the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Faith of the godly. But this cannot
stand with the Truth: For 1. It is clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
a ground or reason of the Sentence. 2.
And to the Consolation &amp; Justification of the
justified: and not to the satisfaction or convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of others onely or chiefly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:106762:111"/>
3. The poor world will have somewhat else
to take up their thoughts, as the Text shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
to wit, the excusing of the sin for which
they are condemned themselves. <hi>Mat</hi> 25. 44</p>
                     <p>4. It seemeth that Christ doth in the Text
call them <hi>Righteous</hi> in reference to this personall
Evangelicall Righteousness mentioned in
their Justifying Sentence, <hi>vers. 46. The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
into life Eternall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. If Gods Justice engage him, not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
their work and labour of Love, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10,
11, 12. If the dead in Christ are blessed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Works follow them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. If
in every Nation, he that feareth God and
worketh Righteousnes be Accepted of him,
<hi>Act.</hi> 10. 35. If men shall reap the fruit of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
in due time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8, 9. If Ministers
save themselves in taking heed to themselves
and to doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. If he that doth
Righteousness is righteous, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 7. If
whatsoever good thing any man doth, the
same he shall receive of the Lord, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 8.
If hearing and doing be building on a Rock,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 24. If the doers of Gods Will be the
mothers, sisters and brothers of Christ, <hi>Mat.
12. 50, &amp;c.</hi> Then the mention of these works
at judgment, is more then to signifie their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
to the condemned world.</p>
                     <p>6. If Christ mentioned these works to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the world. 1. Either it must be his own
Testimony of these works, that they are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106762:111"/>
evidences of a sincere Faith. 2. Or else
by the discovery which the works doe make
themselves. But 1. Christ may testifie of their
faith immediately as well. 2. Works are no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
signes of Faith to any stander-by, who
knoweth not whether Works themselves are
sincere, or not. See more under the 76. <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any say, that it is to silence the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of Satan, that these works are mentioned
at judgement; The same Answer will serve, as
to the last. Besides, Scripture giveth us no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
of any such accusation; but onely
the managing the Laws Accusation. But if he
should Accuse us falsely of Hypocrisie, as he
did <hi>Iob;</hi> It must be onely Gods heart-sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
knowledg of our sincerity that can
cleare us.</p>
                     <p>Yet do I not deny in all this, but that
Works are effects of Faith, and to the person
himself, who knoweth their sincerity, they
may be some Argument of the sincerity of
Faith, and God will vindicate his peoples Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
before all, and be admired in them.
But his Justification primarily respecteth the
Law, and his own Justice, and the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Salvation of the Justified, and but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely
the beholders.</p>
                     <p>Let me conclude with two or three cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Quaeries concerning the inconvenience
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106762:112"/>
of the contrary doctrine.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Qu.</hi> Doth it not needlesly constrain men
to wrest most plain and frequent expressions
of Scripture?</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Qu.</hi> Doth it not uphold that dangerous
pillar of the Antinomian Doctrine, that we
must not work or perform our duties for Life
and Salvation; but only from Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
That we must not make the attaining
of Justification or Salvation an end of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
but obey in thankfulness only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are saved and justified? A doctrine
which I have elsewhere confuted; and if it were
reduced to practise by all that hold it, (as I
hope it is not,) would undoubtedly damn
them: For he that seeks not, and that striveth
not to enter, shall never enter. Now if good
Works or sincere Obedience to Christ our
Lord, be no part of the Condition of our full
Justification and Salvation, Who will use them
to that end? For how it can procure Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as a means, and not by way of Condition,
I cannot conceive.</p>
                     <p>3 <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether this doctrine doth not tend
to drive Obedience out of the world? For if
men do once beleeve, that it is not so much
as a part of the Condition of their Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will it not much tend to relax their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence?
I know meer love and thankfulness
should be enough: And so it will, when all our
ends are attained in our Ultimate End; then
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106762:112"/>
we shall act for these ends no more: we shall
have nothing to do but to love, and joy, and
praise, and be thankfull; but that it is not
yet. Sure, as God hath given us the affections
of Fear, and Desire, and Hope, and so Care,
so he would have us use them for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our great Ends. Therefore he that
taketh down but one of all our Motives to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
he helps to destroy Obedience it self,
seeing we have need of every Motive that God
hath left us.</p>
                     <p>4 <hi>Qu.</hi> Doth it not much confirm the world
in their soul-cozening Faith? Sure that Faith
which is by many thought to justifie, is it
that our people do all most easily embrace,
that is, the receiving of Christ for their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and expecting Pardon and Salvation by
him, but not withall receiving him for their
Lord and King, nor delivering up themselves
to be ruled by him. I meet not with one, but
is resolved in such a Faith, till it be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
by teaching them better. They would
all trust Christ for the saving of their souls,
and that without dissembling, for ought any
man can discern: Are all these men justified?
You will say, They do it not sincerely. <hi>Ans.</hi>
There is evident a sincerity opposite to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation:
But a Morall or Theologicall sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
there is not; Why is that? but because
they take but half of Christ. Let any Minister
but try his ungodly people, whether they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:106762:113"/>
will not all be perswaded very easily to beleeve
that Christ will pardon them and save them,
and to expect Justification from him alone?
But whether it be not the hardest thing in the
world, to perswade them really to take him
for their Lord, and his Word for their Law,
and to endeavour faithfull obedience accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly?
Surely the easiness of the former, and
the difficulty of the latter, seemeth to tell us
that it is a spirituall, excellent, necessary part
of justifying Faith, to accept unfeignedly of
Christ for our Governour, and that part which
the world among us will most hardly yeeld to,
and therefore hath more need to be preached
then the other. (Though some think that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is preaching Christ, but preaching him
as a pardoning, justifying Saviour.) Indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Turks or Indians, that entertain not
the Gospell it is as necessary to preach his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
Office, yea and the verity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Commission: therefore the Apostles
when they preached to Jews or Pagans, did first
&amp; chiefly teach them the Person and Offices of
Christ, &amp; the great benefits which they might
receive by him but when they preach (as
<hi>Iames</hi>) to Professors of the Christian Faith,
they chiefly urge them, to strive to enter, to
fight, that they may conquer, so to run that
they may obtain to lay violent hands upon the
Kingdom, and take it by force, and to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
in laborious obedience to Christ their
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106762:113"/>
Lord; to be stedfast, unmoveable, always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
in the Work of the Lord, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they know their labour is not in vain
in the Lord.</p>
                     <p>5. Lastly, Is not this excluding of sincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
from Justification, the great stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
block of Papists? &amp; that which hath had a
great hand in turning many learned men from
the Protestant Religion to Popery? When they
see the language of Scripture in the forecited
places so plain to the contrary: When <hi>Illyricus,
Gallus, Amsdorfius, &amp;c.</hi> shall account it a heresie
in <hi>George major,</hi> to say, That good Works are
necessary to Salvation: And when (if <hi>Melchior
Adamus</hi> say true) <hi>eo dementiae &amp; impietatis ventum
erat, ut non dubitarent quidam haec axiomata pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnare;
Bona opera non sunt necessaria ad salutem:
Bona opera officiunt saluti: Nova obedientia non est
necessaria.</hi> When even <hi>Melancthons</hi> credit is bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
for being too great a friend to good
Works, though he ascribe not to them the least
part of the Work or Office of Christ: And when
to this day many Antinomian Teachers, who
are magnified as the only Preachers of Free
Grace, do assert &amp; proclaim, That there is no
more required to the perfect irrevocable justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the vilest Murderer or Whorema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
but to beleeve that he is justified, or to be
perswaded that God loveth him. And when
such a Book as that, stiled the <hi>Marrow of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
Divinity,</hi> have so many applauding Epist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106762:114"/>
of such Divines; when the Doctrine of it is,
That we must not Act for justification or salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but onely in thankfulness for it: contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the main drift of the Scripture, which so
presseth men to pray for pardon, &amp; to pardon
others, that they may receive pardon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
and to strive to enter, &amp; run that they
may obtain, &amp; doe Christ Commandements
that they may have right to the Tree of life, &amp;
enter in by the gate into the City, <hi>Revel. 22.
14.</hi> Doe these men thinke that we are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
justified and saved already? before the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
sentence at the great Tribunall; or the
possession of the Kingdome, for which we wait
in Hope? Indeed when we have that perfect
salvation, we shall not need to seek it, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to attain it; but must everlastingly be
thankfull to him that hath purchased it, and
to him that hath bestowed it. But in the mean
time, he that seeketh not, shall not find, &amp; he
that runs not shall not obtain: No, nor all
that seek and run neither, <hi>Luk. 13. 24. Luk. 12.
31. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                     <p>This Doctrine was one that helped to turn
off <hi>Grotius</hi> to <hi>Cassandrian</hi> Popery; See <hi>Grotii vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
Pag.</hi> 21. 22. 23. 115. And was offensive to
<hi>Melancthon, Bucer,</hi> &amp; other Moderate Divines
of our own. And all ariseth hence. That men
understand not the difference betwixt Christs
part of the work, which he performeth himself,
&amp; that which he requireth and enableth us to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106762:114"/>
perform: nor know they, that true justifying
Faith doth at once receive Christ, both as
Lord and Saviour; and that sincere Obedience
to Christ, is part of the Condition of the New
Covenant. Works (or a purpose to walke with
God) (saith Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> on the Covenant <hi>pag.</hi> 73.)
doe justifie as the Passive qualification of the
subject capable of Justification. See <hi>Calvin</hi> on
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6. The common assertion then <hi>That good
Works do follow Iustification, but not go before it</hi>
must be thus understood, or it is false, <hi>viz.</hi>
Actuall obedience goeth not before the first
moment of Justification, But yet it is as true.
1. That the taking of Christ for our Lord, and
so delivering up our selves to his Government
(which is the subjection of the heart, &amp; resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for further obedience, &amp; indeed an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
part of Faith) doth in order of nature goe
before our first justification. 2. That Actuall
Obedience (as part of the Condition) doth in
order of Nature goe before our Justification
as continued and confirmed. For though our
Marriage contract with Christ doe give us the
first possession, yet it is the Marriage faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and duties, which must continue that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.
3. That perseverance in faithfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
doth both in nature &amp; time go before
our full, compleat and finall Justification; and
that as part of the Condition of obtaining it.
<hi>If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
fellow ship one with another, and the blood of Iesus
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:106762:115"/>
Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7.
So <hi>Isai. 1. 16. 17. 18. 19. Wash you; make you clean;
put away the evill of your doings; cease to do evill;
learne to doe well, &amp;c. Come now, &amp;c. though your
sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; and
though they be red like crimson, they shall be like
wooll,</hi> So <hi>Ezek. 33. 14. 15, 16. &amp;</hi> 18. 21. 22.
Neither let any object that this is the Law of
works: For certainly that hath no promises of
forgivenesse: And though the discoveries of
the way of Justification be delivered in the old
Testament, in a more dark and Legall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
then in the New; yet not in termes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to the truth in the New Testament.
Thus you may see in what sence it is that Christ
will judge men according to their Works: &amp;
will say, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
kingdome, &amp;c. For I was hungry, &amp; ye fed me, &amp;c.
Well done, good &amp; faithfull Servant, thou hast been
faithfull in few things; I will make thee Ruler over
many things: Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,</hi>
Matth. 25.</p>
                     <p>For being made perfect, he became the Author of Eternall
salvation to all them that obey him, <hi>Hebr. 5. 9. Of whom
it shall be said, when they are glorified with him:</hi> These
are they that come out of great tribulation, and have washed
their robes in the blood of the Lambe, and made them white:
Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day
and night in his temple; and he that si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>teth on the throne shall
dwell among them, Revel. 7. 14. 15. <hi>To whom be Glory
for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

REader, because an exact Index would
contain a great part of the Book, I shall
omit it: and instead of it, I here lay thee
down some of the chief Distinctions, upon
which this Discourse dependeth; desiring thee
to understand them, and keep them in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
You must distinguish,<list>
                        <item>1. BEtwixt Gods Decretive or Purposing Will:
And his Legislative or Preceptive Will. The
1. is his Determining of Events. The 2. of Duty and
Reward.</item>
                        <item>2. Betwixt 1. the Covenant or Law of Works,
which saith, <hi>Obey perfectly, and Live;</hi> or <hi>sin,
and Dye.</hi> 2. And the Covenant or Law of
Grace, which saith, <hi>Beleeve, and be saved, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. Betwixt the two parts of each Covenant:
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Primary, discovering the duty in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and prohibiting the Sin. 2. The secondary, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the Rewards and Penalties, in Promises
and Threatnings.</item>
                        <item>4. Betwixt a two-fold Righteousness of one and
the same Covenant. 1. Of perfect Obedience, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the Condition. 2. Of suffering, or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for disobedience or non-performance which
maketh the Law, to have nothing against us, though
we disobeyed. See <hi>Pemble</hi> of Iustification, <hi>pag.</hi> 2.
Our Legall Righteousness is of this last sort, &amp; not of
<pb facs="tcp:106762:116"/>
the first. Both these sorts of Righteousnesse are
not possible to be found in any one person, except
Christ, who had the former Righteousness as his
own, (incommunicable to us in that form) The second
he had for us, as he was by imputation a sinner: And
so we have it in, or by him. <hi>Mark this.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5. Betwixt two kinds of Righteousness, suitable
to the two Covenants and their Conditions 1. Legall
Righteousness, which is our Conformity, or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the Law. 2. And Evangelicall Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which is our Conformity to the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
Note, that 1. Every Christian must have
both these. 2. That our Legall righteousness is
onely that of Satisfaction: but our Evangelicall is
only that of obedience, or performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
3. That our Legall Righteousnesse is all
without us in Christ, the other in our selves.</item>
                        <item>6. Betwixt Evangelicall Righteousness, improll
perly so called, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Gospell doth reveain
and offer it. This is our Legall righteousness o
Christ. 2. And Evangelicall righteousness prnt
perly so called <hi>viz.</hi> Because the new Covenar
is the Rule to which it is conformed. This is ou
performance of the new Covenants Conditi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons.</item>
                        <item>7. Betwixt the Life or Reward in the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
<hi>viz. Adams</hi> paradise happiness. 2. And
the Life of the second Covenant; which is, Eternall
glory in heaven.</item>
                        <item>8. Betwixt the death or curse of the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
which is opposite to its reward: This onely
<pb facs="tcp:106762:116"/>
was laid on Christ, and is due to Infants by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
2. And the death of the second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
opposite to its life, called the second death,
and far sorer punishment. This finall unbeleevers
suffer.</item>
                        <item>9. Betwixt sins against the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
For these Christ died. 2. And sins
against the second Covenant: For these he dyed not.</item>
                        <item>10. Betwixt sinning against Christ and
the Gospell, as the object of our sin only: So Christ
died for them. 2. And sinning against the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
as such, or as a threatning Law: So Christ
dyed not for them.</item>
                        <item>11. Betwixt delaying to perform the
conditions of the new Covenant. This is not
threatned with death. 2. And finall non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
This is proper violation of the
Covenant, and a sin that leaveth no hope of
recovery.</item>
                        <item>12. Betwixt paying the proper debt of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
(as Christ did himself,) or of suffering (as the
damned do.) 2. And satisfying for non-payment;
as Christ did for us.</item>
                        <item>13 Betwixt repealing the Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
(which is not done) 2. And relaxing it
or dispensing with it (which is done.)</item>
                        <item>14. Betwixt relaxation or dispensation
in the proper subject and circumstances of the
Penalty. This is done in removing it from us
to Christ. 2. And dispencing with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
it self. This is not done; for Christ did bear it.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb facs="tcp:106762:117"/>
15. Betwixt the change of the Law: 2. And of
the sinners relation to the Law.</item>
                        <item>16. Betwixt the Lawes forbidding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the sin: (so it doth still.) 2. And its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the sinner: (So it doth not to the justified,
because Christ hath born the curse.)</item>
                        <item>17. Betwixt the Precepts as abstracted from
the Covenant termes, (which really they are
not at all) 2. And as belonging to the severall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants.</item>
                        <item>18. Betwixt perfection of Holinesse (which
is a quality.) This is not in this life. 2. And Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Righteousness, (which is a Relation:) This
is perfect, or none at all.</item>
                        <item>19. Betwixt recalling the Fact, or the evil of
the Fact, or its desert of punishment. These are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
done, nor are possible. 2. And removing the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of punishment from the Offendor. This is done.</item>
                        <item>20. Betwixt Pardon and Iustification Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall,
which is an immediate effect of Christs
Death and Resurrection, or rather of the making of
the new Covenant. 2. And Pardon &amp; Iustification Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
when we have performed all the Conditions.</item>
                        <item>21. Betwixt Conditionall Pardon and Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which is only Potentiall. (Such is that
which immediately followeth the enacting of the
new Covenant to men before Faith, or before they
have sinned.) 2. And Conditionall Iustification,
which is actual, &amp; of which the person hath true pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
such is our Iustification after Faith, till the last
Iudgement, which is ours actually, but yet upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb facs="tcp:106762:117"/>
of perseverance in Faith and sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</item>
                        <item>22. Betwixt Pardon and Iustification, as they
are Immanent Acts in God, (improperly, and without
Scripture, called Pardon or Iustification.) 2. And
Pardon and Iustification, as they are Transient Acts,
performed by the Gospell-Promise as Gods Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This is the true Scripture Iustification.</item>
                        <item>23. Betwixt Iustification in Title and Sence of
Law, (which is in this Life.) 2. And Iustification in
sentence of the Iudge, (which is at the last Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.)</item>
                        <item>24. Betwixt justifying us against a true Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
(as of breaking the Law.) Thus Christ justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
us; and here it is that we must plead his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
2. And justifying us against a false Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
(as of not performing the Conditions of the
Gospell.) Here we must plead not guilty, and not
plead the Satisfaction of Christ.</item>
                        <item>25. Betwixt the Accusation of the Law, (from
Christ doth justifie believers.) 2. And the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gospell or new Covenant, for not per,
forming its Conditions at all, (from which no man
can be justified, and for which there is no sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.)</item>
                        <item>26. Betwixt those Acts which recover us to
the state of Relation which we fell from; that is,
Pardon, Reconciliation and Iustification. 2. And
those which advance us to a far higher state, that is,
Adoption and Vnion with Christ.</item>
                        <item>27. Betwixt our first Possession of Iustification,
<pb facs="tcp:106762:118"/>
which is upon our contract with Christ or meer
Faith.) 2. And the Confirmation, Continuation
and Accomplishment of it, (whose Condition is also
sincere Obedience and Perseverance.)</item>
                        <item>28. Betwixt the great summary duty of the
Gospell to which the rest are reducible: which is
Faith. 2. And the Condition fully expressed in all
its parts, where of Faith is the Epitome.</item>
                        <item>29. Betwixt the word, <hi>Faith,</hi> as it is taken
Physically, and for some one single Act: 2. And as it is
taken Morally, Politically and Theologically here;
for the receiving of Christ with the whole soul.</item>
                        <item>30. Betwixt the accepting of Christ as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viour
only, (which is no true Faith, nor can justifie.)
2. And Accepting him for Lord also (which is true
Iustifying Faith.)</item>
                        <item>31. Betwixt the foresaid Receiving of Christ
himself in his offices (which is the Act that Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth:)
2. And Receiving his Promises and Benefits, (a
consequent of the former:) Or betwixt accepting
him for Iustification; 2. And beleeving that we are
justified.</item>
                        <item>32. Betwixt the Metaphysicall Truth of our
Faith: 2. And the Morall Truth.</item>
                        <item>33. Betwixt the Nature of the Act of Faith,
which justifieth, or its Aptitude for its office (which
is, its receiving Christ: 2. And the proper for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
Reason of its Iustifying power, (which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the Condition upon which God will give
us Christs Righteousness.)</item>
                        <item>34. Betwixt Works of the Law (which is
<pb facs="tcp:106762:118"/>
perfect Obedience: 2. And Works of the Gospell
Covenant (which is Faith and sincere Obedience to
Christ that bought us.)</item>
                        <item>35. Betwixt Works of the Gospell used as
Works of the Gospell, <hi>i.e.</hi> in subordination to Christ,
as Conditions of our full Iustification and Salvation
by him. 2. And Works commanded in the Gospell used
a-Works of the Law, or to legall ends, <hi>viz.</hi> to make up
in whole or in part our proper legall Righteousness;
and so in opposition to Christs Righteousness, or in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
with it. In the first sence they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation: In the second, Damnable.</item>
                        <item>36. Betwixt receiving Christ and loving him as
Redeemer (which is the Condition it self:) 2. And
taking the Lord for our God and chief Good, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him accordingly; Which is still implyed in the
Covenant as its End and Perfection; And so as more
excellent then the proper Conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</item>

BEING
An Answer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of a Friend concerning some
Points therein contained. And at his own Desire annexed for the

                        <hi>Zanchius</hi> in Philip. 3. 13.</bibl> What can be more pernicious to a Student yea to a
Teacher, then to think that he knoweth all
things, and no knowledge can be wanting in him;
For being once puft up vvith this false opinion, he

               <div type="objections">
                  <head>The sum of the Objections is as followeth.</head>
                  <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T seemeth strange to me, that you make
the death which the first Covenant did
threaten to be only in the everlasting
suffering of soul, seperated from the
body and that the body should de turned
to earth, and suffer no more but the pains of death; and
consequently not whole man, but only part of him
should de damned?</p>
                  <p>2. Though you seem to take in the Active Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ with the Passive into the work of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
yet it is on such grounds, as that you do in
the main agree with them who are for the Passive Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
alone, against the stream of Orthodox Divines?</p>
                  <p>3. I pray you clear to me a little more fully in what
sence you mean, that no sin but finall unbelief is a
breach or violation of the new Covenant, and how you
can make it good, that temporary unbelief, and gross
sin is no violation of it, seeing We Covenant against
these?</p>
                  <p>4. Whether it will not follow from this doctrine of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106762:122"/>
yours that the new covenant is never violated by any;
for the regenerate do never finally and totally renounce
Christ, and so they violate it not; &amp; the unregenerate
were never truly in covenant, and therefore cannot be
said to violate the Covenant which they never made?</p>
                  <p>5. How you will make it appear, that the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is not made with Christ only?</p>
                  <p>6. How make you Faith and Repentance to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Covenant on our part, seeing the besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
of them is part of the condition on Gods part: Can
they be our conditions and Gods too?</p>
                  <p>7. Seeing God hath promised us these which you call
conditions, is not the Covenant therefore rather abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
and more properly a promise?</p>
                  <p>8. In making a generall Covenant to all, you bring
wicked men under promise, whereas all the promises
are Yea and Amen in Christ, and so belong only to
those in Christ: I find no promise in Scripture made to
a wicked man.</p>
                  <p>9. May you not else as well give the seals to wicked
men as the Covenant? Except you will evade as Mr
<hi>Blake.</hi> and say the Sacrament seals but conditionally;
and then let all come that will.</p>
                  <p>10. How can you make it appear, that <hi>Do this and live</hi>
is not the proper voyce of the Covenant of Works? Or
that according to the new Covenant we must act for
life, and not only from life; or that a man may make
his attaining of life the end of his work, and not rather
obey only out of thankfulness and love?</p>
                  <p>11. Why do you single out the book called, <hi>The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of modern Divinity,</hi> to oppose in this point?</p>
                  <p>12. Seeing you make faith and covenanting with
Christ to be the same thing; do you not make him to be
no reall Christian that never so covenanted? and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
him to be no visible Christian who never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
such a Covenant? and so you bring in a greater
necessity of publique covenanting, then those who are
for Church-making Covenants?</p>

                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:106762:122"/>
13. Do you not go against the stream af all Divines,
in denying the proper act of Faith as it justifieth, to be
either Recumbency, Affiance, Perswasion, or Assurance?
but placing it in Consent or Acceptance?</p>
                  <p>14. Do you not go against the stream of all Divines,
in making the Acceptance of Christ for Lord, to be as
properly a justifying act as the accepting him for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and all that you may lay a ground work for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Gospell obedience or Works; so do you also
in making the Acceptance of Christs Person and Offices
to be the justifying act, and not the receiving of his
Righteousness and of pardon?</p>
                  <p>16. How can you reconcile your Justification by
Works with that of <hi>Rom. 3. 24, &amp; 4. 4, 5, 6?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. I desire some satisfaction in that which <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covius,</hi>

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>THE ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>TO the first Objection about the death threatened
in the first Covenant, I answer: 1. I told you I
was not peremptory in my opinion, but inclined
to it, for want of a better. 2. I told you, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
seem more strong which are against all the rest,
and therefore I was constrained to make choice of this,
to avoid greater absurdities, then that which you object.
For, 1. If you say that Adam should have gone quick to
Hell, you contradict many Scriptures, which make our
temporall death to be the wages of sin. 2. If you say
that He should have dyed, and rose again to torment:
1. What Scripture saith so? 2. When should He have
risen? 3. You contradict many Scriptures, which make
Christ the Mediator, the only procurer of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
3. If you say He should have lived in perpetuall
misery on earth, then you dash on the same Rock with
the first opinion. 4. If you say, He should have dyed
only a temporall death, and his soul be annihilated,
then 1. you make Christ to have redeemed us only from
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:106762:123"/>
the grave, and not from hell, contrary to 1 <hi>Thes. 1. 10.
Who hath delivered us from the wrath to come.</hi> 2. You make
not hell, but only temporall death, to be due too, or
deserved by the sins of believers, seeing the Gospell
only (according to this opinion) should threaten eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death, and not the Law; but the Gospell threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
it to none but unbelievers. You might easily have
spared me this labour, and gathered all this Answer from
the place in the book where I handled it; but because
other Readers may need as many words as you, I grudg
not my pains.</p>
                  <p>TO your second Objection about Christs active
and passive Righteousness; You should have
overthrown my grounds, and not only urge my
going against the stream of Divines: As I take it for no
honour to be the first inventing a new opinion in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
so neither to be the last in embracing the truth: I
never thought that my faith must follow the major
vote; I value Divines also by weight, and not by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
perhaps I may think that one <hi>Pareus, Piscator, Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus,
Alstedius, Capellus, Gataker,</hi> or <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> is of
more authority then many Writers and Readers: View
their Writings, and answer their Arguments, and then
judg.</p>
                  <p>TO your third, about the violation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
I shall willingly clear my meaning to you
as well as I can, though I thought what is said
had cleared it. The 34 Aphorism (which is it you object
against) doth thus far explain it, 1. That I speak of
Gods Covenant of Grace only, or his new Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the terms on which men live or dye. 2. That by
<hi>Violation</hi> I mean the breaking or non-performance of its
conditions, or such a violation as bringeth the offendor
under the threatning of it, and so maketh the penalty
of that Covenant breaking due to him. 3. I there tell
you, that the new Covenant may be neglected long, and
sinned against objectively, and Christs Commands may
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106762:123"/>
be broken, when yet the Covenant is not so violated.
The Tenor of the Covenant me-think should put you
quite out of doubt of all this, which is <hi>He that believeth
shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> The
unbelief and rebellion against Christ, which the godly
were guilty of before believing, is a neglect or refusall of
the Covenant; and I acknowledg that all that while
they were in a damnable state, that is, in a state wherein
they should have been damned, if they had so dyed; for
then their unbelief had been finall.</p>
                  <p>But your doubt may be, whether they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
damnation while they were in their unbelief for
resisting Grace?</p>
                  <p>I answer you as before: 1. I look upon no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as deserved, <hi>in sensu forensi,</hi> in the sense of the
Law, but what is threatened by that Law: Now you
may easily resolve the Question your self, Whether the
new Covenant do threaten damnation to that their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief?
If they believe not at all before death, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
them condemned, otherwise not. 2. Yet might
they in this following sense be said to deserve the great
condemnation before they obeyed the Gospell, <hi>viz.</hi> as
their unbelief is that sin for which the Gospell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
men, wanting nothing but the circumstance of
finality or continuance to have made them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
subjects of the curse; and it was no thanks to them
that it proved not finall; for God did make them no
promise of one hour of time and patience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was meerly his mercy in not cutting them off,
which made their unbelief not to be finall and damning:
Many a man that lived not half so long in rebellion,
did yet prove a finall condemned rebell; so that they
did deserve, that God in the time of their infidelity
should have cut off their lives, and so have let their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
be their destruction. But supposing that God
would not so cut them off, and so their unbelief should
not be finall, (which is the case,) and so they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
or threatened by none but the first Law or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106762:124"/>
which Christ did satisfie: But as for the second
Law or Covenant it condemneth them not, so that
Christ need not bear the condemnation of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
for them; for He doth not fetch any man from
under the condemning sentence of it, but only in rich
mercy to his chosen: He doth prevent their running
into that condemnation, partly by bearing with them
in patience, and continuing their lives, (for into the
hands of the purchaser are they wholly committed,)
and partly by prevailing with them to come in to him
by the efficacy of his Word and Spirit; so that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
them as unbelievers who were to be converted,
and so they were neither the proper subjects of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the new Covenant, nor of the threatening and
condemnation of it: Promise they had none, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall,
such as they had not received, and so were
never the better for; and so they were without the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and without hope, and without God, and
strangers to all the priviledges of the Saints: But yet
not those to whom the Law or Covenant saith, You
shall surely dye, except they had been such as should
never have believed: And for that wrath <hi>(Eph. 2. 3.)</hi>
which they were children of by nature, it must needs be
only the wrath or curse of the first violated Covenant,
and not the wrath or curse of the second; for no man is
by nature a child of that.</p>
                  <p>But I perceive you think it a strange saying, That a
man by the greatest, grossest actuall sin may not be said
to violate this Covenant, so as to incur its curse, but
only for finall unbelief: Do not the godly sometimes
break Covenant with Christ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I have two things to say to the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of your right understanding in this, <hi>viz.</hi>
a two-fold distinction to minde you of, which
you seem to forget. 1. Either the gross sins,
which you speak of, are such as may stand
with sincerity of heart, or such as cannot: If
<pb facs="tcp:106762:124"/>
they be sins of really godly men, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they violate not the Covenant, so as to
make them the subjects of its curse: For the
Covenant saith not, He that sinneth shall be
damned; nor he that committeth this, or that
great sin, shall be damned: But, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
not shall be damned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But is not this Antinomianism, which you
so detest? Is it not said, that no whoremonger, or
unclean person, or covetous person, &amp;c. shall enter
into the Kingdom of Christ, or of God? <hi>Rev. 21.
8. &amp;</hi> 22. 15. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5. that for these things sake
cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I pray you remember that I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that Faith is the consenting to Christs Dominion
and Government over us; or the accepting of him
for our Lord, that we may obey him, as well as for
our Saviour, that we may have affiance in him: And
consequently Unbelief (in this large sence in which the
Gospell useth it in opposition to that faith which is the
condition of the Covenant) containeth in it all Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against Christs Government: I could prove this
to you out of many plain Scriptures, but the plainness
of it may spare me that labour: Even in the Text objected,
the word translated <hi>[Children of disobedience]</hi> doth signifie
both <hi>Vnbelief</hi> and <hi>Disobedience;</hi> or obstinate, unperswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deable
men, that will not be perswaded to beleeve and
obey: 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 8. Christ shall come in flaming fire to
render vengeance to them that obey not his Gospell:
Certainly those are unbeleevers. Or if you will have it
plainly in Christs own words, what is the damning sin
opposed to Faith, see it in <hi>Luk. 19. 27. But those mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which would not that I should reign over them, bring
them hither, &amp; slay them before me.</hi> It is not then for every
act of those fore-mentioned sins that the everlasting
wrath of God doth come upon men; for then what should
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106762:125"/>
become of <hi>David, Noah, Lot, Mary Magdalen,</hi> and
all of us? But it is for such sins as do prove and
proceed from a considerate willfull refusall of
Christs Government, or an unwillingness that
he should reign over us: and that not every
degree of unwillingness, but a prevailing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
from whence a man may be said to be one
that would not have Christ reign, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is real unbelief it self, as opposite
to that Faith which is the condition of Life,
which is the receiving of Christ for Lord as
well as Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is true, that temporall judgements may
befall us for particular sins; as also, that each
particular sin doth deserve the eternall wrath
which the first Covenant doth denounce; but
not (in a Law-sence) that which is denounced
in the second Covenant. Every great fault
which a subject committeth against his
Prince, is not capitall, or high Treason. Every
fault or disobedient act of a Wife against her
Husband doth not break the Marriage Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
nor loose the bond: but only the sin
of Adultery (which is the taking of another
to the marriage bed, or the choosing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
husband (and actuall forsaking the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
or renouncing him.</p>
                  <p>And you need not to fear lest this doctrine
be guilty of Antinomianism: For their Error
(which many of their adversaries also are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of) lieth here; That not understanding, that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106762:125"/>
receiving Christ as Lord is an essentiall act of
justifying Faith, nor that the refusall of his
Government is an essentiall part of damning
unbelief, they do thereupon acknowledge no
condition of Life, but bare Belief in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest
sence; that is, either Belief of Pardon,
and Justification, and Reconciliation, or Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in Christ for it: so also they acknowledge
no proper damning sin, but unbelief in that
strict sence as is opposite to this faith; that is
the not beleeving in Christ as a Saviour.</p>
                  <p>And upon the common grounds who can
choose but say as they, that neither drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
nor murther, nor any sin, but that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
doth damn men, except he will say that
every sin doth; and so set up the Covenant of
Works, and deny his very Christianity, by
making Christ to dye in vain: so great are the
inconveniences that follow the ignorance
of this one point, That justifying faith is the
accepting of Christ for Lord and Saviour; and
that sincere obedience to him that bought us,
is part of the Condition of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>I have been sorry to hear some able Divines,
in their confessions of sin, acknowledging
their frequent violation of this Covenant;
yea, that in every sinfull thought, word or
deed they break the Covenant which they
made in Baptism. Did ever any sober
man make such a Covenant with Christ, as to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106762:126"/>
promise him never to sin against him? Or doth
Christ call us to such a Covenant? Doth his
Law threaten, or did we in our Covenant
consent, that we should be condemned if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we committed a gross sin? I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that those sins which do consist with
true faith, can be no breaches of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace; For else (Faith being the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition)
we should both keep it, and break
it, at the same time.</p>
                  <p>2. But all the doubt is about the sins which
are inconsistent with Faith. Those are either,
1. Disobedience to the Law of Works; (but
that cannot violate the Covenant of Grace
as such.) 2. Or else Refusall of Christ by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
and Unbelief privative,) for of nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
unbelief I will not speak:) And that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall
is either, 1. Temporary, (of that I have
spoken already:) Or, 2. Finall (and that
I acknowledg is the violation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.)</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you will object, That the sin against
the Holy Ghost also is a damning sin, and
so a breach of the Covenant. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
Finall Unbelief is the <hi>Genus,</hi> and hath
under it these three sorts. 1. Ordinary finall
Unbelief, <hi>viz.</hi> against Ordinary means. 2. The
sin against the Holy Ghost. 3. Totall Apostacy:
All these are unpardonable sins.</p>
                  <p>I have in another Treatise adventured to
tell you my judgment concerning the sin
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106762:126"/>
against the Holy Ghost <hi>viz.</hi> That it is when a
man will not beleeve in Christ notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all the testimoniall miracles of the Holy
Ghost, which he is convinced <hi>de facto</hi> were
wrought, but yet denyeth the validity of
their Testimony. This is the unpardonable
unbelief, because uncureable: for it is the
last or greatest Testimony which Christ will
afford to convince the unbeleeving world;
and therefore he that deliberately refuseth
this and will not be convinced by it, is left
by God as a hopeless wretch. So that the
sin against the Holy Ghost is but a sort of
finall unbelief. Lay by your prejudice against
the singularity of this interpretation, and
exactly consider what the occasion of Christs
mentioning this sin was, and what was the
sin which those Pharisees did commit, and
then judge.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, For the sin of total Apostacy, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it is the most proper violation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
not only as it is a Law and Covenant
offered, but also as it is a Covenant entred
and accepted. But it is unbelief which Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
do fall to; for it is only an explicite or
implicite renouncing of Christ either as Lord
or Saviour, or both, which is the unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sin of Apostacy, which is called <hi>falling away</hi>
(that is, from Christ and the Covenant,) and
<hi>crucifying the Son of God afresh, and putting him to
open shame,</hi> Heb. 6. 6. And which is called <hi>Heb. 10.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:106762:127"/>
26, 29. sinning wilfully,</hi> that is, considerate,
resolved rejecting Christ, or refusing his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,)
and so called, <hi>treading under foot
the Son of God, and counting the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
vvherevvith they vvere sanctified, an unholy
thing, and doing despight to the Spirit of Grace.</hi> As
the nature of this Apostacy lyeth in returning
to infidelity, so being Totall it is alwayes also
Finall; God having in his just Judgement
resolved to withold from all such the grace
that should recover them; and so this is a sort
of finall unbelief.</p>
                  <p>A second distinction, which I must here
mind you of, is, betwixt 1. the main Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace: and 2. Particular, subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
inferiour Covenants, which may be made
between God and a believer. The former is
not violated, but as I have shewed before: The
latter is ordinarily broken by us. If any
man make a vow like <hi>Saul</hi>'s or <hi>Ieptha</hi>'s, he may
break it possibly, and not be damned, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
by repentance. If in your sickness, or
other affliction, or at Sacrament, or on dayes of
Humiliation, or Thanksgiving, you should
Covenant with God to forsake such a sin, or
to perform such a duty, to mend your lives, to
be more holy and heavenly, &amp;c. this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
you may perhaps break, and yet recover.
And of such Covenants it is that I mean, when
in confession I do bewail my Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Christ, and not of the main Covenant
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:106762:127"/>
of Grace; for then I should confess my self a
totall irrecoverable Apostate. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which ought to be made with Christ in
Baptism, and which Baptism is the professing
sign and seal of, is the main Covenant of Grace;
Therefore is there no use for re-baptizing,
because such Apostacy is an unrecoverable sin.</p>
                  <p>So you see what Covenant it is that the
godly break, and what breach it is that they
use to confess.</p>
                  <div n="4" type="answer">
                     <head>To the fourth Objection.</head>
                     <p>YOur fourth Objection [that from this
doctrine it will follow, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is never broken] is easily answered.
1. I think it is true, that the regenerate do
never break the Covenant: But yet the breach
in it self, and in respect of our strength is more
then possible; and the controversie <hi>de eventu</hi>
will hold much dispute. <hi>Austin</hi> seemeth to me
to be of this opinion, That there are some
effectually called that yet may fall away, but
the elect cannot; so that he distinguisheth of
calling according to purpose or election, (and
that he thinketh cannot be lost.) and calling
not following election, (which he thinketh
may be lost,) so that he placeth not the
difference in the calling, but in the decree.
I do not recite this as assenting to it; nor
yet can I assent to them, who make the
very nature of Grace to be immortall, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:106762:128"/>
from thence do argue the certainty of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
I think to be naturally Immortall
is Gods Prerogative, and properly imcommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable
to any creature: Even Angels, and souls
of men are Immortall only from the will and
continued sustentation of God; and if God
did withdraw his hand, and not continually
uphold it, the whole Creation would fall to
nothing, much more the quality of holiness
in the soul: To subsist of himself without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
influx from another, is proper to God,
the first, naturall, necessary, absolute, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Being: Yet I acknowledge, that when
God will perpetuate any Being, he fitteth the
nature of it accordingly, and maketh it more
simple, pure, spirituall, and less subject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
But yet to say, that therefore it is a
Nature Immortall, or that cannot dye, I think
improper: But I know Philosophers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
do think otherwise, and therefore I do
dissent, <hi>q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>asi coactus &amp; petitâ veniâ.</hi> 2. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Regenerate may break the Covenant
or not, certain I am the unregenerate may and
do: And whereas you object, <hi>[That they were
never in Covenant, and therefore cannot be said to
break it:]</hi> I must desire you, besides the former
distinctions, to remember these two more.
1. Betwixt the Covenant as promulgate, and
only offered on Gods part. 2. And the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
as accepted and entered by the sinner.
The former is most properly called, The Law
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:106762:128"/>
of Christ, or new Law, as containing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of our salvation or damnation; yet it is
properly also and frequently in Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Covenant, (though not in so full a sense
as the latter,) because it containeth the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or matter of the Covenant, and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Gods consent, so we deny not ours; and
also because the great prevailing part in it is
Mercy and promise, and the Duty so small and
light in comparison of the said Mercy, that in
Reason there should be no Question of our
performance: And so Mercy obscuring or
prevailing against Judgment, it is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenly
called a Covenant and Gospell then a
Law; yet a Law also most properly it is, and
oft so called. Now then that the Covenant in
this sense may be broken, is no question: God
hath said, <hi>He that believeth shall be saved, and he
that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> Doth not he
that never believeth break this Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and incur the penalty? So that men that
never accept the Covenant, do thus break it
by their refusall, and so perish.</p>
                     <p>2. You must distinguish betwixt 1. The
Covenant accepted heartily and sincerely, 2.
Or nor heartily and sincerely: And so I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
you, Though unregenerate men did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sincerely covenant with Christ, and so are
not in Covenant with him as the Saints are,
yet they do usually Covenant with him, both
with their mouths, by solemn profession, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106762:129"/>
and owning him as their Lord
and Saviour, and also by their externall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to his Worship and Ordinances, and
taking the seals of the Covenant, and also in
some kind they do it from their hearts,
(though not in sincerity.) Either they do it
1. Rashly, and not Deliberately; Or 2. They
do it out of fear, as a man that is in the hands
of a conquering enemy, that must yield to his
will to prevent a worse inconvenience, though
he accounteth it an evil which he is forced to,
and had rather be free if he might, and doth
covenant, but with a forced will, partly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(to avoid greater misery) and partly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing.
3. Or else they keep secret reservations
in their hearts, intending (as a man that as
aforesaid covenanteth with the conquerour,)
to break away as soon as they can, or at least to
go no further in their obedience then will
stand with their wordly happiness or hopes
(though these reservations be not expressed
by them in their Covenant.) 4. Or else they
mistake Christ, and the nature of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
thinking he is a Master that will let
them please the flesh, and enjoy the world and
sin, and understand not what that Faith and
Holiness is which his Covenant doth require,
and so they are baptized into they know not
what, and subscribe to they know not what, and
give up their names to they know not who; and
then when at last they find their mistake, they
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:106762:129"/>
repent of the bargain and break the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
or else never discerning their mistake, they
break the Covenant while they think that
they keep it; or if they keep their own, they
break Christs. All these wayes men may enter
Covenant with Christ, but not sincerely;
for sincere covenanting must be 1. Upon
knowledge of the nature, ends and conditions
of the Covenant, though they may possibly
be ignorant of severall Accidentals about the
Covenant, yet not of these Essentials, if they do
it sincerely. 2. They must Covenant deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately,
and not in a fit of passion, or rashly.</p>
                     <p>3. They must do it seriously, and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblingly
or slightly. 4. They must do it
freely and heartily, and not through meer
constraint and fear. 5. They must do it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely,
and with resolution to perform the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
which they make and not with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
giving themselves to Christ by the
halves, or reserving a purpose to maintain
their fleshly interests. 6. And they must
especially take Christ alone, and not joyn
others in office with him, but renounce all
happiness save what is by him, and all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Salvation from any which is not in
direct subordination to him. Thus you see
that there is a great difference betwixt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
sincerely, and covenanting in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
and formality; and so betwixt Faith and
Faith. Which I have opened to you the more
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106762:130"/>
largely, because I forgot to do it when I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
the Definition of Faith in that Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism,
whereto you may annex it.</p>
                     <p>I conclude then, that multitudes of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
men are yet in Covenant with Christ,
though not as the Saints in sincere Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
which I further prove to you thus: Those
that are in Christ, are also in Covenant with
Christ: But the unregenerate are in Christ;
therefore, &amp;c. That they are in Christ is plain,
in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 2, 6. There are branches in Christ
not bearing fruit, which are cut off, and cast
away. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29, 30. They are sanctified
by the blood of the Covenant, and therefore
they were in covenant in some sort. I suppose
it would be but lost labour to recite all those
Scriptures which expresly mention wicked
mens entering into Covenant with God, and
God with them, and their Covenant-breaking
charged on them: you cannot be ignorant of
these. Wherefore you see, that it is a common
sin to violate the Gospell-Covenant.</p>

                     <head>To the fifth Objection.</head>
                     <p>YOur fifth is a mere demand of my proof,
That Christ is not the only person with
whom God the Father entereth Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Which Question I confess I am ashamed
to answer: Nor can I tell what to say to you,
but <hi>[Read the Scripture]</hi> Doth not the whole
scope of it mention Gods Covenants with
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106762:130"/>
man? Turn over your whole Bible, &amp; see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it speak more of covenanting with Christ,
or with us? Nor can I imagine what should
make you question this, except it be because
Mr <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> (or some such other) doth deny
it. How could Christ be the Mediator of the
Covenant, if it were to himself, and not to us,
that the Covenant were made? I know Dr <hi>Preston</hi>
and other orthodox Divines do affirm, That
the Covenant is made primarily with Christ, &amp;
then with us: But I confess I scarce relish that
form of speech: For it seemeth to speak of one
&amp; the same Covenant; &amp; then I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how it can be true. For is this Covenant
made with Christ? <hi>[Beleeve in the Lord Iesus, and
thou shalt be saved: and if thou beleeve not, thou
shalt be damned?]</hi> This is the Covenant that is
made with us: and who dare say, that this is
made with Christ; Or is this Covenant made
to Christ? <hi>[I will take the hard hearts our of their
bodies, and give them he arts of flesh, &amp;c. I will be
mercifull to their transgressions, &amp; their sins and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities
will I remember no more?]</hi> Had Christ,
think you, a hard heart to cure? I know some
think the latter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> clause belongeth to him first,
and so to us; <hi>viz.</hi> as he was a sinner by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and so had our transgressions upon
him: but very ignorantly: For was God mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
to him concerning the debt? Did he not
deall with him in rigorous Justice? &amp; upon the
terms of the first severer Covenant? and make
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106762:131"/>
him pay the uttermost farthing? Sure the
Covenant, whose curse Christ did bear, did
know no mercy to transgressors.</p>
                     <p>Again, the Covenant is also a Law, and Christ
himself is stiled the Law-giver; therefore can
he not be under the Law, or under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
He is not King and Subject too. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover
(as I said before) he is the Mediator, and
therefore not he to whom the Covenant is
made. Perhaps you will say, was not <hi>Moses</hi>
both? To which I answer?: 1. <hi>Moses</hi> was but a
Typicall improper Mediator. 2. <hi>Moses</hi> was in
another respect a Subject to the Law whereof
he himself was the Mediator; as he was one that
had a soul and body to save, or lose, upon the
same terms with the rest of the people: But it
was not so with our Lord Jesus; He was only a
Mediator, as being a middle Person betwixt
the offended Majesty, and the offending Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
But <hi>Moses</hi> was one of the offending Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
chosen out to supply the place of a true
Mediator, as his Type. So that though <hi>Moses</hi>
was both Mediator, and also a Subject to that
Law and Covenant; yet it is not so with Christ.
But the words, and tenor of the Covenant it
self, are so plain an Argument, that I need to
say no more. Yet do I acknowledge that there
are severall Promises in the Scriptures made
only to Christ: As <hi>That he shall see of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
of his soul, and be satisfied: and by his knowledge
justifie many, Isai. 53. 10, 11. That the Heathen shall
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106762:131"/>
be given for his inheritance, and the utmost
parts of the earth for his possession,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psa.</hi> 2.
But 1. These not be the Covenant made
with us. 2. And for my part, I take it
not to be any part of Gods Legislative Will, as
it referreth to Christ, but only as it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to us, as a prophesie, what God would
do in the advancing of Christ and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and so of us; and so hath partly the nature
of a promise to us also. For that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the Covenant betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son, is part of Gods purpose or
decree, rather then of his Law. The Covenant
betwixt the Father and Son was from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
So is not the Law, or Covenant written.
The Divine Nature, which undertook the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorship,
could not be subject to Laws, or
proper Covenants; Christ had no need of
engagement from the Father by word or
writing for his encouragement or confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So that all the Promises to Christ
in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are either meer Prophesies or
do also intimate some Promise to the Church;
and so are written for our sakes, and also
for the spreading of the Meditators Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but not for proper Covenant ends
betwixt the Father and him. And this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
Christ himself hath taught me, <hi>Iohn 12.
28.</hi> 30. Christ prayeth to the Father to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Name <hi>viz.</hi> in the Sons Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;
He is answered by a voyce from
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106762:132"/>
Heaven, <hi>I have glorified it, and will glorifie it:</hi>
Christ telleth the people that stood by, <hi>That
this voyce came not because of him, but for their
sakes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore, That the Gospell-Covenant,
properly and usually, so called, is
made betwixt God and man by the means of a
Mediator, and so delivered to us in the hands
of a Mediator; and may also fitly be said to
be betwixt Christ and us: But not properly
that it is betwixt the Father and the Son: Much
less is the Son the only person covenanted
with. God doth indeed give up the World to
Christ; and more especially the Elect to be
saved by him: But these are not the work of
a written or temporary Covenant, but of an
eternall Decree.</p>

and Repentance are both promised of
God, and required of us; Can they be his

                     <p>I told you before that the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
two sorts of Covenants, absolute and
conditionall. The Absolute Covenant is found
in <hi>Ezek. 11. 17, 18. Ier. 31. 31, 32, 33, 34. Ier.
32,</hi> 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42. &amp; mentioned by the
Apostle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. Concerning this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106762:132"/>
you must understand, that as in the first
promise of it here by the Prophets, it seemeth
to be made to the particular Nation of the
Jews, and is joyned with the promise of their
temporall Restauration; so some do question,
whether it be yet to them fulfilled? or whether
it be not a promise of some extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
happiness which they shall receive at
their last and great deliverance by the Messias?
(whether by coming personally to raign
among them, or not, I now dispute not.) Yet
as the Apostle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8, 9. doth extend it
further then to the Jews, so must we; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Apostle mention it as an absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
is a great doubt; or whether he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the spirituallity of the benefits, and so
oppose the writing of the Law in our hearts,
(which the new Covenant promiseth) to the
writing of it in stone, and revealing mercy in
the dark way of Ceremonies? But yet, for my
part, I think you may call it an absolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
But then understand, that this is not
the new Law or Covenant made with mankind,
revealing to them their duties, and the terms
on which they must live or dye: This is made
to the elect only; this speaketh nothing
of duty: No man can have any comfort by
this Covenant, till it be performed to him,
and till he have received the promised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;
for no man till then can tell whether
it be made for him, or not: It is made to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106762:133"/>
the elect only; and no man can know himself
to be elect, till he be sanctified, and when he is
sanctified this promise is fulfilled; therfore the
benefits of this promise are not to be received
by Faith: for Faith is part of the promised
Good, as it is contained in a new &amp; a soft heart
seminally; and therefore to receive this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
by Faith, were to believe, that we may
receive grace and power to believe, then
which what can be more absurd: No man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can say before-hand, that he shall have a
new and soft heart, because God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
it; for he cannot know that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to him: So that I conclude, that this is
most properly but a prophesie what God will
do, <hi>de eventu,</hi> as it hath reference to the parties
on whom it shall be fulfilled, and so is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
part of Gods purposing Will, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
not at all to his Preceptive or Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Will, by which he doth govern, and will
judge the world: But as it is revealed to the
Church visible in generall, and so in regard
of the subject is indefinite, intended only to
reveall the quality and spirituall excellency of
the Mercy of the New Covenant procured by
Christ, that so Christ may be honoured,
and men drawn to seek after, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this precious Covenant, and not
to stick to the old imperfect Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
In this sence it belongeth to Gods
Legislative Will: And in this sence I think
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:106762:133"/>
it is that the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
it; and not in the former sence, as it doth
respect the particular persons that shall have
it fulfilled, and so is an absolute Covenant to
the unknown Elect.</p>
                     <p>But now the Covenant which is mentioned
through the whole Gospel is of another kinde,
<hi>He that beleeveth, shall be saved; and he that
beleeveth not, shall be damned.</hi> This is frequently
and plainly expressed, and not so darkly
as the former: This is made to all the world,
at least, who hear the Gospel: This is the
proper new Law and Covenant, by which
men must be judged, to justification or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
This properly succeedeth in
the place of the first Covenant, which saith
<hi>Do this and live:</hi> And this is it which I stil
mean, when I speak of the new law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>So that now I hope you can hence answer to
both your own demands. To the 7. you see
there is a Covenant absolute, and a Covenant
conditional; but the last is the proper Gospel-Covenant.
To the 6. you see, that in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Covenant, or Prophesie, he promiseth
faith and repentance (in promising his Spirit,
and a new heart) to the elect, who are we know
not who. And in the conditional proper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
he requireth the same Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of us, if we will be justified and saved.
So that they are Gods part which he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106762:134"/>
that he will perform in one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
and they are made our conditions in
another.</p>
                     <p>Neither is there the least shew of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
betwixt these: For in the absolute
Covenant he doth not promise to make us
Beleeve and and Repent against our wills:
Much less, that He, or Christ, shall Repent
and Beleeve for us; and so free us from the
duty: But that he will give us new and soft
hearts, that we may do it our selves, and do
it readily and willingly: which that we may
do, he commandeth and perswadeth us to
it in the conditionall Covenant: not bidding
us do it without his help; but directing us
to the Father to draw us to the Son; and to the
Son, as without whom we can do nothing;
and to the Spirit, as the sanctifier of our
hearts, and exciter of our Graces.</p>

                     <p>IN your eighth Question I observe severall
mistakes. 1. You observe not how ill it
agreeth with the two former. For if the
Covenant were only absolute, then it can be
made to none but wicked men: and indeed
the absolute Covenant is made to none other.
Sure those that God doth promise to bestow
new hearts upon, and soft hearts, have yet
their old and hard hearts: (except it were
meant of a further degree, and not of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:106762:134"/>
first saving Grace.) 2. And as the absolute'
so the great conditionall Promise, <hi>Beleeve
and be saved</hi> is also made to ungodly men. Is
not this spoken to Unbeleevers? Will you
speak it to none but those who beleeve alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
Were none of those Jews ungodly, to
whom <hi>Peter</hi> saith <hi>Act. 2. 39. The Promise is made
to you and to your children?</hi> But I have proved a
little before, that not only as it is a Covenant
offered of God, but also as it is a Covenant
entered by them, even wicked men are within
the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>2. Yet you say, that <hi>[you no where find any
promise to a wicked man.]</hi> Why then you have
found but a few of the Scripture promises.
I have shewed you, that the absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of a new and soft heart is made to wicked
men, and the great conditionall promise
of the Gospell: Would you have particular
examples? In <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. there is to <hi>Cain</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall
promise of acceptance, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Superiority and Government. <hi>Gen.
9.</hi> 11, 12. There is a Covenant betwixt God
and every living Creature. <hi>Gen. 27. 39, 40.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106762:135"/>
Prophet, doe mention promises and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of God to ungodly Israelites? If I should
instance in all the promises made to <hi>Ahab Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,
Cyrus, Darius,</hi> &amp;c. it would be
tedious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But all these are rather Prophesies
then promises. <hi>Answ.</hi> If that which expresseth
the engaging of the word and Truth of God
to bestow good upon a man be not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
I would you would tell me what is. <hi>Object.</hi>
These predictions doe onely declare what
God will doe, but give no title to the mercy
as a Promise doth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Did not God give <hi>Cain</hi> a title to
his Superiority and Government, and the
Israelites Title to the Land of Promise? and
so the rest.</p>
                     <p>Promises doe give Title to the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised;
1. Either full and absolute: 2. Or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
and conditionall. In the first sence we
have title both by an ansolute promise, and
by a Conditionall Promise, when we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the condition. In the latter sence it
giveth title to men that have not yet perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the condition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But these things which are given
to wicked men, are not good to them, but
evill; therefore it is not properly a promise.
<hi>Answ.</hi> It is good in it selfe and would be to
them, but for their wilfull abuse. Shall mans
sinnes make Gods promises and mercies of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106762:135"/>
lesse value? God promisd that Christ should
come to his owne, the Jewes, (<hi>Isa. 53. Mal. 3.
1,</hi> 2, 3.) and yet his owne received him not,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 11. Shall we say therefore, that God
threatned them with a Christ, rather then
promised him? He promised and gave them
both Prophets and Apostles; was it no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
or mercy, because they killed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
them?</p>
                     <p>To conclude this, the Scripture expresly
contradicteth you opinion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. To
the Israelites was the Adoption and Glory
and Covenants, and the service, and the
Promises: And even to them for whom <hi>Paul</hi>
would have been accursed: So <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39.
And <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. Take heed lest a promise
being made of entring into his Rest, any of
you seem to come short of it. <hi>Prov 1. 23. 24.
25.</hi> Christ promiseth the foolish and the
scorners, that he will poure out his Spirit to
them, if they will turne at his reproofe. <hi>Amos
5. 4, 6. Seek the Lord, and your soul shall live.
Isa. 55. 6. 7. Seek the Lord while he may be found;
Call upon him while he is neer: Let the wicked
forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts, and let him returne unto the Lord and he
will have mercy on him; and to our God, and he will
abundantly pardon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Are not all these promises to wicked men?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But when they returne and repent,
they are not wicked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:106762:136"/>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> But is not this conditionall promise
made to them before they return?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> the Promise is onely to Beleevers,
therefore not to all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Either you speak of the making,
or of the fulfilling of it: It is fulfilled onely
to Beleevers, but it is made and offered to
all that heare it, on condition of Beleeving,
as is proved. <hi>Object.</hi> Beleeving is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the promise, but onely the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the persons to whom it is made.
<hi>Answ.</hi> This Objection hath more subtilty
then sence: Is not Beleeving (in plaine
English) a Duty required in the Promise by
the free Promiser and Law-giver, of him to
whom the Promise is made and sent, and that
upon these termes, that if he performe it, the
thing promised shall be his, otherwise it shall
not? And is not this properly a condition
required of the party if he will enjoy the thing
promised? When you say [It is a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the person to whom the Promise is
made] you speak in the darknesse of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity:
For 1. Doe you meane it is a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
which he hath before the Promise
is made to him? If so, I have proved the
contrary already. Or is it his qualification
afterwards, so it is indeed: But not of all
to whom it is made; but of all to whom it
shall be fulfilled. Againe, doe you meane
an habituall qualification or an Actuall? I
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106762:136"/>
doubt not, but you know it is the act of Faith
which we dispute of: And what is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt such an active qualification,
required on the termes before mentioned, and
a proper condition?</p>
                     <p>But I perceive that which you stick at, is,
that the Promises are all Yea and Amen in
Christ, and therefore are made to none but
those in Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It will be long before you will
prove the Consequence. They are made
onely on the ground of Christs undertaking,
and he is the Mediatour of them, and in
him they are sure. But doth it therefore
follow, that Christ dispenseth then to none
but those that are in him? Wicked men have
benefits by Christ, even those that are not
in him so much as by a visible profession:
And why then may they not have some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises?
Yet I know that beleevers are oft
called in Scripture, the Children, and
Heires of the Promise. But to understand this,
you must know, 1. That the Holy Ghost
hath chiefly the respect to the Thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and of that Beleevers are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Heires: If you also consider, that he
speakes chiefly of the great Promises of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
Remission, Sanctification, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
glorification. 2. I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the promise before we performe
the Condition doth give a remote, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106762:137"/>
loosable title to the good promised:
And so the wicked are children of promise.
But the Promise when we have performed
the Condition, (as also the absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises)
doth give an immediate, proper, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Title to the good promised, so that a
man may say, it is mine: And thus onely
the faithfull are the heires of the Promise:
They onely have a propriety in the spirituall
and speciall Mercies there promised. But a
wicked Israelite may have propriety in his
Inheritance by vertue of Divine Promise and
Donation. For Christ hath led captivity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and recived gifts for men, even for the
Rebellious, that the Lord might dwell among
them, <hi>psal.</hi> 68. 18.</p>

                     <head>To the 9. Objection.</head>
                     <p>YOur 9. Objection is, That if I make
the Covenant to belong to wicked men,
I may as well give them the seales.</p>
                     <p>To which I answer you, 1. You must
meane onely the main Covenant of grace,
and not inferiour promises and Covenants:
For the Sacraments are onely to seale to the
maine Covenant. 2. As you must remember
I distinguished betwixt the Covenant offered
and the Covenant entred by mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
so must you distinguish accordingly
betwixt two sorts of wicked men: 1. Open
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106762:137"/>
Infidels, who never accepted and consented
to the offered Covenant. 2. Those who
have consented and entred the Covenant,
and listed their names in the roll of Christ:
but yet not sincerely unreservedly, entirely,
as is necessary to salvation. To the former
of these you may not give the seales: For
they are not willing of them as such: And
they are not to be forced upon any: Neither
are the seales usefull till the accepting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>But to the latter the seales are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to be given by the Minister, except
they doe againe renounce Christ by word or
deed, or by some grosse sin doe constrain us
to suspend their enjoyment of such priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
while they are under tryall, and till they
discover their repentance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> What doe you take for such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of their Covenant?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. When they shall in plaine terms
renounce it, as Christians do that turn
Turks.</p>
                     <p>2. When they renounce or deny any fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Article of the Faith.</p>
                     <p>3. When they do (not through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but) wilfully and obstinately refuse
to yeeld obedience to Christ; for this is a
renouncing of their subjection to him, which
is an essentiall part of their Covenant and
Faith; and it is a renouncing of his kingly
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106762:138"/>
Office, and so a renouncing of Christ, when
they say, Hee shall not reigne over us. And
though such may acknowledge him in words,
yet in works they doe deny him, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient,
and to every good worke, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. If therefore you shall deny
the seales to any man that is thus in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with Christ, before he doe thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
his Covenant, you must doe it at
your perill. Therefore you must not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to be the Judge of his sincerity in the
Covenant, except hee plainly discover that
he is not serious. Dare not you to assume
Gods Prerogative of searching the heart,
nor to dispence Gods seales upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
of the probability or improbability
of mens sincerity. Neither must you deny the
seales to them, for any smaller sin then as
aforesaid: For as every sin is not a breach of
Covenant, so every sin must not deny them
the seales.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> Then we must not deny it to them
for every grosse sin neither; seeing you affirme,
that every grosse sinne breaketh not Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yet because hee that liveth in
known grosse sinne, cannot consent to the
Kingly Office or Government of Christ over
him, therefore we have just cause to suspend
the giving of the seales, and also of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with him, while we try whether he did
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:106762:138"/>
it through weaknesse or wilfulnesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> But how shall we know that?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ hath lined us out the way:
We must reprove him, and see whether he
will heare and reforme; if he doe not we
must tell the Church, and so admonish and
shame him publikely: If hee heare not the
Church we are to account him as a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Covenant, and so unfit for seales or
communion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> But when shall I take him for one
that will not heare the Church?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> When hee will not be perswaded to
confesse and bewaile his sinne, nor to give over
the practice of it.</p>
                     <p>So that I doe considerately advise you
(after long study of this point, and as
cautelous a proceeding as most have used)
for you know my former Judgement, and
that I never administred the Sacrament, till
within this year, and that I was then invited
to it by an eminent wonder of providence)
I say, I advise you to beware how you deny
to men the seales, till you have tried with them
this way prescribed by Christ: Christ is free
in entertaining, and so must wee; Christ
putteth away none, but them that put away
themselves; and then doth he call after them
as long as there is hope of hearing, as one
that is grieved at their destruction, and not
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:106762:139"/>
delighted in the death of sinners, but had
rather they would returne and live: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thus must we do too. Lazinesse is the
common cause of separation: when we should
go with words of pitty and love, and with
teares beseech sinners to return to theit duty,
and shew them their danger; we neglect all
this, to save us the labour and the suffering
that sometime follows this duty; wee will
plead that they are no Church-Members,
and so not the Brethren that we are bound
to admonish, and so lazily separate from
them, and say as <hi>Cain,</hi> Am I my Brothers
keeper? or as the man to Christ, who is my
Neighbour? And thus when we have made
his sinne our owne by our silence, and not
reproving him then we excommunicate him
for it out of our society and from the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and so judge our selves out of our
own mouths. Or we separate from him for
the neglect of some duty, when wee our selves
have neglected both to him and others, this
great and excellent duty of faithfull admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.
It is more comfortable to recover one
soule then to cast off many by separation.
Though I know that the avoiding communion
with wilfull offendours, who by this due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
will not be reclamed, is a most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
&amp; usefull duty too. But do not execute a
man before he is judged; nor judge him before
you have heard him speak, &amp; fully proved that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106762:139"/>
obstinacy is added to his sinne; (except it be
to suspend him while he is under this legall
triall,) But perhaps you will object, that we
have no discipline established, &amp; so no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to do thus and the means are vain which
cannot attain their end. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
1. You have divine authority: 2. And
may do as much as I presse without a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitery,
First, you may admonish privately:
Secondly, before witnesse: Thirdly, you
may bring your Congregation to this, that
the parties offended, may accuse them openly:
(The Presbyterians deny not to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
the audience and cognizance of
the Fact, but onely the power of judiciall
sentencing.) And here you may admonish
them before all: Fourthly, if yet they prove
obstinate, you may by your Ministeriall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
1. Pronounce against him by
name what the Scripture pronounceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such sinners: particularly, that he is
unfit to be a Church-Member, as openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
obedience to the known Lawes of
Christ, 2. You may charge the people from
Scripture to avoid familiarity with him. 3.
You may also acquaint the Magistrate with
his duty, to thrust him out, if he violently
intrude into Communion, or disturb the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
4. You may forbear to deliver
the Sacrament particularly to his hands.
5. You may enter and publish your
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106762:140"/>
dissent and dislike, if he intrude, and take it
himself. All this I could most easily and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
doubt prove your duty as you are a
Christian and a Minister. And if there be any
more that a Classis may do, yet do you do this
in the mean time: only be sure you try all
means in private (if the fault be not in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick)
before you bring a man in publick:
And be sure you do it in tendernesse and love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and rather with wary then passionate reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:
And be sure that you do it only in case of
undeniable sinnes, and not in doubtfull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
Cases: And be sure that the matter of
Fact be undoubtedly proved: And that no
man be suffered to traduce another publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a wrong way: Or if he do, that he be
brought to acknowledgement. The word Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
comprizeth severall Acts:
Those before mentioned belong to you as a
Minister, and are part of your proper Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
declarative power, which you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
by your Nuntiative authority. The
power of Classes and Synods (I think) doth
differ onely gradually, and not specifically
from that of every minister. I am ashamed
that I have contrary to my first purpose, said
so much of this unpleasing controversy. But
when you are next at leisure privately, I shall
undertake to prove all this to you from
Scripture; and that the Keyes are put by
Christ into the hands of every Minister
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:106762:140"/>
singly: and that with sobriety and wisdome
you may thus name the offendours publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as all Scripture Ministers have been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to do. And if you question whether our
ordinary Congregations are true reall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
where such works may be managed. I
shall prove that they are, by giving you a
better definition of a Church, then that
which you gave me, and then trying our
Churches by it: In the mean time this is not
matter to intermix here.</p>
                     <p>BUt you cannot, it seems digest Mr.
<hi>Blakes</hi> assertion, that the Sacraments
do seal but conditionally. Answer,
I have not Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> book by me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how he explaineth himself I cannot tell;
But I remember he hath oft said so in
conference with me. But let me tell you two
or three things. 1. That I question whether
you well understand him. 2. Or whether
you be able to confute it, as thus to except
against it, 3. That Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is as truly
conscientious whom he admitteth as you.</p>
                     <p>But for the Controversy, you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it a little more distinctly before you
are like to understand it rightly. It is
in vain to enquire, whether the Sacraments
do seal absolutely or conditionally, till you
first know well what it is that they seal.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106762:141"/>
Let us first therefore resolve that Question,
what they seal? and then enquire how they
seal? You know a Christian doth gather
the assurance of his Justification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by way of Argumentation, thus: <hi>He
that believeth is iustified, and shall be saved: But,
I believe; therefore I am justified and shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
Now the Question is which of the parts
of this Argument the Sacrament doth seal
to? Whether to the Major, the Minor, or the
Conclusion? To which I answer: 1. That it
sealeth to the Truth of Gods promise (which
is the Major proposition,) is unquestionable.
But whether to this alone, is all the doubt?
2. That it sealeth not to the truth of the
Minor Proposition, (that is, to the truth
of our Believing) I take also for to be
beyond dispute, For, first it should else seal
to that which is now here written: For no
Scripture saith, that I do believe. 2. And
then it should be used to strengthen my Faith,
in that which is no object of Faith: For,
[that I do believe] is not matter of Faith,
or to be believed, but matter of internall
sense, or to be known by the reflex act
of the understanding. 3. Also God should
else set his seal, to my part or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Covenant, as well as his own, and
seal to the truth of my word, as well as to the
truth of his own; for a justifying and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us, is Gods condition, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:106762:141"/>
to perform; so believing or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
Christ is our condition, which we
there professe to perform. So that it is
doubtlesse, that a Sacrament as it is Gods
engaging sign or seal, doth not seal to the
truth of my faith, or sincerity of my heart in
Covenanting: It were a most grosse conceit to
imagine this.</p>
                     <p>But withall you must understand, that as
there is in the Sacrament reciprocall actions,
Gods giving, and our receiving; so is the
Sacrament accordingly a mutuall engaging
sign or seal. As it is given, it is Gods
seal; so that as in this full Covenant there
is a mutuall engaging; so there is a mutuall
sealing. God saith to us, <hi>here is my Sonne who
hath bought thee, take him for thy Lord and
Saviour, and I will be thy reconciled God, and
pardon and glorify thee:</hi> And to this he sets his
seal. The sinner saith, <hi>I am willing Lord, I here
take Christ for my King, and Saviour, and Husband;
and deliver up my self accordingly to him:</hi> And
hereto by receiving the offered elements, he
setteth his engaging sign or seal; so that the
Sacrament is the seal of the whole Covenant.</p>
                     <p>But yet you must remember, that in the
present controversie, we meddle not with it as
it is mans seal, but onely as it is Gods.</p>
                     <p>So then it is clear, that as it is Gods seal, it
sealeth the major proposition; and as it is ours,
to the minor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:106762:142"/>
But yet here you must further distinguish
betwixt sealing up the promise as true in it self,
and sealing it with application as true to me.
And it is the latter that the Sacrament doth, the
delivery being Gods act of application, &amp; the
receiving ours; so that the Proposition which
God sealeth to, runs thus, <hi>If thou believe, I do
pardon thee, and will save thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. But the great Question is, Whether the
Sacrament do seal to the conclusion also, <hi>That
I am justified, and shall be saved?</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
No, directly and properly it doth not;
and that is evident from the arguments before
laid down, whereby I proved that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
seal not to the minor.</p>
                     <p>For 1. this conclusion is now here written
in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>2. And therefore is not properly the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Faith: whereas the seals are for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Faith.</p>
                     <p>3. Otherwise every man rightly receiving the
seals, must needs be certainly justified &amp; saved.</p>
                     <p>4. And no Minister can groundedly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Sacraments to any man but himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he can be certain of no mans justification
and salvation, being not certain of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of their Faith. And if he should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to administer it upon probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and charitable conjectures, then should
he be guilty of prophaning the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and every time he mistaketh,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:106762:142"/>
he should set the seale of God to a lye:
And who then durst ever administer a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
being never certaine: but that
he shall thus abuse it? I confesse ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to you, that it was the ignorance of
this one point which chiefly caused mee
to abstaine from administring the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
so many yeeres: I did not understand,
that it was neither the <hi>minor,</hi> nor conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but only the major proposition of the
foresaid Argument, which God thus sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.
And I am sorry to see what advantage
many of our most learned Divines have
given the Papists here. As one errour drawes
on many, and leadeth a man into a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
of absurdities; so our Divines being
first mistaken in the nature of justifying faith
thinking that it consisteth in <hi>A Beliefe of
the pardon of my owne sinnes,</hi> (which is this
conclusion) have therefore thought that
this is it which the Sacrament sealeth. And
when the Papists alledge, that it is no
where written <hi>that such or such a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
we answer them that it being written
<hi>That he that beleeveth is justified</hi> this is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent:
A grosse mistake: As if the major
proposition alone were equivalent to the
conclusion; or as if the conclusion must, or
can be meerly <hi>Credenda,</hi> a proper object
of Faith, when but one of the promises is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:106762:143"/>
matter of faith, &amp; the other of sence or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
The truth is the major, <hi>He that believeth
shall be saved</hi> is received by Faith: The minor
<hi>that I do sincerely believe</hi> is known by inward
sence and self-reflexion: And the conclusion
<hi>therefore I shall be saved</hi> is neither properly to
be believed nor felt, but known by reason, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
it from the two former; so that faith,
sense, and reason are all necessary to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
our assurance,</p>
                     <p>So you see, what it is that is sealed to.</p>
                     <p>2. Now let us consider, how it sealeth? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
absolutely or conditionally? And I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
It sealeth absolutely. For the promise
of God which it sealeth is not conditionally,
but absolutely true.</p>
                     <p>So that the summe of all I have said is this
(which answereth the severall questions.)</p>
                     <p>1. The Sacrament sealeth not the absolute
Covenant or Promise, but the conditionall
<hi>Believe and live.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. It sealeth not the truth of my Covenant,
as it is Gods seal; or it sealeth not to the truth
of my faith.</p>
                     <p>3. It sealeth not to the certainty of my ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
and salvation.</p>
                     <p>4. But it sealeth to Gods part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall
Covenant.</p>
                     <p>5. And sealeth this conditionall promise,
not conditionally, but absolutely, as of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:106762:143"/>
6. And not only as true in it self, but true
with application to me.</p>
                     <p>So that by this time you may discern what
is their meaning, who say, that the Sacraments
do seal but conditionally, that is, as it sealeth
to the truth of the major (which is the promise)
so thereby it may be said to seal conditionally
to the conclusion; for the conclusion is, as it
were, therein contained, upon condition or
supposition of the minor proposition. He that
saith. <hi>All Believers shall be saved,</hi> saith as much as
that <hi>I shall be saved;</hi> it being supposed that I am
a Believer: And so you must understand our
Divines in this, Yet this speech is lesse proper:
For to speak properly, it doth not seal to the
conclusion at all; yet it is very usefull to help
us in raising that conclusion, and to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that we are justified, because it so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
our belief of that promise, which is
one of the grounds of the Conclusion.</p>
                     <p>For your inference in the last words of your
objection <hi>then let all come that will;</hi> If you mean
<hi>All that will, though they come to mock or abuse the
ordinance,</hi> then it will no way follow from the
doctrine which I have now opened. But if you
mean. <hi>Let all come that will seriously, really, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently,
enter or renew their Covenant with
Christ.</hi> I think that to be no dangerous or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
consequence. If Christ when he offereth
himself, and the thing signified, do say. <hi>Let him
that is athirst, come; and whoever will, let him take
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:106762:144"/>
the water of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. Why may not
I say so of the sign and seal, to those that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
professe their thirst. Sure I shall
speak but as Christ hath taught me, and that
according to the very scope of the Gospel, and
the nature of the Covenant of free grace.
And I wonder that those men who cry up the
nature of free grace so much, should yet so
oppose this free offer of it, and the sealing the
free Covenant to them that lay claim to it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christs invitation.</p>

                     <head>To the tenth and eleventh
Objections.</head>
                     <p>YOur 10. and 11. objections you raise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my exceptions against the book, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Marrow of Modern Divinity:</hi> And
first you mention the Doctrine, and then the
Book.</p>
                     <p>1. You think, that <hi>Do this and live</hi> is the voice
of the Law of works only, and not of the Law
or Covenant of Grace, and that we may not
make the obtaining of life &amp; salvation the end
of duty, but must obey in meer love, and from
thankfulnesse for the life we have received.</p>
                     <p>To all which I answer. 1. By way of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and 2. of probation of my assertions.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Do this and live,</hi> in severall senses, is the
language of both Law and Gospel. 1. When
the Law speaketh it, the sense is this; <hi>If thou
perfectly keep the Laws that I have given thee or
shall give thee, so long thou shalt continue this life in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:106762:144"/>
the earthly Paradise which I have given thee:</hi> But
<hi>if once thou sinne, thou shalt dye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. When the Gospel speaketh it, the sense is
thus: Though thou hast incurred the penalty
of the Law by thy sinne, yet Christ hath made
satisfaction: Do but accept him for Lord and
Saviour, and renouncing all other, deliver up
thy self unreservedly to him, and love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, and obey him sincerely, both in doing
and suffering, and overcome &amp; persevere here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to the end; and thou shalt be justified from
all that the Law can accuse of, and restored to
the favour and blessings which thou hast lost,
and to a farre greater.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Gospel saith, <hi>Do this and live.</hi> That
the Gospel commandeth all this, I know you
will not question; and that this is doing, you
must needs acknowledge. But all the question
is, whether we may do it that we may live? I
have fully explained to you in this Treatise
already in what sense our doing is required,
and to what ends: <hi>viz.</hi> not to be any part of
a legall Righteousnesse nor any part of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for our unrighteousnesse; but to be
our Gospel righteousnesse, or the condition
of our participation in Christ, who is our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
Righteousnesse, and so of all the benefits
that come with him,</p>
                     <p>In these severall respects and senses fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Gospel commandeth us to act
for life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:106762:145"/>
1. A wicked man, or unbeliever, may, and must hear
the Word, pray, enquire of others, &amp;c. that so he may
obtain the first life of grace and faith. This I now prove,
<hi>Isa. 55. 3. 6, 7. Ionas 3. 8, 9. 10. Pro. 1. 23, 24. 25. Amos
5. 4. Act. 2. 37. Isa. 1. 16. Mat. 11. 15. &amp; 13. 43. Luk. 16.
29. 31. Ioh. 5. 25. Act. 10. 1, 2. 22. 23. Rom. 10. 13. 14,
1 Tim. 4. 16. Heb. 3, 7. Rev.</hi> 3, 20.</p>
                     <p>Yet do not I affirm. that God never preventeth mens
endeavours; he is sometime found of them that sought
him not. Nor do I say, that God hath promised the life
of Grace to the endeavours of nature; But their duty is
to seek life; and half promises, and many encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
God hath given them; such as that in Joel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 12,
13, 14. who knoweth but God will, &amp;c, So <hi>Zeph. 2. 3.
Exod.</hi> 32. 30. And that in <hi>Act. 8. 7. 2. Pray therefore if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. That a man may act for the increase of this spirituall
life when he hath it, methinks you should not doubt if
you do see, 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2. &amp; 1. 22. &amp; 2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7, 8. &amp; 3. 18.
And the Parable of the Talents Mat. 25, 26, 27. 28. 30.</p>
                     <p>3. That we may and must act for the life of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
and Iustification, and Adoption, is beyond dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute:
How oft doth Scripture call on men, to Repent, to
Believe, to Pray, to forgive others, and to reform, that
their sinnes may be forgiven them? I have quoted the
Scriptures before, when I opened the conditions of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
Isa. 1. 16, 17, 18. Isa. 55. 6, 7. Act. 8. 22. Iam. 5.
15. And we are still said to be justified by faith, which is
an act of ours.</p>
                     <p>4. That we may act for to obtain assurance both of
our justification and sanctification is undeniable, 2 Pet.
1. 10. 2 Cor. 13. 5. &amp;c,</p>
                     <p>5. That we may act for eternall life and salvation; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
he that beareth the face of a Christian, should not
deny: and that both for, 1. Title to it, 2. Assurance of our
enjoying it: &amp; 3. for possession it self. I shall but quote the
Scriptures for brevity sake, desiring you to read them,
and save me the labour of transcribing them, Rev. 22, 14.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:106762:145"/>
                        <hi>Iohn 5. 39, 40. Mat.</hi> 11. 12. and 7. 13. <hi>Luke 13.
24. Phil. 2. 17. Rom. 2. 7, 10. 1 Cor. 9. 24. 2 Tim.
2. 5, 12. 1 Tim. 6. 12, 18, 19. Phil. 3. 14, Mat.
25. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. last. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. and 5. 10, 11.
2 <hi>Pet. 1. 10, 11. Luke 11. 28. Heb. 4. 1. Luke
12. 5. 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 17. These last places shew, that
the escaping hell, and damnation, is a necessary end
of our actings and duties, as well as the obtaining
of heaven.</p>
                     <p>If when you have read and weighed these Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
you be not convinced, that we may act or
do for life and salvation, (and so that <hi>Do this and
live</hi> is in some sense the language of the Gospell)
I shall question, whether you make the Scripture
the Rule of your faith, or be not rather one of them
that can force upon themselves a faith of one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
making.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object,</hi> But it is not the most excellent and
Gospel-like frame of spirit, to do all out of meer
love to God, and from Thankfulnesse for life ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by Christ, and given us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If it come not from love to God, it is
not sincere.</p>
                     <p>2. Yet doth not the Gospell any where set our
love to God, and to our own souls, in opposition;
nor teach us to love God, and not our selves: but
contrarily joineth them both together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
us both, The love of our selves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of our preservation, would never have been
planted so deeply in our natures by the God of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if it had been unlawfull.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:106762:146"/>
I conclude therefore, that to love God, and not
our selves, and so to do all without respect to our
own good, is no Gospell frame of spirit.</p>
                     <p>2. Thankfulnesse for what we have received, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in possession, title, or promise, must be a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
spur to put us on duty. But I pray you tell
me, Have you received all the life and mercy you
do expect? Are you in Heaven already? Have
you all the grace that you need or desire in degree?
If not, why may you not labour for that you have
not, as well as be thankfull for that you have?
Or have you as full a certainty of it hereafter, as
you do desire? If not, why may you not labour
for it.</p>
                     <p>ANd to shew you the vanity, and intolerable,
damnable wickednesse of this doctrine, let
me put to you a few more considerations.</p>
                     <p>1. Do you think you may act for your naturall
life, to preserve it, or recover and repair any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayings
in it? if not, why will you labour, and
eat, and drink, and sleep? why will you seek
to the Physician when you are sick? Do you
all this in meer love, or thankfulnesse, or from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
which hath no further end? Or if you
do, why may you not do as much for your soul,
as for your body? Is it lesse worth, or doth
not God require it, or will he not give you
leave? Hath not Christ redeemed your body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so?
and is it not his purchase, and charge, and
work to provide for it? And yet you know well
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:106762:146"/>
enough, that this excuseth not you from your duty;
and why then should it excuse you from using
means for your soul?</p>
                     <p>2. Nay, hath not God put you upon farre
more for your soul, then for your body? For this
life, he hath bid you be carefull for nothing; cast
all your care on him, for he careth for you; Care
not for to morrow: <hi>Why are ye carefull O ye of
little faith? Labour not for the food that perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
Lay not up for your selves a treasure on earth,
&amp;c.</hi> But hath he said so concerning the life of your
souls in immortallity, Care not, labour not, lay
not up a treasure in heaven? Or rather hath he not
commanded you the clean contrary, to care, to fear,
to labour, to strive, to fight, to run, and this withall
your might and strength? And yet do you think
you may not act or work for life and salvation?</p>
                     <p>3. I pray you tell me, Do you ever use to pray
or no? Do you think it necessary or lawfull to
pray (pardon me for putting such grosse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories
to you; for the main question which
you raise, is farre more grosse:) If you do pray,
what do you pray for? Is it onely for your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or also for your soul? And is not earnest pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for life, pardon, and salvation, some proper
kind of doing? it may be you will say, you pray
onely for Gods glory, and for the Church: But
hath not God as much care of his Church and his
glory, as of your soul? or may you pray for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens souls, and not your own, when you
are bound to love them but as your self? Sure,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:106762:147"/>
if you may not make the obtaining of life, the
end of your labour and dutie, you may not make
it the end of your Prayers, which are part of your
labour and dutie.</p>
                     <p>And indeed according to the opinion which I
oppose, it must needs follow, that Petition is to be
laid aside, and no part of prayer lawfull, but praise
and thanksgiving.</p>
                     <p>4. Do you not forget to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
earth and Heaven? I assure you, if you do,
it will prove a foul mistake; if you once begin to
think you are in Heaven, and as you would be,
and all the work is done, and you have nothing
to do but return thanks, you shall ere long, I
warrant you, be convinced roundly of your errour.
And I pray you, what do you lesse by this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then say, Soul, take thy rest, I am well, I
have enough: For if you must not labour for life,
and salvation, but onely in thankfulnesse obey
him that hath saved you: What is this, but the
work of Heaven? Indeed there, and onely there
we shall have nothing to do, but to love, and joy,
and, praise, and be thankfull.</p>
                     <p>5. Methinks, if you do but consider what
Heaven and Hell, reward and the punishment
are, you should easily come to your self and
the truth. Heaven and reward is nothing else
but the enjoyment of God eternally in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Hell or the punishment is most in the losse
of this enjoyment, and the self-tormentings
that will eternally follow the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:106762:147"/>
thereof, and of the folly that procured it.</p>
                     <p>Now is it such a legall slavish mercenary
thing for a Christian to seek after the fruition of
God? Or to be carefull that he may not be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
deprived of it? is it possible that any sober
considering man can think so?</p>
                     <p>6, Do you not think that you may and must
seek after the enjoyment of God in those begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and fore-tasts which are here to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
May not that be the end of your duties, care,
fear, labour, watchfulnesse? May you not
groan after him, and enquire, and turn the stream
of your endeavours this way? And may you not
be jealous, and carefull, and watchfull, lest you
should loose what of God you do enjoy; and lest
any strangenesse or displeasure should arise? I
dare not question, but that this is the very busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which you mind, and the usuall frame of
your spirit.</p>
                     <p>And is it possible, that you can think it our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to seek the fore-tasts, and the first fruits of
Heaven, and yet think it unlawfull to labour for
the full everlasting possession? How can these hang
together.</p>
                     <p>7, Consider seriously, I pray you, to what
end God implanted such affections and powers in
your soul. Why did he create in you a power
and propensity to intend the ultimate end in all
your endeavours, to value that end, to love it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it, study and care how to obtain it; to fear the
losse of it, and to loath all that resisteth your frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:106762:148"/>
to seek and labour after its enjoyment? Why
is the love of our selves, and desire of our preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
so naturall? Surely it is lawfull for you to
care and desire, and labour for God in Heaven, or
for nothing: And its our duty to fear the losse of
this, or to fear no evill at all: and I can hardly
think that God would create such powers in the
soul which should be utterly uselesse. Then let us
no more cry down the abuse of our affections and
powers, but the use of them; and so turn worse
then Stoicks: this is such a making God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of sin, as few men durst ever before be guilty
of. And certainly, if the escaping of Hell and the
obtaining of Heaven may not be the end and work
of all these affections, then much lesse may any
inferiour thing.</p>
                     <p>8. Nay, consider whether you do not make the
soul and life of man to be uselesse as to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of any future happinesse: And so you take
down the blessed order which God hath establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in nature by Creation, and maintained in the
constant course of providence; and this you unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
do in taking down from us the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
end: Take down that, and all inferiour
ends are nothing, and all meanes do lose their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and become uselesse: and so the soul of the
most gracious man shall be no fitter to attain and
prosecute its end, and do no more thereto then a
beast or a stone; This consequence is undeniable.</p>
                     <p>9. Nay, consider whether you do not make
all the graces of the Spirit (except love, joy, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:106762:148"/>
thankfulnesse) to be almost vain, and the blessed
supernaturall work of the spirit upon us, to be a
uselesse labour? doth not God onely create in
nature, but also new create by grace in us such
things as Desire, Care, Fear, Zeal, Courage, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
Watchfulnesse, &amp;c. and may we not use
them? Surely, if we may not use them for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
then for nothing. And I cannot believe that
God will at so dear a rate plant in us a heavenly
nature, and these heavenly Graces, and then make
it our sinne to use them for Heaven, and that while
we are here in the way where we have such need of
them.</p>
                     <p>10. But especially, I would have you through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider to what end God did fill his word so
with Precepts, Prohibitions. Promises conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Threats? Doth not almost all the
Scripture for the doctrinall part consist of these?
And are not Precepts to put us on to dutie? And
hath not every duty its end even for our selves?
And can it be any other then the obtaining of the
fruition of God in Heaven? so what end have the
prohibition else? And what are the conditionall
promises for, but to stirre us up to believe and to
performe the conditions, that so we may enjoy the
promised good? And why are the Threatnings
but with the fear of the evill threatned to deterre
us from the sinne, and to the dutie? What
think you is the reason that God doth so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Promise Heaven, and threaten Hell, if it
be unlawfull for us to labour for Heaven, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:106762:149"/>
to escape Hell? Do you not hereby insinuate
an accusation of vanity at least against God and
his Lawes? Nay, the very essence of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
doth consist in all these parts conjunct: And
will you also overthrow the very essentiall parts
of the Law or Covenant, by making it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for us to admit their proper use? To quote
the particular places for this, would be needlesse
and endlesse.</p>
                     <p>11 Methinks you should be so farre from que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning
the lawfulnesse of labouring for Heaven,
that you should rather think you have almost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to labour for. Gods glory and your sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
not disjunct, but conjunct, are all the
businesse you have to look after: What do
you live for? Why have you all the mercies of
your life? Is it onely that you may be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for life and mercie? Or that you might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
improve them to some further advantage?
I hope (for all your question) that you make it
the greatest labour of your life to seek for assurance
and obtainment of your eternall happinesse in
God.</p>
                     <p>12. And once more let me intreat you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
whether there be any hope of that mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
who shall reduce this your doctrine into
his practise? I abhorre censoriousnesse, but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it may be considered, because it is a matter
of such unspeakable importance: For surely, if this
Doctrine practised will not stand with salvation,
it is time for you and all men to abhorre it: And
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:106762:149"/>
indeed, this is it that maketh me say so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, because it hath a holy pretence, and is
very plausible to the inconsiderate, but yet is no
better then damnable if it be practised: I say,
if practised, because the opinion as such is not
so; for I believe many a godly man doth erre as
foully as this. But it is possible for a man by
reading and argument, to be drawn to entertain
some opinions in his brain, (not onely consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but) directly contrary to the practice of his
heart and life, and yet himself to continue that
practice: Even as a wicked man may entertain
those truths into his brain in speculation, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to contradict his continued practice. Now
it being the practice here that is of absolute necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to salvation, and not the opinion, I doubt not
but such that erre onely in this opinion, not reducing
it into practice, may be saved.</p>
                     <p>But if practised, I cannot see but it will certainly
damne.</p>
                     <p>For search the Scriptures impartially and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
whether seeking Heaven be not necessarie to
the obtaining of it? And whether those that seek
not, and labour not for it, be not shut out? View
over the places which I quoted you before, and
then judge. Must not all that will have life,
come to Christ, that they may have it? <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.
39, 40, And must not they strive to enter in at
the straight gate, and lay violent hands on the
Kingdome of Heaven? And lay up for themselves
a treasure in heaven, and seek the Kingdome of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106762:150"/>
God and his Righteousnesse in the first place,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. And presse on that we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Resurrection, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 14. And lay
up a good foundation against the time to come,
doing good works, and lay hold on eternall life,
1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 6. 12, 18, 19. And work out our
salvation with fear and trembling, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12.
And do his commandments, that we may have
right to the Tree of Life, and enter in by the gates
into the City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14. And make friends
of the unrighteous Mammon, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us into everlasting habitations; See also
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19. 23. 26, 27,
28, 29. and 3. 2, 3, 4, 5, 8. 10, 11, 12, 13, 15,
16, 20, 21, 22. See also <hi>Mat. 18. 8, 9. Iohn</hi> 5.
29. <hi>Act, 2. 28, 1 Tim. 4 8. Iam. 1, 12. 1 Pet.</hi> 3.

<hi>Heb. 2. 3. 2 Tim. 2. 10. 1 Thes. 5. 8, 9. Act.</hi> 16. 17.</p>
                     <p>Yea, we are commanded to fear him that is
able to destroy both soul and body in Hell: even
under that consideration to fear him, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 5.
And to fear, lest a promise being left us of entring
into rest, we should come short of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. And
what is that but to fear the losse of Heaven, or to
fear Hell? <hi>Prov. 15. 24. Mar.</hi> 3. 29, &amp; 16. 16.
<hi>Mat. 5. 25. Rom. 11. 21, 44. 1 Cor. 10. 12. Heb.</hi>
12. 15, 16, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 9, 12.</p>
                     <p>But I must stop; for if I should quote all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
that prove this, I should transcribe a great
part of the Bible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:106762:150"/>
Consider then, if even many that seek to enter
shall not be able, whether they are like to enter
that never seek? And if the righteous be scarcely
saved, what shall become of them that thought it
unlawfull to labour for salvation?</p>
                     <p>13. Lastlie, how is it that you do not see, that
by this Doctrine you condemne not all the Saints
onelie, but even the Lord himself? Did not <hi>Paul</hi>
therefore keep under his bodie, and bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
subjection, lest when he had preached to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
himself should be a cast-away? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27.
what can be plainer? Did not <hi>Abraham</hi> obey
because he looked for a Citie which had foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 10. And <hi>Moses,</hi> because he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the recompence of Reward? 26. And all
that cloud of witnesses obey and suffer, that they
might attain a better Resurrection? 35. and did
they not seek a better Countrey that is, an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie;
and therefore God is not ashamed to be called
their God: <hi>for he hath prepared for them a City,</hi>
ver. 16. Do not all that confesse themselves stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
on earth, plainlie declare that they seek
another Countrie? ver. 13, 14. Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall hereafter tell you, that you must not
do good to attain salvation or escape damnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as being too mercenarie and slavish for a Sonne of
God; abhorre his Doctrine, though he were an
Angel from heaven: And if this satisfie you not,
look to Jesus the Authour and Finisher of your
Faith, who for the joy that was set before him,
endured the Crosse, despising the shame, and is set
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:106762:151"/>
down at the right hand of God; <hi>Heb. 12. 12. Rom.
14,</hi> 9. And as <hi>Adam</hi> fell to be liker the Devil
when he needs would be as God: so take heed
whither you are falling when you will be better
then Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>And do I after all this need to answer the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
objections, that it is mercenarie and slavish,
to labour for salvation? Must I be put to prove
that the Apostles and Christ himself were not
mercenarie slaves? or that Gods Word hath
not prescribed us a slavish task? Indeed if we did
all for a reward distant from God, and for that
alone, without any conjunction of Filiall love, and
expected this Reward for the worth of our work,
then it might be well called Mercenary and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish.
But who among us plead for such a working.</p>
                     <p>FRom all this you may gather part of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to your next Question: why I except
against the book called, <hi>The Marrow of Modern
Divinity?</hi> Because it is guiltie of this hainous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
Yet further let me tell you, that I much
value the greatest part of that Book, and commend
the industrie of the Authour, and judge him a man
of godlinesse and Moderation by his writing: And
had I thought as meanlie of it, as I do of <hi>Colyer,
Sprigs, Hobsons,</hi> and manie such abominable
Pamphlets that now fly abroad I should not have
thought it worthy the taking so much notice of. But
because it is otherwise usefull, I thought meet to
give you warning, that you drink not in the evill
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:106762:151"/>
with the good. And especially because the names
that so applaud it, may be a probable snare to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
you herein. And I conjecture the Authours
ingenuity to be such, that he will be glad to know
his own mistakes, and to correct them: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I am unfeignedly tender of depraving or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at any mans labours. Some of these mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
passages I will shew you briefly. As page
174. <hi>Quest.</hi> Would you not have believers to
esc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ew evill and do good for fear of Hell, or for
hope of Heaven? <hi>Ans.</hi> No indeed, I would not
have any beleiver doe the one or the other: for so
farre as they do so, their obedience is but slavish,
&amp;c. To which end he alledgeth, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74. 75.
But that speaks of Freedome from fear of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
such as Christ forbids in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 5. where
yet he commandeth the fearing of God: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
even that fear of enemies is forbidden,
as they stand in opposition to God, and not as his
instrnments in subordination. Or if it be even a
fear of God that is there meant; yet it cannot be
all fear of him or his displeasure: so far as we are
in danger of sin or suffering, we must fear it: and
so farre as our assurance is still imperfect: a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
of our own hearts, and a dreadfull reverence
of God also are necessary. But not the Legall
terrours of our former bondage, such as arise from
the apprehension of sin unpardoned, and of God
as being our Enemy.</p>
                     <p>In the 180 Page, he denieth the plain sence of the
Text. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="278" facs="tcp:106762:152"/>
In the 155 page, he makes this the difference
between the two Covenants: One saith, Do this
and Live: the other saith, Live and do this, The
one saith, Do this, for life, The other saith, Do
this from life.</p>
                     <p>But I have proved fully, that the Gospel also
saith, Do this for life.</p>
                     <p>So in his second part, page 190. His great note
to know the voice of the Law by, is this, [that
when in Scripture there is any morall work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be done either for the eschuing of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
or upon promise of any reward tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
or eternall; or else when any promise is made
with the condition of any work to be done, which
is commanded in the Law; there is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the voice of the Law.</p>
                     <p>A notorious and dangerous mistake, which
would make almost all the New Testament, and
the very Sermons of Christ himself to be nothing
but the Law of works, I have fully proved before,
that morall duties as part of our sincere obedience
to Christ, are part of the condition of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and for it to be performed. And even Faith
is a morall duty. It is pitty that any Christian
should no better know the Law from the Gospel:
especially one that pretendeth to discover it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>So in the next page 191, he intolerably abuseth
the Scripture, in affirming that of 2 <hi>Thes. 2. 12.
10.</hi> to be the voice of the Law, and so making <hi>Paul</hi>
a Legall Preacher.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:106762:152"/>
And as shamefully doth he abuse 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9,
10., As if the Apostle when he biddeth them, not
to be decived, were deceiving them himself in
telling them, that no unrighteous person, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
adulterers, &amp;c. <hi>shall inherit the Kingdom of
God.</hi> Is this Law? Then let me be a Preacher of
the Law. If <hi>Paul</hi> be a Legalist, I will be one too.
But these men know not, that the Apostle speaketh
of those that die such; and that these sinnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
men the Kingdom, as they are Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ their Lord, and so a violation of the
New Covenant.</p>
                     <p>So in part first page 189. He mentioneth a
Preacher, that said, he durst not exhort nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
sinners to believe their sinnes were pardoned,
before he saw their lives reformed, for fear they
should take more liberty to sin. And he censureth
that Preacher to be ignorant in the Mystery of
faith. I confesse I am such an ignorant Preacher
my self; and therefore shall desire this knowing
man to resolve me in a few doubts. 1. Where he
learned, or how he can prove, that Justifying Faith
is a believing that our sinnes are pardoned? when
Scripture so often telleth us, that we are justified
by Faith: and sure the Object must go before the
Act; and therefore that which followeth the Act
is not the Object,</p>
                     <p>If we must believe that we are pardoned, that
so we may be pardoned; then we must believe a
lye to make it a truth. Also doth not the Scripture
bid us <hi>Repent, believe, and be baptized for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:106762:153"/>
of sinnes;</hi> but not first to believe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of our sinnes? I have proved already that
justifying Faith is another matter: and this which
he calleth Faith is properly no Faith at all; but
the knowledge of a conclusion, one of whose
permises is afforded by Faith, and the other by
Sense.</p>
                     <p>If therefore the Preacher had said, that he
would not have men accept Christ, and so believe
for Remission, before their lives be reformed, then
I should have subscribed to this mans censure of
him. 2. I desire him to tell me, whether he can
prove that any mans sinnes are pardoned before
they have accepted Christ for their Lord? that is,
before Faith. If not, 3. Whether this be not the
subjection of the soul to Christ to be governed by
him; and so a heart-reformation? 4. Whether
the reformation of the life doth not immediately
even the same moment follow the hearts reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
And if all this be so, (as I know it is) then
the ignorant Preachers doctrine must stand good,
that Reformation of life must go before the belief
or knowledge of pardon, though not before justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faith.</p>
                     <p>Many other intolerable errours I could shew
you in that Book: as his making the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to threaten nothing but present Afflictions,
and losse of our present communion with God,
page, 208. and that we may pray for no other
kind of pardon. pag 206, 210. contrary to <hi>Mar.
16. 16. Heb. 10, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:106762:153"/>
Heb. 2. 3. Ioh.</hi> 15. 2, 6. and many other places:
so his affirming that we sinne not against the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works; which I have confuted in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorismes.</p>
                     <p>So his making the Law of Christ and the Law
of Faith to be two Lawes or Covenants: when
that which he calleth the Law of Christ is but part
of the matter of the New Covenant.</p>
                     <p>But this is not my businesse; only because you
urged me, I have given you a grain of salt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to season some passages in your reading that
and such like Books.</p>
                     <p>And that passage in M. <hi>Shepheards Select ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
page 96, 102. that no unregenerate man is
within the compasse of any conditionall promise
had need of a grain too.</p>

                     <head>To the twelfth Objection.</head>
                     <p>WHat you object concerning my making a
necessity of publick covenanting, I wholly
acknowledge: And I heartily wish, that instead of
our large mixt Nationall Covenant; and instead of
the Independants Politicall Church-making Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
we had the Gospel or New Covenant condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
formally in publick rendered to all the people
of this Land: &amp; that the same being opened to them,
they might knowingly and seriously professe their
consent, (&amp; if they subscribed their names, it would
be more solemnly engaging: and this before they
receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="282" facs="tcp:106762:154"/>
This, 1. would take off most Arguments which
are brought for a necessity of Re-baptizing: 2.
And would tend much to engage men to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to Christ, when they have so solemnly
promised it under their hands. 3. And I think that
as an unfeigned heart covenanting with Christ is
true faith, and of the Essence of our Christianity;
so is this publike covenanting of our visible Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                     <p>Though other mens promises on our behalfe
may be of use to infants; yet when we come to
age, we are bound of absolute necessity to a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Faith and covenanting.</p>
                     <p>This also would answer the ends of the ancient
custom of Confirmation: And to this end is it,
that the Church hath still used to rehearse the
Greed, or Articles of Faith, and to require the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to stand up to signifie their Assent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
which, for my part, I think not onely a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
custome, but for the substance of it, a matter
of necessity; so we do but carefully keep away
that Customarinesse, ceremoniousnesse and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which spoileth the most necessary and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
duties.</p>
                     <p>I could wish therefore that this practice were
established by Authority. And, for my self,
I do administer the Sacrament to none, that
do not solemnly professe their assent to every fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Article of Faith expresly mentioned
to them, and their consent that Christ shall be
their Lord and Saviour and that they will
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:106762:154"/>
faithfully and sincerely obey his Scripture Lawes.</p>

read, what other men say in these controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
my mind was so prepossessed with their noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that I could not possibly see the truth, in its

into publick disputations concerning it,
though I was truely willing to know the truth,
yet my mind was so forestalled with borrowed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that I chiefly studied how to make good the
opinions which I had received, and ran further
still from the truth: yea when I read the truth in
Doctor <hi>Preston</hi> and other means writings, I did not
consider and understand it: and when I heard it
from them, whom I opposed in wrangling dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
or read it in books of controversie, I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
it least of all, but only was sharpened the

cast far from home, where I had no book but my
Bible, I set to study the truth from thence, and
from the nature of the things, and naked evidence;
and so by the blessing of God, discovered more in
one week, then I had done before in seventeen
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:106762:155"/>

one who is beyond all exception for piety, Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxnesse,
and Learning, even Dr. <hi>Preston.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. That Faith containeth severall acts.</p>
                     <p>2. That it is both in the understanding and will.</p>
                     <p>3. That the principal act is accepting or consent.</p>
                     <p>4. That it is the accepting of Christ for Lord as
well as Saviour.</p>
                     <p>5. That the object is Christ himself, and not his
benefits but in a remote sence and secondarily.</p>
                     <p>6. That Faith consisteth in Covenanting or
Marriage contract. All these he is so plain and full
in, that I find him speaking my own thoughts in
my own words: and begun to think when I read
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:106762:155"/>
him, that men would think I borrowed all from
Dr. <hi>Preston.</hi> Read him in his Treatise of Faith. pag.
44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 89, 97. Also <hi>Of
Effectull Faith,</hi> pag. 40, 41. 87, And <hi>Treatise
of Faith,</hi> pag. 14, 15, 16, 20, 21. 56, 57, 58.</p>
                     <p>7. But especially, the chief point that I stand
upon, &amp; am like to be opposed most in, he handleth
so fully and asserteth so frequently, as if it were the
choicest notion which he desired to divulge, <hi>viz.</hi>
That justifying faith, as such, is a taking of Christ
for Lord as well as for Saviour. Of so many places
I will transcribe two or three.</p>
                     <p>And first his definition of the active part of
faith, is the very same with mine. <hi>Of Faith,</hi> pag.
44. It is to Believe, not onely that Christ is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us, but also to take and receive him as a Lord
and Saviour, that is, both to be saved by him, and
to obey him. Mark it (saith he) I put them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to take him as a Lord and Saviour;
for you shall finde that in the ordinary phrase
of Scripture, they are put together, Jesus
Christ our Lord and Saviour; therefore we
must take heed of disjoyning those that God
hath joyned together: We must take Christ
as well for a Lord as a Saviour; let a man
do this, and he may be assured that his faith
is a justifying faith; therefore mark it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently;
if a man will take Christ for a Saviour
onely, that will not serve the turn; Christ giveth
not himself to any upon that condition only to save
him, but we must take him as a Lord too, to be
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:106762:156"/>
subject to him, and obey him, and to square our
actions according to his will, &amp;c. pag. 45.</p>
                     <p>So of <hi>Effectuall Faith,</hi> pag. 92. Now faith is
nothing but this: We come and tell you that
Christ is offered; if you will be content to let all
these things go, and to turn your hearts to him,
then the whole bent of a mans mind is turned the
contrary way and set upon Christ; this is such
Faith indeed, &amp;c. Now i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> we were not mistaken
in it, there would be no question of this: We think
that faith is nothing but a perswasion that our sins
are forgiven a perswasion that the promises are
true, and the Scripture true, a perswasion that
Christ died for my sins: And thence it is, that men
are apt to be deceived in it. If they took Faith
as it is in its self, (a Marriage of our selves to Christ,
with all our heart and affections, when he hath
given himself to us as in Marriage and we are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him.) in doing this, we should never be
deceived.</p>
                     <p>So in his Treatise of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> pag.
458. you must know that the Covenant is then
dissolved, when that is dissolved that did make the
Covenant: Lock what it is that puts a man into
the Covenant of Grace at the first; when that is
taken away, then the Covenant is disannulled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and us; but till then the Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
sure. Now what is it that makes the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
Mark it: This is that which makes the
Covenant; when Jesus Christ offereth himself to
us, and makes known his consent, &amp;c. when we
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106762:156"/>
again come and take him, and give our consent to
make him our Lord, and we subject our selves to
him to be his; when we say to the promised seed,
He shall be my God and my Governour, and I
will be among his people, and be subject to him;
I say, when the heart gives a full consent to this,
&amp;c. now the Covenant and contract is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. Now as long as this union continues
between Christ and us, the Covenant is not disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled;
So that in a word, the Covenant is never
nullified till thou hast chosen to thy self another
husband, till thou hast taken to thy self another
Lord, &amp;c. pag. 459.</p>
                     <p>So that here you see 8<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. that every infirmity
breaks not the Covenant. See also <hi>Treatise of Love,</hi>
pag. 147.</p>
                     <p>9 That there is a Gospel curse following the
breach of the Gospel Law, and that it is unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealable
and more terrible then that of the Law
pag. 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>10, What near conjunction love hath with
Faith in justifying. See <hi>Treatise of Effectuall
Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 41, 42.</p>
                     <p>11, That the promise and offer of Christ is
generall, see <hi>Treatise of Faith,</hi> pag. 9, 10. I will
transcribe but one more, <hi>Treatise of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
pag. 317, 318. You must know there is
a two-fold Covenant, one of works, another of
grace, &amp;c, The Covenant of grace runs in these
termes [Thou shalt believe; thou shalt take my
Sonne for thy Lord and thy Saviour, and thou
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:106762:157"/>
shalt likewise receive the gift of Righteousnesse,
which was was wrought by him, for an absolution
for thy sinnes, for a reconciliation with me, and
thereupon thou shalt grow up in love &amp; obedience,
towards me, <hi>Then I will be thy God, and thou shalt
be my people.</hi>] This is the Covenant of grace, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In this you see also, 12<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That love and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
obedience are parts of the condition of the
New Coveuant.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see I am not in these 12. points sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular;
and in more could I also prove his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text;
though in some things I confesse he differeth;
as in making Faith an instrument in our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
pag. 54. <hi>Of Faith.</hi> But as I take that to be a
small difference; so it is apparent by the forecited
places, that he took Faith to justifie, as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant; and so the difference is but
verball; yet speaking in the common phrase put
him upon that absurdity, pag. 56. <hi>Treatise of
Faith, viz.</hi> to say, That reconciling and justifying
are acts of Faith: If he had said, but that they are
effects of Faith, it had been more then (in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
strict sence taken) can be proved.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="15" type="answer">
                     <head>To the fifteenth Objections.</head>
                     <p>TO your fifteenth Objection I answer, 1. The
Apostle in those places dealeth with the Jews,
who trusted to works without and against Christ:
This is nothing against them that set not up works
in opposition nor coordination but onely in subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
to Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="289" facs="tcp:106762:157"/>
2. If I affirmed that works are the least part
of that Righteousnesse which the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
and which must be so pleaded to our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
then I should offend against the
freenesse of grace: But when I affirme, that all
our legall Righteousnesse is onely in Christ,
then doe I not make the reward to be of debt,
or lesse free.</p>
                     <p>3. The Apostle in the same verse <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5.
saith, that his Faith is counted for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse;
and I have proved before that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is a part of Faith.</p>
                     <p>4. The Apostle plainly speaketh of that
Righteousnesse whereby we are formally righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and which we must plead that we may
be justified from the accusation of the Law;
and this is neither in Faith nor works, but in
Christ: But he nowhere speaketh against that
which is only the condition of our participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that, and whereby we must escape the
condemnation of the Gospell, which is Faith,
as I have opened before.</p>
                     <p>5. If the Apostle should meane otherwise,
it were as much against your Doctrine as mine.
For is not Faith a work or act of ours? But
you will say, That though Faith which is a
work do justifie, yet not as a work, but as an
instrument. I answer.</p>
                     <p>1. To be an actuall apprehension of Christ
(which you call its instrumentality) is to bee
a work; Therefore, if it justifie as it is such an
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:106762:158"/>
apprehension, it justifieth as a work.</p>
                     <p>2. So also say I, that subjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
justifie, 1. Not as works simply conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
2. Nor as legall works; 3. Nor as meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
works; 4. Nor as Good works which
God is pleased with; 5. But as the conditions
to which the free Law-giver hath promised ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
and life.</p>
                     <p>Nay, your Doctrine ascribeth farre more
of the work to man then mine; for you make
justification an effect of your own Faith, and
your Faith the instrumentall cause of it, and
so make your selfe your owne justifier. And
you say your Faith justifieth, as it apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
Christ, which is the most intrinsecall;
essentiall consideration of Faith, and so Faith
hath much of the honour. But while I affirm
that it justifieth onely as a condition, which
is an extrinsecall consideration, and aliene
from its essence or nature, I give the glory to
him that freely giveth me life, and that made
so sweet a condition to his Covenant, and
that enableth me to performe the said condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have according to my measure
of understanding answered your Objections,
as fully as necessitated brevity would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
                     <p>And for that question which you propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about Relaxation, Abrogation, &amp;c. of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:106762:158"/>
the Law, which you confesse you doe not well
understand; I refer you to <hi>Vossius Defens. Grotii
de Satisf.</hi> cap. 27. where (among other things)
hee telleth you that <hi>Apud Romanos seu ferenda
esset Lex, populus rogabatur an ferrivellet? seu tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendae,
rogabatur, an tolli eam placeret? Hinc ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gari
lex dicebatur, quae ferrebatur, ut dicit Vlp.
Tit. 1. Regal. Eâdemque de causâ abrogari diceba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
cum antiquaretur, &amp;c.</hi> And then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
all those phrases to you out of <hi>Vlpian.
Lex rogatur, id est, fertur; vel abrogatur, idest,
prior lex tollitur; vel Derogatur, id est, pars primae
tollitur: aut subrogatur, id est adjicitur aliquid primae
legi: aut Obrogatur, id est, mutatur aliquid ex
primâlege.</hi> And so concludeth, that the first
Law was not abrogated, but relaxed, dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with, and obrogate.</p>
                     <p>How farre it was executed, I have shewed
you in the Treatise.</p>
                     <p>But the last task you set me, is of all the rest
most ungratefull, endlesse, and (in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
unnecessary, <hi>viz.</hi> [To answer what
other men have written against some doctrines
which I have here asserted.]</p>
                     <p>1. It is a work ungratefull to search into
other mens weaknesse and mistakes; to handle
the truth in a way of contention or to speak in
way of derogation of the labours of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and godly.</p>
                     <p>2. And should I fall upon a confutation of
every man that hath written contrary to any
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:106762:159"/>
thing in my Book, the task would be endlesse,
and I might stuffe a great deale of paper with
words against words, and perhaps adde little
matter to what is already written; which is a
work unfit me for to undertake who have so
much better work to doe, and am like to have
so short a time to doe it in.</p>
                     <p>3. And it seemes to me a needlesse task;
partly because from the cleering and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the positive truth, you may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to answer opposers your selfe.</p>
                     <p>2. The Authors which you mention doe so
easily and effectually assault the doctrines
mentioned, that I should think no judicious
man can thereby be staggered.</p>
                     <p>But at your request I will briefly consider
them particularly.</p>
                     <p>The Authors which you refer me to, are
two, D. <hi>Maccovius,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Owen.</hi> The points
which they contradict are three.</p>
                     <p>1. That our legall Righteousnesse which
we have in Christ, consisteth not formally in
obedience to the Precept of the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
but onely in satisfaction for our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.
This <hi>Maccovius</hi> opposeth in <hi>Colleg.
Theol. par 1 Disp. 10. &amp; par. 4. Disp.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>2. [That Christ payed not the same debt
which was in the first obligation, but the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;
and so the Law was not properly and fully
executed, but relaxed.] This, you say, Mr.
<hi>Owen</hi> confuteth in <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his late Treatise
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:106762:159"/>
of <hi>Vniversall Redemption,</hi> lib. 3 cap. 7. p. 140.</p>
                     <p>3. [That no man is actually and absolutely
justified (no not so much as in point of Right)
either from eternity, or upon the meere pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the bebt by Christ, till themselves
doe beleeve.] This, you say, is confuted by
both of them, <hi>Maccov. par. 3. Disp. 16. &amp; par.
1. Disp. 17. Et owen ubi supra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If mens names did not more take with you
then their Arguments, you might have spared
me this labour. But briefly to the first of these
I answer.</p>
                     <p>1. Most passages in <hi>Maccovius</hi> doe affirm but
that Christ obeyed for us, as well as suffered
for us; and who denyeth that?</p>
                     <p>2. Of those passages which yet goe further,
there is few of them that say any more then
this, that Christs active Righteousnesse did
merit for us that life and glory which is given
by the New Covenant, more then we lost by
breaking the Old: But this is nothing to our
Question which is onely about justification.
For I have cleared to you before, that Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is (properly and strictly taken) one of
those acts whereby we are recovered from the
condemnation of the Law, and set in <hi>statu quo
prius;</hi> and not one of those acts which give us
that additionall glory which is Adoption,
Union, Glorification.</p>
                     <p>3. Those few Arguments which yet doe
drive higher then this, are so fully answered
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:106762:160"/>
already by Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> against <hi>Lucius, Gomar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,,</hi>
&amp;c. and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> (notwithstanding
Mr. <hi>Roboroughs</hi> Answer) and divers others,
that I am resolved not to lose so much time
and labour, as to doe that which is better
done already, then can be expected from me.</p>
                     <p>4. Onely one argument more then usuall
I finde in <hi>part 1 Disput.</hi> 10. And which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
deserveth a speciall consideration, And
that is this. [If Christ onely suffered for us,
then the righteousnesse of <hi>Adam,</hi> had hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in innocency, would have been more
excellent then the righteousnesse of Christ:
For the law requireth obedience principally
and suffering but <hi>per accidens.</hi> But the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is false, because else Christ hath not
set us in as good a state as we fell from.]</p>
                     <p>To this I answer. 1. This righteousnesse
may be termed excellent in severall respects.
1 In reference to its Rule: 2. Or in reference
to its Ends. The 1. denominateth it Good in
it self: The second denominateth it good to
us. Now the Rules to measure it by, are two:
1. The neerest inferiour Rule; which is the
Law: 2. The remote superiour Rule; which
is the good pleasure and will of the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</p>
                     <p>2. The ends which may denominate our
righteousnesse more excellent, are: 1 The
glory of Gods justice and mercy: 2. The glory
of the Mediatours love, and the setting up of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:106762:160"/>
his kingdom: 3 And the good of the creature:
Or rather all these in one.</p>
                     <p>Now these things thus standing, I answer
thus. 1 I acknowledge that the Law made for
mankinde doth primarily require obedience,
and but secondarily suffering, and upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of disobedience.</p>
                     <p>2. But you must distinguish betwixt what
the law requireth of us, and what of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour:
the law to the creature, and the law
to the Mediatour, are in severall things diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
The will of his Father which he came to
doe, consisted in many things which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
required of us: such are all the works pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the office of Mediatourship. Now
though the Law required of us meer creatures
primarily Obedience active; Yet that which
was principally imposed upon the Mediatour
and undertaken by him, was to satisfie for our
disobedience: And so the principall part of
his works was passive obedience, and that in
him was as excellent or more then Active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
though in us it would not have been
so; because the law did not require it of us
in the first place, as it did of Christ.</p>
                     <p>3. If you call that most excellent which is
best pleasing to God the Law-maker; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the satisfaction of Christ did please him
better, then <hi>Adams</hi> perseverance in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
would have done. This needeth no proof
but the consideration of the event.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="296" facs="tcp:106762:161"/>
4. And for the ends of righteousnesse, let
us consider them distinctly; and see whether
Christs satisfaction do not attain them all
more eminently and fully then <hi>Adams</hi> perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
would have done.</p>
                     <p>1. The glory of Gods justice would not
have been manifested so, if <hi>Adam</hi> had stood,
as it was by Christs sufferings: 2 Nor the
glory of his mercy and free grace. 3 Nor
the Mediatours love: 4 Nor would the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Mediatour have been set up, nor
his honour so advanced. 5. Nor the saints ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to so high a dignity and happinesse, as
now they are and shall be by Christ.</p>
                     <p>So that in what respect is our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
lesse excellent? or who is the looser? Not
the Father; Not the Mediatour: All the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is of our selves: But that is onely in
point of our honour: It is acknowledged,
that to the creature it would have been more
honourable to have kept his innocency, then
to have his disobedience satisfied for by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
But here consider these things, 1
Gods honour is to be preferred to ours. 2
And the Mediatours advancement before our
advancement. 3 It was the very design of
God in the Gospell way of our salvation to
take down our honour, that the creature
might not glory in it self, but all might be
acknowledged to free grace: And shall we
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:106762:161"/>
think it a wrong, if we have not a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as honourable to our selves as that which
we lost? 4 Our happinesse will be greater
though our honour will be lesse: For we shall
have a far greater glory. And that is better
then meer honour. 5 Yea we shall have more
honour then we lost: A reall honour of being
the sons of God, and members of Christ,
and heirs of glory: And this is greater then
the honour of our perseverance would have
been. Onely this being all freely given re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth
to the giver: but still the reall
honour and happinesse we enjoy therefore is
it the everlasting work of Saints, to praise
the Lamb who hath redeemed them out of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l
nations, and made them Kings and Priests
to God; which implyeth an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their former disobedience and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
(and so taking dishonour to themselves)
and yet the greater glory to Christ, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
to them.</p>
                     <p>6. Moreover we have now besides the
righteousnesse of Christs satisfaction a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
evangelicall righteousnesse, consisting in
the fulfilling of the conditions of the law of
grace.</p>
                     <p>So that our little losse of the honour of self-performance
you see is in these 6. respects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
recompensed.</p>
                     <p>So that to our selves a righteousnesse of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:106762:162"/>
tisfaction, is better then a righteousnes of
personall obedience. And as it is found in
Christ, it is also in it self more excellent.</p>
                     <p>Yet further; that it is not derogatory to
Christ, doth thus appear. 1 He had in himself
both sorts of righteousnesse; <hi>viz.</hi> Of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Precept, and of satisfaction to the
threatning. Though both could not be ours,
retaining their forms as such: because the
(law requireth but one sort of righteousnes of
one person for himself: so that we derogate
nothing from Christs righteousnesse or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p>2. Both these sorts in Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
and passive (as I conceive) doe concurre
to make up that one sort of righteousnesse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for us, <hi>viz.</hi> Or satisfaction to the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
and so both conjunct are our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
though not as two sorts of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
but as one. Yet I know that this is
somewhat dark and doubtfull, because Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is a thing commanded and not threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
But yet seeing Christ payed not the
<hi>Idem,</hi> but the <hi>Tantundem;</hi> not the very same
debt mentioned in the threatning, but the
value. I think therefore that his obedience as
such may goe in to his satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>3. I also freely acknowledge, that the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
happinesse which we have by Christ,
more then we lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> contained in our
Adoption, Union with Christ and Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106762:162"/>
are procured by Christs active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
as such, as well as by his satisfaction in
suffering.</p>
                     <p>If yet besides all this, any will maintain
that we fulfilled the precepts of the law in
Christ; or that his fulfilling of them as such, is
our righteousnesse, let them shew me solidly
what neede we have of Christs sufferings, and
let them answer what is said to the contrary by
the formentioned Authors; and I shall quickly
yeeld.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, that God accepteth this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
of satisfaction as being equivalent
to that of obedience (though obedience be
first in the law, and the precept the principall
part) and so that he is as well pleased with us as
if we had obeyed: may appear from the end &amp;
nature of satisfactory punishment. For the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of a perfect just law is supposed to be
such, that it will make a perfect compensation
or satisfaction for all the wrong we have done,
to the law-maker or the publique: so that being
paid or suffered, we must needs in point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
be <hi>in statu quo prius.</hi> I know some object
thus, If a theef be burnt in the hand and so the
law satisfied, yet he hath lost his credit, and will
not be taken or trusted for an honest man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> You must distinguish 1. betwixt
his breach of mans law, and his breach of
Gods law.</p>
                     <p>2. Betwixt his actuall fault, and his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:106762:163"/>
pravity. And then you will see, that his
burning in the hand was for the breach of
mans law; but the perpetuall infamy is a part
of the penalty inflicted by God for the breach
of his law, by the same fact. 2 That his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
was onely for his actuall fault: But our
distrust and contempt of him is also for the
pravity of his heart by that fact discovered, of
which mans Law taketh not notice.</p>
                     <p>But if you instance in the breach of a meer
penall law (as for keeping Artillery, for forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to eat flesh in Lent, &amp;c.) You will see
that the meer suffering or paiment, doth put
the offendour in as good a condition as he
was before.</p>
                     <p>But the Disputant in <hi>Maccovius</hi> thinketh to
strike all dead, with this case. In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 7.
the penalty for them that would not go out
with <hi>Saul</hi> to battell, was, that their oxen
should be hewed in pieces; yet (saith he) they
should besides this have lost their part in the
prey or spoils. To which I answer.</p>
                     <p>1. Then the losse of the spoil was implyed
as part of the penalty. 2 He all along runneth
upon a false supposition; <hi>viz,</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the continuance of the happinesse which
at first was freely given him, should moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by his obedience have merited or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
some further reward: Now (saith he)
this reward must be procured us by Christs
active righteousnesse, though his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:106762:163"/>
put us into the state we fell from.</p>
                     <p>But all this is a meer fiction. For where
doth the scripture talk of <hi>Adams</hi> meriting any
more, or where doth it promise him any more
then the continuance of that happinesse which
he then had?</p>
                     <p>So I have done with the first Question.</p>
                     <p>Your 2. is [whether Christ paid the same
debt which was in the first obligation?] And
here you send me to Mr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I had farre rather you had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
your self. For I cannot well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> minde. in <hi>pag.</hi> 137. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth
betwixt paying the very thing
that is in the obligation; and paying of so
much in another kinde. Now this is not our
question, nor any thing to it; for we affirm that
Christs suffering was of the same kinde of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
(at least in the main;) but yet not
the very same in the obligation.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 140. He states the question far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
(and yet supposeth it the same) <hi>viz,</hi>
whether Christ paid the <hi>Idem,</hi> or the <hi>Tantun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem?</hi>
which he interpreteth thus; <hi>that which is
not the same, nor equivalent to it, but onely in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
acceptance of the Creditour.</hi> Now what he
means by <hi>not equivalent</hi> I cannot tell.</p>
                     <p>1. If he mean <hi>not of equall value,</hi> then he fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with a shadow; he wrongeth <hi>Grotius,</hi> (for
ought I can finde in him (who teacheth no
such doctrine: How-ever, I do not so use to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:106762:164"/>
English <hi>solutio Tantidem.</hi> But if he mean that it is
not equivalent in procuring its ends, <hi>ipso facto,</hi>
delivering the debtour, without the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a new confession or contract of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,
(as <hi>solutio ejusdem</hi> doth,) then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
<hi>Grotius</hi> is against him; and so am I.</p>
                     <p>So also [Gods Gracious acceptance] is
either his accepting lesse in value then was due,
and so remitting the rest without payment:
(this I plead not for,) or els it is his accepting
of a refuseable payment, which though
equall in value yet he may chuse to accept
according to the tenour of the Obligation.
This is gracious acceptance, which <hi>Grotius</hi>
maintaineth? and so doe I; and so distinguish
betwixt <hi>solutio &amp; satisfactio,</hi> payment: and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Yet here Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> entereth the lists with
<hi>Grotius;</hi> And.</p>
                     <p>1. He overlooketh his greatest Arguments.</p>
                     <p>2. He slightly answereth onely two.</p>
                     <p>And 3. when he hath done, he saith as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
doth, and yeeldeth the whole cause.</p>
                     <p>These three things I will make appeare in
order.</p>
                     <p>1. The chiefe Argument of <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
is drawne from the tenor of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and from the event: The Obligation
chargeth punishment on the offendor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
It saith <hi>In the day thou eatest, thou shalt
dye.</hi> And <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:106762:164"/>
all things, &amp;c.</hi> Now if the same in the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be paid then the Law is executed, and
not relaxed; and then every sinner must dye
himself, for that is the <hi>Idem,</hi> and very thing
threatned: So that here, <hi>Dum alius solvit, simul
aliud solvitur.</hi> The Law threatned not Christ,
but us. (Besides, that Christ suffered not the
losse of Gods love, nor his image and graces,
nor eternity of torment, of which I have spoke
in the Treatise.) What saith Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> to any
of this?</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>The two</hi> Arguments he dealeth with, are
these.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>The payment of the very debt, doth ipso facto,
free the debtor</hi> To which he answereth, that
Christs death doct actually or <hi>ipso facto,</hi> free
us. This Answer I shall consider under your
last question whereto it belongeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the second Argument</hi> that the payment of
the same thing in the Obligation, leaveth no roome
for pardon <hi>he answereth thus:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Gods pardoning comprizeth the whole dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of Grace in Christ: As 1. The laying of our
sinne on Christ. 2. The imputation of his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to us; which is no lesse of grace and mercy: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
God pardoneth all to us, but nothing to Christ:
So that the freedome of pardon hath its foundation.</p>
                     <p>1. In Gods will freely appointing this satisfaction
of Christ.</p>
                     <p>2. In a gracious acceptation of that decreed satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in our stead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="304" facs="tcp:106762:165"/>
3. In a free application of the death of Christ to
us, &amp;c. <hi>so farre Mr.</hi> Owen.</p>
                     <p>To which I answer: 1. Pardon implieth
Christs death as a cause; but I would he had
shewed the Scripture, that maketh pardon so
large a thing, as to comprize the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of Grace; or that maketh Christs
death to be part of it, or comprized in it.</p>
                     <p>2. If such a word were in Scripture, will he
not confesse it to be figurative, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and so not fit for this Dispute?</p>
                     <p>3. Else when he saith, that Christs death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
our pardon, he meaneth that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
it self.</p>
                     <p>2. Neither is imputation of Righteousnesse
any part of pardon but a necessary antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
so that here is no part of pardon yet in
all this.</p>
                     <p>3. The same may be said of Gods Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.</p>
                     <p>4. Its Application is a large phrase, and
may be meant of severall acts; but of which
here, I know not.</p>
                     <p>5. How can he call it, <hi>A gracious Acceptation,
a gracious imputation, a free Application,</hi> if it were
the same thing which the Law required that
was paid? To pay all according to the full
exaction of the Obligation, needeth no favour
to procure acceptance, imputation, or applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Can Justice refuse to accept of such a
payment? Or can it require any more?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="305" facs="tcp:106762:165"/>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But it is of grace to us, though not
to Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Doth not that clearely intimate, that
Christ was not in the Obligation? that the
Law doth threaten every man personally; Or
else it had been no favour to accept it from
another.</p>
                     <p>3. That Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> giveth up the cause at
last, and saith as <hi>Grotius</hi> (having it seemeth not
understood <hi>Grotius</hi> his meaning) appeareth p.
141, 142, 143.</p>
                     <p>For 1. he acknowledgeth that the payment is
not made by the party to whom remission is
granted, (and so saith every man that is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.)</p>
                     <p>2. He saith, It was a full valuable compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
(therefore not of the same.)</p>
                     <p>3. That by reason of the Obligation upon
us, we our selves were bound to undergo the
punishment, (therefore Christs punishment
was not in the Obligation, but only ours, &amp; so
the Law was not fully executed, but relaxed.)</p>
                     <p>4. He saith he meaneth not that Christ bore
the same punishment due to us, in all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
of duration and the like; but the same in
weight and pressure, (therefore not the same in
the Obligation, because not fully the same:
Not the same numerically; nor perhaps specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
in all respects, if the losse of Gods Love
and Image, and incurring his hatred, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the body, the losse of right to, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:106762:166"/>
use of all the creatures and the losse of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
corporall or spirituall, &amp;c. were any part
of the curse.) yet that it was in the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
of the same kinde, I doubt not.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>He saith,</hi> God had power so farre to relax
his owne Law, as to have the name of a surety put
into the Obligation, which before was not there;
and then to require the whole debt of that surety.</p>
                     <p>And what saith <hi>Grotius</hi> more then this? If
the same thing in the Obligation be paid, then
the Law is executed; and if executed (properly
and fully) then not relaxed. Here he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that the sureties name was not in the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
and that God relaxed the Law to put
it in. Now the maine businesse that <hi>Grotius</hi>
there drives at, is but to prove this relaxation
of the Law, and the non-execution of it on the
offenders threatned.</p>
                     <p>I Iudge that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath no better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in his next assault of <hi>Grotius,</hi> on that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
[whether God manage this work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing
the Law, punishing Christ for us, &amp;c.
as a Creditor, or as an absolute Master, or as
a Judge under Lawes, or as the supreme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor?
the last of which <hi>Grotius</hi> maintaineth? He
that readeth <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Vossius</hi> own words,
doth need no further defensative against the
force of Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Answers.</p>
                     <p>But this is nothing to me.</p>
                     <p>Onely I would not have any truth to fare
the worse for <hi>Grotius</hi> his defection. It was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:106762:166"/>
that deserved the discredit, and not the
Truth of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third and last contradicted Article is,</hi>
That no man is actually and absolutely justified upon
the meer payment of the debt by Christ, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Beleevers.</p>
                     <p>Against this, you send me to both the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Authors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. When I first cast my eye upon the
two fore-cited Disputations in <hi>Maccowski,</hi> I
had thought he had spoke onely of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
conditionall Justification of men, when
he saith, <hi>that active Iustification was at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the first promise;</hi> But my charitable
thoughts I soon saw were mistaken.</p>
                     <p>But I find, as his Doctrine is very strange,
so are his proofs as slender, as any mans you
could have sent me to.</p>
                     <p>1. Is it not strange that Active justification
should be perfected 5000. yeares before Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
justification is in being? I thought Passive
justification had been the mediate effect of the
Active; And that God had justified no man,
who is not thereby justified.</p>
                     <p>2. And as strange and abhorred to me, is the
other part of his doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That Faith
onely taketh knowledge of justification for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
wrought.</p>
                     <p>And his Arguments are as weak as the
doctrine erroneous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:106762:167"/>
1. <hi>The first is</hi> Because the Object must needs go
before the Act.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> But is it not pity that so excellent a
Doctor should think that justification (&amp; that
not only in offer, but in actuall being) should
be the object of justifying Faith? I am asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to confute so sencelesse an assertion. Sure
it is Christ, and not actuall justification that
is the object. When the Scripture saith, that
<hi>Whosoever beleeveth shall be justified</hi> is it a learned
Exposition which thus interpreteth it? [You
that are elect, are already justified, and if you
will beleeve it, you shall know it;]</p>
                     <p>2. He citeth <hi>Paraeus,</hi> saying, that Faith doth
not effect justification, but accept it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They that say, Faith is the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
cause of justification, must needs say,
that Faith effectth it.</p>
                     <p>2. Faith accepteth Christ for justification.</p>
                     <p>3. It accepteth not justification as being
actually and absolutely our owne before the
acceptance: But it accepteth a conditionall
justification offered to me, that by the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it may become absolutely mine.</p>
                     <p>His citing of <hi>Tossanus</hi> words is nothing for
him: For when hee saith, that <hi>All the Elect are
justified in Christ, in respect of the merit thereof</hi> it is
no more then to say that <hi>Christ hath merited their
justification:</hi> which who denyeth?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the great Argument which he and all of
his judgement do trust to, is this:</hi> If the surety
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:106762:167"/>
so undertake or discharge the debt, that the creditor
rest satisfied with that undertaking or discharge;
then is the debtor free from the debt. But Christ hath
so undertaken and discharged the particular debts of
the Elect; therefore the Elect are freed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Payment is refusable, or not refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable:
That payment which is of the same
thing in the Obligation, either by our selves
or our Delegate, is not by the Creditor refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable;
so that if we had paid it, or Christ had
been our Delegate, appointed by us to pay
the same that was due, then God could not
have refused to take that payment: But Christ
being appointed to this by the Father, and not
by us; and also paying not the very same, but
the value, God might have refused the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>2. Where the payment is not refusable,
there the discharge of the debtor is not refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
but doth follow <hi>ipse facto:</hi> But where
the payment is refusable, (as here it was) the
Creditor may accept it upon what termes he
pleases, and chuse to give the Debtor an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
discharge; so that it being the full agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and pleasure both of the Creditor and
the Surety, the father and the sonne, that the
Debtor should have no discharge by the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but upon a certaine condition by him to
be performed, no doubt he shall have none
till he have performed it.</p>
                     <p>3. So that Gods accepting the payment

and being satisfied with it, may be understood.</p>
                     <p>1. In respect to the Surety, and the value
of his payment; and so God was well pleased
and fully satisfied in Christs payment, as
bein the full value that his justice did require,
and beyond which he expected no more at his
hands.</p>
                     <p>2. Or it may be spoken in reference to the
debtor, the sinner, and the effecting of his
freedome: And so God was not immediately
upon Christs payment, so satisfied or well
pleased with the particular offenders, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
and discharge them without requiring
any thing at their hands.</p>
                     <p>1. For he will first have them perform the
imposed condition of taking Christ who hath
bought them, for their only Saviour, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and Lord.</p>
                     <p>To these of <hi>Maccovius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> in the place
(against <hi>Grotius</hi>) which you referre me to, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
some more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As</hi> 1. By death he deliver us from death:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Not immediately nor absolutely,
nor by his Death alone; but by that as the
price, supposing other causes on his part, and
conditions on ours to concurre before the
actuall deliverance.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>He saith</hi> The Elect are said to dye and rise
with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Not in respect of time, as if we dyed &amp;
rose at the same time, either really or in Gods
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:106762:168"/>
esteem: Nor that we dyed in his dying, &amp; rose
in his rising. But it is spoken of the distant
mediate effects of his death, &amp; the immediate
effects of his Spirit on us, rising by regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to union and Communion with Christ.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>He saith,</hi> Christ hath redeemed us from the
curse, being made a curse for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I explained before how farre we are
freed by Redemption; He hath redeemed us,
that is, paid the price; but with no intent that
we should by that Redemption be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or absolutely freed.</p>
                     <p>Yet when we are freed, it is to be ascribed to
his death as the meritorious cause; but not as
the onely cause.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>He saith</hi> The hand-writing that was against
us, even the whole obligation is taken out of the way
and nailed to his Crosse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. By the hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
is especially meant the Law of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</p>
                     <p>2. If it be meant also of the curse
of the Old Covenant, then it cannot be
so understood, as if the Covenant it self were
abrogate for the reasons I have before given
in the Treatise.</p>
                     <p>3. Nor yet that any are absolutely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
from the curse, till they perform the
condition required for their discharge.</p>
                     <p>4. But thus farre the Law is taken down,
that our Redeemer hath bought us from that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:106762:169"/>
necessity of perishing that lay upon us for our
transgressing that Law; so that no man is now
condemned for the meer violation of that first
Covenant; and so he hath taken the Law into
his owne hands, to charge only upon those
that break the conditions of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>5. And so he hath taken downe the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
power of the Law as it standeth by it
selfe, and not as it is under the Covenant of
grace: And hee hath freed us from the curse
conditionally, and the condition is easie and
reasonable.</p>
                     <p>6. So that <hi>quoad meritum,</hi> the work is done.
All the satisfaction is made, and price paid;
and therefore in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. it is said to be done.
If a man where a 1000 l. in debt, and had tryed
all meanes, and had no hope left to procure
his discharge: And if a stranger to him goe to
the Creditor, and buy the Debtor who is in
prison into his owne hands, by paying all the
debt, yet resolving, that if he refuse his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
hee shall have no benefit by it, but lye
and rot there; May it not be fitly said, that
the debtor is delivered? because the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
which hindered, is removed; and the
condition of his freedome is so reasonable,
that common reason supposeth he will not
stick at it; and if he doe, it is utterly against
reason and humanity, for hee may be freed if
he will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:106762:169"/>
Therefore it is no unfit phrase, to say the
man is freed as soon as his debt is payed: But
yet he is not absolutely freed, nor actually
neither in point of personall right, nor of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.
And for his humane refusall of the
kindnesse of his Redeemer, may lye and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
there, and be never the better, but the
worse for all this.</p>
                     <p>7. Yet it being the absolute purpose both
of the Father and Mediator, to cause all the
Elect to perform this condition of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scharge;
therefore Redemption is a cause of
their certaine future discharge, and a linke
in the inviolable chaine of the causes of their
salvation: But to the rest of the world it is
not so.</p>
                     <p>But I doe not well understand the meaning
of the Author you referre me to: For he
saith, [That Christ did actually and <hi>ipso facto,</hi>
deliver us from the curse and obligation; yet
we do not instantly apprehend and perceive
it, nor yet possesse it; but only we have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
right to all the fruits of his death: As a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
in a farre Countrey who is ransomed,
but knoweth it not, nor can enjoy liberty till
a Warrant be produced, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But 1. Whether a man may fitly be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
and <hi>ipso facto,</hi> to be delivered and
discharged, who is not at all delivered, but
onely hath right to deliverance, I doubt.</p>
                     <p>2. Knowledge and posiession of a deliverance
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:106762:170"/>
are farre different things: A man may
have possession and no knowledge in some
cases; or if he have both, yet the procuring of
knowledge is a small matter, in comparison of
possession.</p>
                     <p>3. Our knowledge therefore doth not give
us possession; so that the similitude failes, for
it is the Creditors knowledge and satisfaction
that is requisite to deliverance. And our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour
was not in a farre and strange countrey,
but knew immediately, and could either have
made us quickly know, or turned us free be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we had knowne the cause.</p>
                     <p>4. Nor can it easily be understood, how
God can so long deny us the possession of
Heaven, if wee had such absolute actuall Right
(as he speaketh) so long ago; which seemeth
to expresse a <hi>jus ad rem &amp; in re.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be said, wee are yet in our minority,
and not fit for present possession.</p>
                     <p>I answer, That this fitnesse and our matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is part of the deliverance, or benefit (which
he saith, <hi>de facto,</hi> we had right to:) And so we
should have had that also in present possession.</p>
                     <p>4. But if he doe meane onely a right to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
possession (for such there is,) yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
it is beyond my conceiving, how in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the relative part of our deliverance,
that right and the possession should stand at so
many yeeres distance. To have right to Gods
favour and acceptance, and to have possession
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:106762:170"/>
of that favour; to have right to the remission
of sinne, and adoption, &amp; to have possession of
these, do seeme to me to be of neerer kin.
Except he should think that possession of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
is nothing but the knowledge or feeling
of it; and that possession of pardon is the like;
&amp; that Faith justifieth us but <hi>in foro conscientiae:</hi>
But I will not censure so hardly till I know it.</p>
                     <p>Indeed there is a justification by publike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
at the great judgement, which much
differeth from a meer Right. But our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by faith here is but a justifying in the
sence of the Law, or giving us right to that
full justification: So that <hi>To have right to it,</hi> and
<hi>to have possession of it in point of Law or Right;</hi> is
to me all one: For what doth Faith give us pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of in its justifying Act, but this legall
right?</p>
                     <p>5. And indeed, it seemeth to me a full defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of all pardon and justification which is
here to bee expected, which he layeth downe;
Hee saith, <hi>Christ did deliver us from the curse,
and take away the Obligation which was against
us ipso facto.</hi> And I think to be justified, is but to
be freed from the curse or condemnation; and
to be pardoned, is nothing else but to be freed
from the obligation to punishment. And is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and justification the immediate effect
of Christs death?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:106762:171"/>
What ever this Writer thinketh in this, is
nothing to us: But because I would not have
you so palpably and dangerously erre, let mee
say a little more against this mistake. You
may remember I have oft told you, of how
great moment it is in Divinity, to be able
soundly to distinguish betwixt immediate &amp;
Mediate Effects of Christs Death. (I think <hi>Tho.
Moore</hi> meant the Immediate and Mediate
Effects, which he calleth <hi>Ends</hi> which hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a great many pages about the Ends of
Christs Death, to be written by his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
to little purpose.) Now I would have you
know, that this actuall Remission and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
are no Immediate, but Mediate effects
of Christs Death; no, nor a personall right
thereto if there be any such thing distinct
from actuall freedome.</p>
                     <p>And to this end I pray you weigh these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                     <p>1. What Right soever God giveth to men
to things supernaturall such as justification,
remission, adoption) he giveth by his written
Lawes. But by these Lawes hee hath given no
such thing to any Beleever, (such as are the
Elect before conversion, (therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The major is evident: Gods Decree giveth
no man a personall right to the mercy inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him. And for the minor, no man can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any Scripture giving to unbeleevers such
a right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="317" facs="tcp:106762:171"/>
2. If God hate all the workers of iniquity,
and we are all by nature the children of wrath,
and without faith it is impossible to please
God, and he that beleeveth not is condemned
already; then certainly the Elect while they
are unbeleevers are not actually, <hi>de facto,</hi> no
nor in personall Right, delivered from this
hatred, wrath, displeasure and condemnation.
But the major is the very words of Scripture;
therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>3. If we are justified onely by Faith, then
certainly not before Faith: But we are justified
onely by Faith; therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I doe in charity suppose that you will not
answer so groslely, as to say, we are justified <hi>in
foro Dei,</hi> before Faith, and onely <hi>in foro consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae,</hi>
by Faith, till you can finde one word in
Scripture which saith, that an unbeleever is
justified, If I thought you were of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I should think it an easie task to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
its falshood.</p>
                     <p>And if you say that we are justified in Gods
Decree before Faith:</p>
                     <p>I answer, 1. It is no justification; shew me
the Scripture that calleth it so.</p>
                     <p>2. Nay, it clearely, implyeth the contrary.
For Decreeing is a term of Diminution, as to
justifying. He that saith he is purposed to free
you from prison, &amp;c. implyeth that as yet it is
not done. To be justified or saved in Decree,
is no more but that God decreeth to justifie
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:106762:172"/>
and save us; and therefore sure it is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
                     <p>4. If we are exhorted while we are unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
to be reconciled to God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
for remissions of sins; then sure we are
not yet reconciled nor remitted; But
the former is evident in Scripture; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>5. No man dare affirm, that we are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
upon Christs death, delivered actually,
and <hi>ipso facto,</hi> from the power or presence of
sin, nor from afflictions and death, which are
the fruits of it; nor yet that we are freed from
the distance and separation from God which
sin procured. And why then should we think
that we were immediately delivered from the
guilt and condemnation?</p>
                     <p>I know the common answer is, that justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is an immanent act, and therefore from
eternity; but Sanctification is a transient act.
But I have disproved this in the Treatise,
and cleared to you, that justification is also a
transient Act: Otherwise <hi>Socinianisme</hi> were the
soundest doctrine, that Christ never needed
to satisfie, if we were justified from eternity.
Yet (to confesse the truth) I was long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with this Argument my self, taking it
upon trust from Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi>
(whom I valued above most other men; and
so continued of that same judgement with
these Authors you alledge, and remained long
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:106762:172"/>
in the borders of <hi>Antinomianisme,</hi> which I very
narrowly escaped: And it grieveth me to see
many of our Divines to fight against Jesuites
and <hi>Arminians</hi> with the <hi>Antinomian</hi> weapons, as
if our cause afforded no better; and so they
run into the far worse extream.</p>
                     <p>I undertake to manifest to you, that this
Doctrine of Christs immediate Actuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
us from guilt, wrath, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,]
is the very pillar and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole frame and fabrick of <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianisme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But these things which you draw out of me
here unseasonably; I am handling in a
fitter place, (in a small Tract of <hi>Vniversall
Redemption:</hi>) But the last week I have received
<hi>Amiraldus</hi> against <hi>Spanhemius</hi> exercitations,
who hath opened my very heart, almost in
my own words; and hath so fully said the very
same things which I intended, for the greater
part, that I am now unresolved whether to hold
my hand, or to proceed.</p>
                     <p>The Lord give you to search after the truth
in love, with a humble, unbyassed, submissive
soul; neither losing it through negligence and
undervaluing, nor yet diverted from it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
controversies, nor preverted by self-confidence,
nor forestalled by prejudice, nor
blinded by passion, nor lost in contentions, nor
subverted by the now-ruling spirit of gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
and levity, nor yet obscured by the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:106762:173"/>
confounding of things that differ; that so by
the conduct of the Word and Spirit, you may
attaine the sight of amiable naked truth, and
your understanding may be enlightned, and
your soul beautified by the reflexion and
participation of her light and beauty, that
your heart being ravished with the sense of her
goodnesse, and awed by her Authority, you
may live here in the constant embracements
of her, and cordiall obedience to her, till you
are taken up to the prime eternall Truth and
Goodnesse.</p>
