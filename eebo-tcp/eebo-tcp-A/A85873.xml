            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Received a Paper from you, ſeeming to authorize you to carry my perſon before the
Lords, to anſwer to a Charge: I am conſtrained to inform you hereby, that my perſon
ought not to be hurried to and fro, or diſturbed, at the pleaſure of any man, neither can
I yeeld obedience to the commands of any, which are not Legal; and therefore in caſe
you intend to diſturb me on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> next, I expect to ſee a legal Warrant from ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Court, which have a Juriſdiction over me in caſe of a real or ſuppoſed Crime: And I
muſt acquaint you, that the Lords have no legal power to ſummon me to anſwer to any crime
whereof I am accuſed or ſuſpected; and therefore you muſt expect to anſwer for whatſoever
injury you offer to my perſon, and know hereby, that I ſhall not voluntarily go from hence to
<hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> by vertue of the paper received, but ſhall ſuffer you to carry me, if you ſhall ſend

            <p>FRiend, I deſire thee to conſider that this Gentleman is now entring the Liſts, to combate
for thy Native Liberties, and if he ſuffer in this encounter, not only he, but thou, and
every individual Engliſhman, eſpecially the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> are, and ſhall be, by the ſame
rule, deſtroyed, (contrary to Law), by the Arbitrary Decrees of ambitious men in power; for
if the Law cannot protect one, it cannot protect another; and if you ſuffer the Law to be
deſtroyed, <hi>luſt</hi> will become a <hi>lawgiver;</hi> and the dictates of the depraved wills of men in
power ſhall be forced as a rule for you to obſerve, and then you will neither know certainty,
nor ſafety: Sir <hi>John</hi> claims nothing but a Legal Tryal, by a Jury of his equals in the Ordinary
Courts of Juſtice, which (being a Commoner) he may juſtly challenge (by vertue of the
Great Charter, and thirty five other Statutes) as his birth-right; but contrary to Law or Equity
the Lords do aſſume to themſelves a power over him a Commoner, and do intend to try him
in a criminal caſe in their Houſe with their doors ſhut, where he ſhall neither have Judge or
Jury, but themſelves, and they are both Accuſers and Judges; and in order thereunto have
commanded the Lieutenant of the Tower to carry him before them on Wedneſday, being the
nineteenth of <hi>April</hi> inſtant: Therefore if thou haſt any love to Freedom, and wouldſt not,
by thy ſilence, become acceſſary to the deſtruction of that Law, which will, if defended and
preſerved, protect thee, on the like occaſion, from the malice of ambitious men, find out ſome
ſpeedy way, not only to encourage this Gentleman by thy appearance for him in this his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

ſubverſion of all Law, and deſtruction of the Liberty and Property of every individual
Engliſhman.</p>
