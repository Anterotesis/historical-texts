            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO MY MOST HONOUR'D FRIEND Sir <hi>CHARLES SEDLEY,</hi> Baronet.</head>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Design of <hi>Dedicating Playes,</hi> is as common and unjust, as that of desiring Seconds in a <hi>Duel.</hi> 'Tis engaging our Friends (it may be) in a senceless quarrel, where they have much to venture, without any concernment of their own. I have declar'd thus much before-hand, to prevent you from suspicion, that I intend to interest either your judgment or your kindness, in defending the Errours of this <hi>Comedy.</hi> It succeeded ill in the representation, against the opinion of many the best Judges of our Age, to whom you know I read it e're it was presented pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly. Whether the fault was in the Play it self, or in the lameness of the Action, or in the number of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who came resolv'd to damn it for the Title, I
<pb facs="tcp:48731:3"/>
will not now dispute: that wou'd be too like the little satisfaction which an unlucky Gamester finds in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of every cast by which he came to lose his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. I have had formerly so much success, that the miscarriage of this Play was onely my giving fortune her revenge: I ow'd it her; and she was indulgent that she exacted not the paiment long before. I will therefore deal more reasonably with you, than any Poet has ever done with any Patron: I do not so much as oblige you for my sake to pass two ill houres in reading of my Play. Think, if you please, that this Dedication is onely an occasion I have taken to do my self the greatest honour imaginable with Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that is, to be recorded in the number of those Men whom you have favour'd with your Friendship and esteem. For, I am well assur'd, that besides the present satisfaction I have, it will gain me the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of my reputation with after-Ages, when they shall find me valuing my self on your kindness to me: I may have reason to suspect my own credit with them, but I have none to doubt of yours. And they who perhaps wou'd forget me in my Poems, wou'd remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me in this <hi>Epistle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the course which has formerly been practis'd by the Poets of that Nation who were Masters of the Universe. <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Ovid,</hi> who had little reason to distrust their Immortality; yet took occasion to speak with honour of <hi>Virgil, Varius, Tibullus,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertius</hi> their Contemporaries: as if they sought in the
<pb facs="tcp:48731:3"/>
testimony of their Friendship a farther evidence of their fame. For my own part, I, who am the least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Poets, have yet the fortune to be honour'd with the best Patron, and the best Friend. For, (to omit some Great Persons of our Court, to whom I am many wayes oblig'd, and who have taken care of me, even amidst the Exigencies of a War,) I can make my boast to have found a better <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenas</hi> in the person of my Lord Treasurer <hi>Clifford,</hi> and a more Elegant <hi>Tibullus</hi> in that of Sir <hi>Charles Sedley.</hi> I have chosen that Poet to whom I would resemble you, not onely because I think him at least equal, if not superiour to <hi>Ovid</hi> in his <hi>Elegies</hi>: nor because of his quality for he was (you know) a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight as well as <hi>Ovid</hi>: but for his Candour, his Wealth, his way of Living, and particularly because of this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony which is given him by <hi>Horace,</hi> which I have a thousand times in my mind apply'd to you.

Certainly the Poets of that Age enjoy'd much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in the Conversation and Friendship of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They imitated the best way of Living, which was to pursue an innocent and inoffensive Pleasure; that which one of the Ancients called <hi>Eruditam volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48731:4"/>
We have, like them, our Genial Nights; where our discourse is neither too serious, nor too light; but alwayes pleasant, and for the most part instructive: the raillery neither too sharp upon the present, nor too censorious on the absent; and the Cups onely such as will raise the Conversation of the Night, without disturbing the business of the Morrow. And thus far not only the Philosophers, but the Fathers of the Church have gone, without lessening their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of good Manners, or of Piety. For this reason I have often Laugh'd at the ignorant and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Descriptions which some Pedants have given of the Wits (as they are pleas'd to call them:) which are a Generation of Men as unknown to them, as the People of <hi>Tartary</hi> or the <hi>terra Australis</hi> are to us. And therefore as we draw <hi>Giants</hi> and <hi>Anthropophagi</hi> in those vacances of our <hi>Maps,</hi> where we have not Travell'd to discover better; so those wretches Paint leudness, Atheism, Folly, ill-Reasoning, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Extravagances amongst us for want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what we are. Oftentimes it so falls out, that they have a particular picque to some one amongst us; and then they immediately interest Heaven in their quarrel: As 'tis an usual trick in Courts; when one designs the ruine of his Enemy, to disguise his malice with some concernment of the Kings: and to revenge his own cause, with pretence of vindicating the Honour of his Master. Such Wits as they describe, I have never been so unfortunate to meet in your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
<pb facs="tcp:48731:4"/>
but have often heard much better Reasoning at your Table, than I have encounter'd in their Books. The Wits they describe, are the Fops we banish: for Blasphemy and Atheism, if they were neither Sin nor Ill Manners, are Subjects so very common, and worn so Thredbare, that people who have sence avoid them, for fear of being suspected to have none. It calls the good Name of their Wit in question, as it does the Credit of a Citizen when his Shop is fill'd with Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, and Painted Titles in stead of Wares: we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them Bancrupt to all manner of understanding: and, that to use Blasphemy, is a kind of applying Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Soles of the Feet: it proclaims their Fancy as well as judgment, to be in a desperate condition. I am sure for your own particular, if any of these Judges had once the happiness to converse with you, to hear the Candour of your Opinions; how freely you commend that wit in others, of which you have so large a Portion your self; how unapt you are to be censorious; with how much easiness you speak so many things, and those so Pointed, that no other Man is able to excell, or perhaps to reach by Study; they wou'd, in stead of your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, become your Proselites. They wou'd reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence so much good Sence, and so much good Nature in the same person: and come, like the Satyre, to warm themselves at that Fire, of which they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly afraid, when they stood at distance. But, you have too great a Reputation to be wholly free from Censure: 'tis a fine which Fortune sets upon all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb facs="tcp:48731:5"/>
persons, and from which you should not wish to be deliver'd till you are dead. I have been, us'd by my Critiques much more severely, and have more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to complain, because I am deeper tax'd for a less Estate. I am ridiculously enough accus'd to be a contemner of Universities, that is in other words, an Enemy of Learning: without the Foundation of which I am sure no Man can pretend to be a Poet. And if this be not enough, I am made a Detractor from my Predecessors, whom I confess to have been my Masters in the Art. But this latter was the accusation of the best Judge, and almost the best Poet in the Latine Tongue. You find <hi>Horace</hi> complaining, that for taxing some Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in <hi>Lucilius,</hi> he himself was blam'd by others, though his Design was no other than mine now, to improve the Knowledge of Poetry: and it was no defence to him, amongst his Enemies, any more than it is for me, that he Prais'd <hi>Lucilius</hi> where he deserv'd it; <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginÃ¢ laudatur eÃ¢dem.</hi> 'Tis for this reason I will be no more mistaken for my good meaning: I know I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Ben Iohnson</hi> more than my little Critiques, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause without vanity I may own, I understand him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As for the Errors they pretend to find in me, I could easily show them that the greatest part of them are Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and for the rest, I could recriminate upon the best Poets of our Nation, if I could resolve to accuse another of little faults, whom at the same time I admire for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Excellencies. But I have neither concernment enough upon me to write any thing in my own Defence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:48731:5"/>
will I gratifie the ambition of two wretched Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who desire nothing more than to be Answer'd. I have not wanted Friends, even amongst Strangers, who have defended me more strongly, than my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Pedant cou'd attacque me. For the other: he is onely like <hi>Fungoso</hi> in the Play, who follows the Fashion at a distance, and adores the <hi>Fastidius Brisk</hi> of <hi>Oxford.</hi> You can bear me witness, that I have not consideration enough for either of them to be angry: Let <hi>Maevius</hi> and <hi>Bavius</hi> admire each other, I wish to be hated by them and their Fellows, by the same reason for which I desire to be lov'd by you. And I leave it to the world, whether their judgment of my Poetry ought to be preferr'd to yours; though they are as much prejudic'd by their Malice, as I desire you should be led by your Kindness, to be partial to, Sir,</p>

            <l>You damn the <hi>Poet,</hi> but the <hi>Priest</hi> damns you.</l>
            <l>But Priests can treat you at your own expence:</l>
            <l>And, gravely, call you Fooles, without offence.</l>
            <l>Poets, poor Devils, have ne'r your Folly shown</l>
            <l>But, to their cost, you prov'd it was their own.</l>
            <l>For, when a Fop's presented on the Stage,</l>
            <l>Straight all the Coxcombs in the Town ingage:</l>
            <l>For his deliverance, and revenge they joyn:</l>
            <l>And grunt, like Hogs, about their Captive Swine.</l>
            <l>Your Poets daily split upon this shelfe:</l>
            <l>You must have Fooles, yet none will have himself.</l>
            <l>Or, if in kindness, you that leave would give,</l>
            <l>No man could write you at that rate you live:</l>
            <l>For some of you grow Fops with so much haste,</l>
            <l>Riot in nonsence, and commit such waste,</l>
            <l>'Twould Ruine Poets should they spend so fast.</l>

            <l>But, Gentlemen, you overdo the Mode:</l>

            <l>This thought had made our Author more uneasie,</l>

SAve you, sweet Signior <hi>Benito</hi>; by my faith I am glad to see you look so bonily to day: Gad, Sir, every thing becomes you to a miracle! your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruke, your Cloaths, your Hat, your Shoo-tyes; and, Gad, Sir, let me tell you, you become every thing; you walk with such a grace, and you bow so pliantlyâ€”</p>

               <p>Sirrah! That my damn'd Master should call a man of my extraordinary indowments, Sirrah! A man of my indowments? Gad, I ask my own pardon, I mean, a person of my indowments; for a man of my parts and tallents, though he be but a <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> is a person; and, let me tell my Master â€” Gad, I frown too, as like a person as any Jack-Gentleman of'em all; but, Gad, when I do not frown, I am an absolute beauty: whatever this Class sayes to the contrary: and, if this

               <p>I come, Sir. What the Devil would he have? But, by his favour, I'll first survey my Dancing, and my Singing.
<stage>He playes on the Guittar, and Dances and Sings to the Glass.</stage>
I think that was not amiss: I think so. Gad, I can
<stage>Layes down the Guittar.</stage>
Dance, and play no longer, I am in such a rapture with my self. What a villanous base fate have I? with all these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and a profound wit, and yet to be a Serving-man!</p>

               <speaker>Aur.</speaker>
               <p>Why, you Slave, you Dog, you Son of twenty Fathers, am I to be serv'd at this rate eternally? A pox o'your conceited coxcomb.</p>

               <p>You do not know this Rogue, as I do, <hi>Camillo.</hi> Now, by this Guittar, and that great looking-glass, I am certain how he has spent his time. He courts himself every morning in that Glass, at least an hour: there admires his own person, and his parts, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies postures and grimaces, to make himself yet more ridiculous, than he was born to be.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Aur.</speaker>
               <p>I do; for he is yet more fool than I can speak him: I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sent him on a message, but he runs first to that Glass, to practice how he may become his errand. Speak, Is this a lye, Sirrah?</p>

               <speaker>Ben.</speaker>
               <p>I confess, I have some kindness for the mirrour.</p>

               <speaker>Aur.</speaker>
               <p>The mirrour! there's a touch of his Poetry too, he could not call it a Glass. Then the Rogue has the impudence to make Sonnets, as he calls 'em; and, which is a greater impudence, he sings 'em too: there's not a Street in all <hi>Rome</hi> which he does not nightly disquiet with his villanous Serenades: with that Guittar there, the younger brother of a Cittern, he frights away the Watch; and for his Violin, it squeaks so lewdly, that Sir <hi>Tibert</hi> in the gutter mistakes him for his Mistriss. 'Tis a meer Cat-call.</p>

My Master, Sir, may say his pleasure; I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert my self sometimes with hearing him: Alass, good Gentleman, 'tis not given to all persons to penetrate into Mens parts and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but I look on you, Sir, as a man of judgment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you shall hear me play and sing.</p>

               <p>This Lady <hi>Laura</hi> I have seen from your Balcone, and was seen by her: methought, too, she lookt with a languishing eye upon me, as who should say, Are you a man, and have no pitty for a poor distressed Virgin? For my part, I never found so much disposition in my self to Love any woman at first sight: handsome she is, of that I am certain.</p>

               <p>Her hour is not come yet; she has not met with a man to Love: when that happens (as I am resolv'd to push my fortune) you shall see that, as her love warms, her vertue will melt down, and dissolve in it; for there's no such Baud to a woman, as her own wit is.</p>

               <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
               <p>They are the same. Do you think it a reasonable thing, dear <hi>Laura,</hi> that my Uncle should keep us up so strictly, that we must be beholden to heresay, to know a young Gallant is in the next house to us?</p>

               <p>'Tis concluded then; you shall meet your Servant, but I'll be your <hi>Beatrix:</hi> I'll go in stead of her, and counterfeit your waiting-woman: in the dark I may easily pass for her: By this means I shall be present to instruct you; for you are yet a Callow Maid: I must teach you to Peck a little, you may come to Prey for your self in time.</p>

For what Crime, fair Creature, were you condemn'd to this perpetual Prison?</p>

                  <p>For Chastity and Devotion, and two or three such melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly vertues: they first brought me hither, and now must keep me company.</p>

                  <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                  <p>I should rather have guess'd it had been Murder, and that you are veil'd, for fear of doing more mischief wirh those Eyes: for, indeed, they are too sharp to be trusted out of the Scabbard.</p>

Madam, I am glad I know my enemy; for since it is impossible to see, and not admire you, the name of <hi>Lucretia</hi> is the best excuse for my defeat.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>Persons, like Prince <hi>Frederick,</hi> ought not to assault Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houses; or to pursue Chastity and Virtue to their last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                  <p>A Monastery is no retreat for Chastity; 'tis only a hiding place for bad faces, where they are thrust in Crowds together, like heaps of rubbish out of the way, that the world may not be peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with deform'd persons, and that such who are out of Play them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, may pray for a blessing on their endeavours, who are getting handsome Children: and carrying on the work for publick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>

                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you would put off Heaven with your leavings, and use it like them who play at Cards alone, take the Courts for your selves, and give the refuse to the Gentleman.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                  <p>You mistake me, Madam; I would so contrive it, that Heaven and we might be serv'd at once: we have occasion for Wit and Beauty; now Piety and Ugliness will do as well for Heaven; that playes at one Game, and we at another, and therefore heaven may make its hand with the same Cards that we put out.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>I could easily convince you if the argument concern'd me; but I am one of those, whom, for want of wit and beauty, you have condemn'd to Religion: and therefore am your humble Servant to Pray for your handsome Wife and Children.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                  <p>Heaven forbid, Madam, that I should condemn you, or indeed any handsome woman, to be Religious. No, Madam; the occasions of the World are great and urgent for such as you: and, for my part, I am of opinion, that it is as great a Sin for a Beauty to enter into a Nunnery, as for an ugly woman to stay out of it.</p>

                  <p>But remember one article of our friendship, that though we banish Love, we do not Mirth, nor Gallantry; for I declare, I am for all extravagancies, but just loving.</p>

                  <p>O my dear Sister, never refuse it: I keep the Keyes you know, I'll warrant you well' return before we are miss'd. I do so long to have one fling into the sweet World again before I die. Hang't, at worst, 'tis but one sin more, and then we'll repent for all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <speaker>Aur.</speaker>
                  <p>I could Love Deformity it self, with that good humour. She who is arm'd with Gayety and Wit, needs no other Weapon to conquer me.</p>

                  <p>We Lovers are the great Creators of wit in our Mistrisses. For <hi>Beatrix,</hi> she a meer utterer of Yes and No, and has no more

Sence than what will just dignifie her to be an arrant waiting-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: that is, to lye for her Lady, and take your Money.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Aur.</speaker>
                  <p>It may be then I found her in the exaltation of her wit; for, certainly, women have their good and ill dayes of talking, as they have of looking.</p>

                  <p>But, however, she has done you the courtisy to drive out <hi>Laura:</hi> and so one Poyson has expell'd the other.</p>

                  <speaker>Aur.</speaker>
                  <p>Troth, not absolutely neither; for I dote on <hi>Laura</hi>'s beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and on <hi>Beatrix</hi>'s wit: I am wounded with a forked Arrow, which will not easily be got out.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cam.</speaker>
                  <p>Not to lose time in fruitless complaints, let us pursue our new contrivance, that you may see your two Mistresses, and I my one.</p>

                  <p>That will not now be difficult: this plot's so laid, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Devil to make it miss. The Woman of the house, by which they are to pass to Church, is brib'd; the Ladies are, by her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the design; and we need only to be there before them, and expect the prey, which will undoubtedly fall into the net.</p>

                  <speaker>Aur.</speaker>
                  <p>He has dispos'd of himself, I thank him, for an hour or two: the Fop would make me believe that an unknown Lady is in love with him, and has made him an Assignation.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cam.</speaker>
                  <p>If he should succeed now, I should have the worse opinion of the Sex for his sake.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Aur.</speaker>
                  <p>Never doubt but he'll succeed: your brisk Fool that can make a Leg, is ever a fine Gentleman among the Ladies, because he's just of their tallent, and they understand him better than a Wit.</p>

Madam, the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> whom you must needs imagine to be in this company, has sent me to you, to know what kind of face there is belonging to that excellent shape, and to those charming motions which he observ'd so lately in your Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>Tell his Highness, if you please, that there is a Face within the Masque, so very deform'd, that if it were discover'd, it would prove the worst Vizor of the two; and that, of all Men, he ought not to desire it should be expos'd, because then something would be found amiss in an entertainment which he has made so splendid and magnificent.</p>

                  <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
                  <p>The Duke I am sure would be very proud of your comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it would leave him more unsatisfy'd than before, for he will find in it so much of Gallantry, as, being added to your other graces, will move him to a strange temptation of knowing you.</p>

                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>I should still have the more reason to refuse him; for 'twere a madness, when I had charm'd him by my motion and converse, to hazard the loss of that conquest by my eyes.</p>

My Ladies Woman, methinks you are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd to night: pray advance into the Lists; though I have seen your countenance by day, I can endure to hear you talk by night.

                  <p>This generosity of the Abbess is never to be forgot; and it is the more to be esteem'd because it was the less to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>

                  <p>At length, my <hi>Camillo,</hi> I see my self safe within your Armes; and yet, methinks, I can never be enough secure of you: for, now I have nothing else to fear, I am afraid of you; I fear your constancy: they say possession is so dangerous to Lovers, that more of them die of Surfeits than of Fasting.</p>

                  <p>You'll be rambling too, <hi>Aurelian,</hi> I do not doubt it, if I would let you; but I'll take care to be as little a Wife, and as much a Mistriss to you, as is possible: I'll be sure to be alwayes pleasant, and never suffer you to be cloy'd.</p>

                  <p>You are certainly in the right: pleasantness of humour makes a Wife last in the sweet meat, when it will no longer in the Fruit.

Pray, Sir, let us make haste over these Walls again, these Gardens are unlucky to me: I have lost my reputation of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> in the one of 'em, and of wit in the other.</p>

Now, <hi>Laura,</hi> you may take your choice betwixt the two <hi>Benito's,</hi> and consider whether you had rather he should Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renade you in the Garden, or I in Bed to night.</p>

You see, Brother, here's a General Jayle-delivery: there has been a great deal of bustle and disturbance in the Cloyster to night; enough to distract a Soul which is given up, like me, to contemplation: and therefore, if you think fit, I could een be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to retire, with you, into the World; and, by way of Penance, to Marry you; which, as Husbands and Wives go now, is a greater Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification than a <hi>Nunnery.</hi>

                  <p>No, Sister, if you love me, keep to your Monastery: I'll come now and then to the Grate and beg you a Recreation. But I know my self so well, that, if I had you one twelve Moneth in the world, I should run my self into a Cloyster, to be rid of you.</p>

            <l>SOme have expected from our Bills to day</l>
            <l>To find a <hi>Satyre</hi> in our <hi>Poet</hi>'s <hi>Play.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The <hi>Zealous Rout</hi> from <hi>Coleman-street</hi> did run,</l>
            <l>To see the Story of the <hi>Fryer</hi> and <hi>Nun.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or Tales, yet more Ridiculous to hear,</l>
            <l>Vouch'd by their Vicar of Ten pounds a year;</l>
            <l>Of Nuns, who did against Temptation Pray,</l>
            <l>And Discipline laid on the Pleasant way:</l>
            <l>Or that to please the Malice of the Town,</l>
            <l>Our <hi>Poet</hi> should in some close Cell have shown</l>
            <l>Some Sister, Playing at Content alone:</l>
            <l>This they did hope; the other side did fear,</l>
            <l>And both you see alike are Couzen'd here.</l>
            <l>Some thought the Title of our Play to blame,</l>
            <l>They lik'd the thing, but yet abhor'd the Name:</l>
            <l>Like Modest <hi>Puncks,</hi> who all you ask afford,</l>
            <l>But, for the <hi>World,</hi> they would not name that word.</l>
            <l>Yet, if you'll credit what I heard him say,</l>
            <l>Our <hi>Poet</hi> meant no Scandal in his <hi>Play;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His Nuns are good which on the Stage are shown,</l>
            <l>And, sure, behind our <hi>Scenes</hi> you'll look for none.</l>
