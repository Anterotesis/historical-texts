            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if that would not serve, but that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to stand it out against him, and put it to the hazard of warre; then hee hung out a red flag, in token,<note place="margin">A Red-flag.</note> that now

there was nothing but death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to be expected upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall of his profered favor and mercy to them. Even so Almighty God, the great and supreme Sovereigne of all Nations and Kingdomes, and the most terrible heart-tamer and wonder-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-King of all Kings, who with the word of his mouth and breath of his nostrils, is able to subdue the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest Kings, Kingdoms and people, and to cast down al strong holds and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest mountaines before him, as those Heathen Kings,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.26. and 6.26.27.</note> 
               <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> and King <hi>Darius</hi> freely confessed.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99479:3"/>
on their true repentance and hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from their evill courses and conversation, but if this will not worke kindly on them, but they wil obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and stubbornly stand out and refuse his mercy and proffered grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, then at last,<note place="margin">Gods Red-flag of wrath and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</note> he hangs out his red-flag of wrath and confusion and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly consumes his proud and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opposers, all insolent and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible sinners, who have thus made themselves uncapable of mercy and compassion, and are so become as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible stubble in the presence of a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and angry God,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.29.</note> who as a consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, devoures them, as in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, as the Prophet sayes,<note place="margin">Esay. 33.14.</note> who is able to stand before, or to dwell with everlasting burnings? Now, this mercifull course of our mercifull God in thus hanging out first this white-flag of favour and mercifull premonitions (which is the thing mainly intended to be described in these following figures
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99479:4"/>
and ocular-Emblemes of prodigious portentious, and apparitions) before he inflicteth severe punishments on his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Servants: The Lord useth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest unto them divers waies, but most especially and most remarkably, these two waies.<note place="margin">2 Sorts of Gods White-flagges.</note> Either by his Prophets and faithfull Preachers, declaring his word and will to his people; as <hi>Ionas</hi> in Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevie,<note place="margin">1.

And this last course, the Lord hath also fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken, with a provoking and impenitent people in all ages and times. And this is the thing which in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99479:4"/>
this little Treatise is mainly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be declared and insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Namely, to shew, that even of late also, in these our modern times (as well as in former and ancient ages) we, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by our sins and transgressions, a greatly provoking people, incensing and exasperating the high indignation and wrath of the Lord against us; yet he hath among us also shewn himself to bee God that changeth not,<note place="margin">Psal. 7, 12.13.</note> full of compassion and slow to wrath; ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his bow, whetting his sword, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up his arm, ready to let it down, yet loath to strike, that so by these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to the blow before it falls heavie upon us, we might see and shun and avoid it by our true and cordiall repentance. Now in the first place, I shall very briefly give you a taste and sight of what God hath done in this nature and kinde in former ages and times, and so passe on succinctly to our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99479:5"/>
owne times, which I say is here mainly intended.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Jove omne princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium. Heb. 12, 2.</note> And, first, to begin with him who is the beginning and end of all things, even the Lord Jesus Christ, our most pretious and deare Saviour, the authour and finisher of our faith, that glorious Lord of life, and Prince of peace; who being born into the world in the dayes of an Emperour of peace, <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> then Emperour of Rome, yet bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world not onely peace,<note place="margin">Mat. 10, 34.35.</note> but a sword also; peace to penitent and broken-hearted beleevers, and a sword of variance and revenge to proud and impenitent sinners: Therefore at his birth,<note place="margin">The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Star in the East, seen at Christs birth.</note> what a most admirable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralel'd Starre was seen in the East? so great and so miraculous a Starre as hath puzled and posed the greatest and most learned Astronomers and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians of the world.<note place="margin">A white Flag. Joh. 3, 16.</note> A white Flag of mercy indeed, yea of everlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from Sin, Death and Hell, if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99479:5"/>
graciously accepted with firm faith, and found universall obedience.<note place="margin">A red Flag. Heb. 2, 2, 3.</note> But a red Flag of wrath and confusion; yea of horror and perdition, if obstinately rejected, or lazily neglected by sin, and ignorance, and infidelity. Again, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the destruction of that great and most magnificent Metropolis of the whole world, Jerusalem, I mean;<note place="margin">Jerusalem</note> what fearfull and prodigious fore-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings were sent to that Citie, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew them the wrath to come? As, first,<note place="margin">1. Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde.</note> a fearfull blindnesse and stupidity of minde, or hardnesse of heart (the most fearfull fore-runner of wrath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, of all the rest) not to see or beleeve those wonderfull fore-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which God then sent among them. Secondly, a Comet,<note place="margin">2. A Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met like a sword.</note> like a sword, and a bright shining light, in their Temple, round about their Altar, in the midst of the night. Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. A Cow which brought forth a Lamb.</note> a Cow, (which should have, then, been sacrificed) that brought forth a Lamb,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99479:6"/>
in the midst of the Temple.<note place="margin">4. The Brass gate of the temple o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened of it selfe. 5. Armed men and chariots in the aire. 6. A voice in the Temple.</note> Fourthly, the great and massie brasen gate of the Temple, which opened of it self. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fearfull and hideous sights and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions in the aire, of mighty compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Chariots and armed men in an hostile manner. Sixtly and lastly, a voyce was heard in the Temple crying out, <hi>Let us goe hence.</hi> With other such like, mentioned by <hi>Iosephus</hi> in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous history of the Jewes, page 738.</p>
            <p>But, to come neerer to our own times. Are not the fearfull apparitions and signes in the heavens, and prodigies on the earth,<note place="margin">Germany.</note> often seen in Germany, by the inhabitants thereof in many places, notable fore-runners and predictions of Germanies succeeding miserie, still fresh in the memory of many yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; who have been both eye and eare witnesses of the manifold and most lamentable distresses and destructions which have befallen; and, even to this day, lye still very heavy on that (once)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99479:6"/>
most famous and flourishing Eden of the whole Christian world,<note place="margin">Germany the Eden of Europe</note> now, made a desolate defart, and bare and barren wildernesse.</p>
            <p>But, all this while, that we have only heard that our neighbours houses have been so fearfully on fire; what use have we of England made thereof? How have we endeavoured to keep the flame off from our own houses and habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Certainly, wee have not made that holy and humbling use thereof as we might and ought to have done, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering our meanes of grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, wherewith we have been, even lifted up (like Capernaum) to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;<note place="margin">Mat. 11.23 England like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum.</note> far beyond our neighbours round about us. We have not been wise by other mens harmes, as meer humane and worldly wisedome might have taught us to be: But have, contrariwise, drunk wine in bowles, as the Prophet complaines, and stretched our selves on our beds of Ivory,<note place="margin">Amos, 6.6.</note> none of us hardly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99479:7"/>
being grieved for the afflictions of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> in the aforesaid Germany, and now also of late and lamentably bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ireland.</hi> Wherefore the Lord hath (and that most justly) come neerer home to our owne doores, and begunne to make us (who were only supine spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of others miseries) now, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py spectacles to others of imbred and homebred devouring destructions.</p>
            <p>Nor yet, I say, in all these our selfe-procured sorrowes, can we justly taxe the Lord in the least measure, with any more harsh or hasty proceedings heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with us, then with any of his other servants in by-past times, but have been, every-way wholy left without excuse. For,<note place="margin">England left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.</note> hath not the Lord for these many yeares together both called upon us by by his faithfull and painfull Preachers of the word fore-warned us to flie from the wrath to come?<note place="margin">1.

Here, I say also, did the Lord, by them, ring us such a peale of thundring Canon, as it were knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at our doores to awaken us out of our marvellous Lethargy of ease and carnall security, or of blockish stupidity, as might have beene thought sufficient to have made us recollect our thoughts, open our eyes and looke about us, and see the hand of God lifted up against us, yet loath to let the stroke fall so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon us, to our irrecoverable ruine and destruction, as our sinnes most just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserved, had hee in his justice so dealt with us.</p>

about 5. of the clocke in the afternoone, at a Towne called Alborough in the County of Suffolke, there was heard in the ayre, and evidently seene, a mighty sound of drummes beating very loud, after which was also heard at the same time, a long and fierce peale of small shot, as of Muskets and such like, and then as it were a discharging of great Ordnance in a pitcht field; all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing about an houre and a halfe, and then there was a mighty and terrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or noise of them all together: At the ceasing whereof a blacke stone was as it were shot out of the skye, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight inches long, and five or sixe inches broad, and about two inches thicke, which was taken up by two men which stood by and heard the foresaid noise, and the whistling of the stone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their head as it past by them (but they could not see it) they found it by meanes of a little dogge, who followed it by the sent, and ran barking to and

                           <l>A mighty battell fought (as 'twere) in th'aire,</l>
                           <l>Which Alb'rough Townsmen mightily did scare:</l>

                           <l>But suddenly this frighting feare was past,</l>
                           <l>And, by melodious musicke turnd at last</l>
                           <l>Into much joy and great alacrity,</l>

                           <l>As if the Lord would hereby let us see</l>
                           <l>His gracious love at last to set us free</l>

                           <l>To crown us with a conquest most complete,</l>
                           <l>Shown in this figure Tragi-comicall:</l>
                           <l>Heav'n say Amen to this. So pray we all.</l>

Now this Tragi-Comicall Warning-piece (for so methinkes I may fitly call it) which we have here described and set forth, as well as a figure and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that nature might be; beginning so terribly, and concluding so sweetly, did far transcend, in prognosticating comfort, in the issue, all the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned marvellous prodigies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, either in Jerusalem, Germany, or elsewhere among us; and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (surely) serve as a soveraigne anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote against our too much fainting and affrighting feares. The Lord our good God seeming hereby to foreshew us (as blessed Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> also, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Divine, and faithfull servant of the Lord, in his most bright and learned revelation of the Revelations of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> hath even prophetically written) that Englands terrible storme of woes and warres now begun in it, by Papists, Atheists, and profane Malignants, whom God hath stirred up to disturb
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99479:30"/>
its abused peace and plenty, and as a just punishment of Englands great sins and enormities, though for a while it may seeme sharp, yet shall be short, and prove sweet in the issue, fanning away the chaffe, and burning up the drosse thereof, and making way for a glorious peace and perfect reformation, and for the setting up of Christs Throne, and advancing of his Scepter, in the power and purity of holy ordinances, in the issue and conclusion.</p>
            <p>It is our part therefore, in faith, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and prayer, to possesse our souls, and to wait on the Lord for the happy performance of the same in his due time, and by that way which is best pleasing to his most wise providence. And the Lord in mercy perfect our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation thereof in his appointed sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Amen and Amen.</p>
            <p>I have made no mention all the while, of the many strange, fearfull, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed Eclipses of the Sunne and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99479:30"/>
Moone, which have been seen from yeare to yeare both in other parts, and also in our owne English Horizon; which also by the judgement of the best Astrologers and Mathematicians, have and doe prognosticate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto us, many notable changes and overtures of States and Kingdoms; as also that late and memorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> among us in February last, 1643. which hath been written of long before it fell out; and which (with all the rest) doth prognosticate and demonstrate unto us (as so many Warning-pieces) the great alteration and vicissitude of Kingdoms, Countreyes, times and things in Church and State; especially, I say, this late and great conjunction of those two celestiall Planets as Mr. <hi>Booker</hi> in his Prognostication for this instant yeare 1643. doth most notably declare and manifest unto us.</p>
            <p>But of these, and some other such
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99479:31"/>
like strange apparitions in the aire, I shall desire (with wise King <hi>Solomon</hi>) all my Christian brethren and friends) to take holy and wholsome counsell which the Spirit of God prompts the children of wisedome to embrace and follow, <hi>viz.</hi> A prudent man fore-sees the evill (or approaching storme) and hideth himself from it. And what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nay what so safe a hiding-place as the clifts and holes of the Rocks, even the wounds of the Lord Jesus Christ, that immoveable and everlasting Rock of our Salvation, and under the holy and heavenly wings of the Sunne of Righteousnesse; where onely (as the Prophet sayes) is true and infallible Soule-healing comfort indeed, to all truly penitent, and conscience-wounded sinners, who with godly sorrow, and unfained repentance and reformation, by faith in prayer, seeke and sue unto him; which, the Lord give us all wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and grace so to doe. Amen.</p>
