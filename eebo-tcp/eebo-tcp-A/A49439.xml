         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HIS

WITH
OBSERVATIONS,
CENSURES,
AND
CONFUTATIONS
OF
Divers Errours,
Beginning at the seventeenth Chapter of that

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <opener>READER,</opener>
            <p>BEfore you go further into this Treatise, I think
it fit to premonish you of three things. First,
How it is writ. Secondly, Why by me. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Why now put out: Concerning the first, expect no
other but to read the strongest Discourse in Politiques,
betwixt <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> and me, that ever was writ; for
the Art of Polity (being more properly signified by the
name of Prudence) is always, by those who writ of it,
from <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> downward, until you come
to the very last, is naturally powder'd with senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and interlarded with Histories; for it being
not a Science whose demonstrations come from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
causes, where <hi>posita causa</hi> most certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the effect, or grant the effect, you must own the
cause from whence it came; but a prudence, which
disposeth men to a wise conformity, not by the force
of a necessary efficacy, but by the perswasions which
fear and love induce to, which are not necessary,
but arbitrary; men in the manage of such affairs, do
most discreetly, when they produce the sentences of
wise men who have gone before, and by great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
found those sentences effectual in such occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
and because there is nothing new under the Sun,
therefore Histories of our Fore-fathers, in like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are most excellent Guides for the prudent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
of our lives, who indeed do but repeat what
they have done: but <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> presuming upon the
greatness of his own wit, which indeed is great, (and
<pb facs="tcp:96149:3"/>
it is a thousand pities he bestow'd it so ill) scorns
to tread in beaten paths, and thinks by the strength
of his own fancies to make his feet leave such an
impression, as all others shall follow him, not he
them. I must follow him, for whosoever is to be
confuted, must have it done out of his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and therefore I fall upon him with only down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
reasons; therefore if at any time my Pen hath
dropt a sentence, or a story unawares, which was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the business, (which I believe is very seldom)
I though it not worth the mending, but let it pass:
And so having shew'd the Reader why I writ so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politically
of Politiques, I pass to these and Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement.</p>
            <p>The second Premonition is a question why I should
write of this piece, and my Answer is short, having
spoke to the former part of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> it was
proper for me not to step over this, but take him in
order as he writes: But a man may object, and some
have objected that were acquainted with my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
that this is not so proper f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r a Bishop
(whose time should be taken up with his Profession,
which is Divinity) to meddle with such State affairs.
I answer, that <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his writings are so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined
with so much Heterodox (shall I say) or
Heretical and Atheistical Divinity, that it befits
none so well as a Divine t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> meddle with them. And
again, I said, that although there is a Generation
that think we should be Fools in anything else, yet
let them know, that if so, we must be Fools in that
likewise, as well as other things: for <hi>Theologia</hi>
Dininity, is not only <hi>Scientia,</hi> Knowledge, but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the School-men, <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s good friends,
<pb facs="tcp:96149:3"/>
speak, it is <hi>Sapientia,</hi> we may render it in English
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> which is the highest knowledge, whose
principles are the highest and first Rules which habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
are imprinted in man, and whose conclusions
are the premises of other inferiour Sciences: And
they say moreover, that this which is called <hi>Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stica
Theologia,</hi> School Divinity, differs from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
only in this, that it adds one principle to the
other, which is the Faith in the revealed Will of
God, which I am forced to fight for in this Treatise
with <hi>Mr Hobbs:</hi> And because this is the nature of
this great Wisdom of Divinity, it may prescribe the
Rules to all Sciences and Prudencies, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of men, from the King to the Cobler, how
they may live and demean themselves vertuously: But
besides this, let those men consider, that there is one
piece of a Divines study (without which he will be
lame and very deficient) which must needs teach
him a great deal more of this Prudence, then I have
need to use in this Discourse, unless he be a very dull
man, which is Ecclesiastical Story, wherein he shall
find such acts and subtilties practised b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Hereticks
and Schismaticks, (whom I have always observed to
be more crafty, though not wiser then the Orthodox
part) such applications to Emperours, to Emperesses,
to Favourites at Court, such cloaking evil intentions
with pious pretences, such artificial slandering the
persons of their Adversaries, that he cannot but know
the polity, yea the base crafts of men, and knowing
them to be such, may the better learn to avoid those
snares which have catched men heretofore, and will (if
not prevented) do so again; yea shall find that many
times the wisdom of learned and pious Bishops
<pb facs="tcp:96149:4"/>
have been the prop and stay of both the Empires,
<hi>East</hi> and <hi>West;</hi> and which is more, even in the
practick peace of Polity, you shall find Bishops exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
them in the most excellent manner for wisdom
and courage, that ever any men did: I write not
this to invite men of that condition to muddle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the trivial affairs of this world, no, as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians 3. 20. Our conversation
is in heaven.</hi> The word which we render Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is in the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
noted by <hi>Beza,</hi> that it is that kind of Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which agrees to the Polity, of such as are Citizens
of the heavenly <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> So that although the
Apostle aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rms this of all men who aspire to Christian
perfection, that such men should live and converse
in that Polity, which conduceth to the establishment
of that spiritual society, which are parts of that
Kingdom, yet in a more especial manner, it agrees to
them who are exalted to that high dignity in that
society, that the Polity of their abilities should be
applied to the advance of that Kingdom; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to that, when the benefit or ill of a sublunary
King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om or Commonwealth shall conduce to that
Kingdom in heaven, it will become such men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
their counsels in a way most proper for them
to imploy themselves in: But my intent in writing
this is to shew, that a poor old man, sitting in his
Study, and principally applying that study to Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
may easily by that study give advice and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
to greater doubts then are in his Politiques,
which indeed are gross mistakes, from the first corner
stone he laid in the Foundation, to the top-tile in
the Roof.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Introduction to the whole Discourse.</head>
               <p>I Have briefly touched the chief heads of his first Part.
And am now arrived at his second, part, which
is entituled of Common-wealths, and this part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at the seventeenth Chapter of the whole Book
superscribed <hi>of the causes, generation and definition of
a Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He begins with the final cause most rightly, which is <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
causarum,</hi> and sets the whole at work. And I find no
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96149:5"/>
fault with what he writes concerning that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I approve what he saith at the bottom of the
85. <hi>page, That small numbers joyned together cannot give them
security to live peaceably.</hi> Small is a Relative, small in respect
of their Neighbours, of whose injury they may justly be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
unless they are supported with Natural, or Artificial For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
or their number may be equalled by the weight of
the internal vertue, or gallantry of the Inhabitants; some
way or other it must be made up.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>I approve what he saith,</hi> pag. 86. That be the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
never so numerous <hi>(I may add or strong)</hi> yet if their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are directed by their own particular Judgments and particular
appetites, they can expect thereby no Defence, nor Protection. <hi>His
Reasons likewise I approve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I censure not his Conclusion in the same page;
That the Government of their Good, must not be for one Life
or Battel, but Perpetual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He makes a very Ingenious Discourse upon the
difference betwixt those sociable Creatures, as Bees, and Ants,
(which <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls Political) and hath very handsom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
concerning them, to the middle of the 87. <hi>page;</hi>
but then I must begin to examine him with less approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
In the Margent there is noted, the generation of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth,
and it begins thus.</p>

meet with so many self-ends; and particular Interests, and so

I will give him all the Scope I can, he may say that
they may meet, as they do to elect Knights for the Parliament,
they may meet in Shires and choose Representatives which may
act for them; I could ask who must divide those Shires?
that must be done by a Supreme. Then consider, if that should
be granted, they must choose little <hi>Leviathans</hi> first, which must
represent these their particular Shires, before the great one is
chosen: And then, consider this hath a great unfitness, if not
an impossibility with it, which was fore-seen by our State,

were adjudged fit to have voices in these Elections: which
heretofore was a very considerable Estate; and yet I believe
scarce ever half of those met at any Election. But then let
us look about and we shall find much the greater company
without the lists of that condition, besides Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which have as great Interests in the Common-wealth as
others. So that this fancy of his, was not only not practised,
but not practicable in such a Kingdom as this of ours; When
men write Romances they should write things possible to be,
and then they are useful to the Reader, for they are of such
things which a mans life may meet with, at some time or other;

<hi>That there is no Covenant with God, but by mediation of some

use it, and practice it accordingly, and when these Covenants
are holy and devout God blesseth them, and those persons

with God in himself, to destroy him in his deputy; a Covenant

                     </gap>again true in the material part, but his inference is faulty;
for his conclusion I am perswaded, that none of his Subjects
can be freed from their Allegiance to him by any act of his,
unless dereliction of his Government, and that may abide a
Dispute too. But to raise this conclusion out of that Ground,
because he made no Covenant with them is exceeding weak.
<hi>First,</hi> There is the same reason, by his Doctrine, betwixt him
and the Subject; for the Subjects (in the very Paragraph which
was but now transcribed,) make their Covenant one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not to the Soveraign, so that there must be the same
reason out of the Nature of the Covenant, that the Subject
should not forfeit his Right to him, as he to the Subject, for
the Covenant being only made one to another, the breach of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96149:12"/>
that Covenant is only one with another: but I am bold to
affirm it an impossible case, as he imagines it, that there must
be mutual approbations betwixt both, and all. For, certainly
it cannot be imagined, that such a generality of men, as must
convene to do such an Act, should submit to such a total dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction
of themselves, without some promise, or Covenant on
his part; that he will protect them from injuries at home, and
Invasions from abroad; but he being exalted above all other
Earthly Powers is subject only to the King of Kings, which is
God, who will Judge him: but the Subjects are examinable,
responsible, and condemnable by him. But he labours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe
this reason in his following discourse thus, <hi>That he who
is made Soveraign makes no Covenant with his Subjects before
hand, is manifest; because either he must make it with the whole
Multitude as one party to the Covenant, or he must make a several
Covenant with every man; with the whole as one party, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;
because as yet they are not one person).</hi> I will not put
down his reason against his second branch, because I shall not
need to dispute against that, having shewed the possibility of
the first. But I will begin with his division, and deny that
it is necessary that the Covenant should be made with the
whole as one party, or with every particular severally; for
there is a Medium participationis, which is more reasonable
than either; for without doubt the Fathers of Families were
Natural Governours from the beginning of the World, and
they had by the Law of Nature Absolute Government over
their Families, these when they find themselves not able in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
distinct bodies to defend themselves, may treat amongst
themselves how by an Union they may make themselves strong,
against forreign and domestique dangers, and to that end erect
a Supream over themselves; and this certainly hath a greater
shew of Reason, then any of his thoughts, that every person
who hath no Judgment nor Authority should be introduced to
make a Covenant for so high concernments. Therefore that
division was not good which did not comprehend the <hi>totum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visum.</hi>
Then for his Argument <hi>that he could not Covenant
with the whole as one person, because as yet they were not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
I answer, first that they neither are, nor in truth will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96149:12"/>
ever be <hi>one person,</hi> but because by his unimaginable conceipt
they are after their Covenant represented so by him, I will
answer to himself; That first this Company meet together, then
they consult upon that great work of choosing a Soveraign,
the business is concluded upon by both parties, Soveraign and
People, first they engage for their Patrs; then he may
Covenant for his, and this is no otherwise then is apparent in
all contracts, one must speak first, and after another, so in
marriage first one speaks and then the other; and in all bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains,
which yet are conditional until the second word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the contract. Nor is it possible, as I have said, to think
that men would so deliver themselves to anothers will, from
whom they have no promise or the least verbal engagement
to govern them justly and prudently. What he speaks against this
Covenant with the several persons, I let go, thinking it impossible</p>

his Covenant, and unless such a Clause were put into his
Covenant, there was no pretence of reason for it; and it were
as much against Reason, to put such a Clause into his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
I have delivered my opinion of this before. The King
of Heaven will Judge him severely for his breach of Covenant,

right, to wit, that he will Govern his People Legally and Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

produce Confusions and Distractions in the Government, for
the People upon any hardship they suffer, though never so just,

can the publick Sword which is derived from that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

when we lose these vertues of fidelity, and obedience,
it is only the publick Sword which by force can make them
submit, but yet that which the Sword can justly compel any
unto, must be by the obliging vertue of the Covenant. But
whereas he placeth the obliging power in the Sword, he gives
all right of interest to it, then which nothing can be more
destructive to Monarchy: Let Kings know that their Swords
may rust, or loose their edge, and then he who hath the
keenest Sword may plead the best right. This encouraged the
late Rebels, who having got a longer Sword then the King,
upon that Title, preserved their Usurpation to the utmost
they could. And the wickedness is very apparent, for by his
Doctrine whosoever can force his Superiority, may justifie his
exercise in it, which is the greatest encouragement Rebellion
can desire: But perhaps that phrase <hi>(The Publick Sword)</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:96149:14"/>
may bear him out in it, for by this he understands the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Power in that Man, or Assembly of men, which hath
the Soveraignty, all whose actions are acknowledged by them
all. What a foolcry is this? Was there ever any Rebellion in
which the Rebels did not deny to approve the actions of the
Supreme they rebel against? And suppose that impossible Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the universal meeting and assent to that Covenant,
yet when the same persons renounce, who made that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
how can the Sword authorize his actions, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

and perished, and a new Breach started up in its place: The
right of the Sword is given by the breath of the Covenant,
with promise to own his actions; that Breath is gone; they
breath contrarily and revoke it, if any man can get the
Sword, he will make them blow such an other Breath upon
his Sword, as they did upon the first Supreme. The truth is,
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> makes the power of Government to consist imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
in the Sword; but that founded upon a Breath, which

arraigned, condemned? This certainly he cannot,
because the power of Judgment supposeth Superiority, which
cannot be over the Soveraign in his own Kingdom: But let
us observe the consequence of this Argument out of these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
premises, that because by his fancy of the Institution
every subject is Author of all his actions, he can do no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to any of them; certainly this doth not follow by his own
Doctrine; for put the case, that the Supreme doth authorize
a Judge to hear and determine such causes, doth the Supreme
only do injustice in it, when the Royal Authority gives power
to the Judge, who acts unjustly by that Authority, which was
given him by the Supreme, or the Judge likewise who abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that Authority? I believe no man will affirm it; or if he

Kings acting by the Authority of the peoples grant, not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
in himself; for (which is his reason before spoke to) if
the Author do solely perform, not the Actor or the person
who immediately operates, which he delivered before, the
King not the Judge doth unjustly, when by his Authority
the Judge decrees wickedly: But he proceeds with another
reason, (for saith he) <hi>He that doth any thing by Authority
from another, doth therein no injury to him by whose Authority
he acts.</hi> This is not true generally, a Judge judgeth by the
Authority of the Supreme, but if he Judge unjustly (yea,
judgeth a cause against the King perhaps unjustly) he then
doth the King an injury by his own Authority. Again, a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
with Plenipotency to kill, slay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the King, he
turns now his Army to the Kings destruction perhaps, doth
not he then do the King an injury by his own power?</p>

shall adventure his life upon idle and frivolous occasions, he
deals unjustly with himself, by hazarding so Noble a Creature

hath a nice distinction at the bottom of this Paragraph; <hi>It is
true, that they that have Soveraign Power may commit Iniquity,

had expounded the proper signification: At the first I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at this distinction, and did doubt there was some
great and excellent Notion in it, but duly considering the
words, I find they were airy, and do signifie no more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
then if I had affirmed Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> or the Writer of
<hi>Leviathan,</hi> said this, or that, meerly nominal: For what is
iniquity but unequal dealings? which in him who is bound
to deal equally in distribution, or commutation, is <hi>injustice;</hi>
and indeed injustice is nothing else; and <hi>injury,</hi> what is that?
but not just, or right; and I am sure injustice is nothing else:
But where some Law directs this or that, he doth otherwise:
This is the proper and genuine sense of the words, and unless
he had shewed us some more proper use of them, there is no
reason why we should be forced from this common acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>IT will be a strong foundation for this discourse to produce
the Actions of the King of Kings, God himself, which
I may do in the eighteenth of <hi>Genesis;</hi> ye may observe there,
that God was pleased to reveal to <hi>Abraham</hi> his intended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Sodom; Abraham</hi> after he had undertaken to
plead for them, in the twenty fourth verse, puts the Question,
Peradventure there will be fifty righteous within the City, wilt
thou also destroy, and not spare the City for the fifty righteous
that are therein? Then in the twenty fifth verse, <hi>That be far
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96149:17"/>
from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the
wicked, and that the righteous shall be as the wicked, that be
far from thee; shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi>
In which you may observe, that <hi>Abraham</hi> in a bold manner
did dare to intimate, that God himself should have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
not right, but unjustly, in punishing the righteous with
the wicked; and shall we be afraid to say that <hi>Leviathan</hi> can
do unjustly, when they shall slay the righteous as the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which many of them have done? If we consider all the
Species, and several sorts of injustice, we shall find that they
may, and have prepetrated them: They have broke the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>distributive Justice,</hi> in preferring base and unworthy
people, and neglecting, yea punishing vertuous men; for
<hi>Commutative Justice,</hi> they have taken against Law and Equity
other mens Estates, they have neglected to pay their due
debts, and what can be more unjust then those? they may
therefore do unjustly, nay what is more, by how much their
power is greater, by so much they are enabled to do more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice;
and I may add, other mens injustice may prove
theirs, not only out of his vain principles, because all Judges
in his Dominion act by his Authority, even in those Causes
where they judge wickedly: But because he is the Supreme,
and should take care for his inferiour Officers that they do
their duties, which if he knows they do not, and yet neglect
to correct them for amendment, they will prove his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
We know the Judgment upon old <hi>Eli,</hi> who was a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and good man in himself, and the <hi>Leviathan</hi> of that
Nation then, yet the Judgment of God was upon him for
not using severe Justice to his Sons, when he knew their
faults; as you may observe in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 27. So that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that they may do injustice more then others; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if he cannot be unjust, neither can he be just, for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are belonging to the same subject; he who cannot be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
cannot be vertuous, and contrary acts in any man will
by degrees eat out any vice or vertue, nor can men call it ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in any who cannot do ill. But I think there is now
enough said to this, I will pass to his fifth Inference, which
is this.</p>

cannot punish a wicked Judge, a rebellious General, and the

urge to these instances, that this Judge, or this General, acted

he doth that which is contrary to their good or peace; so

know, That as I have oft observed he exceedingly often
abuseth this general Rule; he who hath right to the end, hath
right to some means, but not to all: A man hath right to his
house, in anothers possession, right to get it peaceably by Law,
and not by force: A Supreme, or under him his Judge, hath
right to punish Felons, but he hath no right to butcher any
man without a legal Tryal, no though the fact were seen by
him; so that he hath right to all legal means to obtain this
end, but not any other: Let us change the person, and this
will appear most manifestly, every man hath right to the peace
and good of the whole Kingdom, without which he cannot
live contentedly, and happily, and he ought to use his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

these men are either of one Religion, or divers; (for

that Doctrine should be regulated by peace, without doubt
peace is an excellent Box to preserve truth when it is setled,
it is a Child, a Daughter, and fruit of truth, for true Doctrine
brings peace wheresoever it is; but it cannot so regulate a

But peace and concord are artificial things introduced by the
wit of man for his greater security: So that if truth and
peace agree no better, then peace, and the Law of Nature, as
he hath stated it, it is little or not at all. But the truth is, that
truth of Doctrine bring all peace, peace with God, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
our wills to his Sacred Revelations in the regulation

planted it with his death, so must we cherish and water it

But be it of what opinion it will, this Argument
doth not become him, because he makes war to be the natural
state of all mankind, which if it be, it will return, unless
you take the very nature away in which it is rooted, otherwise
it only suppresses the outward acts of violence or war, but not
extinguisheth the being of it. Again, he makes his peace
obtained by the Covenant in the Soveraigns Institution, to be
nothing else but a cessation of Arms, for fear men should not
else enjoy their conveniencies or well being. Now then, if
this be the height of any peace, they who are governed thus
remisly, as he speaks, are in as good a state of peace as any
others are. I grant that remisness of Government, is an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

men call Propriety.]</hi> To understand this we must return back,
and consider, that this is spoke of a Commonwealth consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
after his impossible imagination, by a multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of which there was never any president, nor is ever
likely to be: The impossibility of which will yet appear more
manifest, by the examination of this Paragraph. To that
purpose let us conceive a multitude of people met together
upon such a design, as he proposeth, of chusing a <hi>Leviathan;</hi>
all these people either had estates, or had none, but only their
beings in the world; or else some had estates, some had none.
To think that in such a multitude no man should have any
thing of his own, were most unreasonable. And again, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that there were no necessitous men amongst such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, were ridiculous, it must needs therefore be, that
some had estates, and some none. Let us then proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own Rule, that the prime and principal Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is for every man to look to himself, and his own accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations;
and for that reason it is (and the sole reason by
him alledged) why men incorporate into a Body Politick.
This being supposed (as it is by him) can any man think that
such men who had estates, would make themselves in an equal
condition with those who had none, and leave them at the
disposal of a <hi>Leviathan</hi> when he is constituted, whereby they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96149:24"/>
should be levelled with them who had no estate; or rather in
the constitution of their Commonwealth, provide to have
them secured by some Covenant or other, that they might not
be worse afterwards, then they were when they covenanted
for it, yea loose that which perhaps with great pains and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
they had acquired, which if they do in their constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Commonwealth, the Soveraign hath not right to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose,

having formerly assented to that Covenant. For if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Politicks, we shall find the only end, why men imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
themselves into a Commonwealth, to be the securing
themselves to live comfortably, enjoying their own without
molestation, or to that purpose. Think then how it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for a man with such thoughts about him, in that way to
throw himself, and all he hath, clearly to anothers disposal,
without any condition or Covenant. For although all things
under the Sun are subject to change, and the strongest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails
find means to be frustrated, yet providence, and careful
men, in such a constitution of so high a Nature, would fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see

                  <p>ANd now Reader, having passed some Notes, I will
proceed to set down my own judgment and Opinion
of this so much honoured division, which although out of
the Reverence I bear to the consent of so many learned men
in it, I dare not deny that it is a good division; yet methinks
in political stories I can observe, that take these in their pure
and simple natures, there's scarce one of them purely such,
in any one Country of the whole world; and therefore I
may say of them, as Philosophers say of the Elements, they
are the matter of which this great Globe of this sublunary
world is composed; and yet not found distinct in their pure
nature, in any creature in the world, but are denominated
such <hi>

it is called fire; when cold and moisture are intense, it is then
water; or else (as the Mathematicians speak) <hi>Saturn</hi> is
Lord of this House, because he is predominant; yet the
power of his influence is more or less, according to the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nce
or detriment he receives from other Planets. So when
one is chief or Lord of the House, either a Monarchical chief,
or Aristocratical, yea I may add a Democratical or popular
Government, it is denominated from that which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
although one or both the other may be joyned in the
influence, and concur in the Government over the whole. I
think this appears most true to any man who hath perused sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
nay they are so conjoyned and mixed one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sometimes, that it is exceeding hard to say which is the
predominant, and disputes amongst learned men are raised,
what name to give some Supremes. You may find a common

who did acknowledge a God as <hi>Darius</hi> did: For how could
he think that God would bless him, acting so cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r, as to forbid prayers to him? Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> indeed might
have concurred with him, that thinks no prayers have preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
with God, but that all things are governed by immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
necessity. But <hi>Darius</hi> could not be of that mind, who
for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thought that God could, and would deliver him: Neither
could <hi>Daniel</hi> be of that mind, who would not leave praying
for all the terrors of the world. Well, the Decree is out, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> which is unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable;
when the Law was out, and <hi>Daniel</hi> found to be a
transgressor against it, we shall find in the thirteenth verse,
that these Princes presented the crime to the King, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Justice against him; in the fourteenth verse the King is
said to labour until night to deliver <hi>Daniel,</hi> and was displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with himself. Surely before he was aware he had consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to such a Law as was mischievous to a person of that great
integrity and excellency, as <hi>Daniel</hi> was; and this Law which
he had made, must be Author of so great a Crime, as to shed
not only Innocent, but vertuous blood; and therefore he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
until Sun-set with those men who joyned with him in
the making that Law to deliver <hi>Daniel:</hi> But they, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

verse, being fierce against <hi>Daniel,</hi> urged the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Decree, that it was a Law confirmed by him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> which may not
be altered; and indeed the argument is of great force: For if
Laws made by any Supreme may be violated before they are
repealed, what security can any Subject have of any thing
he enjoys? And surely in keeping and preserving the Laws
they have made, they do imitate their great Master the King
of Kings, and Supreme of Supremes, from whom they have
all their Authority, and by whom they reign, who although
by his infinite power he can do what he pleaseth, yet out of
his infinite goodness he cannot deny himself, or alter the word
which is gone out of his mouth, <hi>falli non potest, mentiri non
potest;</hi> so that all his Words, and Covenants, and Promises,
are Yea and Amen. Such should Supremes be; such was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
that just King; no doubt but he could have sent a party
of Souldiers, and have taken <hi>Daniel</hi> out of their power; but
having made the Law, which bound him to the execution, he
would perform it, although it were never so contrary and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
to his disposition. From all which you may discern, that
this great Potentate had his power limited by a Law which he
could not justly violate. Now look upon him, and see him in
the following part of his story, of a most absolute and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
power, where it was not restrained by Law. In the
latter end of that <hi>Cap.</hi> you may observe, that when the King
had perceived that God had delivered <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Lyons,
and he had taken him out of the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King commanded, and they brought those men who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
<hi>Daniel,</hi> and cast them, and their Wives, and Children,
into the Lyons Den, that is, the Presidents and the Princes,
which was the greatest act of power exercised upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
persons which were in that greatest Kingdom, and all this
meerly arbitrary.</p>

and the controul of the Execution is another. Here you see

This supposal of his, that men are in an absolute liberty, is
very rarely to be found; for all men that are in the world,
as soon as they are born, are Subjects, unless we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a man born King of that Country he is in. I would
fain find out such a possibility, where such a number of men
fit to make a Commonwealth may be at liberty; and I have
found out one where it hath been practised, I mean that of
the Roman Empire, when it was broken and ruined, many
people for fear were driven away to shift for themselves, or
perhaps overs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

men, one or other, being thus left to themselves, their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Emperour, and his Posterity, to whom they should obey,
being destroyed, or altogether unable to give them any sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
these men are left to shift for themselves: A Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they must have, or grow wild; they conspire in that,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96149:32"/>
and then set up many Commonwealths in <hi>Italy,</hi> and those
adjacent parts. But give me leave to tell Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> that he
shall hardly find in any of them existing any pure element
of Politie without commixion. And I shall tell him more,
that these Commonwealths having no support, but that weak
foundation of the peoples Constitution, were upon all o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in all these was ever called a Representative, or a <hi>Leviathan:</hi>
And therefore Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> did much amiss to lay this as a
foundation for all that light stuff which follows, yea of his
whole Book, and of all Commonwealths, which can only be
founded upon such an extraordinary occasion, neither then
in such an absolute manner as he supposeth: For never did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of these submit their Religion, their Estates or Lives, as he
would injoyn, but had them preserved by Laws.</p>

It is not true, that all acquisition of a Kingdom is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96149:33"/>
by force, sometimes it is got by craft and knavery, we know
how <hi>Absalom</hi> got the Kingdom. There may be other instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but let that go, acquisition by force is but one species of
acquiring Kingdomes. But then see what follows, <hi>[It is then
acquired by force, when men singly, &amp;c.]</hi> as before expressed.
I dare boldly say he can shew me no considerable Kingdom
that either is or was so acquired. I have confuted this in my
former discourse, concerning the Institution of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and those arguments will be of more force against
this manner of acquiring. Suppose an Enemy should conquer
<hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> do you think he could or would assemble
all the Nation together to subscribe, or any way express their
intentions of this his most unjust request to own all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

any such thing. Look upon <hi>David, Alexander, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
any of those Concquerors in the world, did they ever
act any such thing? I am confident we read of none, and yet
they attained Kingdomes, and get Dominions. But let us

to fear; however, in the last case, I think it not amiss: A
vanquisht Nation seldome subjects themselves to an Enemy,
but out of fear of the Conqueror. But concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
the motive is as much the love of their own happy and
quiet condition, together with the hope and expectation of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96149:34"/>
many other conveniences which will accrew to them and
their Families by it: But (saith he) <hi>in both cases they do it for

as proceed from fear of death, or violence, void; which if it were
true, no man in any kind of Commonwealth could be obliged to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.]</hi>
Thus far he, and indeed if there were no other obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
but these fears he speaks of, there were no obligation
to bind any man when he may secure himself: For let the
Reader observe, that the fear he speaks of are fears of men,
one of another in an instituted, and in his acquired Kingdom
for fear of the Conqueror. Here is put down no fear of God,
which is the obliging fear; for the rest men may have worldly
plots to escape, and rid themselves of the dangers of War,
but he can have none to acquit himself of Gods anger, which
is the great weight, and the only one which presseth man to
obedience.</p>

the reason of it. The Proposition I speak to first, and allow it
to be true, not only in a Commonwealth instituted or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

unlawful thing is not obliged to the performance; and the
reason is, that the Moral Law of Nature being written in

that Thieves should with oaths and imprecations make a man

lawful for him to do it, but it would be a most wicked act
to keep such a Covenant; not because (as his reason is) <hi>that
he had no power to do it;</hi> for he had by all those Laws which
he seems to acknowledge, which are the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes

his goods into the Sea, to save his Ship and his life, doth that

a reluctancy, and against his love of his riches, which
weighs the ballance heavier on the other side, it is neither
violent, nor willing, but a mixed action, yet willing princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
because it is chosen; and upon this reason it is, that
this act done by such considerable fear, is expounded not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory:
As if a Maid surprized by such means should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

if she finds she should be unhappy in such a Match,
without doubt she is not bound to perform it, because it
was not fully a willing or rational act, but mixed; but yet if it
had been a voluntary act, and with full consent, she ought
to keep her Covenant: Which shews, that many times forced
acts or obligations made by terrour of death, or with strong
probabilities of great mischief, if refused, may when that

to the Man, the Mother to the Father: I but, saith he,
they are equally principles of Generation; therefore if the right
of Dominion be an appendant to Generation, it must equally
belong to them both. I will not dispute the nature of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which Philosophers and Physitians have abundantly
done; but suppose that in the case it exacts an obedience to
them both, yet with a subordination to the Father, which
must clearly appear in this, because the Woman her self must
be obedient to the Father, as will appear in the two first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Generation, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> God gave them that
Law, <hi>Thy desire shall be to thy Husband, and he shall rule over
thee, Gen.</hi> 3. 16. Now then if the man rules the woman, then
in the subordination of Government, she cannot equally share
in that Dominion with him, who is Governour of her: So
that although the Child hath from his Generation two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96149:37"/>
to obey; yet this obedience is terminated in one, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Scripture, and hopes with a flash of wicked wit to divert men
from that due observance which they ought to have of those
duties which are there required, or at the least to diminish
that rational obedience which men should give to it. It may
be some do attribute the obedience to the man only, out of this
regard, that he is the Nobler Sex, and why not? He is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly;
for although it may happen out in particulars,
that the Woman may be more prudent or strong then her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
yet certainly the generality is not so; and the rules of
governing and obeying are not to be taken from a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

when a Man and a Maid married, they were to fight at the

whether true or false it is not much material; I read it
only in him; but surely a most unreasonable practice. Is the
power of Government proper to strength or wisdom? Can
any man think that a Bull or a Horse is fitter to govern a man,
then he them, because they are of more strength, though he
have more wisdom? But surely for us that are Christians, there
is no need to fly to such poor little instances, or customs, or the
accidental prudence or strength of the woman; if she have

what of late I delivered concerning this Doctrine out of <hi>Gen.</hi>

over his Church; which I hope no Christian will say, but that
it must submit to, and be governed by him. And I hope, both
Nature, Gods Law, and Christian duty, may be sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine

fain know how the Fathers, rather then the Mothers, should
come to be Erectors of Commonwealths? Certainly if Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
were instituted (as he feigns) by the general suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of all who had interest in the Government, then women
as well as men, Mothers as well as Fathers, had the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that business, for they have their interest in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
constitution as well as men. But he hath let fall an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
truth which is clear against the whole Body of his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
which is, that the Fathers of Families, not the Rabble,
were the Erectors of Commonwealths: For if they did (as
I am confident with him here they did) then his former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
which is built upon the institution of a Commonwealth
by the universal consent of all who have interest in it must fail,
for not the Fathers and Mothers only, but even the meanest
child or servant, may challenge their shares in it. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Fathers of Families could not be the Erectors of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,
but only out of this regard, that they were the
chief in their Families, and by that reason had right to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of himself and them. And here let the Reader consider,
that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> never remembers that great Authority given
by God to <hi>Moses,</hi> which regulated him and his Posterity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96149:39"/>
Generations; nor the confirmation that Law laid from our
Saviour in the New Testament, which are obligatory to us in
all Ages. He only clouds the truth with this pittiful poor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or rather shew of reason, only that men were the Law-makers,
and they were partial to their own Sex; No, Master
<hi>Hobbs,</hi> God was the Law-maker, who is no accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or Sexes, but in an infinitely wise manner disposeth all
things in the best and surest method that may be, according to
his most just Laws, But because he said (but not always) that
is, that the Fathers of Families were not always the Erectors
of Commonwealths, intimating that some Commonwealths
were erected by the Mothers of Families, I should thank him,
or any man else, who can shew me any such in the world. It
may be he will fly to that beggerly instance which he gives pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
of the <hi>Amazons;</hi> but let it suffice for them (if there
were any such) that they were Widdows, or single Women,
not united in Marriage, and so not subject to Husbands, and
therefore were free to dispose of themselves as they pleased,
and might have made what just Laws they thought fit for
their condition; but if they were joyned in marriage to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
they must then subm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>NExt let us consider what power the Mother hath to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
her child; <hi>Id potest, quod jure potest;</hi> she hath no
power, but by some Law which gives her that power. I am
confident he cannot find any National Law which gives the
Woman authority to act any such thing, or if he could, what
would it avail him? because he disputes of such who are not
imbodied into a Commonwealth, much less can he pretend to
the Law of Nature, which dictates nothing more clearly
then the Love of Parents to their children. I but he will say,
<hi>she hath power, that is, she is able to do it:</hi> If such a malicious
disposition were discovered, the Husband hath power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
it: But suppose such a horrid wickedness may be in the
Woman, and a power, yea an opportunity of acting it, doth
she gain dominion, because she doth it not? by that reason
Wives may have dominion over their Husbands, Children o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Parents, Servants over their Masters, Subjects over
their Kings, for all these have or may have power, though no
right to murder or slay the other, which is very odious to the
consideration of any man who thinks upon either Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96149:42"/>
or Politicks; nay there is none of those more abhorring
to nature, then the Mothers exposing her child. I therefore
conclude against that member of his distinction, that although
a Mother may be so impious as to expose her child, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she hath no right to do it, she gains no right of domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

leave to look back again upon what he writ at the beginning
of this Chap. for the confusedness of his method must needs
make my discourse somewhat such, who follow him closely
foot by foot. He there affirms, that these two Governments
by Institution and Acquisition, differ not but in the manner of
fear; that by Institution is obeyed for fear of one another;
that by Acquisition is obeyed for fear of the Conqueror; then
the condition of all Subjects in the most civil estate is slavery:
The Supreme may kill, ruine, destroy, beggar any of them,
without Law, other then his own will, nay he may do it
rightly, then which never was there a more horrid Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
uttered in Politiques, and if these two Dominions be the
same which he affirms there, and Dominion by Acquisition
have the power to do so as he affirms here, it must needs be
so with all Subjects according to his Doctrine.</p>

would half the people in any conquered Nation do it. But

pass all the rest of that Paragraph, and that which follows,
and will only drive at the fundamental, which being shaken,
the building will fall of its self. At the bottom of this page
he begins a new old business. <hi>[In sum, the rights and consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

with those of a Soveraign by Institution, and for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

adventured their lives and fortunes with their King, and had
a subordinate share in the Conquest, should after the Conquest
be no better but in the same condition with those whom they
conquered, and by them were conquered. It is true, an easie

into one condition, when it shall be observed that they who
are conquered, are gained to a liking of the customes and

I will question nothing in this Paragraph at this time, but
let the Reader bear in mind, that there is such a thing for
which I shall call Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> to an account hereafter. In the
following Paragraph he labours to bring Scripture for what
he hath taught: It is an honour to Scripture, that it is like
Vertue, commended even of those that will not follow it.
But it may be Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> objects it against us who do confide
in it, and not produceth it to satisfie himself, that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is consonant to Scripture, I will examine this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
for surely if the Scripture be for him, I am also, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
to me it appears never so erroneous, according to
mine own reason: He begins; <hi>Let us now consider what the
Scripture teacheth in the same point: To</hi> Moses, <hi>the Children of
Israel, say thus,</hi> Exod. 20. 19. <hi>Speak thou to us, and we will
hear thee; but let not God speak to us, least we die. This is
absolute obedience to Moses]</hi> thus he. A strange deduction out
of this Text, where is no one word of obedience, much
less of absolute obedience as to a Supreme. But I will help
what I can, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 27. there this self-same business being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
it is added, <hi>We will hear it, and do it.</hi> There obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is mentioned implicitly: To understand this therefore
consider with me, that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> having the
Law delivered to them by God in such a terrible manner in
Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with Thunder, Lightning, Trumpets, and the
like, they were terrified and afraid to have such an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
converse with God, they thought it mortal, it being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96149:48"/>
before seen in the world; and therefore they entreated
<hi>Moses</hi> to go betwixt God and them, and receive Gods Will
from him, and deliver it them, and they would obey. Here
is nothing of obedience to <hi>Moses,</hi> but to God only; they
trusted that <hi>Moses</hi> would relate Gods Laws to them truly,
which indeed they had great reason to do. If the rest be like
this, I shall have little trouble with it.</p>

First then consider, that it is not said, this shall be the
<hi>right of a King,</hi> that would have made it <hi>Jus Regale;</hi> and being
indeffinite would have constituted it to belong to every King;
but it shall be the <hi>right of your King.</hi> Many things may be the
rights of one Countries King, which are not of another; yea
many things may belong to one King of a Country, which
did not belong to another King of the same Country, yea to
the same King at another time. I urge this only against him,
because he urges this place to prove the right of Kings, which
it doth not do (if truly quoted) but only the right of a King
of <hi>Israel,</hi> and it may be not that neither, but only the right
of the next King; for it is said, <hi>of the King that shall reign
over you,</hi> in the singular number, not in the plural. Nay it
is most certain, that God, by whom Kings reign, and from
whom they have their Authority, may give what Authority
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96149:48"/>
he pleaseth to one, and not to another, the Plenipotency of
which Commission I shall more fully shew hereafter. Well
then, let it however be granted, that this Text is truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,

(manner, or custom;) but certainly it cannot but be
yielded, that it is used in both senses. But our Translators do
very often render it as here, so <hi>Psalm</hi> 19. 132. as thou usest
to do unto those that love thy name: But it is not material to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96149:49"/>
alledge more Quotations; this Text will enforce this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
for in the 18 verse it is said, <hi>Ye shall cry out in the
day because of your King which ye shall have chosen you, and the
Lord will not hear you in that day.</hi> Consider here, that men do
not clamour and cry out upon Justice, when it is executed but
upon injustice. I know there are other Expositions given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his or mine, as that of <hi>Cajetan,</hi> that it is not said, <hi>the
right of the Kingdom,</hi> which is a Law, but <hi>of the King;</hi> as if
Kings would esteem this right. But this is scandalous to Kings,
to many of whom, I doubt not, but Justice and Mercy are as
dear as to any men in the world. There is another Exposition
with a distinction, that there is an ordinary and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
right: This Text sets down the extraordinary right; to
which I say I allow the distinction; many things may be right
and lawful for Kings to do upon extraordinary occasions,
which would not be just in his ordinary Government. But
how can a man conceive that these things should relate to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
occasions, to make Perfumes, or to run before his
Chariot, to gather in his Harvest? as if there should be exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
of these poor trifles, or the honour of a Kings Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
could not yield such a return as might make every man fit
for such an imployment, ambitious of his entertainment. I
think this may suffice for the exposition of this Text, to shew
that it was spoke of the practise, not the right of their
Kings: but if not, look the seventeenth of <hi>Deut.</hi> at the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
verse, where you may see the passage foretold, <hi>When
thou art come into the Land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and shalt say, I will set a
King over me like as all the Nations that are about me.</hi> The very
language which these men used, ver. 15. Thou shalt in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ny
wise set him King over thee, whom the Lord thy God shall
chuse; and so goes on to describe the Laws for their Kings in
the following part of that verse, and the 16, 17, and 18. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
But there is none of these things reckoned there; and in
the 18 and 19 verses, he is commanded to get him a Copy,
or a double Copy (as some would have it) of this Book, which
is <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> one Copy to lye by him, and another to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
about with him, as our marginal hath it, and is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
(methinks) to the Text, which saith, <hi>He shall read
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96149:49"/>
therein all the daies of his life, that he may learn to fear the
Lord his God, to keep all the words of this Law, and these sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
to do them.</hi> So that a King ought to take care to keep
the Law of the Land, which to them was <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> And
from thence the madness of their Exposition will appear, who
think that the Law which was spoken of, was this Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
spoken of by <hi>Samuel:</hi> But alas! that needs no great
study either to know or practise; this therefore must needs be
the sense of it. But if this will not serve the turn, you may
read in the 46 of <hi>Ezek.</hi> ver. 18. some part of the Kings Law
delivered clear opposite, to one clause delivered here; that is,
<hi>That the Prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance by oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to thrust them out of their possession, but he shall give his
sons inheritance of his own possession, that my people be not scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

to that which is said, <hi>He will take your fields, and your vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
and your Olive-yards, even the best of them, and give them
to his servants.</hi> This certainly is unjust for a Prince to do by
<hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and therefore these places must be reconciled, which
may easily be done by our Translation, understanding the
word <hi>(Mishpot)</hi> for a custom or usage, for so <hi>Sam.</hi> describes
what will be done; but the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> from God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
what is right and just to be done. And thus I think

(as I shall shew hereafter) it is impossible, that the people who
had no power given them from God, should give it to a King;
none sure but the All-powerful God can give men power one
over another. And as this story confutes his abominable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which destroy the foundation of Government, so it
doth that horrid and treasonable conclusion of his which
plucks down all Government, and hath been the Author of
almost all Treasons that ever were; that is, that in defence of
a mans life, or himself, from such hardship as may render his
life irksome to him, a man may take arms, or kill any man,
or do any thing which may rescue him from it. I have spoke
to this before, how unchristian a speech it is; but now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how destructive of peace it is in a setled Commonwealth.
There are no Traytors but pretend their Liberties are invaded,

when your King abuseth you with such oppression, there is no
such consequence to be drawn from the whole context, that
men should whet their Swords, and be avenged. There is no
power above that of the Kings, much less is there any such in
his own Subjects: But men in such a case must fly to the King
of Kings, who according to his infinite Wisdom, Justice and
Mercy, will consider and help them when he thinks fit. There
is no appeal from a King, but to his King; and then when
your own sins call for his judgments (as it was here) he will
not hear your cryes; which strongly intimates, we must not
fight, but cry in that day when such things are done unto us;
prayers and tears are the only weapons allowed Christians in
that case: Righteous men must not think to go to heaven

that <hi>Naboth</hi> conceived no such right; for else he would not
have denied to yield that upon a good valuable consideration,
which was due by Law. Well, this Text being thus exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and some inferences made upon it, let us now consider
his collections out of it: <hi>[This</hi> (saith he) <hi>is absolute power,
and summed up in the last words, you shall be his servants]</hi>
which is the last clause of the seventeenth verse. Let a man
consider here what Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath writ of servants in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
page, (where he sets down, that men vanquished in war
are servants, and what their servitude is) and he shall find all
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96149:51"/>
Subjects to be in a miserable condition, such as will little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from being in war; for what can war do? it can but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
mens estates, their wives, children, and their lives, to a
Conquerors will; and that, by this Gentleman, they are in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
even in peace; yea by that very reason, that they are
imbodied into a Commonwealth. But he proceeds further:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Again; when the people heard what power their King was to
have, yet they consented thereto, and say thus, We will be as
all other Nations, and our King shall judge our causes, and go
before us, to conduct our wars.]</hi> I looked for these words, but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nd them not either in ours or other Translations; but indeed
the sense is in the nineteenth and twentieth verses: And so I
let it pass: His collection is <hi>[Here is confirmed the right that
Soveraigns have, both to the Militia, and to all Judicature, in
which is contained as abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lute power as one man can possibly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to another.]</hi> But hark you Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that phrase transfer? can it be thought, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
assent transfer'd any Authority which God did not give?
Certainly that is a greater Exaltation then ever man dreamt of
until now. But I am confident that the people took this as a
menace of <hi>Samuel,</hi> to deter them from having a King, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the language used in the ninth verse by God to <hi>Samuel,
Protest solemnly to them, or against t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>em</hi> (as it is in the margent
of our Translations) so they thought it a menace or threat;
and that you may conceive from the nineteenth verse, which
begins—Nevertheless, that is, for all that menace, or <hi>nequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam,</hi>
as the vulgar Latin, by no means will we be terrified, but
will have a King like other Nations; they would be in this
fashion; but where can they find that fashion used in the
world? they had lived in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Pharoah</hi> oppressed them
mightily, mistrusting them to be a dangerous people, and a
people that lived apart from the Aegyptians, and had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with them. But I do not read, that they took the
Land of <hi>Goshen</hi> from them, which had formerly been given
them by the King of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and those horrid oppressions
were most wonderfully revenged by God upon <hi>Pharoah</hi> and
his Aegyptians, when the <hi>Israelites</hi> cryed to him for help,
because they were undeserved: But saith <hi>Samuel; You in this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96149:51"/>
case shall cry, and not be saved,</hi> because you provoke these
mischiefs, being under a most excellent Government, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
protection of God himself; in which regard he saith
in the seventh verse to <hi>Samuel, They have not rejected thee, but
they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there were some miscarriages by <hi>Samuels</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that his Sons did not behave themselves well under
him; yet you may find in the twelfth <hi>Cap.</hi> third ver. when
<hi>Samuel</hi> resigned up his Government to <hi>Saul,</hi> he could cal
them to witness, <hi>whether he had taken any mans Oxe or Ass
from him, or defrauded or oppressed any man;</hi> and at the fourth
verse they acquit him. So that for men thus to reject the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of God, by such a pious and excellent person as
was <hi>Samuel,</hi> for some discontents and rebellious humors
which were in their fancies, and exchange him for they knew
not whom, was such an unpardonable fault, that God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Samuel,</hi> that he would not hear their cryes when they
clamoured out for these evils; which not their folly only, but
impiety had brought upon them: So that methinks there can
be no inference deduced here to shew the justness or right of
this exorbitant power, which he pretends to in this word <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute.</hi>
He hath the power of <hi>Judicature,</hi> but that power is
to determine what is right, and to whom the Vineyard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs,
but not to take it to himself. He hath the power of
the <hi>Militia</hi> to fight with the Enemy; nay, he may by it force
(and rightly ought to use that power to force) men to render
to every man their own; but he cannot rightly take away any
mans estate from him, otherwise then the Law directs; and he
who saith he can do it to others, if he felt such unjustness
done to himself, would quickly learn that Lesson, that it is
excellent Justice, that <hi>Artifex necis arte periret sua;</hi> then he
would abhor his own Doctrine. This was well fitted for the
sequestrations and seisures which were made of mens estates
when he wrote this Book for them.</p>

I let it therefore alone, but consider his Logick: He saith,
<hi>Because he is to be Judge, and to prescribe the Rules of discerning

think this consequence is so far from a necessary deduction out
of the premises, as I conceive the contrary is absolutely true;
because he is Judge, he must take those rules which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
him, but not make his rule. Consider with me, I
beseech you Reader, that every Judge must be a Judge either
in a constituted Commonwealth, betwixt men who live in that
Polity, or else where there is no Commonwealth, and where
men live only according to the dictates of Nature: In the first
every Judge hath the National Laws of the Country to be his
guide, and he must judge according to them, and not make
Laws of his own head to judge the cause is committed to him.
For the second, he hath the Law of Nature to guide him to
that which shall appear most equal, according to that rule. He
who draws a line by a rule, doth not make the rule, the Judge
is such, his Decrees are regulated by the Laws according to
which he decrees, but doth not make those Laws: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

                  <p>THe rest in that Paragraph is such trash as never was read;

the Kings word is sufficient to take any thing from any Subject

for he himself, as King of the Jews, commanded his Disciples to
take the Ass, and the Asses Colt, to carry him into</hi> Jerusalem:
<hi>Read the Text,</hi> Mat. 21. 2, 3. The words as he writes them
are, <hi>Go into the Village over against you, and you shall find a
She-Ass tyed, and her Colt with her, untye them, and bring them
to me: And if any man ask you what you mean by it, say the
Lord hath need of them, and straightway they will let them go.)</hi>
Thus he writes that Text most false in many places. But I
will consider the matter in hand, and stick to his Inferences.
<hi>(They will not ask whether his necessity be a sufficient title, nor
whether he be Judge of that necessity, but acquiesce in the will of
the Lord.)</hi> Thus he. And I could wish he would acquiesce in
the will of the Lord, for then he would never have vented
so many abominable falshoods as he hath. But to my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
I first retort this <hi>ad hominem,</hi> be it true or false; This
argument is not proper from his mouth, who (page 262.) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<hi>that our Saviour had any Kingdom in this world whilst he
was in it)</hi> therefore he did not now send for this Ass by a
Kingly right; (I mean to speak to that in its proper place:)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96149:53"/>
but now he who denies his Kingdom, cannot here justly urge
this for a president to Kings: I (but he will say) he spoke that
of our Saviours Manhood; I reply, if he spoke this of him
as God, it is no president for Kings; for undoubtedly God
hath reserved cases to himself, by which he can and doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose
of all things in this world how he pleaseth, (as will be
shewed hereafter) and not only of things in Kingdoms, but
of Kingdoms themselves; and therefore this instance is no
president. But then let us consider the fact: Our Saviour
sent for an Ass and her Colt, they were goods belonging to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
man; and the up-shot of all was, when the right
owner questioned why they loosed them, and they told him
it was for the use of the Lord, which was the Apostles lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
concerning Christ, he being a person famous for many
Miracles, and much Piety, as that Story will shew, the right
owner let them go, and let them use them; and it is most
reasonably thought, that our Saviour having made use of
them in that great Solemnity he was then going about, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them afterwards, when it was finished. But mark, the
owner gave way to his use of them; he did not take <hi>Naboths</hi>
Vineyard from him without his consent: This is a weak way
of arguing, from an act by the owners consent, to prove it
lawful against his will; if the right owner gives way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to use his goods, there is no fault in it, and this proves
no more.</p>

let it go, it shall be taken in the present tense, and I

away. Well then, it appears clearly, that here was no Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical

to the will of the Monarch. But because I am in
now, I will add a word or two against his urging this place,
for the absoluteness of their Dominion, out of the following
words,—<hi>Whatsoever they shall bid you observe, that observe, and
do it.</hi> Now this word <hi>whatsoever,</hi> must have relation to the
former words, <hi>whatsoever they teach you out of</hi> Moses; let not
their vicious lives or hypocrisie make you refuse the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Doctrine which they teach; but if they teach you
false Doctrine (as they will) that comes not out of <hi>Moses his

<hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 2. and therefore our Saviour often forewarns them,
not only of the <hi>life, but doctrine of the</hi> Pharisees, in the
16. of <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. take heed of the leaven of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
which in the 12. verse is expounded the doctrine; and in
this very Chap. verse 4. <hi>They bind heavy burthens, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to be born, and lay them upon mens shoulders;</hi> and in the
13. verse, they were said <hi>to shut up the Kingdom of Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
men;</hi> which must be by their doctrine: In the 16th
verse, <hi>They are called blind guides,</hi> which must also be by
their ignorance in doctrine or teaching; and if the <hi>blind
lead the blind, they will both fall into the ditch:</hi> So likewise in
the same verse he reproves their false doctrine about Oaths;
wherefore this <hi>(whatsoever)</hi> must be understood of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
according to that they pretend: So out of <hi>Moses</hi> his
Chair, what they from his Authority shall appoint to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
must be observed; but when they produce doctrine
contrary to that, they must be disobeyed; their wicked
lives shall not prejudice their godly doctrine, nor shall <hi>Moses</hi>
his Chair countenance their wicked doctrine or commands;
for if so, S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> (before spoken of) were to
blame, who disobeyed their commands; and the inhumane
Murther of our Saviour might be justified, which was acted
by their direction. Well, I need speak no more to this, it is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96149:55"/>
apparent, that this neither can prove Aristocraty, nor deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

And as he was to blame to found Aristocraty upon any of

expression, That the power of every one of these Supremes

then all Supremes have a like power, (which certainly is not

may fancy many evil consequences, yet the consequences of

wild asseveration is this? Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> (I am perswaded) hath
lived in divers Commonwealths, yet did he never find in any
this absolute Hyperbolical Power of a Soveraign; nor did
he see any where, that every man was at war with his
Neighbour. That which follows in that Paragraph I let
pass, because confuted by what hath been writ heretofore,
there being no new matter in it, and pass to the next, which
he thus begins: <hi>(The greatest objection is that of the practise,

done a great work if he had instanced in those Nations, and

the demonstrations out of them most undeniable; but
the affairs of Politique Government most weak, the subjects
(which it treats about) most unconstant, which is men uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and because the judgments of men, their humours,
their passions, are all obnoxious to variation, there can be no
certain Rules which can meet with all accidents at home, or
abroad with other Nations, which are variable one as the
other; but much and many designs must be daily changed,
according to divers occasions; and indeed they are so many,
that no wit of man can foresee all: Let <hi>Achitophel</hi> himself
advise never so cunningly, yet if <hi>Absolon</hi> do not follow it
(which no man can foreknow, but by guesses) his directions
can effect nothing; and therefore there is no conformity in
the Rules of the Mathematicks, and these of Politiques; the
one like the subject most immutable; the other like its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
most uncertain. The last clause of that Paragraph and

Consider, Reader, what a strange perplexed kind of writing
this is, where he is forced to write a Comment upon his
own Text. To begin with him: <hi>(Liberty, or freedom)</hi> What
need of freedom here, when the subject he treats of is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?
Secondly, What need of that <hi>Parenthesis</hi> to expound
<hi>opposition?</hi> If he had not affected a deceitful way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
he might in fewer words, and much more clearly, have
said, <hi>Liberty signifies (properly) the absence of external impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of motion:</hi> But if his contempt of such Learning had
not made him neglect to read it, he might easily have known
there is a liberty <hi>à Coactione, from constraint,</hi> and a liberty
from <hi>necessity.</hi> The first is that, and that only which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines;

is left out by him, and that is peculiar to men alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

of the word, A Free-man, is he, that in those things
which by his strength and wit he is able to do, is not hindred to do
what he has a will to do.]</hi> This is freedom and great liberty;
but I doubt he will not find any Subject in the world having
this liberty. He might have given this Chap. another title,
for there are no subjects which are not confined from this
liberty. Well, he goes on, and I wait upon him: <hi>But</hi> (saith
he) <hi>when the words Freedom and Liberty are applied to any thing
but bodies, they are abused.)</hi> It was unkindly and unhandsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said, to affirm it <hi>abused,</hi> since it hath been the language of
all men who have written of any spiritual things; which
certainly, having no bodies to hinder them, must needs be
free, according to his own conceit. I hope in a fuller manner
to handle the nature of Spirits; therefore I will not meddle
now with it, only I will mind him of that common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96149:58"/>
amongst us, denoting a spiritual freedom in that which
is no body, and that is, <hi>Thought is free;</hi> and yet this thought
is a spiritual thing, having no dimensions; but because no
Humane Laws can restrain, confine, or judge of mens
thoughts, they are free. But he produceth a reason for what
he had writ <hi>(for that which is not subject to motion, is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to impediment;)</hi> What he means by <hi>motion,</hi> I know not;
but if he means that, which according to the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of Philosophers it importeth, that is, not only lation
or changing of place, but that which makes any change in any
thing, which (he knows) are commonly reduced to six species:
then he might have observed, that that heat which warms a
mans hand is not a body, and yet may be impeded and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by cold from its activity, or that motion of calefaction.
Well then, some things besides bodies have motion, and
may have that liberty (which he speaks of) confined by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
things. But because his Philosophy points at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Spirits, whose motion is not so clearly discerned as
that of bodies, especially in that succession in which bodies
move; and I think he means only local motion; I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that Spitits move, in their way, from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in a spiritual manner, and are at one time in a place, in
which they were not before; and many times have spiritual
impediments; of which I reserve a fuller discourse hereafter.
But at this present, my affirmation is as good as his negation,
especially countenanced with such a general consent of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
as cannot be counterpoised by any thing that can
be produced for the contrary opinion. Well then, let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
that which follows—<hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>when 'tis said
(for example) the way is free, no liberty of the way is signified,
but of those who walk in it without stop.)</hi> This expression
will not serve his turn; that phrase, <hi>The way is free,</hi> doth not
mean a liberty of the <hi>men who walk in it</hi> without stop; for
prisoners in bonds may walk in it without stop, who are far
from freedom; nor is it yet used abusively, but passively,
which that word <hi>freedom</hi> doth bear, (though hardly that
word <hi>liberty,</hi> which he applies to it.) So that the meaning is,
the way is of an open condition, not appropriated to any
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96149:59"/>
particular owner, so as to forbid you legally to pass there;
nor is this an abusive speech, but this word <hi>liberty</hi> is seldom
used but (with such addition as may expound it) in a passive
sense, for some power to act, although freedom in others.</p>

Then secondly, take it for the act of giving, that is, a

but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds
no stop in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to do.)</hi>
What? from the use of this word Free-will, no liberty can
be inferred of the will, desire, or inclination! I wonder why
by his discourse, because it is no body, which he conceives to
be the only free thing; but that hath been refuted: other
things are as free as bodies, according to his conceit of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
because other things produce alteration, and may be
impeded in their operations. But perhaps he puts a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
here betwixt freedom and liberty, which before he
conjoyned; and conceives that the freedom of the will,
which may not be stopt or hindred in its operations, is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
thing from its liberty of doing, or not doing, of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, or refusing that: And although he allows the first,
that it is free, without stop to operate; but hath no liberty to
operate, or not operate, or to refuse one, and chuse another;
this I apprehend to be his meaning, as will appear presently,
his whole discourse pointing at it. To understand which,
let the Reader consider with me, that this word <hi>will</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
two ways; for a faculty in the Soul, by which it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96149:60"/>
divers acts, as to will, or nill, chuse, or refuse. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
for the prime act of this faculty, which is to will,
for so Philosophers do with the understanding. <hi>Intellectus</hi>
is the faculty by which a man understands any thing, and the
prime act of the understanding, or indeed the chief habit by
which it understands any thing. The <hi>habitus principiorum,</hi> is
called <hi>Intellectus:</hi> Thus sometimes the same name is applied
to the faculty, and the chief operation of the faculty: I
speak this, because he more then once abuseth this notion
with some derision; but however, until we can learn more
significant terms to express our notions by, we must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with such as are in use. Now consider, here he takes
will for the act, or the operation of the faculty, not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
it self: that is evident, because he expounds it, as if
they were one by desire and inclination. Now those two, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and inclination, are actual motions, or at the least, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies
to motions: Now (saith he) of these there is no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
but the liberty of the man. It is true, the man is the
<hi>subjectum quod,</hi> or the Soul of man in which the faculty of
the will is, but the will is the faculty which is the <hi>subjectum
quo,</hi> the immediate subject by which the man is free; and
by this faculty the man is enabled to work this act of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
freely. But yet consider with me a little, that the will
being the instrument which man useth to obtain his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
hath a twofold act; one respects the end, which is
happiness, the other the means, by which this happiness is
to be obtained: The first is natural, and necessary; as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
as for the eye to see colours, for the fire to burn. There
cannot be a man who would not be happy, he may be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the thing so as to count this or that to be happiness,
which is not, but he would be happy. The second, which is
conversant about the means, is Election, and that act is free
for a man to chuse, or not chuse, to chuse one, and refuse
another. Now concerning the second there is abundance of
liberty; concerning the first, he might confound will, desire,
and inclination; but concerning the second, he may will, or
rationally desire that which he hath no inclination to, yea is
averse to in his natural inclination; and therefore in that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96149:61"/>
regard they were very ill joyned together; and it was a Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
of him, and what follows is most odious to all reason
and experience; for explaining himself, what he meant by the
liberty of man, <hi>which</hi> (saith he) <hi>consisteth in this, that he finds
no stop in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to do.</hi>
Consider this strange proposition; Was there ever any man
of such a liberty, such a power, that he finds no stop in doing
what he hath a will to do. The greatest Emperour that ever
was, could never say so; they have stops in themselves, their
own reasons and consciences forbid them to do many things
they would do, their short and weak arms stop them from
doing many things they are inclined to do, only God is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of this liberty, whose infinite wisdom can find out all
things, and infinite goodness desires nothing but what is
most excellent, and infinite power can do all what he hath
an inclination to: It was therefore a most strange speech, and
I cannot but wonder how such things can pass amongst rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
men for Philosophy; and being in, I think it my
duty to shew such a thing to a heedless Reader.</p>

cast into the Sea, for the preservation of the Ship
and Passengers. The dictate of Reason often diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
and the will violently carried by the sensual
appetite. Denominations are a principaliori.</head>
                  <p>SO now we will pass on to the next Paragraph; I expect
more of this stuff: It begins <hi>(Fear and Liberty are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting)</hi>
(I believe they are in a mixture) <hi>as</hi> (saith he) <hi>when
a man throweth his goods into the Sea for fear the Ship should
sink.)</hi> This instance is commonly given to mixed actions,
which are compounded of voluntary and involuntary; here
is a part of both; he doth throw his goods into the Sea,
this makes it voluntary; he doth it grudging, that makes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96149:61"/>
it involuntary, yet it seems the predominancy is in the
will. But now consider with me, that these terms (which
he handled before, and confounded together) you may now
find distinguished, they are will, desire, and inclination:
these three (to speak properly) differ, according to a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
estate in man, Natural, Animal, and Rational: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the first, he hath inclination to tarry and remain
in the world, with the like; agreeing to the second, he
desires meat, drink, to walk, to talk, and do all things which
are pleasant to him: According to the last, to act such
things as reason shall dictate: Nay he may have an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to many things which Reason can say are not fit; take
the highest instance which can be given, that is, to live;
when Reason shall shew him, that it is not fit to live upon
such dishonest terms as are offered. So likewise he may
have an animal desire of pleasure, which being found not fit
by Reason, the rational will controuls it. Thus we see those
three Appetites; and to keep close to his instance, man
hath an inclination and a natural appetite to live, and hath
a sensual desire of his riches, by which he hopes to live to
the satisfaction of his sensual appetite; but Reason pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes,
that life is to be preferred before all the pleasures in
the world. So that here he saith right, one may have a
will to throw his riches into the Sea, but his sensual desire
is against it, and that makes it have a degree of unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Consider again, that this act of throwing his goods
into the Sea, is in its own nature an unwilling act; for no
man would desire to cast that away, which with so much
hazard and pains he had got; but in the particular, when
it comes to be yoked with that greater mischief of loosing
his life, then it is chosen before the other, and yet it is oft
grieved for when it is passed and gone, which is a shrewd
objection against the willingness of it; for no man is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
grieved for doing what he will; but be it as he will,
yet the rational will, the sensual desire, and the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
are not the same; and although the rational will
in that act doth command, yet in many it doth not, being
violently carried away with the other; So that he saith
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96149:62"/>
truth, when he saith,—casting his goods into the Sea was a
willing action, although there was an earnest desire to the
contrary; and there was, by reason of that, some mixture
of unwillingness in it; yet <hi>denominatio à principaliori,</hi> the
predominant part gives the denomination invincibly: So
likewise what follows in another instance, <hi>of him who pays
his debts only to avoid imprisonment:)</hi> And what in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of that Paragraph, he saith, <hi>That generally all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which men do in Commonwealths for fear of the Law, are
actions which the doers had liberty to omit)</hi> therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they had liberty in themselves, they might do, or not

of this Argument is invisible; for though this will doth
proceed from a cause, as he expresseth it, yet if that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
cause from which it proceeds be not necessary, yea, if
any one Link in the Chain of Causes be free, and not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the effect is not necessary; for the arbitrariness of any
one will make the effect such: But this liberty of the Agent
(he speaks of) looks only upon the immediate cause, which
in humane actions is free, and may not be done; yea, very
often the Agent may chuse the contrary: That the first
cause works with all second causes, is as certain as any thing
in the Mathematicks; for there cannot be a second, or a
third, or any number, but it proceeds from a first: And yet
because the first hath an influence upon the rest, it follows
not that they are Cyphers, but each out of that foundation
hath its several operations: So in this, the first cause is <hi>Causa

from it: But they have their several ways and powers of
working; Natural, according to their natural inclination;
Animal, according to the peculiar disposition of those Souls
which inhabit them; only man hath a free nature amongst
bodily things, in that resembling the Great Cause of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
he is the Principle of those actions which he doth as a

or used, and Man is used as a Master, or Owner under God,
of them, a Steward who must give an account of such of
them as come within the sphere of his Dominion. Let any
man tell me, how a man can be capable of commands, if he
were like them necessitated: No man commands Fools, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or Infants; we might account them Fools, or Mad,
who should do it; but, if he would have them act any
thing, he must work upon their predominant passion, as we
would do with Beasts, because there is in them a deficiency
of this high Power, to be Master of their own actions. It
cannot be then, that all those Precepts, Councels, Commands
of God, should be given to him who hath no power to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey:
And from thence we must needs conclude, that they
have a liberty to do, or not to do. But let us follow him.</p>

to judge falsly, so his Will cannot be deceived, in

are free Agents in what they do, and must give an account
of their actions to him, and be judged according to them

for his will, since it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96149:64"/>
then he is necessitated by Gods will,</hi> which is to make no man a
sinner; for although (as he spake) God disposeth all things,
and that disposure must needs be to infinitely good and wise
ends, even the evils and things against his Rules of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yet his disposure orders such men, according to their
evil actions, to suffer, not makes them do evil that they may
suffer. But perhaps he explains this <hi>(For though men may do
many things which God does not command, nor is therefore Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of them.)</hi> Nay, I will tell him more, men may do, and
many men do many things, not only which God hath not
commanded, but which God hath forbidden, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
they shall not do; and surely then he is less Author
of them: But if a man do an act of advise or counsel of
Gods without a Command, yet that Gods Counsel is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of. Now these actions which are against Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
without doubt he is not Author of; if he were, he
could not justly punish them: But I would fain make out his
sense, which is this, he doth not do it by Authority given
by God, but against it; Well then. Gods Authority is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
evil, but his power worketh this evil. So he seems
to affirm in his following words; <hi>(Yet they can have no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
nor appetite to any thing, of which appetite Gods will is
not the cause.)</hi> True indeed, God is the first general cause,
but not the second and particular. The Sun is an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
cause, it shines upon the Earth, Trees, Plants, and is the
cause of their fertility, but diversly, according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Constitutions it concurs with; so doth God, as he is
the first and general cause (meeting with several conditions)
operate severally, to the production of those several effects
which are produced by them, with things necessary, before
he produceth necessary effects. But, as the Suns concourse
doth not determine this thing to this, and that to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
so doth not the general concourse of God determine
this or that appetite to this or that object, in this or that
manner; but when it meets with things so disposed, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
in the production of that effect to which it was so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed;
so that God concurring with free Agents, makes
them no more necessary, then his concurring with necessary
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96149:65"/>
Agents makes them free: It is the same infinite Power of
God which constituted both, and his concurrence destroys
neither in its ordinate working: (I speak not of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
operation, whereby he can and doth controul all
the frame of Nature, when and how he pleaseth, nor doth
Mr. <hi>Hobbs):</hi> Nay, I may say, that God himself being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
free, bounded with no limits, having nothing above,
or about him, which can stop or hinder his Almighty hand
from working, it is much more reasonable to think, that
his concourse should make even necessary Agents free, and
not to be bounded by their natures which he had given
them, rather then that this most free Agent should against
himself make those which he had constituted in a free na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be necessary, because they are by that more like
himself, which every Agent endeavours: Nay, in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
works, he doth often, for the present, shake off
those bonds which his former Donation had confined them
to; so that by his extraordinary concourse, he makes them
cease from their former operations, which by their natures
they were necessitated to do; as the fire not to burn, the
water not to run down its channel, and the like, which are
apparent to every man. So then, though Gods will and
concurrence is a cause of those actions, yet not being a
terminating cause, but concurring with that nature which
he had given them, that concurrence doth not necessitate
that operation which he had given to man, <hi>viz.</hi> freedom
to do, or not to do. But he proves the contrary in his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words, which are these.</p>

consequence can be deduced out of the premises; for if
God endowed man with liberty and free power in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
why should it follow, if God do not necessitate his
actions, that mans will would cross and impede the power
and liberty of God? For the will of God is, that man
should act freely: the free actions therefore are according
to his will, and the necessitation would be contrary to his
will. But, I think, he means, that if mans <hi>free power could
sin against the will of God, then man should be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
and stop his Omnipotency and Liberty.</hi> To understand
this therefore, consider with me, that Gods Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this World, is like that of a King in a Kingdom; he
gives Laws and Rules to the Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

they shall live happily under him; but if not, he will

It is an opposition to the Kings power, that when men
break his Laws, and he shall go about to punish them, they
shall then rebel against him, and oppose the power of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96149:66"/>
County, or of the Kingdom, or that power which he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
up to do Justice upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then indeed his power is
contradicted and impeded. God, whilst men live here
with these natures, hath given Rules, and governs them by
such Laws as he hath appointed them for their good; if
they observe those Laws, happy are they, but he seldom
puts in his Omnipotency to make men do the one or the
other, never to make men break his Laws; he ordinarily
doth not vary the nature of man, or any thing. Men may
and may not keep his Commandments, (I do not now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
of the nature of Grace, or any thing of that kind)
they that do not, shall be punished, as the other blessed;
and then comes in his Omnipotency; if man could resist
or impede that, that were contradicting his power; but
these sins only oppose his concourse which inclines, but not
necessitates a mans nature; so that there is Gods <hi>voluntas
facere &amp; fieri,</hi> his will which we should do; which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for God to oppose; and there is his <hi>voluntas facere,</hi>
to do himself, which it is not possible for man to oppose:
The first appears in this life, the second in the other; nor is
it any contradiction to the Divine Power which hath so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
it, and without which it were impossible for his
Power to joyn with his Justice in punishing Offenders at the
last day; for how can a man justly be punished for what
was not in his power to do otherwise, yea much less can
he punish him in Justice, who makes him commit that fault
which he punisheth, which God must do, if he (with
his co-operation in the act) determines mans power to
that evil which he punisheth, and for which condemneth
him to Hell. Certainly, this is the most abominable impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Doctrine for sinning that ever was read in any Author
that ever writ of this Subject, and the most derogative
from that infinite Essential Goodness that should cause, or
make men do evil; for no more then fire can cool or act
against its nature, no more can God, who is essentially good
(goodness it self) act that which is evil. It is in vain for a
man to say, it is not evil, God doing it; for it is an evil
which God hates and punisheth, and therefore must be evil
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96149:66"/>
in his esteem. I do not now speak of that Language used
by some, Of Gods afflictions working with some men,
which comes not in this discourse to be disputed of; but
that God doth work these sins which he punisheth, this is
abhorrent to the thought of a Religious man. And now, I
must censure Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> not only for ill and false Doctrine,
but for having such a delight in it, as in this place unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to obtrude it, where there was no reason for, nor use
of it; for let any man consider what this hath to do with
liberty of the Subject, which is the Head he undertook to
treat of; the liberty of the Subject is neither more or less
for his linking of his actions to God Almighty; nay, if his
discourse be true, Subjects have as great liberty as Kings, for

having, as I think, digged up his Foundation, and then the
Building must fall; but meeting so many wicked interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Scripture, and so many abominable conclusions in
Divinity intermixed with his Political discourses, I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to proceed with some of them, lest the Reader should
be unhappily seduced, but not prosecute them word by
word, as I have done; but skipping from one hill to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
leaving the lesser work, and Mole-hills, to be censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

the Soveraign Power of Life and Death is either abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished

the power of the Soveraign, and that Authority not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by any Law, which being violated, he should do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly:
(for this sense the sequel of this discourse will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
justifie) and then I say it is a wicked Proposition,
as will appear by the examination of his reasons, which he
enters upon in the following words: <hi>(For it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewn, that nothing the Soveraign Representative can do
to a Subject, on what pretence soever, can properly be called
injustice, or injury):</hi> Yes, he hath shewn it with a nice and
learned distinction, betwixt <hi>Injustice</hi> and <hi>Iniquity;</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, I may justly say they are hardly two words, but
not two things, as I have shew'd. But what doth he mean
by a <hi>Soveraign Representative here?</hi> I think he hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all Soveraigns are Representatives of the people;
What he can mean by this addition of Representative, I
know not; but he explains himself in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96149:67"/>
                     <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>every Subject is Auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Soveraign doth; so that he never wanteth right to anything,
otherwise then as he himself is a Subject of God, and bound
thereby to observe the Laws of Nature.)</hi> The first part I have
spoken to heretofore, and shewed, that every Subject is not
Author of the Soveraigns acts; where, he saith, he hath
shown it: But now I shall go further, and prove, that if
they were Authors of his acts, yet by their Authority he
cannot kill an Innocent justly; which I do thus,—The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cannot authorize him to act any thing, which they
themselves have not just power to do; but the people <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctim,</hi>
or <hi>divisim,</hi> have no just power to take away an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
mans life; therefore they cannot authorize him. The
major is grounded upon that invincible Axiom, No man
gives what he hath not; therefore if they have not that
power, they cannot give it. The minor will be proved
thus;—Before a Commonwealth be instituted, no man
hath just power to take away anothers life, as is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
I, but they may answer, every man hath power over
his own, which every man may yield to the Soveraign

life, he may give his goods, but not his life; God is the
God of life, and hath given no private man Authority to
cut off his own life, and therefore undoubtedly he cannot
give power to another, which he hath not himself. And if
there were no other argument against his popular Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Supreme, this were enough for confutation of it;
for there must be a power of life and death in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
upon the emergency of great iniquities, it cannot
subsist else. And so I pass to the second part of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
which is, <hi>(Otherwise then as he himself is the Subject
of God, and bound thereby to observe the Laws of Nature:)</hi>
There is much folly <hi>(if not wickedness)</hi> in these few words.
First, I say, neither Kings, nor any man, hath right to any
thing, but as they are Gods Subjects: <hi>The earth is the Lords,
and all that is in it;</hi> and to whom he giveth it, they have
right to such pieces, and none else: He is King of Kings,
with a much greater Prerogative then they can have over
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96149:68"/>
their Subjects: They can have no power therefore or right
to act any thing which is not a power delegated from him;
and certainly he can never shew me any power given to
Kings by God to shed innocent blood. Secondly, it is a
strange phrase used by him <hi>(and bound thereby to observe the
Laws of Nature:)</hi> First, because the Law of Nature, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
is to preserve, not to take away life in general; and
concerning Commonwealths, to reward Virtue, and punish
Vice; when this wicked book would have it the Law of
Nature, to kill an Innocent, yea a virtuous person. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
consider <hi>(that being bound, because he is Gods Subject, to
the Law of Nature)</hi> and only that he should not be bound to
Gods positive Laws in Scripture, a distinction which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
makes use of, and therefore may more powerfully be
retorted to him; but he loves not Scripture, and this odious
expression of his is most abominable.</p>

Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> I am perswaded did know how it is with sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
disputed by Divines whether he sacrificed her, or made
a Votary of her. I will embroile my self in no unnecessary
controversies, but will grant all he requires in that dispute,
that he did sacrifice her; what follows then? that he did

                     </gap> justly? certainly no, the actions of bad Kings, yea the
bad actions of good Princes cannot be justifiable precedents for
following ages. The world and the particular men in it are
compounded of good and evill; there is not any man so bad
as hath no good, but that he may be worse; nor any man
so good, but he may be better; he hath some ill actions
falling from him. That is it which I speak of this very
gallant person, <hi>Jephta,</hi> he might have such an ill action
out of a foolish mistaken Zeal, that that rash vow of his
was to be kept; it was a foolish and a rash vow; for (for
my par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) I cannot guesse what he could imagine, what he
could conceive, should come out of his doors which should
be fit for a sacrifice to God; Domestick creatures, as dogs, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
or children, are all of them hated by God for sacrifices.
Calves, Rams, Cows, Goats &amp;c. which are the proper things
for sacrifices, are not domestick inhabitants; but to shed
innocent blood in offering his daughter for a sacrifice was
without doubt most impious; and this is reckoned by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
in <hi>Psalm 106. verse</hi> 38. amongst the abominations
of the Israelites that they shed blood, in their offering up
their Sons and Daughters to Divels. I, but it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that he had vowed it to God. A vow made to do
evil is <hi>ipso facto</hi> void; God never confirmed it; he ought
not to keep it, but to repent for making it; this was to shed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96149:69"/>
innocent blood which was a sacrifice fit for none but the
Divel, from whom the instigation to it proceeded; so that if
<hi>Jephta</hi> did kill her for a sacrifice, he did wickedly. There
is a certain humour in many men, who will be peremptory
in some point of religion that they may seem godly, who value
not much the reality of it: they will keep a rash, or (which
amounts to the same) a not well advised oath, although to sin,
when they will neglect obedience to do righteously; this was
evident in King <hi>Saul,</hi> you may find 1 <hi>Sam. 14. 24.
Saul</hi> curseth any man who should eat any food until eventide;
here was a most rash curse, and the 27. <hi>verse, Johnathan</hi> who
knew nothing of this curse of his Fathers eats a little honey;
in the 44. <hi>verse, Saul</hi> swears again, that he shall surely dye:
what a horrid injustice had this been in <hi>Saul</hi> to slay that
gallant person, a man of so much honour and worth, for
the satisfaction of his rash oath? You shall find in the next
<hi>Chap.</hi> that <hi>Samuel</hi> gave <hi>Saul</hi> a commandment from God
to do execution upon <hi>Amalek,</hi> and then he can in the 9. <hi>verse</hi>
spare <hi>Agag</hi> and the best of their cattle; see the same humour
in both, that which God had prohibited, murther, even
upon his own son, he would have committed, although against
Gods law, because it was agreeing with that religion which
he had instituted for God, to wit his oath; but then upon
the same reason he spared <hi>Agag</hi> when God commanded his
destruction, because it suited better with his phancie that
they should make a glorious sacrifice to God of what they
had taken: and therefore in the 22. <hi>v. Sam.</hi> gives him
this heavy reproof, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings
and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the
Lord? behold to obey is better than sacrifice. When God
hath given laws for mens actions it is a disobedience to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
witty ways of our own which cross them, to spare
what God would have us destroy, and destroy that which
God would have us save. This was the humour of <hi>Sauls</hi>
religion. I dare not censure <hi>Jephta,</hi> he was a person of as
spotless integrity as any I find amongst the <hi>Judges,</hi> unless
<hi>Samuel;</hi> but if he did kill his daughter, I may justly say
it was a most unjust act, and a satisfaction of his fancy in
religion (which imagined what he had sworn <hi>in re illicita,</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:96149:69"/>
must be performed although against Gods law, which forbids kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which in sacrifice required no such thing) but not a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
act; nor can this be a precedent for others, nor a justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of others in doing the like, although a better man
than he be joyned with him, which is <hi>David;</hi> and so I come
to his second instance.</p>

not to do, and such a law which enjoyned such a penalty
for the breach of it. Again he <hi>[And the same holdeth also

more abominable. I, but he hath reason for what he hath

law of nature as being contrary to equitie (as was the killing
of</hi> Uriah <hi>by</hi> David) <hi>yet it was not an injury to</hi> Uriah; <hi>but
to</hi> God. A very fine and delicate distinction, of which I
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96149:70"/>
have spoke before. But now concerning this language, as
it is used here, <hi>though the action</hi> (saith he) <hi>be against the
law of nature, as being contrary to equitie.]</hi> First, Reader,
consider, if he take equity (as many times it is) for a mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or a gentle exposition which moderates the extream rigor
of the law, this surely may be deduced out of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then (saith he) it is against the law of nature, because
against the kind and charitable exposition of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
only; but without question killing an innocent is most
directly contrary to the very letter of the law of nature and
the full sence of it, for although he makes nothing of the
positive law of God in this discourse, yet the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being by all understood to be an illustration or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of that law writ in our hearts (as he himself
seems to allow hereafter) therefore that law being clear,
Thou shalt not kill, and this killing an innocent being
the most detestable of all other, it is most clearly not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the equity but the letter, that is that sence which the
law intends; for the law of nature directs and commands
that vertue and vertuous men should be rewarded and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and vice punished. Thou shalt not kill for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of thy passion, whom the law doth not direct;
but if the law command killing, lest the Common-wealth
be hurt by so wicked a person, lest vice may be nourished,
then the law kills, not thou who art an executioner of the
law. And therefore to kill an innocent is a monstrous
crime, whom no law kills; he gives an instance again,
<hi>as was the killing of</hi> Uriah <hi>by</hi> David, <hi>yet it was not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to</hi> Uriah, <hi>but to God:</hi> yes, the greatest injury could be
done to him. No saith he, <hi>not to</hi> Uriah, <hi>because the right
to do what he pleased was given him by</hi> Uriah <hi>himself.</hi>
Shew that concession or gift from <hi>Vriah</hi> and it will go a
great way to my satisfaction, nay certainly there was never
such a concession from <hi>Uriah</hi> or any Subject, that the King
shall kill him being an innocent. It is not good for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
that any have such a power, because by such
a wicked act the Commonwealth loseth a worthy member
as was <hi>vriah;</hi> but that abominable false foundation of the

only way of instituting a Common-wealth by the popular

but suppose <hi>vriah</hi> yielded such a power, yea if it had been
done by such a consent as he expressed, yet they had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over their own lives; and therefore could not impower
him over them; especially when embodied into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
for his country hath a share in every Subjects
life, and good subjects well-being, by which it is amended
and bettered; so that he must needs do an injury to others
by such an act; for it is wrong and again all justice, that

                     </gap>y; for no other reason
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96149:71"/>
certainly but because it was injustice done to another man.
The law of nature prescribes all, (and nothing but) in justice:
if it be towards God it is called religion, which payes to
God the duty which we owe him, and is set down in the
four first commandements of the Decalogue; but all the
justice which is due to man, is set down in the six latter.
I must then tell him, that that act of Murther in <hi>David</hi>
was not a sin against God, but only out of regard that it
was an injury to man; for, therefore the law of nature
written in mens hearts, and the positive law of God was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, because it was unjust for man to do it; so that
the reason why it was an offence against God, being only,
because it was an injury to man, it must follow that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be an injury to God, but it must likewise be an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to man. I, but (saith he) <hi>it was against God, because
King</hi> David <hi>was Gods subject.</hi> Yet give me leave, although
King <hi>David</hi> was Gods subject, yet it doth not follow that
in murthering his fellow subjects he did no injury to them,
no more than the Kings subjects, officers or Judges under
him may be said in condemning innocent blood to injure
only the King, and not the person whom he so murthered:
it is most evident therefore, that that sin was against both
God and man. But he brings scripture for what he writes:
<hi>which distinction,</hi> David <hi>himself when he repented the fact,
evidently confirmed, saying, To thee only have I sinned.</hi> Which
text you may read <hi>Psalm.</hi> 51. 4. and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nderstand the sence
of it, let us reflect upon the story of this <hi>Psalm,</hi> as it is
recorded, with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. where we may observe,
that after he had committed these hainous sins of adultery
and murther, God sent <hi>Nathan</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> to him, and
he told <hi>David</hi> his own story, under a Parable of a Rich
man, who took a poor mans lamb from him to entertain
his friend with it. This was a picture of <hi>Davids</hi> crime;
was not this injustice? Consider then in the 9. <hi>verse,</hi> where
he acquaints the King with Gods sentence against him, he
doth not lay to his charge only that he had offended God,
but that he had killed <hi>vriah</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> with the sword,
and had taken his wife to be his wife, and had slain him
with the sword of the Children of <hi>Ammon:</hi> so that the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:96149:71"/>
sins of <hi>David</hi> were against men; for though all sin is against
God, even the trespass against men is therefore a sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
against Gods law; yet it is a sin against men, and
therefore prohibited by Gods law because unjust to men.
I speak of all such sins, which are <hi>suâ naturâ</hi> in their own
nature sins, of which kind murther is; then let us look to the
14. <hi>verse</hi> of this <hi>Psalm.</hi> Deliver me from blood-guiltiness O
God. Blood-guiltiness, what is that? Nothing but the guilt
of that sin which he had committed by that murtherous act
of killing <hi>Vriah,</hi> and therefore as a murtherer is guilty of
the crime, untill he is absolved of his Judge, and his only
Judge God Almighty had acquitted him; he untill then
was guilty of blood, of murthering <hi>Vriah.</hi> Well then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
that was an unjust act, let Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> say what
he will or can. But I will do him right, he goes not alone
in this opinion; but hath St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> a person of great
honour both for judgment and integrity, along with him;
and because I will urge this argument to the full, I will
say he was no Court parasite; one who would flatter Kings
into sin, as was evident in that contest he had with the
Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> in which was apparent both an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
<hi>Emperour,</hi> and a pious and zealous Prelate.
This St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> utters some things in his book called
<hi>Apologia David</hi> like Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> where in his tenth Chap.
at the beginning he expounds these words <hi>[tibi soli peccavi]

only to thee, for he was a King, he was held or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
by no laws; because (saith he) Kings are free from
the bonds of laws, neither by any laws are they called to
punishment, being safe by the power of Empire. This a
man would think abundantly full, but yet he never used
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Phrase, to say he did not unjustly. But his
first speech must be understood that he was not with held
by any humane laws: for Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> confesseth that he is
responsable for the breach of divine laws, by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Secondly, that speech of his, that Kings are freed from
the bonds of their faults; that must be understood of such
bonds, as imprisonments, or such punishments which by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
laws are injoyned offenders; and that is clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96149:72"/>
by his last sentence, that they are by no laws called
to punishment, being safe in the power of Empire, that

for them. I could speak more to this, and shew how that

certainly neither he nor any man but Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will say
it was not injustice; it is <hi>suâ naturâ</hi>

the greatest punishment, death, an innocent person. Nor
doth his being a King, make it less injustice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the sence of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> as I guess, but lest any scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might remain from his authority, with any man, who
might mistake his sence, I will therefore weigh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> down the
Scales with the weights of others, his near contemporaries, of
no less honour in Christendom than himself. And the first I
shall present you with, is St. <hi>Basil,</hi> the great, (so he is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
in his <hi>scholia</hi> upon this verse of this <hi>Psalm: Tibi soli
peccavi cùm multis &amp; magnis donis tuis sum positus:</hi> Since I

his wife, but the greatest prevarication was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96149:72"/>
against God himself, who had c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him King, and therefore he rightly added, and done
this evil in thy sight; thus far St. <hi>Basil.</hi> The next which
I shall produce, shall be S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> upon this <hi>Psalm,</hi>
and this verse, and he agrees very much with St. <hi>Basil.</hi>
To thee only have I sinned, Many (saith he) and great
benefits have I received from thee, but I have returned them
with contrary things, for these things which by thy law are
interdicted, I have not doubted to commit: neither doth
he say, that I have not hurt <hi>Uriah,</hi> for he had both hurt
him and his wife, but the greatest iniquity was against
God. Thus far St. <hi>Chrysostum.</hi> Next consider St. <hi>Hierom;
Tibi solùm peccavi,</hi> to thee only have I sinned, for to thee
every man sins when he sins, because thou art only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sin, as the Apostle speaks. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. God is true but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man a lyar; or else <hi>David</hi> saith, I have sinned and
thou only art without sin, as saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> 53.
Who did no sin nor was guile found in his mouth. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
likewise harps upon the same string. To thee only
have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight, what is
this, saith that heavenly man? Had not he adulterated ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wife and slain her husband? Did not all men know
what <hi>David</hi> had done? What is that he saith then, to thee
only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight? (He
answers) because thou only art without sin; he is a just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher
who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th nothing in himself to be punished; he is
a just reprehender who hath nothing in himself to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.
Here you may see how holy and learned men
(living near together about one time with St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
men famous in their generations, and to whom the Church of
Christ owes exceeding much for the propagation of the Gospel)
gave their sense of this text of scripture as well as he; and St.
<hi>Augustin</hi> was one who honoured St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> living and
dead: yet you see varies from him in his judgment in this
point. Give me leave to shew my sense of these words and
then conclude. And first I will allow <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his
reading, <hi>to thee,</hi> which is not according to our translation,
which is <hi>against thee;</hi> and certainly by men learned in the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> both amongst the ancient and modern writers, with

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is acknowledged to be true; yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
his cause nothing to read it as he doth; insomuch that
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Comment upon this <hi>Psalm,</hi> saith, To thee only
have I sinned, he doth not say, against thee only; he had
offended against <hi>vriah,</hi> against <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> he had scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
the people; but to thee only, as Judge, and none
else can judge and condemn me, as he illustrates it. So that
although Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> varies from his own rule of scripture, yet
he gets nothing to his cause by it. But to proceed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding;
I ask leave and beg pardon of such eminent men
from whom I may seem to differ; for my part, I do not
think that <hi>David</hi> here acts the part of a King, or so much
as thinks of his great Regality (if he did, it was to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
not to extenuate his sin) but of a penitent; and
in his penitence is a pattern to other men, as well as Kings,
how they should demean themselves; even Kings in those
duties are reconciling themselves to their King, in respect of
whom they are poor and mean people; and if they should
consider themselves Kings, they should by this increase their
humility, considering that he who o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es so much to God should
be so ungrateful and unmindful of him, The Prophet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now considering his offence to God cryes out. To thee
only have I sinned; before, <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet had visited
him, and told him of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aults, he thought he had sinned
only to man, and therefore to hide his first sin with <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba,</hi>
he added another of murther, by which he thought
his shame of the other might be hid from men, which was
possible; but now clean contrary when he is acquainted with
the wrath of God for his sin, now he cares not for his
sin to men, so he may be right with God, and to that
end penned this <hi>Psalm,</hi> to be sung in Churches; and to
God utters those lamentable complaints; that he is besmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with blood; that his bones are broken; that he hath
need of Gods great and many mercies; that his heart is
broke, yea contrite; that he is all unclean and must be
washed, and washed again; that he begs God to purge and
make him clean, although with hysop and sharp medicines.
Here is the perfect character of a true penitent; many a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>an is sorry for his sin, because it breeds him shame and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96149:73"/>
wordly evil; but this doth him no good: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut King <hi>David</hi>
is grieved for sin because sin; because against Gods law which
he hath transgressed; he car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s not what this world thinks
of him, so God be appeased and reconciled to him; and
therefore that this may be done, he only begs his pardon
and thinks only of him, To thee only &amp;c. do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hou acquit me,
I care for nothing else. And surely, this is the most certain
test of a true repentance, when a man grieves that he hath
offended God, and values nothing but that offence; not that
<hi>Bathsheba</hi> was a woman which he injured, but that
he took the members of God and made them the
members of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Hittite</hi> with the sword of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> as it was expressed
in the 9. <hi>verse,</hi> therefore the sword shall never depart from
thy house: then for his sin with <hi>Bathsheba, verse</hi> 11. and
12. I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them to
thy neighbour, and he shall lye with them in the sight of
the sun, for thou didst it secretly, but I will do this thing
before all Israel, and before the sun. Then, because by this
deed he had given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord
to blaspheme, his child by her was adjudged to death, as
it is in the 14. <hi>verse.</hi> So that it is evident by his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that he sinned against men; and it is a most vain
thing to collect from hence that a King can do no injustice
to his subjects, for certainly it is injustice in a King to but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher

save, how much more his own subjects which he is bound to

is this? that he who had before affirmed, that man
by nature had right to any goods, any life, any thing which
conduced to his own contented life before a Common-wealth
was instituted, hath now, by these words which institute and
give form and being to his doctrine of a Common-wealth;
these, not liberties only, but licenses, but abominations
must not be abridged or restrained. But mark his reason—<hi>for</hi>
(saith he) <hi>by allowing him to kill me, I am not bound to kill
my self when he commands me.</hi> So that it seems, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing
he speaks of is of the supremes actions, not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
and then surely his former proposition is not good,
<hi>men are restrained by nothing of the Soveraign commands,
where his own interest is personally opposed to it.</hi> If this be
not insufferable doctrine in any well governed Common-wealth,
I know not what is: for by this any man may act
any thing which may conduce to his contented living; nay,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96149:76"/>
what is more, he hath right to do it: and if so, what a
condition would a Common-wealth be in? a King accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his doctrine may without injustice kill any man which
he thinks fit, and a subject hath right to kill him when he
thinks it conduceth to his good; for naturally every man hath
this right by his doctrine, and so cannot be supposed by any
contract to part from his natural right; all this is evident
out of the beginning of the 14. Chap. where he defines the
right of nature thus, <hi>The right of nature, which writers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call</hi> jus naturale, <hi>is the liberty each man hath to use his
own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his
own nature; that is to say of his own life; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of doing any thing which in his own judgement, and reason,
he shall conceive to be the aptest means to conduce thereto.</hi>
And there is much more to this purpose, of which I have
already treated in my notes upon that Chap. So that it is
clear by his doctrine, That the constitution of a Common-wealth
enables the Soveraign to act nothing by right, more
than another man, because that constitution doth not restrain
the right of nature, and the right of nature impowers every man
to act any thing which shall appear to him for his particular
advantage, by his Book. I shall treat no more of this now.</p>

                  <p>I Will step to the next paragraph; but first consider that
in the beginning of this I last discoursed about, he saith,
<hi>The consent of a subject to soveraigne power is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in these words, [I authorise, and take upon me all his

and consequently the obligation a man may sometimes
have, (upon the command of the Soveraign) to execute
any dangerous or dishonourable affair, dependeth not upon
the words of our submission, but on the intention, which is
to be understood by the end thereof. Mark, Reader, how
immediately he contradicts himself, first his <hi>consent is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in these words</hi> &amp;c. Secondly it is not contained in
the words but <hi>in the intention which is to be understood by
the end thereof.</hi> He indeed put them both together in the
preceding page towards the bottom of that page, and there
you may find him telling what the end is, <hi>Namely
the peace of the subjects within themselves and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against a common enemy.</hi> Now then since he gives
the subject this latitude of interpreting the commands
of his soveraign, it is not credible that he will judge his
own ruine or hurt, or that of his Father, Wife, Children,
dear Friends shall conduce to the peace of the subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               <p>I Wish my self at an end of this, but his gross errors
make me stop at more particulars than I intended. Look
down towards the conclusion of this page you shall find
that at the beginning of that paragraph he concluded it unjust
in the defence of another man to resist the sword of the
Common-wealth. But (saith he) <hi>in case a great many
men together have already resisted the soveraign power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly,

Certainly they have; for they but defend their lives,
which the guilty may as well do, as the innocent.</hi> Let
the Reader consider here what a justification this was of
those men who bore unjust armes at that time when he writ
this book in English. It is true he allows the first rising
to be unjust, but all that damnable prosecution of that war,
even that act which I never think upon but with horror,
the murther of king <hi>Charles</hi> the first was lawful by him,
for when they had drawn their swords in rebellion, their
lives were forfeited, and then all the future prosecution was
just because in defence of their lives. I but page. 113.
(where I am at the bottom of that paragraph) he gives a
fair pretence for what he speaks: which is, <hi>The offer of
pardon taketh from them to whom it is offered, the plea of
felf defence, and maketh their perseverance in assisting,
or defending the rest, unlawful.</hi> A goodly piece of nicetie! I

have answered, that that cannot serve them, as long as
there is power in the offended partie to make his revenge,

take away that, there is no security for them. These

with this animadversion. And now I pass over twenty more,

from natural laws, <hi>that the one are eternal</hi> (I will cavil at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
<hi>that is, he means, always consisting with men to
whom they are given; the other had a beginning; the one
are universal to all men that have humane nature;</hi> but (he

                        </gap>th authorised to declare them. But</hi> (saith he) <hi>this
authority of man to declare what be these positive laws of
God how can it be known? God may command a man by a
supernatural way, to deliver laws to other men. But because
it is of the essence of laws, that he who is to be obliged, be
assured of the authority of him that declareth it, which we
cannot naturally take notice to be from God.</hi> I transcribe
all this, because the reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by it should understand from
what ground he raiseth two questions, which he answering
unchristianly, will require a better satisfaction from my
pen. The questions are these. <hi>How can a man without
supernatural revelation be assured of the revelation received
by the declarer? and how can he be bound to obey them?</hi>
Two noble questions to be disputed against heathens, and
because upon all occasions he takes advantage to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
seem such, <hi>(whether he be or no, God knows)</hi> I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to refute him; But withall give the reader this cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that throughout his Book he violently forceth himself
to such disputes as may render Christian religion suspected,
as if he had an ambition to make this, Bable shall I say,
or impious treatise of his, to be authentick; for what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
had he here to raise those doubts? It had been enough
for him and his whole design to shew that the holy Bible
had manifested those positive laws to us, and never to have
raised such scruples whereby a man may doubt (as it seems
he doth) whether these laws are divine or not. Consider
therefore his answer for the first question, <hi>how a man can
be assured of the revelation of another, without a revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
particularly to himself, it is evidently impossible;</hi> and I
answer it is possiible; we will try it out; and first let us
consider this leading term for this discourse, which is <hi>[assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted]
how a man can be assured;</hi> the power of that word
must be explained. There is a diversity of assurances, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96149:78"/>
physical, moral, all which have their several force,
and differ only by degrees. In the first kind we are assured
that two and two make four; and the like; in the second that
fire will burn, whose nature doth (if not hindred) break out
into the act; in the third that when I see a debauched man stay
with a company of drunkards along time at a Tavern I can
be assured that they will be inflamed with drink; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
when a pious man hears the bell tole to prayers, he
will go to Church. Thus our assurance is va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the object which it is busied about. But there is
another diversity drawn from the difference of this act,
which produceth assurance; as thus, there is an assurance
from science, from opinion, from faith. The certainty of
science is drawn from the certainty of the medium by which
it is proved, and is exceeding great; by some esteemed
greater than that of faith; at the least of a greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
although for my part I am not of that mind; for
it being a most clear and absolute truth that God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<hi>verax</hi> as well as <hi>verus,</hi> true speaking, as well as
true being, and faith (I mean divine faith) being an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion
to what God speaks, it is not possible to be a falsehood,
&amp; then there is the greatest argumentative evidence that can be
of the truth of such a proposition which God hath delivered:
but I will not involve my self in niceties. That which is proper
to my immediate discourse is, that science is, from natural op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
of natur I causes; faith (divine faith) from supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
from God; which must be more certain in it self, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y faith
made more certain to us; opinion is only probable, which
may be other; and this probability either relates to science,
as it is probable such causes will produce such effects, or such
effects proceed; from such causes or else it relates to
faith, and it is then, when a good honest man speaks any
thing, it is by faith probable to be true; but yet it may
be otherwise; only divine faith admitts of no falsehood in
its self, and requires no doubting or hesitation in us. Now
although this assurance of opinion and probability be the
least, yet it yields us such an assurance, as we build the
greatest moral and politick actions (which are practised
amongst us) upon it. As when a man is dead, his hand
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96149:79"/>
and seale p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sseth away his estate; witnesses are dead likewise;
these are probable arguments only; but being the greatest
that the subject question can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the greatest matters
must be regulated by such probable arguments. I can say
the like of oathes, they have neither a Physical certainty,
nor do they produce a divine faith; but yet when we have
hand and seal, and Oath, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will not say I think,
that we have no assurance. How then can he say that we have
no assurance that these are divine revelations, which are
delivered in the Bible? (for that is the sence of the question
which he proposeth) but that we have great assurance is
that which I affirm. I shall not here meddle with School
nicetyes, nor with any thing about infused faith, but only
the acquired faith, which we have of these truths. Many
learned men have debated this question with great variety
of Learning, which may be perused in their Comments
upon the 3. of the sentences <hi>Dist.</hi> 24. as likewise many times
in <hi>Prolog.</hi> and 22. of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> question, 1. as also in <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>undae,</hi> with many particular treatises to that purpose. I turn the reader to these places which with ease he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use, and find amongst them, what he reads not with me,
who intend to deliver such things here, as they have scarce
touched upon. My arguments shall be drawn, first from
the things delivered in this book; Then from the manner
of the delivery, and Thirdly from the persons who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
these things; in all which I shall not meddle with
those particular Books, or Chapters of Books which are
controverted betwixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> I think
it incomparably handled by my much honoured and truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Brother <hi>Iohn Lord</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham;</hi> but my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
is to shew that the bulke of Christianity and our faith
is delivered in such a manner, in respect of the things
delivered, of the manner of the delivery, and of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who delivered them, that it is most rational for a
man to assure himself that these were divine revelations, if
it be not absolutely impossible that they should be other.
I will begin with the things delivered; and first with the
beginning of the Bible, the first book of <hi>Moses,</hi> the 1.
Chap. of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where we find the Creation so delivered,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96149:79"/>
as it was not possible for man to do it without revelation.
Men might, and men have by reason (even Philosophers)
guessed and proved that the world was created; but to say
when, and set it down in such a method, as that a man may
find the year in which it was done, this was never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by any, nor could any man do it, but by divine
revelation. Yet you may think, that <hi>Adam</hi> being made a
perfect man, might know the instant when he first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the world, and communicate that to <hi>Seth,</hi> and he
downward: but could <hi>Adam,</hi> without revelation, know, that
he was made of earth? Nay could <hi>Adam,</hi> without reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
know, how <hi>Evah</hi> was taken out of him, or all
the works of God which were wrought in the 6. dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was made? this could not be, this story of the
Creation must need be a revelation, no man of himself could
search it out. But I am afraid Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will say, it is
false; no Christian ever said it was so, but I suppose my self
to have to do with an heathen, not an <hi>Atheist</hi> but a <hi>Theist</hi>
at the best. Well then, it is most reasonable for any man
to think, this story to be true; because it is rational for a
man to think, that since God will and must be worshipped
by men, and it is impossible for men to know, what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is proper to be given him, unless he tells them; It is
then most reasonable for a man to think, that God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
how that worship is to be performed, and therefore
caused this whole book to be writ for mens instruction;
and in it sets down this work of his creation, to shew man
the foundation of all his duty, from whence it is derived,
that he owes God his being, soul, and Body; that he should
be humble, who was taken out of the dust, and to dust he
must return, that he that made him can destroy him, and the
like; which God being pretended to do no where else, it is
most reasonable to think it is done here.</p>

and that it should be about that time; but that it should
happen now, and that this should be the Virgin which
should be the mother of our Saviour, that none could tell
but by revelation, no not she her self, It is true, when
she found her self with child, she might wonder how that
should come about, since she knew not man; as she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the Angel who foretold it to her <hi>Luke the 1. and
the</hi> 24. but that it should be so contrived and perfected
as it was by the overshadowing of the Highest, this she
could not have known, but by a revelation. But I doubt
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will answer this was not so, his wicked wit seems
to imagine such a thing, I will prove it the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Well then, he was so conceived as is taught; and this could not
be taught but by divine revelation, therefore he who taught it
had divine revelation. I must not spend time in particulars;
look upon all the Prophecies in the whole Book of God,
so many, as their time is expired, we find them all fufilled;
the Prophecies made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the children of <hi>Israels</hi>
long captivity in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and their extraction thence, and
plantation in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> of all the great transactions of
the highest affairs of the world; The erection and destruction
of all the great Monarchies which were punctually fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
and accomplished, and foretold long before; could these
be foretold by any other way than by divine revelation? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it could not be; nor can the wit of man think how it
should be done. <hi>Jaddus</hi> the high Priest shewed <hi>Alexander</hi> his
own story foretold by <hi>Daniel.</hi> Let us consider how the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
long before prophesied of Christ, how the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
writ like an antedated Evangelist, differing only in these words
[shall and did] only in the time. Let us consider, how not
only those great and remarkable passges, of his birth, his
miracles, his death, his resurrection, (but even such little things
as the piercing of his side, the parting of his garment, &amp; casting
lots for his vesture, his burial, were foretold hundreds of yeares
before. Let Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> or any other heathen tell me how these
could be foretold without divine revelation. But perhaps he
will say, as before, these were not true books nor prophecies,
but fained since Christianity. No, even the Jewes themselves
yet remaining in the world do consent unto them, and are
preserved by God, a glorious witness of these truths, who are
the greatest enemies of Christianity.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The former assertion further proved from the piety of the

                     </gap>s, and excellency of the
matter contained in them. The power of the word of God,
and efficacy of Scripture above the reach of Philoophie.</head>
                  <p>BUt then consider the doctrines taught here, they are so full
of religious piety to God, so full of such excellent
moral conversation betwixt men, that the wit of man could
not invent them, there must needs be divine revelation in them;
there was never any thing delivered by men, meer men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
divine revelation, that had not imperfections in it; he who
reads the Philosophers may find it. I do not love to rake
their Dunghills, and shew their filth; but the duties taught
in this book are so divine, and so like God, from whence they
came, that they are able to make a man absolutely good if
practised. Wherefore as a tree may be known by its fruits,
as the heart of man by his language; so these Books may be
known to be Gods by the heavenliness of the matters delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in them; which have such a power of sanctity in them,
as is able to make such as receive them of a more Godly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
than other men; yea than themselves, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times, before they received these doctrines. I could
treat of a strange Metamorphosis in <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> who was
a persecutor, a destroyer, and when converted with this
doctrine accounted it joy to suffer and be persecuted for this
cause. As also of King <hi>David,</hi> who to hide the shame of
his adultery, committed Murther, and slept securely
in his sin; yet when awakened from that stupidity he was in,
and taught his state by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> he cares for no
shame of this world, so God be pleased, cares for nothing
but the shame of his sin, and made his penitence for it to be
chaunted out in all ages, for all Churches in the 51. <hi>Psalm.</hi>
Se that there is a strange power and force in the word of God
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96149:81"/>
to turn men to godliness, which no other hath; And the
great and mighty effects wrought by this scripture, do fully
evince it to be divine, having divine power annexed to them.
Thus having shewed that the doctrines contained in scripture
are fit for a man to believe they are divine, and by divine
revelation, yea that they could not proceed from a pen which
was not guided and assisted by the holy spirit, we therefore
may have assurance that they were such. I shall come next
to shew how we may be further assured from the manner of
their delivery.</p>

SECT. IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">The second Argument from the difference of the Style
of the Scriptures from the books of Philosophers. The
propositions and conclusions in Scripture not so much
deduced from reason, as asserted from the Majesty
of God, not disputing or endeavouring to perswade,
but commanding to do. The rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
proposed in scripture of eternal truth, impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be propounded, or given but by God himself.</head>
                  <p>LEt a man look upon all the doctrines of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
concerning God, his essence, his attributes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Creation, we shall find that they laboured
still to prove what they spoke, and by reason to convince
mans understanding. Only I must confess, <hi>Trismegistus</hi> in
his Pomander makes his discourse which is most divine
to be revelation (and four ought I know it may be so, much
of it) but otherwise they all go upon ratiocination; and the
reason is, because such things ought not to be assented
to which are not either proved or revealed by God, which
is the most invincible evidence that any truth can have. But
now <hi>Moses</hi> and those holy writers inspired by God in their
compiling those holy Books only affirm this, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96149:82"/>
arguing the reasons of it, because they were divine, not
humane words; likewise in all those moral duties, which
concern men, they are writ with the majesty of the King
of Kings and Lord of Lords, Do this or this, not disputing,
as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> how it conduceth to the present
happiness, but exacting obedience. It is true when the
Prophets disputed with the Gentiles, or Apostles with Jewes
or Gentiles who believed not their report, they confuted the
one by reason, or out of their own authors, and the other
out of the former Scriptures; because all proofs must be
made <hi>ex concessis,</hi> and out of such premisses they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
these Conclusions. God exacted a belief, and this
he doth with the greatest arguments and most forcing that
are possible, by <hi>Praemium</hi> and <hi>Poena</hi> reward and punishment;
but such as never King or Emperour either did or was able
to propose, by eternal happiness or misery; which nothing
can doe but God alone. And this is done to those who will
receive, or not receive his word. Well, the words contained
here are delivered with such an exaction as never man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the same truths in; and required with such promises,
as never man did meet with nor could perform; we must
needs therefore be assured they are divine.</p>

us, who will give us as full assurance as any thing else of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96149:82"/>
the certainty. The persons were of most eminent integrity,
and affirmed that these writings were delivered them from God.
I will begin with the first <hi>Moses</hi> a man who approved his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with God, and Gods approbation of him by most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
signs; first by those mighty wonders which he wrought in
<hi>Aegypt</hi> before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp; upon him and his in their journey;
afterwards by his wonderful conduct of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi>
through the wilderness, the like of which was never known;
The bringing water out of the rock, feeding that mighty Host
with bread and flesh; the miraculous stopping the mouths of
<hi>Korah,</hi> &amp;c. why should we imagine that this man should lye,
and say, he received this law from God, when he did not?
Yes, to make himself King among them. Indeed the rebells
(last spoke of) did object that, but God confuted it by a
miraculous destroying them, and we see although whilst he
lived he went betwixt God and them, delivering prayers to
God for them, and bringing Gods will to them, yet we
find not that he acquired any high matters for himself; the
Priesthood which was to be a perpetual dignity he put <hi>Aaron</hi>
into; the Politique government he bequeath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and we do not find him contriving more than an ordinary
proportion for his Children, which shews that he had no self
end in any thing he did. Nay we may read in the 32. of
<hi>Exodus,</hi> 10. when <hi>Moses</hi> interceded with God for favour to
the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> God made him answer, <hi>let me alone that

them, and I will make of thee a great Nation;</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
<hi>Moses</hi> was not bribed with this for his own interest to
forsake Gods glory: but presently after presseth God for his
own honour to have pitty upon the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as you may read
<hi>vers.</hi> 11. &amp;c. where methinks he did like <hi>Abraham</hi> offer his
whole posterity to Gods glory and honour; which sheweth
that <hi>Moses</hi> had no <hi>sinister</hi> ends in his actions, but only the
glory of God; which certainly could not rise out of such a

there were none.</p>

                  <p>IF we descend to the Apostles we shall find they were a sort
of men of mean extraction and education; how could it
be possible that they unless by revelation, should attain to
such an efficacy of preaching, as to be able to convince the
whole world, and preach this divine Philosophy? How came
they by the power of Tongues to be able to travel through the
world, and preach to every man in his own language,
but by the supernatural assistance of the Holy Ghost? Why
would they undertake the work through such cruel persecutions
foretold them, that they should be as sheep amongst wolves,
but that it was a duty enjoyned them from the Holy Ghost?
and they were sure that he who promised it, would make good
their reward in heaven hereafter, for here they were to have
miseries. Truly I know not what can be opposed against
this, but that both from the matters delivered, rom the manner
that they are delivered by, and from the persons who delivered
them, we have as great an assurance that these truths were

encrease and continuance of it in despite of persecution.
The Scriptures not possible to be written by bad men, in
regard their design is to destroy the Kingdom of Satan.
Good men would not obtrude a Lye upon the world.
Faith resolved into divine revelation. The rest is a
preparation to this faith, and conclusion of this point.</head>
                  <p>LEt Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> tell me, what assurance he hath of any
thing? He saith in the beginning of this Book that
he is <hi>Thomas Hobbs</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury;</hi> I think he is as
sure of this as of any thing; but I am much surer, and
so may any man be, that this Scripture was writ by divine
revelation, than he can be of that; first for his place, that
he was of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> which is a town in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> where
Christianity is professed, where men are assured of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that they are by divine revelation, How should it breed
such a monster, who would bring all their hopes of heaven,
their faith in Gods promises to be dubious? as if they were
not promised. But he is <hi>Thomas Hobbs,</hi> how knows he that?
perhaps his mother told him so, and the midwife; I know not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96149:84"/>
whether after he came to the years of discretion, he ever
talked with them; but if he did, it is but a weak Testimony
in respect of ours which was and is affirmed by such divine and
incomparable persons as the Apostles and Prophets were. His
Mother, and the Midwife, although true persons, yet were apt
to be deceived, and it may be he was a supposititious Child;
how oft have such things been done? when contrariwise these
men who have delivered infalible truths many ages before they
came to pass, cannot be conceived to have any Error. I, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,

fully expressed these divine perfections, unless it was his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
word. I, but his Christening is registred in the Church
Book of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> a good legal evidence; and perhaps he
enjoyed his fathers estate by this; I know not, but certainly
there is a possibility of Error in it, because the Church Book
may be counte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(may I say) or ingraven in these volumes which have been
attested in every age since the first writing with the Blood of
many martyrs; which can be affirmed of no Church Book
in the world; worms and Cankers may eat them, and thieves
may break through and steal them and counterfeit them, but
these are subject to no corruption, but by the providence of
God have been, and will be preserved so long as the world
stands, and endures. So I think evidently that it appears that
we have as full an assurance that these Scriptures are Divine,
as men can have of any thing in this world which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by hear-say. Nay let us go further, &amp; examine whether we
have not a Demonstration from the effect to the cause, we know
such a man was our friend by his voice when he speaks, another
by his style, as the report is of Sr. <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> with <hi>Erasmus,

with one word; The Scriptures must be writ by good or ill

hath said this, or that; this is but a preparation for that

last resolution of that faith because such a man speaks it:
but before this I must be prepared for this, with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance

introduction of that Act of faith in him; but faith in
him is the foundation of my belief in that sentence, it
is evidently so in this Case, we believe these divine truths
absolutely, and the last resolution of them is into this,
that God hath revealed them; but yet it may be enquired,
whether these Arguments be necessary to our assent to these
divine principles, or not. Certainly to a man who should
be converted from Paganisme, <hi>Vt prudenter credat,</hi> that he
be not carryed about with winds of Doctrine, it is fit, he
should have these or some other equivalent Arguments to
induce him to them: But to a man born in the Church,
and bred up in the Christian religion, it is comfortable to
his faith when he finds it attended with such invincible
reasons, and he is able to understand them; But if not,
simplicity of faith and obedience to God will be blessed
by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It will not be expected that I should engage in
more niceties of this kind. I hope it appears that we have
assurance of these divine revelations. It was therefore not
only a bold, but impious and wicked affirmation of him to
say it is <hi>evidently impossible for a man to be assured of the
revelation to another without a revelation particularly made
to himself.</hi> But he proceeds to answer some seeming proofes
brought to affirm the assurance of these revelations, I will
put them down in order and examine his answer. The first is
drawn from miracles and is thus set down in the place last cited.</p>

planting of the Church; which is enough for proof of this
Conclusion, that the Miracles wrought by our Saviour and
his Apostles here, were such Arguments as did enforce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of what they spake. I could expatiate in this noble
Theme of Miracles, and fall upon divers most Scholastick
discourses; but I rather chuse to apply my self close to him
who answers, <hi>[That what is wonderful to one may not be so
to another.]</hi> The force of which answer lies in this, (That
there may be many counterfeit Miracles, which may appear
true to one and may be found false by another; and therefore
because men may be deceived they have no assurance from
them. To this I can say that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is not so good a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician
here as the Devil; for the Devil disputed from the
real force of the Argument, but Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> draws his Answer
from the apprehension of the Heater or Spectator; when it
thunders man a man is busie &amp; hears it not, Doth it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thunder, because he doth not hear it? The Sun ariseth and
shineth out in the morning when I am in bed and see it not,
Doth it therefore not shine because I discern it not? When a
man who hath weak Eys or troubled with the Jaundice comes
into a Room, many colours are there which he perceives
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96149:87"/>
not; or if he do, they appear yellow to his Eyes, Are they
therefore yellow? But this and no other is his consequence
against Miracles, because some apprehend them not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are not, or do not send out that proof which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
flows from them. Many fallacious Arguments are
used<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (He hath used many,) and because they are fallacies,
Are therefore perfect Demonstrations not good? His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
therefore is not Logical in saying that these things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
marvellous to one, which do not to another. Let a
man consider the possibility, or rather impossibility which
Nature hath to do such a work, and if he be not learned
enough to discuss with a Cause, let him consult with Learned
men who are able to judge of it, and he shall by that find
whether God hath in an extraordinary manner any hand in
it or no; but the Answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he makes may be returned

who delivered these Revelations, and affirmed they
were such, it is not probable they should be counterfeited;
all counterfeiting is for some end, some wordly end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for

what they did, the asserting of these Revelations being
the ready way to miseries and unhappiness, which was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
by their great Master, our most blessed Saviour. We
have seen in this distracted world in which we have lived,
now and then a man proud with an imagined Enthusiasme,
persevere in an abominable lye even to death: but for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to do it, and suffer for the relation of the same story, it
cannot be imagined. And then consider that they were men
blessed by God, in having these Revelations, and the relating
them: I say <hi>relating them:</hi> for because the Doctrine was to
be divulged to all Nations by them, God assisted them with
the gift of Tongues, by which they were able suddenly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
in their own Language to every Nation the wonderful
things which concerned their salvation; And from hence
I will draw the impossibility of their feigning their san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
in the delivery of these Revelations; for as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
was from God, so the very delivery of them

by the power of Tongues, was from God, who cannot

their might be a possibility of being other, (I grant
that for Arguments sake which I allow not) yet when there
is no probability of the contrary, we have great assurance of
that truth, and his answer is most wicked, as well as weak

the Apostles.</p>

                     </gap>r if clear, he speaks very weakly. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
for although the Law of Nature do oblige, yet it is
not apparent to every man, what this Law of Nature is; no
not to learned men; for in many cases it is disputed, vvhether
such or such actions are according to the Lavv of Nature or
no; And therefore although the major proposition be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
true, that the Lavv of Nature is instituted by
God, yet the assuming of a Minor to it, [this is the Lavv
of Nature] may be full of dispute, and from thence it vvill
be hard to conclude. Again consider, that vvhen the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

bound to obey them, of vvhich he affirmed that vve could
have no assurance, and that I have immediately before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed:
but novv his vvhole discourse runs upon mans obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to humane Lavvs. Thus the Notion and Conceipt
shuffled and changed, a Reader is distracted, and vvhilst he
finds something seemingly proved, he thinks the undertaken
proposition is clear: for vvhere hath he satisfied, yea but seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
this Question, <hi>How a man can be bound to obey the
Revelations? But</hi> (saith he) <hi>if he undertake to obey a Law
which is not against the Law of Nature, he is bound by his

thinks) he instituted a supreme, and that Act only reflects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
humane Lavvs established by the supreme vvhich he insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.
But I do not finde this expressed there in that lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
he novv formes it, but rather I thought that he vvould
have supposed that the supreme should be obeyed in such
things cross not the Lavv of God vvhatsoever, either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or positive, but it seems novv he must be obeyed in
all vvhich is not against the Lavv of Nature onely; he
vvould have the Scriptures and positive Lavvs laid aside. By
this if a King shall command us not to be baptized, not to

receive the Communion, or, like <hi>Darius</hi> not to pray to
God, for a certain time, not to repent <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (vvhich are not
acts of the Lavv of Nature, but positive Lavvs) vve should
not doe them, vvhich must needs be most odious to any
Christian man. But indeed had not Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> distinguished
these tvvo the positive, and natural Lavvs of God before in
the former page, and raised these doubts, to disgrace the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
laws of God, I could have answered that there is no
Law more Natural, than that we should obey the positive
Laws of God; for he being the supreme power, must needs
have that authority to make Laws for the government of
men; and this is universally received. All Nations in the
World pretend to have divine Laws for their direction, I

                  <head type="sub">Obedience founded upon the belief, or acknowledgment of
his power that commands. Mr. Hobbs his complacency
in quarrelling with Religion. The want of reason in his
proofs discovered, and censured. Faith commanded by
God, urged by promissory and penal Laws. The dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                     <hi>HE is bound,</hi> saith he, <hi>to obey it but not bound to believe it.</hi> A
strange proposition: for take his particle [<hi>i</hi>] how you
please, for obedience to divine or humane Laws, he can be
bound to obey none, when he hath no belief: for he cannot
have an obligation to divine Laws, unless he believe they are
given by God, nor can he perform obedience to humane
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96149:90"/>
Laws, unless he have a belief that they are made by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
power. So that obedience in all kinds supposeth a
belief of that authority which commands. But again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
what he means by this word, belief, <hi>He is bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
but not to believe.</hi> Certainly (as I said,) he must believe
the authority that commands, and 'tis as true, that he must
believe that that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thority commands this Act, or else he
can have no ground for his obedience. This man had a
mind to be quarrelling at Religion, but could not find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
to do it. But he proves his conclusion, for (saith
he) <hi>Mens belief, and interiour cogitations, are not subject
to the commands, but only to the operation of God, ordinary, or
extraordinary.</hi> The vainest and weakest Argument that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was urged. First, in Logick it cannot follow; because
they are subject to the operations of God, they therefore
are not subject to commands, as Charity, and all the restraint
of exorbitant lusts are subject to his operations, are they
not therefore subject to commands? This is a pitiful infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
but then consider further; that faith, and the cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men are commanded by God, that faith is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
first, <hi>Heb. 11. 6. Without faith it is impossible to
please God; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,
and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him.</hi>
Now it is necessary that he who requires us to come, must
in that exaction require such things as are necessary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it; and therefore faith without which Heaven cannot be
attained. And God hath given a blessed promissory Law
that he will bless such as do believe; and penal also, that he
will punish such as do not believe. For the first, <hi>John 3.
15, 16. Whosoever believeth in him,</hi> (that is in Christ)
<hi>should not perish but have eternal life.</hi> The same is added in
<hi>the 16 verse. God so loved the World, that he gave his only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
but have everlasting life.</hi> Here is a Law made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happiness, an eternal Law concerning an eternal life, all
terms indefinite. The same is repeated in the 18 <hi>verse</hi> of
the same Chap. but with the addition of the penal Law, <hi>He
that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> As likewse our

                     </gap>e words and tremble, <hi>Condemned, Damned,
Destroyed</hi> who believes not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What shall such be who
have not only this privative infidelity, but a positive,
which opposeth and disturbs the faith of such as do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
with foolish and unnecessary Arguments? Faith is
commanded and exacted by God, upon a dreadful penalty.
So likewise <hi>John 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23. This is his commandement that we
should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> There
in express terms, this belief is commanded: and as I have
shewed, obedience could not be given to other Laws, if
faith did not preceed, which is the first step towards Heaven.
I need not speak of other cogitations of the Heart, as
Pride, Self-conceitedness, Covetous, desiring others goods,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all prohibited by God, and he will punish them.
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> was therefore to blame very much in saying that
faith and the interiour cogitations are not subject to Gods
commands; had they been humane Laws of which he spoke it
had been somewhat to the purpose: men cannot know, and
therefore cannot punish the interiour cogitations, and so
not make Laws for them; but God knows and searcheth the
heart and reins, and will punish them, and therefore it is fit
for him to give commands concerning them.</p>

where I shewed that other vertues which cannot be

God, who worketh both to will and to doe; who creates
and preserves: and although he gives the will, yet if he

                     </gap>ing because he cooperates in the performance. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
with the same proposition, in other terms, and I will
follow him. <hi>Faith of supernatural Law</hi> (saith he) <hi>is not a
fulfilling, but only an assenting to the same.</hi> Faith of that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Law (which concerns Faith) must needs be a
fulfilling of it, (if it be such as is according to the Law
of Faith, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> phraseth it <hi>Rom. 3. 27) But only</hi>
(saith he) <hi>an assenting to it.</hi> What if it be but only an
assenting to it, (yet I can shew other operations of faith
besides that) yet if that assenting be the act which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
in his command of faith, faith is the fulfilling of
that Law which exacts it. And yet give me leave to add
one note more, Although faith were a meer act of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
an assent as he terms it) yet because this assent
is impeded by many vices in the Soul, which untill they are
mastered, the Soul cannot break out into a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
assent unto the divine propositions, it comes in regard

many believed, but because of the Pharisees they did not
confess him, lest they should be put out of the Synagogue;
for they loved the praise of men, more than the praise of
God.</hi> Mark, in this they are said to believe, being convinced
in their understandings of the truth of the doctrine, they
had a credulity of the things, but vain-glory hindred them
from practising accordingly, <hi>the praise of men;</hi> as likewise
a wicked love of it, and I may add another passion, <hi>fear,</hi>
out of that Phrase <hi>because of the Pharisees, i. e.</hi> because

the Jewes. These words,</hi> that is, that shifting of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession

impediments to faith. I know it may be objected here,
that it is spoke of the confession of faith, not the act or

outward acts of faith which do not choak its being,
and nature. I answer, it is true; but withall it cannot be

think him true in all his sayings; that they are according
to his intentions; and that he is able to make good what
he intends. Who can honour him, but he that believes he

of them who seek him? It is the duty which he who
hath, cannot lack the rest; and he who hath not, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upright. But it seems he utters his mind clearly in
this sentence which he did more obscurely otherwhere, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
throughout this discourse to weaken our faith.
Well let us go on, <hi>but,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is a gift which God freely
giveth to whom he pleaseth:</hi> what therefore no command
concerning it? he may say the same of Hope and Charity;
and indeed of all the things of this World; the Earth is
the Lords, and all that is in it, and to whom he pleaseth
he giveth it, but is there therefore no command concerning
these things? Consider, Reader, that although faith be Gods
gift, yet God gives it according to those rules which he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96149:93"/>
hath set down: faith is introduced by hearing, by such
setled wayes as God hath appointed to produce it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I do think that no man living can shew me faith, where
that faith was not wrought by God in his ordinary way of
working: and therefore one part of his distinction which
he used before, either by Gods operation ordinary or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
might have been spared, if applyed to the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
operation. I know the conversion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> may be
objected, and the like, where God wrought his faith by a
miraculous manifestation of himself to him: yet consider
that the conversion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was produced immediatly
by that miracle which was in a most setled course of Gods
working b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> hearing and seeing; for hearing the word, or
reading it, seeing some vision, or miracle, are most ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
means by which God bestoweth that blessing upon his
servants, by preaching, by visions, by miracles. And I do
not believe that any man in the world can perswade me that
he hath a right and religious faith, who never heard or saw
any thing which did perswade him to it. Again, consider
that there are three things, which make a gift profitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides;
the giving, the receiving and the right use of it: the
first only concerns God, the two latter men. Now suppose
that the Sun (which alone can do it) should shine, if men
will remain in their prison, keeping the doors and windows
shut, they shall not be able to see by that gift of light; yea
if he open the windows of his house, and shut those of his
body, he shall not see. Out of these ariseth the faultiness of
infidelity, that men shut out that means which God gives
them to believe; they will not hear or read the word of
God, they scorn his miracles, and all those glorious reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which have been made to his servants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the
hands of God are open to give, and the hands of men not
so to receive, and when he sows his seed of righteousness,
and the pleasures and the cares of the World choak it, then
the duty of faith is subject to a command although given by
God.</p>

clearly, <hi>John 3. 18. He who believeth not, is condemned already,

which, was, that he would in near and dear respects fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

of that Chapter. So that here in this is no more implyed,

read, <hi>Gen 18. 18, 19. Again where God saith to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
<hi>In thee shall all Nations of the Earth be blessed: for
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96149:95"/>
I know thou wilt command thy Children, and thy house after
thee to keep the way of the Lord, and to observe righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and judgment; It is manifest the obedience of his family,
who had no revelation, depended on their former obligation to
obey their Soveraign.</hi> Thus far Mr. <hi>Hobbs.</hi> I answer, 'tis
true that this obedience of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family to himself, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon their filial obedience to him as their Father, and
his commanding them depends upon his soveraign power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them as their Father But what? can it be collected
hence, that if <hi>Abraham</hi> had commanded dishonest things,
<hi>i. e.</hi> such actions as were against any will of God, revealed
any other way to them, that they should have obeyed him?
Certainly no; nay, the contrary is here intimated, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God promised to bless him and his posterity, because
he did know that <hi>Abraham</hi> would command them vertuous
things, <hi>to keep the way of the Lord.</hi> But mark here, Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> still varyes from the English lection, and that to the
worse; for it is not what he writes, to keep, but, <hi>he will
command them, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> So
that the sense is; because God foresaw his fatherly care,
and their filial duty in these righteous actions, he would bless
them. He prosecutes this conclusion with another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thus; <hi>At mount</hi> Sinai, Moses <hi>only went up to God, the
people were forbidden to approach on pain of death; yet were
they bound to obey all that</hi> Moses <hi>declared unto them for Gods
Law.</hi> Upon what ground, <hi>but on this submission of their own,</hi>
Exod. 20. <hi>Speak thou to us, and we will hear thee; but let
not God speak to us lest we die? By which two places,</hi> (saith
he) <hi>it sufficiently appears that in a Common-wealth a Subject
that has no certain and assured revelation, particularly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
concerning the will of God, is to obey for such the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Common-wealth.</hi> (That is, by his Logick, the
soveraign of the Common-wealth.) How this conclusion can
be drawn out of these two places of Scripture, I cannot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine.
Why it should not, I shall give these reasons. First,
that although these two particular cases were to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
as he conceits; yet they are but particular cases, which
concerned those only affairs which were under their proper
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96149:95"/>
management; and there is no one word which points at
them, to make them presidents for others, or to give an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
rule for all others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, whereas he saith that in
a Common-wealth a Subject should do thus (as he sets down
in one of his instances,) to wit, that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> there
was no Common-wealth; setled, but only a noble family;
many things may be proper to a family, which are not for
a Common-wealth nay indeed the government of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
under <hi>Moses</hi> was, as yet, not a pefect established Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
but only <hi>in fieri,</hi> the Common-wealth was in
moulding, the Laws for the government were in making.
Then consider, in <hi>Moses</hi> his case (for I have writ enough
concerning the other the People said they would hear
<hi>Moses;</hi> and good reason for it because they discerned that
he had conversation with God; that Gods terrour was so
great that no man durst injure him by doubting his Laws,
who had such near converse with God, as he had, when
called up to the top of the Mount: and therefore might be
trusted on his relation. And therefore it seems their promise
of hearkning to whatsoever <hi>Moses</hi> should deliver for Gods
Law, was to him, as a Prophet, rather than as a King; which
indeed was (in that regard) more to be considered. And
certainly those dictates of the holy Scripture for our practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which are delivered by King <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> have not
that great obligation upon us as they were Kings, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
nor are the books which are Scripture and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be so received amongst us, therefore of divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thourity,
because Kings declare them to be such; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise,
Kings declare them to be such, because they are
such. And, (good Reader) consider further, that this
reason of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> might have excused all the worshippers
of <hi>Baal:</hi> all the idolatries and abominations committed in
the reign of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and the rest of those wicked Kings
over <hi>Israel.</hi> For if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eople were to receive that, and that
only for the word of God, which their supremes authorized,
then they authorizing those, and only those commands which
were directed to those impieties, were so to be accepted
and obeyed, unless they had particular revelation; (which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96149:96"/>
in general, the common people never had) and then how
could God justly punish them for violating those Laws
which he had given them (as he did often) when their Kings
exacted otherwayes? But he gives reason for what he hath
delivered; <hi>for</hi> (saith he) <hi>if men were at liberty, to take for
Gods commandements, their own dreams, and fancies, or the
dreams, and fancies of private men; scarce two men would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
upon what is Gods commandements; and yet in respect of
them, every man would despise the commandement of the
Common wealth.</hi> Alas poor man, what a dream and fancy
hath he vainly uttered! this is like to what he affirmed before,
<hi>that we have no assurance of revelations, unless we had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
revelations our selves.</hi> And what I opposed to that
will serve for this; Were all those Councils, all those Fathers,
all the consent of the Christian Church, nothing but dreams?
all the blood of holy Martyrs nothing but fancies? yea the
blood of Christ whereby he hath subdued all the Kings of this
Christian World, nothing but dreams and fancyes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>? which
yet are those Medium's by which men oppose Kings, (and
ought to do it) when they command contrary to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith. Certainly Mr. <hi>Hobos</hi> said right when he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>That private men must not oppose their dreams or fancies
to the Laws of the Land wherein they live.</hi> But under that
Notion, he doth amiss, when he terms our assent to the
revealed vvill of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> clearly and intelligently apprehended)
a dream or fancy. But because he terms it the Lavv of the
Common-vvealth, vvhich hath some sense according to his
impossible principles, <hi>viz.</hi> That the supreme represents the
vvhole, I vvill tell him it is a phrase of speech never used by
any Author before: for a Common-vvealth consists in the
ordination of all the members of it, supreme and inferiour;
the supreme is soveraign, the inferiour are subjects; but by a
common vvealth here he only understands the soveraign. But
let us proceed vvith him; out of the former confuted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses
he dravvs this conclusion: <hi>I conclude therefore, that in
all things not contrary to the Moral Law, (that is to say, to
the Law of Nature) all subjects are bound to obey that for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law, which is declared to be so, by the Laws of the Common-wealth.</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:96149:96"/>
Certainly the Moral Lavv, or the Lavv of Nature,
doth not bid us be baptized, or receive the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
nay it doth not command us to make a profession
of our faith in Jesus Christ. The Law of Nature did not
command <hi>Daniel, Shedrack, Meshack,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> to
refuse the voluptuous meat which <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> allowed
them, and fed upon pulse and water; but the fear that they
should break the Law of God by obeying the King; I mean,
the positive Law which God had not writ in their Natures,
but in Tables; so that this conclusion of his was most
Heathnish.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Mr. Hobbs his further reasons to prove the former as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
examined and censured. His diminution of
the authority of the divine positive Law, and constant

(Now I am in the 150 page<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> let the Reader consider again,
how he takes occasion to lessen the authority of Scripture.
I am perswaded he can produce no Christian writer from our
Saviours time downward, that ever delivered so unworthy
a conceipt of the positive Law of God: it is as if he should
say, we should obey a Constables command against the Kings
command by Statute; for the difference is much less betwixt
the King and a Constable, than betwixt the greatest King in
the World and God. The common Law which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be an unwritten tradition, is like the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Statute Law like the positive Laws: It is lawful (not
considering a statute) for a man to act any thing not against
the common Law, but if a positive, <hi>i e.</hi> a statute Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene,
it is no longer lawful by any private power to act
that, which otherwise had been lawful. Thus until a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Law of God interpose, whatsoever is not against the
Law of Nature is lawful; but when that positive Law is
manifest, it is necessary that that likewise be obeyed; and
no humane Law of mans making can have right to dispense
with it. He proceeds <hi>[besides, there is no place in the world,
where men are permitted to pretend other commandements of
God, than are declared for such by the Common-wealth. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
States punish those that revolt from Christian Religion, and
all other States, those that set up any religion by them forbidden.
For in whatsoever is not regulated by the Common-wealth 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
(which is the Law of Nature, and therefore an eternal
Law of God that every man equally enjoy his Liberty.]</hi> Here
is an Argument drawn <hi>à facto ad jus;</hi> Because this is done,
therefore it is rightly done; and an equal weight put upon
the acts of Heathens, and worshippers of the Sun, Moon,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> with that of Christians who only worship the true
God. As if because Kings justly punish those who violate
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96149:97"/>
the Laws of those Kingdomes which they are intrusted
with, therefore Thieves justly may destroy such as break
the Laws of their Combination, when indeed the first are
just, but the other most unjust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The case seems to be the
same here: for all those are combinations of Thieves, who
rob God of his due honour required by him &amp; the Christians
only act by the Law of God. So that here we may discern a
great difference in the right of the two a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tings of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and the Heathen; but then consider what is the ground
of them both, we shall find it different from what Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
delivers. He conceiveth the reason to be this, why de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
are punished, because they swerve from the Law
of the supreme: but it is clearly otherwise; The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
doth not therefore receive the holy Communion, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of his sin, or do such like heavenly duties, because the
supreme Magistrate requires them, but because he finds those
duties exacted by God in his positive Laws; and if the
Magistrate shall controulit, he knows God must be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before man, when he requires contrary to God. And
the same reason persvvades the <hi>Turk</hi> concerning his <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
vvhich he vainly imagineth to be the divine Lavv; and if the
Grand <hi>Signior</hi> himself do contradict that Lavv they vvill not
obey him, upon that reason. And surely the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
prevails vvith all other Nations vvho have their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by tradition; it is not the Lavv of man, but the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Lavv of God vvhich they subject themselves unto in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
performances. And therefore though soveraigns punish
such transgressions vvhich are against those Lavvs vvhich they
have established for divine; yet it is therefore because they
are esteemed divine. Therefore they made such Lavvs, not
that they could think that they ought to be esteemed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
because they established them. I vvill add but one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
more, vvhich is this; That although he saith, that all
Nations practise this, that is, that they allovv only such divine
Lavvs, vvhich they have established to be such; yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no Nation in the World, (no Christian I am assured)
would have allowed this doctrine to be published, but only
such as were in that distracted condition as our poor Nation
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:96149:98"/>
was when he published it. For since every Christian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
professeth a conformity to divine Law, it cannot be
imagined that they durst obtrude such an impossible thing
to be credited as that they could make divine Laws, but
only confirm and exact an obedience to them. Nay, I can
think the same of all, even Heathen Nations. So that it is
a conclusion abhorring to Christianity, yea humane Nature
wheresoever it is planted with any Religion. For since all
do conceive God to be an infinite able and wise Governour
even of Kings, supremes, and kingdomes, how can they
think it afe for them out of humane obedience to subject
his rules to the controul of his Subjects, which all Kings
and Potentates are? I have handled this Paragraph <hi>verbatim,</hi>
and although there are many more expressions (in this case)
which may deserve censure, yet I pass them over, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

sounds like a legal Officer, and truly (to speak properly) I
think the supreme legislative power is the Judge of politick
good and evil; the other subordinate Judges are only Judges
of the application of the supreme to particular cases; for
instance thus. The legislative power commands that no man
shall steal; if he do he shall be thus and thus punished; the
Judge applyes this sentence of this evil to <hi>

the Judge upon his Bench determines, that this person is
guilty of this evil; in neither of which a private man hath
right to pass a conclusive sentence concerning other men.
But yet give me leave to tell the Reader, that in both these
he hath <hi>judicium rationis,</hi> a rational sentence in his own
thoughts, as thus; before a Law is made, he judgeth that
this would be fit to be made, and so may discretely interpose
with the legislative power to advise them to act according
to those reasons which appear to him as perswasive, for
else the Legislator will lack that great assistance which he
may receive from the premonitions of prudent men, who,
many times, (although they are not lifted up to the dignity
of such as sit at the Helm) v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And in the second <hi>(viz.)</hi> the application, when a private
man shall stand by at the pleading or hearing a cause, he
perceiving that the Judge carries himself partially to one side,
and doth pass his sentence accordingly, this private man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuse but judge in his Soul, that this was a wicked sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
As contrarily when it is justly carried with indifference,
he may judge with himself that this was a righteous judgment.
But the intruding into the Office of a Judg is altogether unfit
without a special deputation to it But since God hath pleased
to give man that most excellent faculty of ratiocination both
in Natural and Political affairs, he shall desert humanity who
should deny himself the exercise of that ability. Nay he
may indeavour (if he can) to avert that execution of that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
when it is wickedly pronounced; as was the case of
<hi>Daniel,</hi> in the unrighteous sentence decreed upon <hi>Susanna;</hi>

                     <hi>THis is true,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the condition of meer Nature, where
there are no civil Laws; and also under civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in such cases as are not determined by the Law.</hi>
Consider now, Reader, that by the Law, he understands
here the civil Law. Consider then that the Laws of any
Nation may be against the Law of Nature; in which case he
himself hath limited the power of civil Laws. A man is
commanded by the National Law to act against the Law of
Nature, shall not this private man judge it unfit for him to
do that? And without question, in many particulars, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Law of God in Scripture is as clear to many men, as
that Law written in mens hearts; and therefore in such cases
there is no doubt but as God hath imparted to men the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of reasoning, so he hath given men Laws by which they
should regulate themselves according to his directions, &amp; they
must and ought to use that reason in the guidance of their
actions by his rules. But then, concerning the civil Laws
themselves, a man may judge in private of them, whether
they are prudential or no; yea, every man who is versed in
Politicks, will judg and think so of them, and sometimes
judge they are not prudent, and yet give no disturbance to
the peace of the Kingdome: but think it more prudent to be
subject to an imprudent Law, than for it to hinder the end of
all Laws, which is the peace aud quiet of the Kingdom.
But now consider further, <hi>Turpe est doctori cum culpa redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guit
ipsum.</hi> He hath writ a book of Politie, he hath censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all the civil Laws in the World, he is a private man, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96149:100"/>
hath (I believe) no legislative power; why should he take
upon him to forbid others to act that which he himself doth
in that very place where he forbids them? And yet give me
leave to add one Note more; this judging he speaks of
must be about his Actions in the future, whether, what he
is about to do will be a good or an evil action. Is it possible
for a man to live honestly and not to judge of such actions
wherein there is any scruple whether they are good or evil?
Suppose the civil law (as he would have it) were the only rule
to walk by; yet every private man must judge whether this
or that act which he is about to undertake, be according to
that rule or no. And perhaps he may, in many cases, find
work enough for all the wit he hath to regulate himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that rule: and although he calls this the poyson
of a Common-wealth; yet I dare boldly say it is that
bread which doth most wholesomly nourish, support and
maintain a Common-wealth, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that every man should
consider and judge what is legal, and fit for him to do. Let

                     </hi> Here are two Propositions, I shall
handle them apart, they are both indiscreet, and very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to the Question. The first is, that the Civil
Law is the measure of our Actions the measure is in
definite without any limitation what not the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
shall not that be a measure? How shall a man be
able to commit Treason then <hi>se defendendo</hi> against the
Civil Law? (which is one of his popular Aphorisms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in many places of this Book:) for if the Civil
Law be the measure of his actions, he must not violate
that for the pretence of the Law of Nature. I urge this

                     </gap>nvincible argument against his wicked
doctrine, but see it overthrown out of most received prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
It is possible that the Civil Laws may be wicked
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96149:101"/>
and dishonest, and so against the Law of God; as even
in this Nation, they have made s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>rilegious Laws; shall
not I judge in my self whether it be fit for me to act
according to these Laws? The Law made in Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> days which shed so much innocent blood, it was
fit for every man in that time to suffer rather than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
with them. And therefore he must be judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
what is vertuous for him to do; and that Law is not
a rule to guide him sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

first proposition. The second is, <hi>And the Judge is the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator,

whether it is fit for <hi>Titius,</hi> at this hour or instant, to act
according to this Civil law concerning which the scruple
ariseth? whether it be not against the Divine law? the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is instant, now required; It is not possible for this man to
obtain leave to enquire of the legislator; or if he could,
is it not probable that the legislator may not be at leisure
to answer such doubts? It cannot be therefore that the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator
can be a proper Judge of such questions; <hi>Titius</hi>
alone must do it himself: neither indeed is it possible for
any legislator to foresee all such particular scruples which
may arise out of general rules; and therefore there
is a necessity for every man to be judge of good and
evil, concerning his own particular actions what he
should do. But he reduceth great mishaps and ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
which follow upon this doctrine, which must be
examined. <hi>From this false doctrine</hi> (saith he) <hi>men are dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to debate with themselves, and dispute the commands of the
Common wealth.</hi> And why not, good Reader? There is no man
that hath reason with him when he studyeth a Law-book,
or indeed any other (besides the holy Scripture) but he
considers whether that law or discourse be agreeing to the
principles of Faith and Reason, whether it be consonant
with equity: if a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> have not his judgement free to
himself, how comes it about that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hopes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96149:101"/>
with his discourse against all the laws in the Christian
World, but that he himself thinks there is a freedome of
judgement left amongst men to determine by their reason
what is good or evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But then he adds, <hi>[And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to obey, or disobey them as in their private judgment
they shall think fit, whereby the Common-wealth is distracted
and weakned.]</hi> Certainly every man living will obey or
disobey as he thinks fit; and this is done by vertuous and
good men without distracting or weakning the Common-wealth.
For if a vertuous man find the Civil law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
Gods law either in Nature or Scripture, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think it good <hi>moraliter</hi> for him to act according to its
direction. But his opposing of an established law shall
be with submission to the penalty, not contending marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
against it, for the accommodation of this present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
being, which is his doctrine; and by this means
the Common-wealth will suffer no distraction, but rather
confirmation and establishment; when a mans private evil
shall be patiently endured, rather than the peace of a
kingdom shall be disquieted. I speak no more of this
because the sence is much the same with that doctrine
which he censured next and condemns.</p>

                     <hi>ANother Doctrine repugnant to Civil Society, is, That
whatsoever a man doth against his Conscience is sin, and it
dependeth on the presumption of making himself Judge of good
and evil.</hi> Certainly the proposition is true, whatsoever
a man doth against his Conscience is sin; for Conscience
includes in its Name and Nature Science, so that there can
be no Conscience, without there be a knowledg of the
condition and circumstances to which his Conscience is
applyed. I would be loth to involve my self into many
intricate Questions. But intreat the Reader to consider,
that Conscience is the conclusion of a practical Syllogisme,
in which the Major is either the Act of a principal law
of Nature, or some general rule equivalent to it. To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this, observe, that there are two innate qualities
in man, which the Philosophers call, <hi>Habitus Principiorum,</hi>
habits of principles which do so evidence themselves that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96149:102"/>
no rational man doth hear such truths clearly delivered,
but he presently assents to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which is about
speculative things they term <hi>intellectus,</hi> because it is in the
prime operation of the understanding; of which Nature
are these, That the whole is greater than a part; two and
two make four: There is no man that heareth such propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
clearly delivered who doth not presently assent to
them. There is another quality which is called by them
<hi>Synteresis,</hi> which is the habit by which we readily assent
to practical things, as in the other to speculative, of
which Nature are these; That good is desirable, evil to
be eschewed; God is to be obeyed in his commands, and
the like. Now there is no man, ho, as soon as he hears
these Axiomes clearly delivered, but doth without ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
presently yield an assent to them. Out of these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
when a man makes true collections and deductions,
that conclusion is Conscience, as thus:</p>
                  <p>All evil is to be eschewed;</p>
                  <p>Adultery is evil;</p>
                  <p>Therefore Adultery is to be eschewed.</p>
                  <p>Such a man who thus argues, acts against his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
when he commits Adultery. But not only so when
a conclusion is immediately deduced out of <hi>Synteresis</hi> but
that which is more remotely deduced out of it; as take the
conclusion of the former syllogisme;</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Adultery is to be eschewed:</p>
                  <p>This particular Act, with this forbidden Woman, is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this is to be eschewed.</p>
                  <p>Sure he who commits that sin acts against his Conscience,
and so as far as any man can go, with right arguing, so
far his Conscience obligeth him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now if we would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
from strong reason, a man may say, there is no such
thing as an erroneous Conscience, because if it be not
Science, it cannot be Conscience, which upposeth Science
and a right drawing out the Conclusion, which proceeds
from these evident principles; and then most certainly
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> must be in the wrong, who affirms that it is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96149:103"/>
not sin to act against his Conscience. But let us take
Conscience as in the usual way it is taken, not for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of a direct and certain arguing, from these known
and evident principles, (of which before:) but for that
conclusion which any man, according to his ability, draws
out of these principles although mistaken, and not logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
or truly done. (I understand not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> this word [logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally]
the art of logick, but that natural ratiocination, of
which the artificial is an assistant only.) Well then, the
question is, whether that a man who acts against that light
which he hath, that shews him this particular is unlawful,
is sin in him who so acts, although this light be not a true
but a bare shew of Conscience; and not true Science, or
deduction which must be drawn from the principles of
<hi>Synteresis</hi> by true ratiocination? And certainly the opinion
is most right and true, and founded upon the strongest
principles of reason that can be. For it is a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Axiom which he hath delivered, that laws bind only
by the force of their sufficient promulgation. So that if they
are made only, they exact no obedience until they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed;
nor then, unless the Proclamation be such as the
obliged party may take notice of it; for no man can be
bound to that which he cannot know; he cannot obey,
unless he know what to obey; nor can he know,
unless he have a Revelation to shew it him; so that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
question, the very law of Nature could not bind, but
that there is a <hi>Synteresis</hi> that enlightens mans Soul, and makes
the goodness of that law manifest. Well then, this man
must needs sin who acts against that light he hath: put that
case which is common amongst us, A man by misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Scriptures thinks that they command him, not to
swear: therefore when he is convented before a Judge to
attest a truth by that most religious act, of calling God to
witness what he saith to be true, or to punish him, if it be
false; if this man so conceive these places of Scripture, as
if they should render his swearing in any case unlawful, if
he do swear, he sins against that light he hath, and it may
most justly be imputed to him for sin: for he who thinks,
and believes it is the law of God which prohibits it, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96149:103"/>
yet will do otherwise, prefers men before God, this world
before the other, which is the fountain from whence all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
proceeds.</p>
                  <p>I know but two objections of any moment, which
can be made against this conclusion, which I shall satisfie
presently. The first is, if a man doth sin in acting against
his erroneous Conscience, then a man may sin in acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods commandements; because that he may
mistake Gods command, and in doing so when he acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the true meaning of Gods command he must
sin: which may seem most strange at the first view.</p>
                  <p>For answer I will consider this Phrase, <hi>Act according to
Gods command.</hi> To understand this know that he who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys
<hi>Gods commands,</hi> must do it as a man <hi>scienter</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
A man cannot pretend to obedience in any act
which is done by chance, or ignorantly. Such acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which are done when a man thinks otherwise of the
Law of God or the principles of the Law of Nature,
than the truth is, though he do the Acts materially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by them; yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ring in the principles which God
hath given him for his guide (I mean the light of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
which should shew him the vvay) he doth not
act them formally vvell; he doth <hi>bonum,</hi> but not <hi>bene,</hi> a
good act but not well, <hi>according to Gods law formally.</hi> As for
a man to do a good act vvell, requires a completion of all
circumstances, he must do it for a right end. In which first
qualification the erroneous man who acts against the light of
his <hi>Synteresis,</hi> must needs miscarry, because he cannot think
he acts for the glory of God, vvhen he thinks contrary to
the revealed will of God: and indeed it might be shevved
hovv he erres in every circumstance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Quis, Quid, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Cur, Quomodo, Quando, (Quis.)</hi> What? the Creature
go against the revealed will of the Creator? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I
desist, the restare obvious. Well then, I answer this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
that he who acts the thing commanded against his
erroneous Conscience, although he do that vvhich is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
good, yet in not doing it vvell he sins.</p>
                  <p>The second objection is, that if he vvho hath an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96149:104"/>
Conscience must not act against it, such a man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; for he must either act according to his
Conscience or against it; in either of which he sins, as in
the instance before given; A man whose Conscience tells
him that he may not swear, this man is brought before a
Judge to give evidence in a Cause of moment, if he do it,
or not do it, he sins: but surely the Nature of sin is such,
that it is impossible to sin in any act which he cannot
choose but doe; for sin supposeth a possibility not to
sin.</p>
                  <p>For answer to this I shall say, that there is no impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the case proposed, for that man may lay aside his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and consider that God hath given a command to swear
by his Name, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. and elsewhere; the words there
are, <hi>thou shalt fear the Lord thy God and serve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>im and
swear by his Name.</hi> Not that he commands us to swear,
but supposing swearing to be necessary in all politiques
for the deciding controversies, he commands that when we
swear, we should swear by his Name, because it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
act, and ought to be referred to none but himself
only; yea God himself hath sworn, <hi>Gen. 22. 16. By my
self I have sworn, saith the Lord,</hi> so like wise <hi>Psalm 100. 4.
The Lord hath sworn,</hi> and many like places. It cannot
therefore be ill in it self to swear, nor can we think it a
priviledge or prerogative of Gods to swear: Holy men in
all ages have done it: for you may find <hi>Abraham</hi> divers
times, as <hi>Gen. 21. 22. He sware in the Covenant with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech.</hi>
So likewise <hi>Isaac,</hi> either the same or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 26. 31. I need not name more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the same Nature. But to whatsoever may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
of this kind out of the Old Testament, these may
reply, that our Saviour hath instituted a New Law <hi>(Mat.
5. 33.)</hi> where in the 34 <hi>verse</hi> he saith, <hi>But I say unto you,
swear not at all;</hi> It is true he so requires them. But let us
consider that St. <hi>Paul</hi> (whose life and actions after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
are so eminently excellent, and without blame) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
time swears, yea in his Epistles, which were a greater
fault than in ordinary discourse, because 'twas done upon
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96149:104"/>
consideration. Nay, in those Epistles which he was directed by
the Holy Ghost to write, for the good of the Church of
Christ. So you may observe <hi>Rom</hi> 1. 9. God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
so likewise, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. I call God for record upon
my Soul. <hi>Phil</hi> 1. 8. God is my record. And now it is
not possible for any man to think, that so vertuous a man
in a premeditated act, as an Epistle writ for a publick good,
and in that act, guided by the holy Ghost, should commit
a sin against that Christ, whose Gospel and Laws he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and taught every where, with hazard of his life, if
that Law were to be understood in that latitude and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in which it is taken. Any man who considers this,
must needs cast about to see, if learned men, (who through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Christian World have practised with St.
<hi>Paul)</hi> have given any such exposition upon these words of
our Saviour as may consist with the universal practice of
mankind, and doing that he may find this fully explained
so, as fit to shew our Saviours design, which was not in
this to controul the practice of his servants. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
will lye in these two Phrase, the Negative in the
<hi>(34) verse,</hi> and the Affirmative in the <hi>(37) verse.</hi> First for
the Negative, <hi>sweare not at all;</hi> to apprehend this consider,
that these universal, as also indefinite terms are with much
caution to be extended, and to be expounded in Scripture
according to that consent they have with other places, and
the Analogie of Faith. In the 21 <hi>verse</hi> of this 5 <hi>Chap.</hi> of St.
<hi>Matthew,</hi> it is said, <hi>thou shalt not kill,</hi> and lest some
should say, there is no universal sign preceding as in my
Text, consider the following words which make it as
large as this in my Text, <hi>whosoever killeth shall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the judgement.</hi> And yet surely it is lawful for an
Executioner to hang according to the Law of the Land,
and so to kill any man who is condemned, when he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a command to do it. So likewise it is lawful for a
Souldier in defence of his Country, and for any private
man to kill any private man in defence of himself. So
likewise the same we may say of our Saviours words,
<hi>John</hi> 10. and the 8. All that ever came before me, were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96149:105"/>
Thieves and Robbers. Here are as full and large words as
possibly can be; but a man say, what were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,
the Prophets, and St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptist Thieves and
Robbers? Certainly no; it is easie to observe many more
of the like Nature, and I think one answer will serve them
all; thou shalt not kill voluntarily, but upon necessity, or
command, (that is) a Natural or Moral necessity, for a
command from lawful Superiours introduceth a Moral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
of obeying. And so for that in St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> all that
came of themselves, unsent by God, were Thieves and
Robbers. But <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, the Patriarchs, and the
Prophets were men sent from God. And so for those
Swearers, swear not all, that is, of your selves, unless you
are commanded by Superiour Powers, unless to confirm
some great and considerable truth; which way all vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and holy men have ever understood this Text, as their
practice assures us; and so that place in St <hi>Iames</hi> the 5.
must abide the same exposition. And although much more
may be said for the exposition of thi N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gative command
of our Saviours; yet I conceive that this is sufficient, and
so pass to the Affirmative precept in the 37) <hi>verse, But
let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay, for whatsoever
is more than these cometh of evil.</hi> Here it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eems that as
our Saviour before forbad swearing by his Negative, <hi>swear
not at all,</hi> so here he insinuates the same by his Affirmative,
<hi>but let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay;</hi> and
he gives a reason for it, for what is more than these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of evil. Thus the Argument being enforced, I answer
clearly, that in the Translation of the English there is a full
gloss upon the Text which expounds it clearly; for so it is
read <hi>[let your communication]</hi> which intimates that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conversation should not be powdred with Oathes,
which is far distant from those just occasions where oathes
are exacted by the commands of Superiours, or the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of some great and weighty business which needs a
strong affirmation to assure the credulity of it; and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
which is (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) enforceth no more but let your
Speech be yea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the reason which is added in the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96149:105"/>
Text makes this interpretation good (for what is more
than these cometh of evil;) it is not sin, <hi>it is not Evil, but
cometh of Evil;</hi> which is evident, for no man swears in
conversation, but either because he doubts his own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if he do not swear, or because other men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustful,
both which arise out of the evil of humane fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which makes him apt to lye. This Text being
thu opened let us consider what will result out of it, in
the Negative first, and then out of the Affirmative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
In the Negative we may find that it is opposed to a
practice of the Jews, who (by some tradition or other)
imagined that it was no sin to swear, but to swear falsly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
So that if a man performed his promise which he
swore he would do, it was no sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it seems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be spoken only of promissory Oaths, not of such
which were made to give Testimony of matters of fact;
if so, then there is no prohibition of such Oaths which
are for the decision of controversies, commonly called
Assertory Oaths; and then again, it may justly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that they (that is the Jews) thought (out of some
tradition or other) that it was only unlawful to swear by
God, but not by the Creature, for our Saviours instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are only in them, <hi>Thou shalt not swear by Heaven, by
Earth, by Ierusalem, by the Gold of the Altar, or thy Head.</hi>
Which he sheweth relatively to reach even the Creator
himself: so that for these considerations it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that it excludes not assertory Oath vvhich decide
controversies, that it extends not to such Oaths vvhere
God is religiously called to witness any thing. And then
for the second the affirmative precept, it reacheth to our
Communication and common conference one with another,
that Gods most Sacred Name be not slightly or in vain
taken by us; but that either some great business more
than ordinary, or else some supreme power must exact it
from us. So then this being thus expounded, it must needs
appear that in this case, a man may justly depose his errour,
and he cannot be necessitated to sin, when he hath an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in his Conscience. And truly it is an excellent rule
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96149:106"/>
for the practice of a mans life, when he shall find a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
practice of good and holy men in all Ages to practise
any thing which he is offended at, to suppress that averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in himself, and with study and pains to cast about
which way he may reconcile himself to that common
practice, and not without strong and evident grounds
(which will hardly be possible) oppose that which the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
practice makes us know, that the universal Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
as they practised; for if there be an Error in such a
practice, a man may find something to excuse himself with <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravimum
cum patribus;</hi> but in the other, nothing but pride
and self conceipt, which makes him oppose these pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices:
and surely in these cases it is a safe rule for any
man when he finds a place of Scripture which seemingly
opposeth the universal doctrine of the Church, which is
and hath been so heretofore, to look about how that
Scripture may be expounded according to the Analogy of
faith and good manners or usage of the Catholick Church,
which then must be the sense, and the other (though
more apparent at the first) not the true meaning; and by
this means he shall not act contrary to his Conscience, but
if he do, he must sin.</p>

                  <p>HE proceeds, <hi>And it dependeth on the presumption
of making himself Judge of good and evil.</hi> It doth
(say I) for so every man will be, in what concerns
his own practice; and must needs be so, for else how can he
judge that he doth right or no unless he may judge it?
and if there were no Law but what he speaks of, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
he must judge whether his actions be according to
that or no when he acts: But Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> acknowledgeth a
superiour Law to that, to wit, the Law of Nature, and I
have shewed another the positive Law of God, and he
must in both these use <hi>judicium privatum,</hi> his private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether his actions accord or no with these supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Laws. Now in all these he must judge and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsible
for that judgement, whether he judge by such
rules as ought to guide a prudent man: but he gives
a reason for what he speaks, <hi>for a mans Conscience
and his Judgement is the same thing: and as the
judgement, so also the Conscience may be erroneous.</hi>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:96149:107"/>
This doth not follow, because he may erre therefore he
should not be guided by it. A man may have a false
light shewed, or his eyes may be weak, as our eyes, who
are old men, are; must he therefore not make use of that
light and sight which he hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay rather he must be
more careful in the diligent using of his eyes, and more
seriously examining the light which is offered to them. But
in all these offers of reason which he makes in this Case,
they may be applyed to that judgement which he must
make concerning the Law of Nature, or the Civil Law
(which he allows a man must judge) whether his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be according to them, and what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s the meaning of
them as well as what is the meaning of the positive Law
of God, and he must and will, if he be a vertuous man,
act accordingly. <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>though he that is
subject to no Civil Law, sinneth in all he doth against his
Conscience, because he hath no other rule to follow but his
own reason; yet it is not so with him that lives in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
because the Law is the publick Conscience, by
which he hath already undertaken to be guided.</hi> I cannot
find how to apply this discourse closely to the question,
for he who is not imbodied in a Common-wealth (saith
he) is ruled by his reason, (but hark you) that reason
ought to be ruled by the Law of Nature, according to his
own doctrine; and according to mine, by whatsoever is a
known positive Law of God. Likewise, although there
is no Civil Law. And I will tell him farther that no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
or Politick Law can have power to bind him to the
breach of any of these, and therefore what he speaks of a
publick Conscience is an unheard of Language, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be applyed to Conscience, and most undoubtedly
only educeable out of that before unheard of, and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
principle of constituting a supreme, which hath
been abundantly confuted in my former discourses. Let
the Reader take notice that I am now in page the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (169)
<hi>(Otherwise in such diversity as there is of private Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which are but private Opinions, the Common-wealth
must needs be distracted, and no man dare to obey the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:96149:107"/>
power farther than it shall seem good in his own
eyes.)</hi> In this clause he sets down the mischiefs (as he
thinks) which may happen to a Common-wealth by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of Consciences, or Opinions. But before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
I will take notice of a mistake whereof he is guilty,
when he saith, <hi>That private Consciences are but private O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</hi>
To this I say there may be such Consciences
which arise only out of private Opinions, which ought
to be overswayed with the greater weight of publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
but there are other Consciences which are drawn
out of the evident Law of Nature, or clear text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
these are so strong foundations to build Conscience
upon, that a Conscience erected upon one or both of
them cannot be shaken by that which he calls a publick
Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> howsoever, it is an improper Phrase used by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>im to call Conscience, Opinion, or Science; for it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Conclusion deduced out of either, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But then when he is angry in these Politicks with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of Consciences or Opinions (as he terms them)
I would fain have him consider, how any Common-wealth
should be able to make a Law to regulate mens thoughts,
for they can judge of them only by outward acts, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God who can search the hearts and reins, and therefore
he only can make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aws for them. Men may consine the
external manage of Opinions and Consciences, which is fit
the legislative should do, in all such things which might
impede or trouble the well government of a Common-wealth,
and punish the expression of them: but let all the
power in the World make what Laws they can, men
will think what appears most reasonable to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings:
thoughts are far from the controul of any <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi>
whatsoever. And although it is true in some
part, that distractions in Common-wealths arise from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Opinions; yet it is not true what he saith, the
Common wealth must needs be distracted by them; for so
long as they are but Opinions, they do no harm but to
those Persons who have them; but if they justify their
Opinions to the withdrawing others or themselves from
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96149:108"/>
obedience than they are dangerous. And therefore the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi>
although he cannot know mens Consciences, and
therefore not judge of them, must not make Laws for
them; yet because he can know and judge of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
act, which may distrub the peace, he must be severe
both in making Laws against, and punishing those faults:
yet I cannot chuse but wonder, how he who dares pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
so many doctrines against all the <hi>Leviathans</hi> in the
World, should not allow others the liberty of thinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them.</p>

Mr. Hobbs his Arguments against this Opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.
Faith and sanctity entitle not any man to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
The means of salvation most certain. Mr.
Hobbs his Arguments against the former assertion
retorted.</head>
                  <p>HE proceeds in another Paragraph, <hi>It hath been also
commonly taught, that faith and sanctity are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to
be attained by study and reason, but by supernatural inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or infusion.</hi> I will not trouble my self to turn Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
where to find a defender of this proposition, but
set down my judgement and then answer his cavil at it:
my judgement is, that faith and sanctity are both inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and acquired; faith is the Gift of God, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaketh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. so likewise sanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 30. and yet they are acquired; and in the Parable of
the Talents <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. we may observe, that the use of
Gods gifts is blessed by Almighty God with a further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement;
multitudes of Scriptures might be produced,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96149:108"/>
which would but dull the Reader. So that in this case it
is no other wise than it is with almost all the affairs in the
World; neither the grass, nor the plants grow without
light and influence from the Heavens; nor can the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
make them grow unless there be a specifical vertue in
the Plant to adapt that influence to that particular opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is in it. Neither can the Heavens without the
Earth; nor the Earth without the Heavens, bring forth
the least fruit, according to that Heavenly speech of St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,
Tolle liberum arbitrium, non erit quod salvetur;
Tolle gratiam, non erit unde.</hi> Take away free choice, and
there will be nothing which can be saved for no inferiour
thing without that faculty is capable of Heaven, that being
like the specifical vertue of Plants which co-operates with
the general influence from above:) but take away grace
there is no means by which these supernatural acts should
be performed; that being the influence by which it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to produce these blessed acts of faith and sanctity. So
that I say, faith and sanctity are both infused and acquired.
Now we will inquire into his exceptions against the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
of this opinion (as he conceives,) <hi>[which granted,</hi>
(saith he) <hi>I see not why any man should render a reason of
his faith.]</hi> If the Opinion were, as he sets it down, I
can tell him why? that is for the satisfaction of others:
but he goes on, <hi>Or why, every Christian should not be also
a Prophet.</hi> I will tell him, because faith and sanctity, and
prophecy are divers things, which may and do oft exist
apart; and therefore one of them may be, and is oft with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the other. Again he saith, <hi>Or why any man should take
the Law of his Country rather than his own inspiration, for
the rule of his actions.</hi> I answer, because there are many
vain suggestions into the Soul of Man, which are often
apt to perswade a man that they are inspirations by God;
and therefore we are commanded to try the Spirits, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
those suggestions whether they agree with such stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rules which ought to guide our actions, amongst which
the National law is one. He goes on, <hi>And thus</hi> (saith he)
<hi>we fall again into the fault of taking upon us to judge of good
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96149:109"/>
and evil.</hi> I answer as before, there is no man but will
judge of good and evil, if he be an honest man and guide
his actions by that judgement, but yet as a private man,
if he be such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He again, <hi>[Or to make Judges of it, such
private men as pretend to be supernaturally inspired, to the
dissolution of all Civil Government.]</hi> I see no consequence
in this, for although a man may be inspired, and can know he
is so; yet that inspiration can only serve his own turn, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he can produce arguments to make me assured of it
likewise; and then although a man may be inspired with faith
and sanctity, which is the matter in dispute; yet that
hath nothing to do with the direction of any other mans
actions, unless he can produce some urging argument to
assure us that he is inspired, with authority to direct
us, which anothers faith and sanctity cannot do; for men
may be faithful and holy, and yet have no Authority to
govern. He goes on thus, to shew by discourse that
faith and sanctity are not infused thus <hi>[Faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hearing by those accidents which guides us, into the
presence of them who speak to us.]</hi> Faith comes by hearing,
but it is by hearing the word of God, which is <hi>Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum
Spiritus,</hi> and brings the Spirit with it; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as Heaven is more necessary to us, and of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
than all the things of this world; so the means
of obtaining it are, without doubt, more certain than any
thing in the world. And therefore faith, and the means
of getting faith which is most ordinately by hearing, and
no doubt but reading likewise, which are the means by
which men may be acquainted with the will of God, so
likewise <hi>[hearing comes by those accidents</hi> (as he speaks
rightly) <hi>which guide us into the presence of them that speak
to us.]</hi> What can be deduced out of this, but that a man
using such means as hearing, and such accidents as bring
him into that presence, God blesseth them and pours into
them those graces which enable them with faith and sacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
I but (saith he) <hi>which accidents are all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by God-Almighty; and yet are not supernatural, but
only, for the great number of them that concurr to every effect,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96149:109"/>
unobservable.]</hi> All this is nothing to the purpose, that is,
to prove that faith and sacntity are not infused: for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God contrives those means, or man, which beget
faith, or whether those means which bring us to hearing
be natural, or supernatural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet God blesseth them; our
eyes are natural which see it; our ears are natural which
hear those things, which bring us to faith and sanctity;
yea our understanding is natural which apprehends them,
but God blesseth both the one and the other (as his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will hath appointed) with supernatural graces. He
goes on. <hi>[Faith, and Sanctity, are indeed not very frequent.]</hi>
Let that be granted; <hi>[but yet they are not Miracles.]</hi> And
that is true likewise, for Miracles, as they are supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
so they are things beyond the ordinate and set way of
Gods working; which these holy operations of his are
not, but most congruous to his set and prescribed way
of acting them, upon such productions according to his
Covenants. He proceeds <hi>[but are brought to pass by education,
discipline, correction, and other natural wayes, by which God
worketh them in his elect, at such time as he thinketh fit]</hi> It is
true; and yet these are wayes of Gods prescribing, and
which he blesseth; therefore he adds <hi>[And these three O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
pernicious to Peace and Government, have in this
part of the World proceeded chiefly from the Tongues and
Pens of unlearned divines; who joyning the words of holy
Scripture together otherwise than is agreeable to reason, do
what they can, to make men think, that sanctity, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reason cannot stand together.]</hi> Give me leave, Reader,
to retort this discourse to his Person, who not long since
in the 26 <hi>Chap.</hi> page 149. maketh faith not a duty, but a
gift of God, and saith <hi>it is barely an operation of God's, as
likewise internal sanctity.</hi> And there put me to the trouble
of proving mans concurrence in these acts; and I may
assuredly affirm, that he is there exceeding guilty of what
he chargeth ignorant Divines with here, <hi>(viz.)</hi> incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
putting places of Scripture together, and as much as
in him lies to make men believe that sanctity and natural
reason canot stand together; for if faith be only a

gift and no act in the receiver, or use of it, <hi>insomuch as no
command can be given concerning that or sanctity,</hi> as he
speaks there, certainly natural reason hath nothing to do
with it; and as there I was forced to prove the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of man in these Heavenly duties, so here to justifie
his former doctrine, I must prove the co-operation
of God which he seems to deny. Let the Reader put
that with this, and he shall find the affirmative part true,

the head, and rules it. One word more, there may be
Laws in a Common-wealth for Kings, and for Subjects,
he must be guided by these which are the Royal Laws,

certainly it tends to the dissolution of a Common-wealth,
to deny an absolute propriety in private men, and
to affirm that in no Common-wealth a Subject can have
such propriety, for it being the reason, (according to his
own Philosophy) why they imbodied themselves into a
Common-wealth, that so they might enjoy the fruits of
their labours peaceably, not only plough and sow peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
but reap the fruits of that pains they take, and call
it there own: It cannot be denyed, that that justly can be
denyed them; and if it be they are in such a state as they

Laws of every Nation are justly to be observed; but still
according to that right which each person hath: and this
propriety is so naturally dear unto every man, as there can
be no wiser Laws made for the publick than such, as
private men shall be bettered by them, for then every

(that is his legal propriety) over his Subjects is over
their estates, to determine their Controversies, to have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over their Persons, legally to punish, according to
his just prerogative. But the title of propriety in his
estate, is belonging to the subject in all such things as are
not included in the supremes legal prerogative. So that
when he has granted Laws which do limit the extent of
his power, and indulge the vertuous industry of his subjects,
he cannot justly infringe them and call that his right,
which he hath condescended not to use. And upon this reason,
with us, the Title of the King in many occasions is decided by

<hi>every other man should have equal right to the same.</hi> This
is not truly spoke; for the protection of the soveraign
doth not make, or give right to any thing, but enables him to
use the same; the law gives the right &amp; the soveraign protects us
in the enjoying that which the Law hath given. But
I wonder at his meaning in what follows, which is, <hi>But if

                        </gap>d, he cannot perform
the Office they have put him into.</hi> That must be understood
of the right of the Soveraignty, but not of propriety:
if he be not allowed the prerogatives belonging to
soveraignty, he cannot protect them; but if he be denyed
the right of propriety, he cannot well destroy them; but
surely may protect them with his justice, and with his
power. He expounds himself <hi>[which is to defend them both
from forraign Enemies, and from the injuries of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and consequently there is no longer a Common wealth]</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:96149:112"/>
A strange inference, unless he have right to their Estates
he cannot defend them <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Surely many Soveraigns have
defended and do defend their subjects, and yet have not
propriety to their Estates. He who hath a propriety in an
estate may use it how he will to his own advantage or
content. But this Supremes cannot do with their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
justly; there may be a case of extremity, where <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Reipublicae</hi> must be <hi>suprema lex;</hi> put the case an Enemy
invades the Kingdome, the land of some particular
subject lyes fit to make a Fort of; the King by force
takes it for the publick benefit; not out of propriety that
it belongs to himself, but that it belongs to the Common-wealth,
to whose publick benefit all private interests and
proprieties must submit. But I may term the right of
such accidents to be an universality rather than a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
the universal right of the Common-wealth, not
the particular right of one or another. That which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
to this purpose, receives the same answer, <hi>In offices
of judicature and the like.</hi> I pass to a <hi>sixth Doctrine which,</hi>
(he saith) <hi>is plainly and directly against the essence of a
Common-wealth; and 'tis this, that the soveraign power may
be divided.</hi> What he means by division, I cannot readily
apprehend; if he means that it may not be divided into
sundry persons, then he hath overthrown himself, when he
constitutes other Government besides Monarchy, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristocracy,
and Democracy, which are in divers persons,
but united; if he means (which he seems to do by his
following discourse) two several Kings in the same king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
I think it cannot subsist, because of distractions
as he intimates; but the fountain of the errour, I think is
not well derived from the Lawyers, <hi>who,</hi> (saith he) <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make the Laws depend upon their own learning,
and not upon the legislative power.</hi> Which way this should
conduce to the dependance of the Law upon their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I see not; he himself hath discoursed that the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsa

Romans, as the opinion of the Judges are amongst us;
and all men have a great reverence of them in all Nations.

taking the same course hopes to find it as beneficial to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as it hath proved to the other. I approve the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
throughout, and therefore need not transcribe any
more. But yet would have been glad to have read some
way, by which this evil, being known, might be hindred
or avoided, and truly I can think upon none but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our selves more industrious than our Neighbours,
by better rewarding vertue and industry, and punishing
vice and sloth than they. There is scarce that people
whose fundamental principles are not such as may make
the Kingdom happy under that government, if they were
used to the best advantage; so that it is not the form of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96149:113"/>
Government only, but the disposure in that form which
felicitates a Nation, and so the making and execution of
good Laws at home will redress the inconvenience which
comes from a Neighbouring Nation. He enters upon a
new Paragraph, <hi>[And as to rebellion in particular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Monarchy, one of the most frequent causes of it, is
the reading the Books of policie, and Histories of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Greeks and Romans.]</hi> I wonder he had not put in
the Old Testament likewise; but certainly he is out in it:
for these Books (he speaks of) do teach Kings and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premes
how to govern and avoid those Rocks upon which
their predecessors have been split; they teach Subjects to
avoid all rebellion, the most happy and prosperous of
which brings confusion if not destruction to that Nation
where they are, and very frequently ruine to themselves and
their Families, who are Ring-leaders in such actions; But
if books which encourage to rebellion must be laid aside,
then let <hi>Leviathan</hi> be buried in silence; which I have, and
shall shew shortly, not by example only, but precept to
justify more rebellion than ever any Author did; <hi>I but,</hi>
saith he, <hi>(from which (that is these books) young men, and
all others as are unprovided of the antidote of solid reason,
receiving a strong and delightful impression of the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
of war atchieved by the conductors of their Armies,
receive withal a pleasing Idea of all they have done besides.]</hi>
I think this may be done, and that these excellent stories
which relate the gallant and exemplary virtues of many, may,
yea must likewise with them record the vices of others yea,
many times the faults of vertuous men, without which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man lived, but our ever blessed Saviour. But what then?
shall the Bee lose its hony, because the Spider may
suck poyson out of the same flower? shall we avoid the
Sun-shine because many are scorched by it? By this
means we should avoid all good things, for there are
none so good but foolish and wicked men have made ill
use of them; even the mercies of God and all his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
attributes have by some been applyed to evil. This
Argument follows not therefore, because weak and ignorant
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96149:114"/>
men have ill digested these excellent meats, therefore bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
stomachs should not use them; without doubt these
stories have abundance in them to shew vertuous men how
to lead their lives, and expose them and lay them down
<hi>pro focis &amp; aris,</hi> which his self-seeking doctrine will not
allow. And yet these had been the most proper dictates
from him, who writes Politicks as conducing more to the
publick good than any self-preservation which he so much
labours for. But a little after he proceeds to shew their
folly who make ill use of them, which I allow; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently

acts; <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Greek and Latine writers in
their books and discourses of Policy</hi> (I am now in the 171 p.)
<hi>make it lawful and laudable for any man so to do; provided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

he had abused them or no; to turn and examine all Authours
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96149:114"/>
were too tedious for me; yet something I may say in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that I believe no man of honour for learning and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
did either amongst the Greeks or Romans affirm, that
if he hath called a Monarch a Tyrant, it is laudable for
him to kill him; for certainly no man can found the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of such a Villany upon his foolish calling him
such, but his being such. Now, as I remember, they
make Tyrants of two sorts; such as invade the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and usurp it from the right owner; and no doubt
but any of those Subjects that owe obedience to their
lawful King, may vindicate him and their fellow subjects
from that unjust invasion. The other way of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is by such a man who is a lawful King, by his succession
or election according to the Laws of the Realm, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
arbitrary by his will, not the Law: Now because
his right of title and possession, puts him above the reach
of legal (though he can never be out of the reach of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate)
judgement; and seeing it is not lawful for a man to
kill any one upon a private judgement, therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>(ex abundanti)</hi> be lawful to kill him, but leave him,
<hi>Deo ultori:</hi> so that if he find such doctrine amongst the
Greeks and Romans, he may rationally judge them amiss,

great happiness of the wisdome contained in these books,
because fools make ill use of them, than to barr men a
sober and healthful use of wine because vitious men abuse
it by drunkenness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He goes on <hi>[from the same books</hi>
(saith he) <hi>they that live under a Monarchy conceive
such an opinion, that the subjects in a popular Common-wealth
enjoy liberty; but that in a Monarchy they are all
slaves.]</hi> I wonder why he should impute this to the
Greek and Latine, more than to the Italians, Germans,
or Dutch stories. Certainly most people when they find
their own condition hard, are willing to change, and
think any other would be better; and it is the same
with all other Common-wealths, as well as Monarchies;
And therefore he truly added what follows <hi>[I say, that they
who live under a Monarchy conceive such an opinion;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96149:115"/>
not they that live under popular government: for they find no
such matter.</hi> But as I said before why this should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the Romans, and Grecians only; not to the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,
Germans, and others who live equally with them
in Common-wealths, I cannot discerne; and therefore

to confirm his conclusion (stronger I think, than any he
produced,) which is, that dominion is over persons not
parts; he who hath dominion over the Soul hath dominion
over the body, which is governed by the Soul; and he
who hath dominion over the body hath likewise dominion

the power of conduct and command (which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
faculty) on one man; and the power of making laws,
(which is the rational faculty,) on the accidental consent not
only of those two, but also of a third.</hi> There he turns his
spleen against our Government in <hi>England,</hi> without name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, but clearly intimating that state and condition
which is fundamental to the constitution of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
I cannot imagine why, unless he had a mind to
provoke the then present Usurper to be most tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
in his Government. For certainly this Government as
established in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> at the first, was setled with
so grave and weighty consideration, and such a serious
manner of confirmation, as never any but the Law of
God delivered on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> (with thunder, and such
astonishments) and in it self so prudent, that nothing
can reasonably more conduce to the perpetuity of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
But let us see what he saith <hi>(there is</hi> (saith he)
<hi>more than one Soul.)</hi> I think it would trouble his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
to answer these Arguments which are brought by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96149:116"/>
those Philosophers who assert there are more in every
man, as also to prove the contrary. But I let that alone,
there is no enforcing that from this establishment; for all
these several operations (which he speaks of) do arise from
the same Soul; so that the lowest, even the giving of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to our King, is by his Authority, and that power is
ensouled (as I may speak) by him. But as he is the
Soul by which his subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cts are enabled to leavy such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for his necessity and the necessities of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
so they are the body which must act by this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
he enables them, for without his assent they cannot
leavy that money from any but their own particular
purses; this he compares to the Nutritive faculty, and indeed
not amiss; for as that faculty is dispersed throughout the
whole man and each part of him w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ich doth receive nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so these are dispersed throughout the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and indeed they in particular, and the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in general receives nutriment in being protected in
prosperity and safety, which the Monarch is enabled to
do by these supplies. But yet he is mistaken in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
when he calls this an act of the nutritive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> to leavy money, that is afterwards an act
of the King, who makes use of that assistance, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
this in the first act of bare leavying mony, looks
like an act of exhausting or consumption rather than nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.
But as wise nature disposed those contributions,
which the singular parts sometimes afford the fainting
stomach by a return to their advantage afterwards so doth
the wisdome of a King make those payrings from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts produce their greater happiness and plenty: but
still observe, this is not as if there were many, but one
Soul. All is acted by the supreme power which enables
the other to perform, what he doth. From hence he
passeth to the King, <hi>(The power of conduct and command
is (which is the motive faculty on one man.)</hi> Why he
should call this the motive faculty I do not perceive,
since that is Philosophically seated in the sensitive or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96149:117"/>
certainly be in the supreme and rational part, for where
that is, it commands and governs the sensitive so that
they move or acquiesce according to its conduct. But I

in particular to the Lords; let them vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and the House of Commons themselves, I shall
only meddle with the inconveniences which arise out of
this policie which he begins immediately to fall upon, <hi>this
endangereth the Common-wealth, sometimes for want of consent
to good Laws</hi> This danger I never found, but many times the
stop of evil Laws which have been projected by private men,
or perhaps might pass one house, &amp; faults which have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by one which were not taken notice of by the other.
A multitude of Councellors gives safety to laws; a weaker
understanding many times sees that which a greater over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked:
that which appears lovely to some, may be known
to be faulty by others. But certainly these two houses
being compounded of men of all conditions who must
needs be acquainted with all the unhappinesses in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
cannot but be thought most fit to have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aming
and passing Laws for the Government. He
goes on, <hi>but often for want of such nourishment as is most
necessary to life and motion.]</hi> I doubt this can hardly be
made out where the necessity of such contributions shall
be made appear, but at such times when his rebellious
principles have been infused, for without doubt where
such necessities are the necessities of the Kingdome, and
the King lacks the supplies proper to such motions as war
defensive and offensive, the very state and condition of
every man is endangered, and his doctrine of self-preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
will compel men to it, although they cast one eye
upon the publick. But such things he will say have been
done: it is true that the niggardliness of the People to such
expences have brought the kingdome to destruction, I can
call it no less; the same may be said of some Kings whose
too much frugality has made them lack both men and
hearts to serve their occasions. There is nothing humane
that is not subject to error, and a possibility of being
mistaken. But certainly this as little as any, because this
assembly (as he calls them) are men selected for their
estates and prudence, and because they are prudent,
it is likely they are able, and because of their estates, it is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96149:118"/>
reasonable to think that they should be willing to give
their best assistance to the publick good. He goes on,
<hi>for although few perceive that such government, is not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but division of the Common wealth into three
factions, and call it mixt Monarchie</hi> Indeed I think that
never m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n did conceive that this Government is not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> doth govern his servants, yet his
government is limited with many more bounds than this is,
and yet that is a government; he cannot take their cloaths
from them, or their Estates, much less their lives or
limbs, yet he is their Governour. And though he saith
only a few did perceive, yet I think until he wrote this
none did ever perceive three factions; factions do oppose
one another, they are not joyned, neither do they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate
in the same effect, as these do in all things which
are done by them. And in this business it seems not to
be a co-operation of equal shares in the work, but like
an univ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sun with the same light shines upon a Rose, a Violet, and
a Primrose. Yet with these particular specifical causes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
those various effects with those several subordinate
powers to his, but they were not instituted for factions,
nor are such, but subordinate to him, and to concurr with
him in the legal settlement of that is good for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:
it was therefore very ill phrased of him, to call <hi>the
factions a mixt Monarchie.</hi> For my part I am of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
which I have expressed before, that there is no
Government in the World so pure, that it hath no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in it, either Monarchy, Aristocracy or Democracy,
but the denomination in all these is from the predominant
part; <hi>yet,</hi> (saith he) <hi>the truth is, that it is not one Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Common wealth; but three Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which I hope, he shall never be able to do either with
this book or any other; <hi>and</hi> (saith he <hi>not one represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative

heretofore spoken to. In a Monarchie the Monarch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

no more than the head can be termed the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
of man, he is the head of this body politick, and
governs it, but not represents it. He is so fond of that
conceipt (as indeed it is the foundation of his whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie)
that the error mixeth it self in almost every page.
But let us go on with him. <hi>[In the kingdome of God there
may be three Persons Independent, without breach of unity in
God that reigneth.]</hi> Yes by him there may be twenty, a
hundred, or a thousand, and indeed are so many; for as he
makes a Person to be a man who represents another as <hi>Moses</hi>
did God (of which I have treated at large in my former part
against him) certainly there was a thousand such which
represented him in his Kingdome in this World; and
therefore this instance is nothing to the purpose, especially
concerning the representation here treated of. <hi>Yes</hi> (saith
he) <hi>this is without breach of unity in God who reigneth.</hi>
There can be no doubt of it, for though God be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by a thousand several men, his unity is the same.
And I may say of a King though he be represented in divers
Provinces by divers Vice-royes, yet he is the same King
and the only King. <hi>But where men reign that are subject
to diversity of opinions</hi> (saith he) <hi>it cannot be so.</hi> What
doth he mean by that? I think that where divers men are
supremes that have divers opinions, there will be breach of
Unity; For perfect Unity there is none such but in God,
who b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing without composition is absolutely not one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the concrete, as created things are, but Unity which
nothing else is, as there is no one man who is so at unity in
himself, as not to differ from himself, now judging one
thing, then another; yea at the same time, he may have
combustion in himself by diversity of Arguments which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
in his thoughts at the same time so that he cannot
imagine any perfect Unity amongst men: but yet when
there is a subordination, that reduceth them to the nearest
method of unity that may be; therefore where there
shall be many supremes without subordination, there can
be no unity: But where there is a subordination there
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96149:119"/>
we may find the greatest unity that this subject is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, which will appear by my answer to what follows.</p>

goods exclusiv of the Soveraigns right to the use of the same.]</hi>
I have heretofore taught that men have proprieties in their
estates, yet in cases of necessity, as in War, any mans
house may be made a fort, any mans land digged to make
a trench, with multitudes of the like Nature, according to
the necessities and exigencies of the Common-wealth There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this propriety without necessity cannot be dangerous,
nay, a man may say, that without this propriety we should
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96149:120"/>
not have a legal, but arbitrary Government, and that which
he himself hath supposed to be the reason why a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
is instituted would be frustrated, which is
that men may peaceably sow and reap, and enjoy the profits
of their industrie; which if the supreme might lawfully take
away together with their estates for the support of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
it would quickly come to pass that an Estate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
in the Crown may be the prey of other Subjects,
as it was with the Church revenue, which although in
Queen ELIZABETHS time it was alienable to none
but the Crown, yet we know that from thence it passed to
mean Tenents, until King JAMES most happily gave a
stop unto it, by enacting that there should be none after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
passed to the Crown; so that this cannot fitly be
termed a hinderance, without which a Common-wealth
loseth the end for which it was instituted. But give me
leave to speak to the main proposition it self. Why should
it be difficult to raise just summes for the defence or good
of the publick? every man hath an interest in it, and they
are reasonable creatures, which will consider both their
own and the publick benefit. I, but he will say it hath
been so; let this be granted, it is true that all sins
and wickednesses have been too, and certainly this is
a mighty great one. But let him consider, whether this
way of their consent to the performance of this duty be
not a decent way of doing it. For first, we may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that few Persons of great estate do know their own
estate, much less a Monarch of a great kingdom. How
then can he be able to give a just esteem of every private
mans estate to proportion him justly to that service? this
cannot be done but by such Persons who are universally
acquainted with the generality: and without an equality
upon some legal measure the Tax will be unjust and the
execution (no doubt worse. Secondly as to the making
a Tax for such a supply the Commonaltie are necessary,
for by them the Collection will be more speedy than by
any other means, and therefore I think it a difficulty
which may easily be taken away, by letting them see, what
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96149:121"/>
necessity there is of such an aid, (I mean not to meddle
with these disputes,) and then no doubt but they will be
so prudent in the execution of their trust, as to give a
proper assistance, or else they are mad or worse. I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this point with that passage in those incomparable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
which that ever to be honored King CHARLES the
First gave his son in his own words (which none else can
imitate nearly, much less match) speaking of the Laws of
this land which he should govern by, saith, <hi>[Which by an
admirable temperance give very much to subjects industry,
liberty and happiness, and yet reserve enough to the Majesty
and prerogative of any King who ownes his People as subjects,
not as slaves.]</hi> And I may say who can add any thing to
what this most incomparable King hath writ down which
is matchless? Yea what he speaks afterwards of the shifts
Kings are put to, and the Comparison Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> makes
of this disease to an ague, I let pass, and do only affirm
that such discourses savour of an ill disposition to this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and as I can guess, can tend to no good; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then when they were first printed nor afterwards. I
mean to trouble the Reader no further with his observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of these lesser diseases, as he terms them, in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
but come close to a censure of this which I have
formerly noted in this Book.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The conclusion of all; the Authors just censure of this book
of Mr. Hobbs.</head>
                  <p>FIrst I affirm, that it is not a book to be tolerated by Kings
or supremes: because according to his doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the original of all such there is none in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
World: for if it be necessary (as he saith it is in the 17
Chap. where he handles the <hi>generation of Common-wealths,</hi>
and in the 18 Chap. where he sets down the <hi>institution of a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96149:121"/>
Common wealth,</hi> and in the 13 Chap. <hi>This only is the way to erect a
Common wealth, which way, &amp;c.</hi> Now if this be the only
way which have shewed not only not to be practised but not
practicable, there not only is none in the World, but there can
be none hereafter, and therefore this doctrine is not to be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
either by them who think themselves supremes, or may
hereafter be such, because they neither are nor shall be such
supremes as he describes, and they (by his doctrine) ought to be.</p>
                  <p>Again it is to be abhorred by supremes, because it leaves too
easie and open a gap, yea a countenance for rebellion: for if the
Law of Nature be only to take care for a mans own particular
(as he saith it is) and that every man should endeavour and
ought by any means to free himself from death or wounds, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing which may render his life unhappy, how easie it is for
these suggestions to be whispered in the ear, of people upon any
mishap in government, without which none can be, let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
think. (I will not teach him.) So that by this doctrine the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from private misery may justify the execution of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ruine. So that whether we look upon the generation of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premes,
(concerning which there neither is nor can be any such,)
or upon the preservation thereof, there is according to his
doctrine, no security in the throne of soveraignty, but it may
justly be disturbed by their subjects upon any terrors struck in
them from a jealousie that they may be deprived of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
being.</p>
                  <p>Now as this book is dangerous for Kings and Supremes; so it
is in some conclusions destructive to the Comfort &amp; happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of subjects, when he takes away their propriety: for if they
have no title to the enjoyment of their lives and estates, but these
must be at the will of the Lord only (that is of the supreme)
which he affirmed but a little before, then the very end of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is lost, which is that men may quietly enjoy the fruits of their
own vertue and industry, may sow and reap, work and receive
the benefit of their labour without fear of loss or injury. It is
true that there is an impossibility that there should be any such
thing, but to that man who is guarded by Gods providence,
who alone can foresee and deliver a man from all danger: But yet
humane providence, with good Laws and Vertuous execution of
them may protect men in safety against all humane oppression,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96149:122"/>
which in wisely settled Common-wealths ought to be done; and
although a Supreme may by force wring from a subject what is his,
yet he doth it unjustly and shall be responsible for it to his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
which again he hath denyed by saying that a Soveraign
can doe nothing unjustly. So that in such a Case there is no room
for any man who may have his Estate taken away without injustice,
(that is, justly without breach of Law.) It is not fit then to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
by Soveraignes, or Subjects.) I may yet go further and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it not fit to be tolerated by Christians, because it robs them
of all Assurance of heaven, and all the Covenants of God by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they have no assurance that their holy Books are reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God, which if it were true, their confidence and trust in
Gods promises are vain, and all the Religion performed to our
Blessed Saviour, which only depends upon that assurance they
have of the Revelation made in that Book.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is not to be tolerated by those Theists who think there
is a God; because all such do think that this God hath many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
attributes; Is infinite in Essence, infinite in all his attributes,
power, wisdom, justice, mercy; all which do propagate in men
a fear and love of him, and are in themselves so excellent, that the
least of them (if any one may be said the least) is to be valued by
every knowing man beyond a world: yet his legislator, his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
must have power to Eclipse this glorious Sun, and to have so
much as he will, and no more be revealed of him.</p>
                  <p>Again, this glorious God is by all Theists apprehended to be the
governour of Heaven and Earth, rewarder of good men and a
punisher of all such as work wickedness, when he makes him to
reward only and punish his own decrees and acts, not those of
men; And therefore I think it a Book not to be suffered amongst
Christians, and I am confident, would not be tolerated amongst
such kingdomes which do not acknowledge our Saviour, but
only one God.</p>

               <p>IN my Epistle before this Treatise, I have said that I
heard of some amendments Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> would make in
his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and upon that stop'd these papers
which were intended for the Press; being desirous
rather that he should do it himself with his own hand,
than I; a work which would be very beneficial to his
own soul, and more satisfactory to those Readers upon
whom his name had gain'd an Authority; but after a
tedious expectation, I found nothing corresponding to
my Expectation. Wherefore I urged this Treatise to
the Press, where I thought to have it Printed when I
came to <hi>London;</hi> but I was no sooner arrived, than a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
Cold locked me up in my Chamber, which gave me
leasure to enquire after him whilest these Notes were
Printing, and found that he had Printed his <hi>Leviathan</hi> in
<hi>Latine,</hi> which I never before had notice of; I sent for it
and viewed it, hoping that it might prove the designed
retractation as St. <hi>Aug.</hi> calls his, or at least a recogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls his of the like nature; but truly I
found little to that purpose, only the virulency of some
English Phrases, now and then more gently expressed in

I found an Appendix consisting of three Chapters, the
first of which was of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, the second of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
the third an Answer to some Objections against his

is not in the Creed, for the language of the Creed is (I
believe in one God the Father Almighty) in which it is
not said there is a God, but supposed, and he affirmed
to be one, and he the Father Almighty, so that if we
must be forc'd to make one or more propositions of it,
they must be these (I believe there is one, and only one
God, and that he is Father Almighty,) where is, is a
copula not a substantive as he makes it; and upon which
he makes his discourse, but I let it pass as he might well

my part I cannot observe where the force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lies, to prove that <hi>lumen,</hi> or light, is a meer Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm
or nothing, this light shews the Candle, or if he
will, represents it, now what represents another must be
like it; but nothing cannot be like a thing, being clean

it, therefore if light were nothing, it could not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

many candles appear, <hi>to wit,</hi> by the reflection of those
many plains of glass, but surely this no way enforceth
his conclusion, for every one of these plaines (for all I
know) represents the true Candle, and are so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing, as they must therefore be something; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they represent something; but they may by a false
reflection multiply the Candle, and make it seem many;
what if it does? Does the erroneous representing make
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96149:124"/>
the representor nothing? certainly no; for then every
man who tells a lye should say nothing; for that lye is a
false representation; we see that light makes us see the
Candle from whence it comes; and indeed any body
else in the Rom where it is; truly, if it be not abused
by some <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the glass, which returns the representing light wrong
ways, not in the light it self, which is retorted, he might
therefore from hence fitter call that nothing, which abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the <hi>medium,</hi> than the light which is abused; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in the same place with a strangely unnecessary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

I need repeat no more if there be strength in any
part of his discourse it is in this; but here is none, for
although none of these Images of the Candle, is the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
yet they are things, such things as did represent the
Candle, for the Candle could not be represented to the
eye, by that which is nothing, the thing that represents
another and that which is represented are two, but both
of them must be things, or neither; but now it may be
replyed to me that this is not Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his opinion, but

                  <p>NOw I can observe one thing, which is too frequent a
fallacy throughout his Book, which is a changing
his Termes, which ought not to be when a man brings a
Philosophical reason for what he speaks; this appears in
those main and substantial Termes of this discourse, to
wit, extinguishing fire in the first proposition, and that
inlarging which fallows extinguisht, <hi>&amp; ad nihilum redigere,</hi>
to annihilate it. Oertainly as nothing can create but God,
so nothing can annihilate but he himself, for annihilation
is reducing a thing to nothing, as Creation is a produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

now although nothing can annihilate but God, yet not
only man, but many inferiour creatures to man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish

this, if man by his own sole power should do it; this

it be hard to think so; I hope the Almighty cannot be

he should, we may produce those invincible instances
which are formerly given, and thousand more to prove
the contrary, where God hath given to creatures infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to man, abilities to do such works, as water, earth,
and the like; yea, fire hath such a power to dry up water,
to destroy wood, and the like. And indeed, let him but
consider how any man hath a power given him of God,
by which he is enabled to destroy another man, a much
more noble creature than fire, and then it need not be
thought strange that he should have the abilities to do
the less; there is enough I think spoke to this.</p>

as when we see a man in his cloaths cloathed; it is more

<hi>colour to be nothing but perturbed Light, or light by reflection

is light, then it must be something, not a meer phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasme,
a nothing as he tearms it; nay, I dare affirm, if it
be but a phantasme, yet it is something, <hi>ens intentionale,</hi>
although not a <hi>reale,</hi> an intentional, although not a real
thing; for first consider, it is the work of a noble power,
the Phancy, if we take it for the operation, which is the
art of Phancying any thing, but if you take it for that
eminent effect which is wrought by that operation, and
left in the memory, it must be something, and has an abode
and being there, it must needs be something therefore, so
that if we consider these colours only in the Phansie, they
are something if we consider them as he hath taught us,
in that being they have without our heads, they are real
things; but to write to that which most especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
upon me my self, that colour is nothing, I could
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96149:126"/>
wish the reader so much leasure as to peruse what I have
writ in my former treatise, and he will find that Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>
hath neither answered those arguments I there produced,
nor confuted any answer I gave to his arguments; I will
add something more, and consider <hi>(good Reader)</hi> if it be not
rational; that which not only works real effects, (which I
have formerly shewed invincibly that <hi>Colours</hi> do) but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in its self suffers change must needs be something; for
nothing cannot be changed, it is a pure non-entity,
and will be so alwayes, and when it is changed upon
any supposition of such a thing, it must be changed
to something: Now colours we see changed from
white, to redder or greener, and therefore must needs
be something: If he shall say, it is but a diverse ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
we shall cleare that by the examination of his
following discourse, which is this, <hi>Quam apparitionem,</hi>
which apparition without some cause and foundation
we sufficiently understand is impssible, <hi>viz.</hi> white can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without some substance to subsist to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
which is its cause, and as <hi>Logicians</hi> speak, its
subject here is a great deal of truth in this discourse,
but I can find nothing that Proves his conclusion,
which is, that colour is nothing, nay, I will retort his
discourse to him and prove his conclusion false by it,
which thus I do, That which subsists to <hi>White</hi> must
subsist to something, or else that which requires or
needs something to subsist to it, must be something,
for nothing is nothing, and needs nothing to subsist
to it, nor can any thing be said to subsist to nothing,
for any entity added to nothing, makes it something,
which is most abhorring to nothing. Again, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath a cause is somthing, but these <hi>Apparitions</hi>
have a cause according to him here and elsewhere,
for as he makes refracted light in other places to be
the cause, so here he makes the subject to be the cause
of them, the major is evident, for nothing can cause
nothing, for although God by his almighty hand can
annihilate any thing what he pleaseth, yet that anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96149:127"/>
is not so properly a production of nothing,
as a destruction of a Being; for there is no existence
of that nothing, either to or in another, but a take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of that Being which did formerly exist; so
that there can be no Existence of nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to say that nothing is supported or subsisted by
a Substance, seems to be a contradiction: That which
follows in this <hi>Paragraph,</hi> is nothing to his purpose,
I let it pass therefore, and come to <hi>Page</hi> 340. and

why should we then be troubled with nothing?
or that sharpness which enabled the knife or bullet

meer names? which certainly, as such hurt no man,
or that they are meer phantasmes? can any man think
that the meer phantasme of one man can warm, cool,
or hurt another? I remember, I think, I have read in
<hi>Parnelsus, That if one mans inward man be too hard for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

Author, having not my books about me, but I have

those habits which dispose any man to a ready acting

the Divine glory,</hi> (that is his Translation) and therefore he
adds, <hi>sive,</hi> or which is the same, <hi>lumen de Lucido,</hi> light out
of a lucid body (so I render his words, for <hi>Lucidum</hi> or the
light body, is the subject or substance, and light is the
accident, or nothing rather which proceeds out of it; so
that by this Philosophy, the Father should be a substance,
and the Son but an accident, or nothing: Let us go on
with him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 11. And the first faith is called the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis
of things hoped for,</hi> that is (saith he) <hi>for the Speech is
Metaphorical)</hi> Faith is the Fundament of hope: Now
Reader, by his Philosophy, Faith should be a substance,
a body, (for he allows no other substance but bodies)
which without doubt is a quality inhaerent in the Soul,
and by him the things hoped for, or (to give him what
scope his words can bear) the hope of future blessings
which is founded upon faith is nothing, or at the best but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96149:128"/>
a Phancy: He produceth another Text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 4.
where I do not find the word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> nor any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to his intent: But now, that the Reader may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
how these Texts are abused by him, I will lend such
assistance to him as my present conceipt administers to
my self; let him consider how in the first to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
the 3. it is said, that the Son of God is the brightness of
his glory, here first is not any mention of <hi>Lumen de Lucido,</hi>
of Light proceeding out of a Lucid body, as he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it; but the splendor or most Illustrious appearance
of that unutterable Glory, which was manifested by the
Incarnation of the Son of God, and his conversation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us in the flesh, which indeed clouding and vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the extremity of that infinite glory which was in the
Deity, with his humanity, he made it more clearly and
brightly appear to us then it could have been discerned
by humane eyes without it, and in that regard he may
well be said to be the brightness of his Glory, because it
made that glory which was invisible in its self, visible to
us, and those glorious Attributes with it, which were
not possible for Nature to reach, or any way compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
to be apprehended by Faith in him, the Son; And
in all this we find neither substance, nor substantiated,
which should be founded upon it; But then to proceed
to the second passage in that verse, which he made the
first, (and the express Image or Character of his person)
conceive Reader if you can, how it is possible to make
an Image of substance meerly substance, not cloathed
with any accident, colour, figure, or any such thing which
is subject to sense, for these are the only things by which
we can Caracterize any thing, and these are not in God,
this Image or Character thereof must needs be some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
thing, and that must needs be some substantial
thing, and that must be represented to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(not the sense) which only can apprehend substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
especially abstracted from all accidents; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whose Character it must be, to wit Gods, who is
infinite, immense, unimmaginable, unintelligible, not to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96149:129"/>
be represented by any thing less than himself, it must
needs therefore be another of the same, another it must
be, because the Representors and the Represented must
be Two, the same it must be, because nothing, no Art
or Conceipt or any thing, can imagine any thing to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize
God but God; here then in clear termes are
two Persons and one Nature; and not his imagination of
a substance and accident, or indeed nothing.</p>
                  <p>Then we will explain his second place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. faith
is there the <hi>Hypostasis</hi> of things hoped for, we read it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
there will be no difference about that, he ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
confesseth it to be a Metaphor, and surely so it is,
and the likeness consists in this, that as a substance is it
out of which accidents are produced, which supports and
maintains them; so hope (as he expounds it) or the
things hoped for, that is the blessings of God either in
this or the other world (for Gods blessings in this world
may be hoped for) arise out of Faith, in which God hath
founded them, and which is the sole and only thing by
which God hath Covenanted to continue and preserve
them to us; thus taking it Metaphorically, as he, but then
take it litterally, as the Schools distinguish <hi>subjectum quo,</hi>
and <hi>subjectum quod,</hi> a subject by which this subsists in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a subject which supports really the inherent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident;
so may I speak of substance, or <hi>fundamentum,</hi> the
foundation of hope without doubt is the reasonable soul
of man, out of which this act or habit is produced, and
to which it doth adhere or inhere; this soul is the <hi>subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi>
or <hi>fundamentum quod,</hi> but faith the substance, or <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum
quo;</hi> by the mediation of which, hope is there
fixed and setled; for he that hopes for blessings from
God, without Gods revealed promises, which are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
only by faith, trusts in his own wit, not in God:
thus this Text being explained, there is no violation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to any Term, but each word hath its proper and
genuine signification, and it lays open a clear and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
truth, which cannot be denyed; but contrarywise
by his explanation, every word is wrested out of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96149:129"/>
sense and meaning; for faith which is an accident, a
habit, must be a substance, hope to exist in the Aire
where is no foundation, no substance to support it.</p>

as if to inhere, or adhere, were not to exist, but
only subsistance were existance; but I shall prosecute this
no further now, it being a conclusion to which I do not
remember that I have objected any thing heretofore,
which are the only things I intended to vindicate in this
paper; next he enters upon a long discourse how the
Greeks and Latines have distorted names as he termes it,
which I omit upon the same reason before, although a
most unhappy perswasion of his; But in pag. 342. in his
discourse of a person, he opposeth what I have delivered
in my 34 Cap. against his sixteenth, which I find much
alter'd in his Latine Edition, and if the Reader will
trouble himself so much as to peruse that Treatise of
mine, he will find that Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> hath added nothing here
that was not in the former, nor answered any thing of
my discourse, which I doubt not to affirm, doth much
more clearly explain the nature of a person, then any
thing he hath put down for it; and I will pass the rest
of this Cap. as not opposing my former censures of him;
so likewise his second Cap. of Heresie, which was only
writ to excuse himself from Heresie, which I never

Heretick, because <hi>Leviathan</hi> must be supream judge, but
withal, I think he doth deliver Heretical Doctrine; and
that that very conclusion is one, according to the Laws

as they had against all Authority, until they had
made themselves sole Governors: yet their cheif aime
was to pluck down the Regals, and in order to that, it
was necessary first to take down Episcopy, which was a
support of it; and indeed you shall find that almost all
Treasons do pretend Religion; that under the cloak of
holyness, they may cover such horrid impieties as must
be acted by such parties: It is in vain to give instances
which are much too frequent: but then as he well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,

I go on, <hi>&amp; jura quidem Regalia, (saith he) the rights of

and spiritual matters:</hi> here I must pause, and in a little,
put down somethings more Largly delivered in the
preceeding Treatise; he hath supervindicated the Kingly
authority in spirituall things, for he hath made him above
God himself; so that if God himself command one thing
in his word, and the King command another, we
must obey the King; he hath done as much in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

he gives Ahab leave rightly to take Naboths vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard;

               <p>THat which immediately follows his making God a
Body, which is abominable, but I will not speak
of it here but page 361. towards the bottome he enters
upon a third Objection, which I have censur'd in my
former Treatise, <hi>Cap. 13. Sect.</hi> 4. which is thus framed by
(A) the Objector, <hi>Timor inquit invisibilium potentiarum,</hi> the
fear of invisible powers, whether those powers be
feigned by the man who fears, or conceived from
Fables publickly permitted, is Religion; but from
them which are not publickly permitted, Superstition;
<hi>quando vero,</hi> when the powers which are feared are true,
it is true Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Objection; and first I commend his <hi>Latine</hi>
Edition better then the <hi>English,</hi> for in his <hi>Latine</hi> Edition
he changed this word (Fables) which is used amongst us
for a vain or foolish relation, and put in Hystories, which
hath a more graceful acceptance; so that the sense is,
that Religion is drawn from Histories publickly permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which is a milder expression, although the best will
be bad enough, as you shall see presently.</p>
               <p>That fear, and reverential fear of these invisible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
is an Act of Religion, I think no wise man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but that Religion should be shallowed up with fear,
and should be nothing else (as he seems to require) is too
much; for therefore in that 6 Cap. where these words
are, (as that Cap. consists of nothing but definitions, and
these definitions pointed at in the Margent) he puts in
the Margent against this (Religion) so that this was his
definition of Religion, of which it is but one single Act,
there being many more of a higher nature proceeding
out of it; for Religion being as I defined it, and as it is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96149:131"/>
generally used, that part of Justice by which we give
God that Honour and Worship is due to him; certainly,
faith in what he speaks, trust and hope in what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth,
Love of those excellencies which we discern in
him, are much more requisite and due to God then any
fear, but a Reverential fear which flowes out of those
other; fear opposeth trust, and faith, and love: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
again, he divides Religion only according to the
divers application of this fear to the object; so that
one way it is Religion, another Superstition, if conceived
of Histories, permitted Religion, if otherwise Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
when the powers are true powers, it is true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
any man may draw the other conclusion out of these
premises, if the powers be false, it is false Religion.</p>

                  <p>AGain, consider that he puts these Termes <hi>Powers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,</hi>
without any limitation; so that the fear of
Angels or Devils is Religion; for although he seems to
be against the spirituality of those dominions good or
bad, (of which, God willing, I mean to treat more fully
hereafter) yet he doth not deny them to be invisible,
and then the fear of them must be Religion, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is only due to God, and therefore not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in that generality; but this is only an objection
by (A) let us see what (B) answers; His answer is thus,
<hi>Idem asseritur,</hi> the same is asserted by <hi>Ecclesia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>es, The fear
of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom.</hi> I will not examine
the place where it is, I remember the sentence perfectly,
but do wonder what he can collect hence for his purpose;
this fear <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> speaks of, is the fear of the Lord, his,
of invisible Powers; there are other powers invisible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
which are governed and commanded by him, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96149:132"/>
therefore he deserves all awe, fear, and reverence from
us; but they, some of them, I mean the ill Angels or
Devils, hatred and contempt as is evident; so that the
fear of the Lord is one thing, and the fear of the Invisible
powers is another, much more large then the former:
Again, <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> saith, <hi>That the fear of the Lord is the beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of wisdom,</hi> when without question Religious worship
is that which perfects a man so far as he is capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in this world, and is the perfection of wisdom;
and therefore out of this Text it cannot be deduced,
that the fear of Invisible powers is Religion, which is
mans chief perfection: Consider good Reader the truth
of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> how it consists with what I have deliver'd;
when a man shall be taught that there is an invisible
Agent, who by his Almighty power, and Infinite wisdom,
made and still governs this Universe, and will one day
judge us men according to our works; then he trembles
at the apprehension of it, and that causeth him to seek
out which way he may please him, and stop the fury
of his wrath from falling upon him, and act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly:
Thus wisdom is begun, but afterwards this
same man out of these beginnings, proceeds to search
out Gods will and believe it, to trust and rely upon his
promises, to be enamoured with God, and delighted
with his excellencies, with following Acts far exceed in
the worship of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Honour, that first of fear
only; so that although the fear of God may introduce
and begin Religion, yet unless a man go further, it is not
Religion, nor that it is can that Text prove, but he hath
another Text which I wonder what he can do with it to
this purpose, which is,</p>

in these? and yet there is less consequence in it, if a man
will consider his proposition to be proved hence, it is
not that fear is the Religion paid to God, but to invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

say in their hearts there is no God; that is, such as he is

Aristotle to be, so that although he and others may
think there is no such God as we conceive, yet they

hath amended the matter, did God in Creating the

in any Divinity Writer; he that bears the person of any
man or thing, must be another from that thing which he
bears, but in this he destroys his bearing the person of
God, when he affirms, he did it in his own, <hi>in propriâ

is to the worse, but I return from whence I came, to
<hi>Moses</hi> again, in which I referr'd the Reader to my former

the Second Person in the Trinity after <hi>Moses,</hi> and that of

such saying, as God in <hi>propriâ personâ,</hi> God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

personâ</hi> is not there, nor I think in any confession
of any Christian Church, to be used for the Father;
all three are proper Persons, no one more then other,
neither doth the Catechism use that very phrase Person in
that whole answer, for it is thus, <hi>I believe in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who hath made me, and all the world,</hi> not that he made
it in <hi>propriâ personâ,</hi> for it was the work of the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

Father which made the world, no one word
which signifieth one person to be more proper then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Secondly, in God the Son, who hath Redeemed
me and all mankind; it is true, this Redemption being a
glorious effect of the Death and Sufferance of Christ,
which must needs be acted in his humanity, which was
united to his Divinity, to the second Person <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

hath a most proper termination in the Son; so that
I do yield it must be implyed that it was acted in the
Son, but it is not expressed; and therefore, although it
was materially the same, yet formally it was not, and he
said more then was in the Catechism; and for the last, it
is not said in the Catechism that God in the Person of
the Holy Ghost did Sanctify his Church, but in God the
Holy Ghost who sanctifieth me, and all the Elect People
of God, which although God the Holy Ghost in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism
be the same with the third Person, yet he is not
called so there, and we may mark, that although these
three Persons are put down in the Catechisme, as foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of those great Blessings comminicated to man; yet
no where is any called proper person of God more then
the other, nor is any of those blessings appropriated to
any person exclusively, shutting out the other; so that
although it is said, God the Father, who made me, it is
not said without the Son of which abundance of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
affirms he made the World, and Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> dealt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsomly
with our Catechism, when he forced such a

for when the Objector immediately after urged that
Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> used that Language in divers places, he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>That all of them might receive that Exposition;</hi> but he a
little further explains himself thus, <hi>Vel si dixisset,</hi> or (saith
he) <hi>if he had said God in his proper person, had constituted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Church by the Ministry of</hi> Moses, <hi>in the person of his Son
had redeemed the same; in the person of the holy Ghost, had
sanctified the same, he had not erred:</hi> Thus far he, but it
seems to me strange that both these should be without
Errors, for they are extreamly different; in the first God
in his proper person to Create the World, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
in his proper person by the Administration of <hi>Moses</hi>
to constitute a Church; but that phrase of, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
person, is unheard of amongst any who are not with
it called Hereticks; for if God the Father did any of
those great works in his proper person, then the Son did
not operate in them, which is against the whole sense of
Scripture, <hi>Joh. 1. 3. All things were made by him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him was nothing made that was made,</hi> Of which I have
treated at large in my former Piece with much more,
which is to be seen in every Writer upon this Subject, or
else the same must be the very person of the Father,
which is horrid Divinity, or else not a proper, but an
improper person of the Deity, which is alike hateful:
Then consider his next proposition, that God in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Son did redeem the same; what is that he calls
the same? surely that was the Church of the <hi>Israelites</hi> only,
for <hi>Moses</hi> constituted no other Church; then Christ Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed
them only, when before in the former opposition,
according to our Church Catechisme he Redeems Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
which is much larger then the Church which <hi>Moses</hi>
constituted; and then last of all, when he saith, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96149:135"/>
God in the person of the Holy Ghost did sanctifie the
same, it is too narrow for his former proposition, which
was, that in the Person of the Holy Ghost, God did San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
the Church which is much larger then the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
which was constituted by <hi>Moses;</hi> and when he
said he had not Erred, if he had phrased it after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
I say it is evident he had erred, and erred grievously
in expressing himself either of these ways.</p>

and bowed in the house, not to <hi>Rimmon,</hi> but if he had, I
think I may boldly say, that Idolatry, worshiping a false
God, is not so bad as to deny a true one; and therefore,
if he had worshipt <hi>Rimmon</hi> it had not been so bad, as to
deny Christ; but I deny that he did worship, or in that
act shew so much as a practical Idolatry; for to bow to
<hi>Baal,</hi> to bow to <hi>Rimmon,</hi> is the sin of Idolatry, not to be
in the house where <hi>Baal</hi> or <hi>Rimmon</hi> was, or to bow in that
house, which yet is all that is desired by him; If <hi>Elisha</hi>
had the thoughts which I have, that valedictions may
seem to imply a tacite assent of his to what he said, he
going no further in worshiping <hi>Rimmon;</hi> but he proves
it farther from the practise of the Primitive Church.</p>

pause,</hi> and indeed did when I read it, for I was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with that Councel, and the story of it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
no such easie Penance, whereupon being not in
my Study, I borrowed <hi>Binnius,</hi> and there found in his two
first Lections no such thing in the 19. Canon of either,
as he speaks of, or relating to it; in the 11. of both the
vulgar Editions, and the 19. of <hi>Pisanus</hi> I did; it would
be tedious to transcribe the words, but what is material
will easily appear in the canvassing his discourse; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
therefore first, that in his answer to the question,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96149:136"/>
he said it was lawful to obey his Prince, commanding to
deny Christ; how can any thing in this Cannon prove it
to be such, if it were only, as he said, condemning to be
amongst the Catechismens, this supposeth it a fault for
which a man should be amongst the Catechismens, this
supposeth it a fault for which he should be banished the
Communion, and on such terms as they were, it could
not be, unless they had thought it a hainous crime; then
I observe, that in that Eleventh Canon, as the vulgar, it
is said of those which prevaricated, without necessity, or
without the taking away their goods, or danger of the
life, as was done under the Tyranny of <hi>Lucinius;</hi> here is
not Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his case, <hi>Licinius</hi> persecuted Christians se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,
which being discerned by many a fearful Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
they would deny Christ before they came to suffer for
him, rather than put themselves in that hazard, just as
Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> would have men; afterwards repenting of that
fault, they would seek admittance into Gods mercies
communicated in the Church; what thinks the Councel?
Thus, although such men are adjudged unworthy of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
yet let benevolence be administred to them, or
as the other Reading, although they are unworthy of
mercy, yet let them have humanity shewed them: Here
you see what a severe judgment was past upon these men
for this Crime, that they are unworthy of any mercy in
themselves who should deny Christ, to flatter Princes;
but let us see the humanity judged, fit to use towards
them; it is true, the Church should imitate God, who
hath shut the Gates of Heaven to no penitent Soul, but
because the Church cannot have the All-seeing Eye of
God to discern who is penitent, but by the outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;
therefore the Councel sets down what shall
be thought a sufficient evidence of it. That which he

which were the Catechumens; for they were admitted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96149:137"/>
to hear the Catechistical Sermons Preached before they
went to Prayers, but not to the Communion of Prayers,
which kind of Penance too many men amongst us punish
themselves with; but this is not all, then let him detest
himself seven years more with all contrition, nor hath
the Councel done yet, let them communicate with the
people two years more in Prayer; so that here are twelve
years Penance, and if in this time he relapsed, he was to
begin again, and as it is expressed in other cases, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
his death to receive the Communion; and if he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

that out of Christian piety the <hi>Eucharist</hi> was given him

by our Saviour: Good God what easiness do we
find, it was not without Repentance, and how sharp that
was, we cannot tell, the word of God notifies that he
wept bitterly; and how powerful those tears wrought
upon our Saviour we know, so that it was hardly spoke
of him, and more then he could know to say it was easily;
and worse in his conclusion, when he said that horrid sin
might be committed without a fault, and that it was
lawful to do it; I am sure that fevere sentence which the
Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> lay upon it, and the bitter tears of St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> are no arguments for it; and the whole course of
Divinity delivered by our Saviour and Apostles, makes
against it, and the constant practise of holy and religious
men: for our Saviour, <hi>Luk. 9. 23. If any man will come after
me, he must deny himself, and take up the Cross and follow me.</hi>
Mark you, it is deny himself, not Christ, it is take up
his Cross, not cast it away and reject it; his Cross, that
is, all affliction which is upon him, as in this case he must
either Sin or bear it; thus it is laid upon him; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
there are other cases, but this is one and a main one.
Again, <hi>Mat. 33. He who denies me before men, him will I deny
before my Father who is in Heaven.</hi> What more pertinent and
close against his conclusion; and you may perceive, that
as we demean our selves towards Christ here, he will so
demean himself towards us hereafter; if we suffer for him,
we shall raign with him; if we forsake him to save this
life, we shall have no share in his life or death hereafter;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96149:138"/>
and surely if a man might lawfully deny Christ, it was a
strange folly, yea madness in all those glorious Martyrs,
who suffered such torments rather then they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
their Saviour. I have spoke of this before in this
very Treatise, and I see nothing opposed to any thing
there which was brought against his or for my conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
this might have been therefore spared.</p>

                  <p>BUt now Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> I again bespeak you, leave off the
Justification of such horrid Errors as this; consider,
if you intend to act according to this Doctrine, you can
have no part in Christ, he will reject you at the last day;
consider again that you have taught, and by that teaching
have tempted others to be of that Error, to love and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
this temporal life, before that eternal: An Atheistical
practice which men may easily be induced to entertain and
practise, when there is little reason produced for it; and
consider with your self, that although this is one of the
greatest sins a man can commit; yet according to that
ever honoured Councel in the Canon cited by you, there
is room for you in the Church here, and in Heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
if you prove penitent; Repent therefore of this
your wickedness, that God may according to his Sacred
Covenant, have Mercy upon you; Judge your self, that
you be not judged of the Lord; and make amends for
this publick Scandal you have given to the Church of
Christ; which I think since the first Conversion never had
any so publickly professed this Doctrine before <hi>Leviathan;</hi>
do it therefore in some publick Treatise, and that in
<hi>English,</hi> whereby there may be amends to those who have
been seduced by your Doctrines, and so Farewell; This
is all which concerns me in this Appendix of yours at
this time, therefore I meddle with nothing else.</p>
