            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey of whom this is said,
were that Multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whom the Apostles first
converted to the Christian
Faith. All together in one
word, they are called <hi>the
Church</hi> in the last verse of this Chapter. Which
being observed, it will soon appear what we
are to learn from these words.</p>
            <p>They teach us, <hi>First,</hi> What the Church of
Christ was in the Apostles days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33773:3"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What Church is now a true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or Branch of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That, having such a Church, it is
our duty to continue in it.</p>
            <p>Accordingly in my discourse on these words,
I shall endeavour to shew you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> a description of that Original Church
by all it's Tokens and Characters; which are
described in my Text to have been,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> the Apostles Doctrin,</p>
            <p>Secondly, their <hi>Fellowship,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, their Sacraments <hi>Breaking of Bread,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, their Worship of God, <hi>and Prayers.</hi>

                  </gap>y,</hi> I shall consider what Church in
our days hath those Characters of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Church. I shall shew, they are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
in that Church which will own them
in no other: They are through Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
in great Purity and Perfection in our
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I shall shew that it is the Duty of
every Christian to continue stedfastly; first
in the Church that hath these Characters, and
secondly in these things that are the Characters
of the Church, and thirdly to live sutably to
them in his whole Conversation.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>re I speak of the Characters of a
true Church, I ought to shew in few words
what it is that is to be known by them.</p>
            <p>The Church, <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> among Christians in
the largest use of the word, is the whole
Multitude of Believers joyned together in one
Body or Society under one Head <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Nicene Creed it is called, the <hi>Catholic
Apostolic</hi> Church. <hi>Apostolic,</hi> because it was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at first by the Apostles, and still retains
the Characters of their Original Church. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic,</hi>
that is, Universal; (for that is the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
English word,) because it is made up of
all those Particular Churches, of which every
one hath these Characters in my Text, and is
therefore a true part of the Catholic or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal.</p>
            <p>For the word <hi>Catholic,</hi> as fond of it as they
are now in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, If any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
of <hi>Rome,</hi> for some ages after Christ, had
heard any one say <hi>I am a Catholic,</hi> he would
not have been able to have guest what Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he had meant. But when the Greeks had
used the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in their language;
First, to distinguish the Christian Church as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to all Nations, from the Jewish which
was confined to one Nation in particular; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33773:4"/>
to distinguish the Common Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
which was in all parts of the World,
from that of a Sect which sprang up in
some particular Country: After this, the
word Catholic was taken up by them of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church. And in process of time they
came to distinguish themselves by it, from the
Greeks, and from those of the other Eastern
Churches that first used it.</p>
            <p>It could not but seem very strange to the
Greeks, to see them of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
whose Communion extended no farther at
that time, than only to the West part of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
that they should call the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
the Catholic, or Universal, in Opposition to the
Greeks, and to all other Christians, that then
possest, not only all the rest of this <hi>Europe,</hi>
but all that was Christian in <hi>Afric</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi>
besides. But this is not strange to any one
that considers, how natural it is for men of
any Sect to make a great Business about
Words. As they are apt to bestow the worst
words they can find upon their Adversaries, so
with the same Partiality they are ready to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
the good ones to themselves. Thus
the Jews will have none but themselves to be
<hi>the children of Abraham.</hi> The Turks will have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33773:4"/>
none but themselves to be called <hi>Musulmans,</hi>
Believers, The Arrian Heretics, in their Day,
would allow none but themselves to be <hi>Catholics,</hi>

only Catholics now, who can help it? But we
shall not allow it them, till they can prove all
other Christians to be <hi>Schismatics,</hi> and us in
particular; Which will be tried in the issue of
this Discourse.</p>
            <p>The mean while to give the word its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
use, the Catholic Church (as I have shewn)
signifies the Universal. And by the Universal
Church<note n="b" place="margin">

                  </gap>e Church from which every Church had its beginning.</note> we mean that which from this Head
in my Text came to disperse it self into all
parts of the inhabited World. The Original
of this Church Universal was that Church
which the Apostles planted first at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
Therein following the Command of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
who bade them,<note place="margin">Luke xxiv. 47.</note> 
               <hi>Go, preach to all Nations,
beginning at Ierusalem.</hi> The Body of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church consists of all those, whether
National, or Less, that are called Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Churches. Which were either derived
from that Original Church in that age; such
as were, those seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> and
the rest which are mentioned in Scripture:
or that have been deri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33773:5"/>
any after Conversion, in whatsoever Country
or Age.</p>
            <p>These Particular Churches are many, as the
parts of the Body are many. And as all those
parts together are one Body, so all these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches make up one Universal. One
I say, in both respects, both as being deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from one source, that Original Church at
<hi>Ierusalem:</hi> And also One, as being united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in those Common Characters, by which
that Original Church is described in this Text.</p>
            <p>Those Characters are four, which I come
now to consider particularly; The Apostles
Doctrin, and Fellowship, and Sacraments,
and Prayers.</p>
            <p>The first is the Apostles Doctrin, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of Faith; and not the Inward Belief, but
the Outward Profession of it. The Inward Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
is required to make us true Christians, but
the Outward Profession makes us Members of
a true Church. And as it can be no <hi>true</hi> Church
that has not a Public Profession of the Apostles
Doctrin; so it can be no <hi>sound</hi> Church that
embraces any other for the Doctrin of Faith,
then what was received from the Apostles.</p>
            <p>Now their Doctrin, at this time referred to
in my Text, was no other than what they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33773:5"/>
preached as the Faith of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> But consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how long ago it was that they preached;
how many ages have past since; and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what ages they have been; many ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of Darkness and gross Ignorance, as they
cannot but know, that are any thing acquainted
with<note n="a" place="margin">V. Card. Baron. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Eccl. <hi>Anno</hi> 900. &amp;c.</note> History; I say, after so many extreme
ignorant Ages, it is impossible we should have
known what was preached by the Apostles,
unless it had been also delivered in writing, and
unless those writings had been brought down
to our Hands. And, blessed be God! there
was such a Delivery, in the Books of the New
Testament. In which Books, the Apostles
bearing witness, as they do, to the Scriptures
of the Old Testament, that they were<note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. iii. 16. 2 Pet. i. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Divine Inspiration,</hi> and that they<note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. iii. 15.</note> are
<hi>able to make us wise to Salvation through Faith in
Iesus Christ;</hi> and delivering <hi>the Faith in Iesus
Christ,</hi> as they do, in their own writings, to
the end<note n="d" place="margin">Joh. xx.</note> 
               <hi>that all men may believe on him to
Eternal life;</hi> Therefore in these Books of the
Old and New Testament together, we have
a Standard of the Apostles Doctrine; and we
have not the like for any other than what is
written in these Books.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:33773:6"/>
               <hi>Here is all that we can surely call</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Apostles, <hi>unless we know more
than the Fathers of the Primitive Church.
They through whose hands this Doctrine must
pass, before it could come into ours, knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what they had in the Scriptures. This
was constantly their</hi> Standard and Rule of all things,

            </p>
            <p>So that in their Judgment, it is not only a

of the Apostles. And by this we may

who are not Members of the Apostolical
Church.</p>
            <p>The next Character is this, that they <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Apostles</hi>

               </gap> or <hi>Fellowship;</hi> a word
that has diverse senses in Scripture. In this
place it seems to be the same as Society. They
were in the Apostles Society or Communion.</p>
            <p>Now to continue in their Society (consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they were, men deputed by Christ
for the Government of his Church;) it could be
no other than to continue as Members of that

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:33773:7"/>
But how can any be so now? they being
dead so many Ages since, and their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so long since expired with them. No,
their Government is not expired, though they
are. For it was to continue<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. xxviii. 2c.</note> 
               <hi>till the end of
the World.</hi> So that according to the common
saying among the Jews, <hi>Whosoever one sends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as himself:</hi> So our Saviour having sent the
Apostles saith,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. x. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Whosoever receives you, receives
me;</hi> In like manner, whosoever were sent
by the Apostles, were as themselves; And
whosoever continued in their Fellowship, were
in the Fellowship of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>Now their Government is declared to have
been <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their Bishopric.<note n="c" place="margin">Act. i. 20.</note> And in this
Office they were equal among themselves; as
our Saviour describes them, sitting on twelve
Thrones, and judging the twelve Tribes of
<hi>Israel.</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. xix. 28. Luke xxii. 30.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is observable that this was <hi>after</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to St. <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> xvi. 16, &amp;c. Which
Promise I consider, by the way, because 'tis
so much pressed by the <hi>Romanists,</hi> to prove a
Power, which Christ had given St. <hi>Peter</hi> over
the rest of the Apostles. If Christ had truly
given it, we must then have considered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
St. <hi>Peter</hi> left any Successors in that Power?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33773:7"/>
And if so, why not St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle by
Survivance? why not the Bishop of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Mother-Church at <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> Why
not the Bishop of some other City, where the
Scripture has assured us that St. <hi>Peter</hi> Preacht?
rather than of <hi>Rome,</hi> where if he did preach,
we have not a word of it in Scripture. These
and sundry more such Questions would have
risen upon that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> of such a Power
given to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> But it is out of Question
that the Apostles never so understood those
words of Christ. They knew of no Power
that was promised to St. <hi>Peter</hi> more than to
themselves in that Text. For after this,<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. xviii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. xx. 24.</note> they
were at strife among themselves who should
be chief. After this,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. Luk. xxii 24</note> they disputed it again
and again: and Christ chid them every time,
but never told them, I have promised it to
<hi>Peter.</hi> Nay it appears that Christ did not
intend it, by his open Declarations to the
contrary; That<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. xx. 26. &amp; xxiii. 8, 9, 10. Luke xxii. 26.</note> 
               <hi>it should not be among them,</hi>
as in Secular Kingdoms and Monarchies. It
appears more plainly in the fulfilling of his
Promise. For he both ordained the rest
with S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Joh. xx. 21, 22, 23.</note> without any Difference; And
when they all together had received the
Holy Ghost, in this Chapter, St. <hi>Peter stood
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33773:8"/>
up with the eleven,</hi> ver. 14. And upon him and
them Christ built his Church; even all these
who <hi>continued,</hi> not only in his, but <hi>in the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of</hi>
all <hi>the Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if all the Apostles were equal in
their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Government, then it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that their Successors must be so in like
manner. Though one must have Precedence
before other, for Order's sake; as St. <hi>Peter</hi>
had<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Usually,</hi> but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; for at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> being Bishop there, had the Precedence. <hi>Act. xv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Now the Bishops in after times, in their several

lookt upon Communion with their Bishops as

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33773:9"/>
to govern the Church, and for the People to
live under their Government, in Spiritual
things; This was to live <hi>in the Fellowship of the
Apostles,</hi> which is the <hi>Second</hi> Character in my
Text.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> is the Participation of the same
Sacraments. One only is mentioned in my
Text, that is the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
For being already baptized, they had
no more occasion for Baptism; But that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

both these Sacraments.</p>
            <p>The use of both these, in the Apostles times,
was a Character and Token of the Christian
Church. Thus St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. xii.</hi> 13. menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
both these Sacraments, as the Instruments
and Means by which we are united to Christ.
<hi>By one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body,
and we have all been made to drink into one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both these Sacraments they received of
Christs own Institution, who required them
to be used in all Ages of the Church; to be
administred to all it's Members by every
Church. And that in the same manner as
they were instituted by Christ; I mean as to
all the Essential parts of the Sacraments.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33773:9"/>
However Ceremonies or Rites may be varied;
yet in their Essential parts they are of perpetual
Obligation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Baptism, when it was instituted by our
Saviour for the Admission of Members into his
Church; he said thus to his Apostles,</hi>

               </gap>dministred
it himself to his Disciples, (who were then not
in Orders, for it was before his Death; and he
did not ordain them till after his Resurrection.)
And administring the Sacrament to them, who
were not in Orders,<note n="c" place="margin">Matt. xxvi. 26. Mar. xiv. 22. Lu. xxii. 19. 1 Cor. xi. 24.</note> 
               <hi>He took Bread, and
blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to them, saying,
Take, eat, this is my Body,</hi> and what follows.
<note n="d" place="margin">Matt. xxvi. 28. Mar. xiv. 24. Luke xxii. 20. 1 Cor. xi. 25.</note> 
               <hi>He gave them the Cup</hi> in like manner, <hi>say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
Drink ye all of it. <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> or <hi>this
Cup is the New Testament in my Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly it was done in the Church in the
Apostles times. The Apostle calls it the <hi>Bread</hi>
and the <hi>Cup</hi> which they received in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
never otherwise; though Spiritually
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33773:10"/>
and Sacramentally the Body and Blood of
Christ, yet Bread and Wine in its Natural and
Bodily substance. He says,<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. x. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The Cup which
we bless is it not the Communion of the Blood of
Christ? And the Bread which we break is it not the
Communion of the Body of Christ?</hi> No doubt we
have the Mind of Christ in these words. It is
properly the <hi>Communion</hi> of His Body and Blood,
which we receive in this Sacrament. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Law they are conveyed to us,
under the Elements of Bread and Wine. For
so the Apostle tells us, that, even after Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
It is <hi>Bread which we break;</hi> it is <hi>Bread
which we partake;</hi> It is <hi>Bread that we eat</hi> in this
Sacrament. Which last thing he says three
times together, in three Verses.<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. x. 16, 17. &amp; xi. 26, 27, 28.</note> In like
manner it was properly Wine which remained
in the Cup, even after Consecration. So it was
called by our Saviour,<note n="c" place="margin">Matt. xxvi. 29. Mar. xiv. 25.</note> 
               <hi>the fruit of the Vine,</hi>
and <hi>this Fruit;</hi> even the same of which he had
said, <hi>This is my Blood.</hi> And, as he said to his
Apostles, being Laymen,<note n="d" place="margin">Matt. xxvi. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Drink ye all of it;</hi>
and as St. <hi>Mark</hi> observes,<note n="e" place="margin">Mark xiv. 23.</note> 
               <hi>They all drank of it,</hi>
so did all other in those times, as well Laity as
Clergy. 1 <hi>Cor. xii. 13. We are all made to drink
into one Spirit.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:33773:10"/>
'Tis observable, the whole Sacrament there
is called <hi>drinking,</hi> as here the whole Sacrament
is called <hi>Breaking of Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Sacrament being thus instituted by
Christ, being thus administred by his Apostles,
and being thus received in his Church, was
to continue <hi>till</hi> Christs coming again. So the
Apostle saith expresly. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 26. So that
here's a <hi>third</hi> Character of an Apostolic Church;
to continue the use of those Sacraments which
they used, and that in all the Essentials of them,
according to Christ's own Institution.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fourth</hi> Character in this Text is <hi>Prayer,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the Plural Number; that is, not
one or two, but many, and oft. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
they were publick Prayers, by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>ver. 46. They continued daily with one accord
in the Temple.</hi> There the Apostles used to meet
after Christ's Ascension into Heaven. They
were continually in the<note n="a" place="margin">Luke xxiv. 53.</note> 
               <hi>Temple praising and
blessing God.</hi> They were constantly there in the
times of Devotion, as may appear from <hi>Acts</hi>
iii. 1. and other places. They continued this
Practice as long as the <hi>Iews</hi> would suffer them;
till they drove them away from their Temple
and Synagogues. After which, these first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
had Assemblies elsewhere, as we read
<hi>Acts</hi> xviii. 17.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33773:11"/>
In which Assemblies, what they prayed, and
what they did besides praying, we have no

This, together with the Administration of the
Sacraments, and their gatherings for the poor,
is all the Account they give us of their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Which account being given much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
fifty years of the Apostles times, we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
conclude it was the manner of their
Prayers, the use whereof was the <hi>fourth</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in our Description of the Apostolick
Church.</p>
            <p>Besides these you see my Text hath given us
no other: and therefore whosoever would
make sure of such a Church, he may do well
to judg of it by these Characters, being all that
the Apostles have given us.</p>
            <p>But if these were the Notes of a true Church
in the Apostles times, what mean they of the
Now <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to require any other? Or
what would they have that cannot content
themselves with these? Sure their hearts mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them that these are not for their turn.
Either they have them not, or others have them
as well as they: And therefore they choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to insist upon those, which they can hope
to appropriate to their own Faction.</p>
            <p>It is not worth the while, in this Place, to
reckon up the fifteen Notes of a true Church,
which<note n="a" place="margin">Bellarmin de Conciliis &amp; Ecclesiâ <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmin</hi> gives us. All which, are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33773:12"/>
either common to other Societies, as well as a
true Church; or if they are proper to such a
Church, they are elsewhere no less, nay, much
more in some others, than in theirs.</p>
            <p>As for the Essential Properties, here in my
Text, they are but <hi>four,</hi> and those are from an
Infallible Authority, The like whereof cannot
be shewed for any other. Therefore our Church
desires nothing more than to be tried by these
Tokens. If the same way of Tryal does not
please them so well in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, we
cannot wonder at it, for these make no way
for them, but against them in every Particular.
I shall make a short Proof of it, trying their
Catholic Church (as they call it) by these
Characters of the Primitive Apostolick Church.</p>
            <p>And <hi>first</hi> for <hi>the Doctrine of the Apostles.</hi> If
the Publick Profession of that, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
be required of any true Church; and if
the Scriptures contain all the Doctrine of the
Apostles, as it was firmly believed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the Primitive Church: How come
they of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to find out so many
Doctrines, of which there is no mention in the
Scripture, nor in any of the Primitive Fathers?
In what place were they kept, to be made
known in after-times, that were not known to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33773:12"/>
them that lived in or near the Apostles times?</p>
            <p>But they have I know not how many such
Doctrines, and they are properly Doctrines of
their <hi>Church.</hi> They are declared by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
with most dreadful Anathemas to all those
that shall presume to deny them. We see they
Unchurch us; we know what they have done
more, and may guess what they would do more
to us, for denying them. But they have them in
their Creed, the Creed that is sworn by all their
Clergy.<note n="a" place="margin">

they were concerned to bring them in credit
with the People. And they took a way for it
that could not fail in such an Age, by forging

New Revelations<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <p>For <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the first that wrote was <hi>Paschas.

                  <p>For <hi>Auricular Confession.

                  <p>For <hi>Image-Worship,</hi> the Fathers in that second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council set it up in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Miracles that were wrought by the Images, Concil.

                  <p>For <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> in his before-mentioned Dialogues l. IV. c. 55. &amp;c. declares upon what ground it was that he believed it; namely, from the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poor Souls themselves, that were confined to the Hot Baths, and kept there at hard work, Swelterd as Tenders use to be: From which miserable Bondage they were redeemed by Prayers and Masses, as he tells us. So Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> ubi Supra p. 132. saith, <hi>Purgatory was found out, partly by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations and partly by Scriptures;</hi> but Scriptures, he confesseth, so understood as they never were in former times.</p>
                  <p>And for <hi>Indulgences,</hi> he tells us, that they came not in use till <hi>after men had quaked a while at the flames of Purgatory,</hi> The belief of that Doctrine fitted men for this. And yet this had Miracles to support it. So Lintur. App. ad Fascic. temp. Anno 1489. tells, how at <hi>Friburg</hi> one Devil in the Shape of a Dog helpt one to rob the Pope of all the Mony that his Factors had taken in that City, for which <hi>the Thief,</hi> having confessed it, was put to <hi>a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and Miracles. when by
these means, worthy of their Doctrines, they
had brought them into the Christian Faith; then
beside the Interest that first brought them in,
there was another reason to continue them. It
was necessary for the Credit of the Infallibility
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Touch that, and you shake
the whole building of Popery, even to the
Foundation, that<note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellarmin de Romano Pontifice, Praef. saith,</hi> When we speak of the Popes Power, we speak of the Sum of Christianity.</note> is, the Papacy it self. To
secure that, they are brought under this misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
necessity, of holding all for Catholic Faith,
that is once received in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.
Whatsoever she bringeth forth, must be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

What the Emperors could not hold by Arms,
the Bishops would fetch in by Religion. And

a Secular Monarchy, instead of that which

                  <p>The first that writ for this use, (as far as I can find) was <hi>Gislebertus,</hi> that lived about the year eleven hundred. <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that lived about one hundred and fifty years after, says that then this new manner was <hi>providently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in some Churches.</hi> Summ.

A trick which they brought up in those corrupt

Lastly, for the Worship of God, here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

            <p>The chief part of her Worship is <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

            </p>
            <p>This horrible affront of Christs Sacrifice,<note n="a" place="margin">It makes the Sacrifice of Christ <hi>as much lower in value,</hi> as it is <hi>oftener offered</hi> than the Levitical Sacrifices. For the reason of their being often offered was because of their insufficiency <hi>to take away sin.</hi> Heb. x. 11.

and abuse of his Sacrament<note n="a" place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was Ordained, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ, to be offered or made by every believer.

There goes with it an Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical Sacrifice, that is, before the Sacrament an Oblation solemnly presented to God: in, and after it, a Spiritual Sacrifice of Prayer and Thanksgiving, an offering of our selves souls and bodies. For this every Christian is a Priest 1 Pet. ii. 5. The manner of it is thus described in the old <hi>Roman</hi> Missal set forth by <hi>Pamelius.</hi> After the reading of the Gospel, <hi>the Offertory is sung, and the Oblations are offered by the people: out of which, Bread and Wine are set upon the Altar to be Consecrated;</hi> and the Prayer is said over the Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. After this the Priest began the Canon of the Mass, and said the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration</hi> in these words, <hi>Remember Lord, all here present, who offer to thee this Sacrifice of praise, for themselves and all theirs.</hi> Menardi Sacr. Gregor. p. 2. In those times men saw the Oblations to which those words did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. But afterward when there was no more such offering, and no more <hi>breaking of Bread,</hi> but a Wafer to be offered by the Priest for the People, then the Antient form was improper, and therefore they altered it thus. <hi>Remember Lord all here present, for whom We offer to thee,</hi> &amp;c. So it stands now in the <hi>Roman</hi> Missal. Where all the other Prayers, which were designed for the Eucharist, are misapplied to the new Propitiatory Sacrifice. And yet still they continue these following words of the Prayer after the Diptychs; through our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>By whom thou O Lord Createst all these things always good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and givest them to us.</hi> This they say over the Wafer and Wine after Consecration. Of the <hi>Creatures of Bread and Wine,</hi> See the end of Page 47.</note> together, was

XVII. 13. 11, &amp;c.</hi> It was alledged on the one hand, that if that at the last Supper was a true Propitiatory Sacrifice, then that upon the Cross could be only in remembrance of this: and on the other hand, if it was not such a Sacrifice, then there was no such Sacrifice Instituted by Christ; for the words of Institution, <hi>Hoc Facite,</hi> could refer to nothing else but to what was done then and there. (I have shewed that they refer to those words, <hi>Take, Eat, Drink;</hi> and were spoken to the Disciples, as Communicants, and no otherwise.) After much time and heat, at last the Doctrine was set down in these words, <hi>that at the last Supper Christ offered himself for a Sacrifice,</hi> without saying whether Propitiatory, or Eucharistical. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did this satisfie, saith Cardinal <hi>Pallavicino, XVIII. 9. 3.</hi>

                  <p>None before <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> speaks of Sacrifice among Christians; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Clemens Remanus,</hi> in his Epist. ad Cor. §. 36. Where he calls Christ <hi>the High Priest of our offerings.</hi> But he speaks only of the Sacrifice of praise, and contrite hearts. Ibid. and §. 52.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>Iustin</hi> in his Book against <hi>Tryphon,</hi> p. 344. c. He proves that we are all a Holy Priesthood, because God accepts none but Priests: and yet all that offer the Sacrifices which Christ delivered, in the Eucharist, or blessing of Bread and Wine, are accepted of God. And whereas the Jews say that, since they have no temple, now their Prayers are their Sacrifice: So, saith he, I say; that Prayers and Thanksgivings, offered by them that are Worthy, are the Only perfect Sacrifices and acceptable to God. For Christians have learnt to offer these things Only; and that even in commemoration of that food in which there is a remembrance of the Passion of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The next Father was <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who writing <hi>adversus Haereses,</hi> Lib IV.

            <p>For the other parts of their Worship, we

So they have some likewise in the

they have Two Lessons out of other Books:
And no small part of them (I say no more
than I can prove,) are as arrant Fables<note n="b" place="margin">For their Saints. whom they make sharers with Christ in their Prayers, and pray to God to be heard for their Merits and Intercession, not a few of the Persons themselves are meer Fictions; as St. <hi>Christopher,</hi> St. <hi>Parnel,</hi> St. <hi>Catherine,</hi> St. <hi>Win<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as the looseness of the Age will bear. If

            <p>Thirdly, for our <hi>Sacraments;</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Art. 25.</note> we use the
same, and no other than those, which Christ
expresly left to his Church: I mean, which he
both Instituted, and Commanded us to use;
Which can be said of no other than only Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>Lastly, For our Public <hi>Worship,</hi> we have
cause to bless God that has given us such a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy;
in which, according to all the measures

but what, as to the Substance, is Theirs; And
our most malicious Enemies can tell us of no

to be Corruptions, and Errors: to which
end several of those Articles were framed, to
be subscribed by our own Clergy, without
imposing them on any other.</p>
            <p>In all these respects, our Church holds a
Communion, or hath done nothing to break
it, with any other National Church; no, not
with those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion: and is,
not only, what they deny, a true Member; but
what they are not, a Sound member, of that
one Holy Catholic Church, which was from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33773:34"/>
the beginning, and which will be to the end of
the world.</p>
            <p>The last thing is, having proved we have a
true Church, to persuade you, <hi>First</hi> to <hi>continue</hi>
in it <hi>stedfastly.</hi> And <hi>Secondly</hi> in the Belief
and Practice of those things, by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be a true Church. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> to
profit by them; and so to adorn our Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
with a Holy and good Conversation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> to persuade you to <hi>continue stedfastly</hi> in
this Church; it is enough, if you are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that you cannot mend your selves by any
Change.</p>
            <p>Who would not desire to continue where he
is well? Who would not stick to that which is
the best he can chuse? Who would needlesly
run the danger of any loss? Especially of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himself, which is the greatest loss that is
possible? and yet That we have reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from the just indignation of God, if we
shall reject the great benefit that he hath given
us, to be born in the womb, and bred up in
the bosom of such a Church.</p>
            <p>No doubt you hear, (for who does not?)
on every side the voices of them that would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
you, or would threaten you out of it.
But whatsoever they say, remember what the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33773:35"/>
Philosopher made the first part of wisdom,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> do not believe all that is said.
Remember how our Saviour forewarned,<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. xxiv. 23. Mar. xiii. 21.</note>
               <hi>if any tell you, Christ is here, or Christ is there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him not.</hi> If Antiquity be pretended on
the one hand, if large boasts of Purity on the
other, many fine things are said, believe them
not. And if many have been seduced by these
means, let them answer for themselves: you
had best to look before you follow them. If
many have fallen off from our Church, so did
many from Christ. But some were wiser,
and considered what they should get by it.
They said,<note n="b" place="margin">John vi. 68.</note> 
               <hi>whither should we go? Thou hast
the words of eternal life.</hi> If our Church has but
that, whatever she wants else, it will be our
wisest way to continue in it.</p>
            <p>But then secondly, you are to continue in
those Characters by which it appears to be a
true Church: And to exercise your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in all the Acts that belong to these Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters;
namely in the Apostles <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and
<hi>Fellowship,</hi> and in the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and in <hi>Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> for <hi>Doctrine; Hold fast<note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. i. 13.</note> the form of
sound words which you have received. Contend<note n="d" place="margin">Jude verse 3.</note> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints.</hi>
Seek it not in muddy Streams, but in the living
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33773:35"/>
Fountains of Scripture. <hi>All Scripture<note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. iii. 16, 17.</note> is
given by inspiration from God; and is enough to
make the man of God perfect, and throughly furnisht
to every good work.</hi> It is sufficient to make us
wise<note n="b" place="margin">Verse 15.</note> to <hi>salvation:</hi> So that if we mind only
that, we have no need of any other; and yet
we would refuse no other that could be made
out, as this is, to be the Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as to the Apostles <hi>Fellowship,</hi> we
have heard it is continued in the Bishops their
Successors. Therefore we ought to take heed
how we break Communion with them. We
are both to acknowledg, and make use of their
Ministery; to <hi>obey them</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. xiii. 17.</note> in spiritual things,
as being those that <hi>must give account for our souls.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, for the Sacraments and Worship of
God, <hi>forsake not the assembling of your selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. x. 25.</note> nor run into separate Meetings, <hi>as
the manner of some is.</hi> Some will alway be
stragling; we cannot help what they do; and
what they do among themselves we do not
enquire. They that are of the Catholic and
Apostolic Church, will be only for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
and Apostolic Sacraments; Namely, for
those which Christ himself instituted in his
Church: <hi>Baptism,</hi> by which we are<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. vi. 5.</note> 
               <hi>planted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33773:36"/>
into Christs</hi> death; and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> in which
we keep up the <hi>remembrance</hi> of it<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. xi. 26.</note> 
               <hi>till he comes.</hi>
We have also the same <hi>worship</hi> of God, which
was in the Apostles times, and which hath
been ever since in the Church. They who are
now Saints in Heaven, while they were upon
earth, prayed to no other but God only. If
we pray not to them, they will excuse us, we
do as they did. And we do it in assurance that
the same worship which they used, will bring
us (as it did them) to be Saints in Heaven too,
if we continue in it.</p>
            <p>Lastly continuing in the Church, and in all
the Characters of it, our business is to profit
by all these; <hi>to grow<note n="b" place="margin">2 Pet. iii. 18.</note> in grace, and in the
knowledg of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It concerns us, not only to be in a true
Church, but to see that we our selves are true
Christians; and that can no otherwise appear,
than in the likeness of Christ, in Righteousness
and Holiness of life. Without this, though
you be of a true Church, you will not be so
long, or you will be so to no purpose. A
wicked life will, in time, eat out all the sense
of Religion; or the more sense one hath, he
will find the less comfort in Ours. Our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
hath no comfort for him that is and will
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33773:36"/>
be Wicked. Our Religion hath no Purgatory
to keep him from Hell. Our Religion can
make him no penny-worths of Heaven. Our
Religion hath no pardon for sin, but on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
No Repentance, but on real amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life. He that cannot come to that,
Alas! what does he in our Religion? As it
cannot, if he knows it, but be uneasie to him;
so he will make himself unworthy of it. He
will provoke God to deprive him of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
And it is all one which way he deprives
him; whether by letting him now run out of
the Church, or whether by shutting him out
of Heaven at the last. For that it will come
to, when all is done, without holiness there is
no coming thither. <hi>Without holiness<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. xii. 14.</note> no man
shall see the Lord.</hi> None shall; If you want
that, not <hi>you</hi> in particular; and then what
will your Religion signifie? Though your
Church hath all that the Apostles Church had,
What good will this do you, if you perish in
it? Though your Ship will go its Voyage, what
is that to you, if you die of a surfeit by the way?
Though you have the True Doctrine, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
Sacraments, and Prayers, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
will all this give you in that terrible day?
Yea, what Horror will it be, that being placed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33773:37"/>
well by God, you are fallen from it? You have
lost, you have thrown away that great Blessing
that he had given you.</p>
            <p>Beloved<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. vi. 9.</note> we hope better things of you, and
things that accompany Salvation, though we thus speak.</p>
            <p>I Hope, and therefore Pray, that all that
hear me this day may be the better for being
of such a Church. God intended we should.
He has dealt exceeding graciously with us.
But yet he expects that we should do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for our selves: That considering the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
that is put in our hands, Seeing how
near God has brought us to the Kingdom of
Heaven, Seeing nothing but our own sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and it, (should that sight make
us fly out; and seek other ways; ways
that God never made nor will bless? Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
we should break through our sins, and go
the way that he calls us in his Word; there
can be no better, there is no other than this.</p>
            <p>So performing his design, pursuing the ends
of our Calling, living suitably to our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Religion: We are indeed the followers
of the Apostles in this life, and shall be with
them hereafter in the blessedness of Life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</p>
