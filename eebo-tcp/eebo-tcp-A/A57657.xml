            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>ACHELOUS was a River which as all others, hath its beginning and encrease from the Sun, the Sea and the Earth: it was called a Serpent from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny windings thereof, and a Bull, from its noise and bellowing 2. The two hornes are its two streames, the one whereof was cut off by <hi>Hercules,</hi> and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto divers brooks, by which the countrey was enriched; and <hi>Hercules</hi> for his paines received the greater increase. 2. They that strive against mighty men had need to be both Serpents in policie, and Buls in strength. 3. They who turne themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wanton Buls, and spend their horne, that is, their strength on women and wine, are at last choaked with melancholy and hydropicall humours. 4. If

great men lose their horne, that is their power and honour, let them redeeme them with their wealth, for honour is better then mony. 5. If God for thy sins take thy power and glory away, or thy bodies strength by sicknesse, let the poore partake of thy plentifull horne, and choake thy sins, in the river of repentance.</p>

                     <hi>AMphion</hi> was called <hi>Iupiters</hi> son, because musick is from God; or because the heavens by their perpetuall revolution, shew, that musick without continuall exercise cannot be attained unto; or to shew that there is in the heavenly bodies a harmony, as well as in musick; or if by <hi>Iupiter</hi> we understand the air, as sometimes Poets do, then as <hi>Iupiter</hi> gave life to <hi>Amphion,</hi> so doth air to musick, for no sound either by voice, instruments, or water, without air. 2. <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the form of a Satyre begot <hi>Amphion;</hi> Satyrs were great Dancers, and dancing requires musick. 3. <hi>Amphion</hi> was bred by shepherds; for these living an idle and solitary life, were invited to invent musick, partly by the singing of birds, and partly by the whisting of the wind among the trees,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55642:16"/>
or by the running of waters. 4. He was born in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote hill, because musicall inventions require quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and a private life far from troubles and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. 5. <hi>Mercury</hi> taught him, and gave him the Lute; to shew the resemblance, and equall power of eloquence and musick; eloquence being a speaking harmony, and musick a speechlesse eloquence, the one by words, the other by sounds working on the affections. 6. His building <hi>Thebes</hi> walls by his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, shews what is the force of eloquence, to draw rude people to religion, policie, and civility. 7. His out-braving of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> doth not onely shew the insolencie and pride of some men, when they have got some perfection in an Art; but also, I suppose, may be meant the power and delight of musick, that it no lesse affects and delights the soul by the ear, then the light of the Sun and Moon doth the eye: So that musick may as it were challenge the light. 8. <hi>Amphion</hi> may be said to be killed by <hi>Latona,</hi> when musicall knowledge is lost by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and oblivion. 9. Our Saviour Christ is the true <hi>Amphion,</hi> who by the preaching of the Gospel hath built his Church, and made us who were but dead and scattered, living stones in this building; his musick hath quickned us, and his love hath united us. 10. <hi>Amphion</hi> was said to build the walls by the help of his musick, because perhaps he imployed Musicians at that time, who by their musick incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the builders, and made them work the better.</p>

                  <p>I Thinke, not unfitly against the Peripateticks, we may gather out of this fiction, the creation of the Sunne and Moone, for in the beginning the Spirit of God, like a Swan, moving on the waters, out of a confused egge, that is, out of the chaos brought forth these two glorious flames, whose dominion is over the sea, because by their influence, light, and motion, stormes and vapors are raised and setled: the Sun is the Champion, who by his heat subdueth all things: The Moon is the Horse-man, if you consider its swift motion, it is well and comfortable when they both shine, but if either of them be eclipsed, it is dismall and ominous: Immortality may be said to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between them, because when the one liveth,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55642:39"/>
that is, shineth, the other is obscured, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dead, at least to us. They ride on white horses, to shew their light; and they found out the golden Fleece, because no mettals are generated but by their influence, nor can they be found out, but by their light. 2. The soule and body are like <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> for when the one dieth, the other liveth; and when the body is a sleepe, and as it were dead, then is the soule most active; and when the body is most vigilant, the soule is lesse vigorous. 3. By this fiction the Gentiles wound themselves; for if they believe that these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscuri were begot of a god and a woman; why will they not believe the true generation of Christ, of a Virgin, and the Holy Ghost. 4. By this also, judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Astrologers may be confuted; for we see that the soules and dispositions of men depend not on the Stars; these two were twins, borne under the same constellation, yet of farr different studies and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the one being a wrestler, the other a horse-man. 5. Satan who can transform himselfe unto any shape, appeared to the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Latin war in the form of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> on horse backe, for which cause a Temple was errected to them, by <hi>A. Posthumius</hi> dictator; have not we more cause to errect the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our hearts to Christ, who upon the two white horses of the two Testaments, hath brought us good news of our victorie against our spirituall foes. 6: This temple was erected both to <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> but <hi>Castor</hi> the lesse worthy caried the name from the other, by which we see, that honour is not alwayes given to those that deserve best. 7. <hi>Dioscuri</hi> were
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55642:40"/>
preservers of men, but <hi>Helena</hi> came out of the same egge, which was the overthrower of <hi>Troy;</hi> so in the same Church are good and bad, savers and destroyers. 8. It was love in <hi>Pollux</hi> to share his immortality with <hi>Castor,</hi> but in this he did him more hurt then good, for it had been better to dye once then so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; thus our affections are oftentimes preposterous. 9. Christ hath done more for us then <hi>Pollux</hi> for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,</hi> for he lost his immortality for a while, that we might injoy it for ever.</p>

                     <hi>CIrce,</hi> saith <hi>Nat. Comes,</hi> is the mixture of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, which is caused by heat and moysture; the 4. Elements are the 4 hand-maids; she is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall because this mixture is perpetuall; and the strange shapes shew the varietie of strange forms brought in by generation, she had no power over <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisses</hi> because the soul commeth not by mixtion of the Elements, or generation. 2. By <hi>Circe,</hi> I suppose may be fittly understood death; caused by <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceanus</hi> grand-childe, because death and corruption proceed out of heat and moysture; the poysoning of her husband shews that death is no accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; <hi>Sol</hi> carrieth her in his chariot, for where the Sun shines there is death and corruption; her turning of men unto beasts, shews that man is like the beast that perisheth, yea a living dog is better then a dead man; but she hath no power over <hi>Vlisses,</hi> that is, over the soul which is immortall, death hath no power; the four hand-maids that gathered poyson for her, were <hi>Adams</hi> pride, gluttonie, infidelitie, and curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which made <hi>Adams</hi> death poyson all his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. 3. By <hi>Circe</hi> may be meant the Devill, who hath caused beastly dispositions in the nature of man, and hath poisoned us all; as <hi>Circe</hi> infected <hi>Vlisses</hi> fellows, but not himself; so he poysoned <hi>Iobs</hi> body, but had no power over his soul; and because God had set his

love upon man, and had rejected him for his pride, being an Angel, he to be revenged poysoned man, as <hi>Circe</hi> did <hi>Scylla. 4. Circe</hi> is physicall knowledge consisting much in herbs; she is the daughter of <hi>Sol,</hi> because herbs proceed of his heat; she turneth men unto beasts, because some physitians searching too much unto nature, become beasts, in forgetting the God of nature; she dwelt on a hill full of physicall simples, to let us understand wherein the physitians skill and studie lyeth; he hath no power over <hi>Vlisses,</hi> the soul, but the bodies of men he may poyson or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; his 4 hand-maides are, Phylosophy, Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, Anatomie, and Botancie or skill of simples. 5. Sin is a <hi>Circe,</hi> chiefly drunkennesse and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which poyson men, and turn them unto swine; <hi>Circe</hi> hath both a cup and a rod, with which she poysoned men; so in sin there is a cup of pleasure, and the rod of vengeance; though <hi>Vlisses</hi> fellows were poysoned, yet he would not himself be enticed by <hi>Circe;</hi> but by means of the herb <hi>Moly,</hi> and his sword, he hath defended himself, and made <hi>Circe</hi> restore his fellows again to their wonted shapes; so Governers and Magistrates must not be overtaken with the <hi>Circe</hi> of drink and fleshly pleasure, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others are; but they must use <hi>Moly,</hi> that is, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in them selves, and use the sword, against this <hi>Circe</hi> in others.</p>

                  <p>THere is a two-fold love, to wit, in the creator, and in the creature; Godslove is two-fold, inherent in himself, and this is eternall as himself, therefore hath no father nor mother: or transient to the creature, this love was first seen in creating the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and all things out of it; therefore they sayd that love was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of <hi>Chaos</hi> without a father; and when they write that <hi>Zephyrus</hi> begot <hi>Cupid</hi> of an egge; what can it else mean, but that the spirit of God did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest his love, in drawing out of the informed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused egge of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> all the creatures; the love of the creature is two-fold, according to the two-fold object therof, to wit, God and the creature; that love
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55642:55"/>
by which we love God, is begot of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> that is, God, and that uncreated beautie in him, is the cause of this love; and because the main and proper object of love is beautie, (for we do not love goodnesse, but as it is beautifull) and it is the object that moveth and stirreth up the <note n="a" place="bottom">Passio movetur ab obiecto.</note> passion, therfore <hi>Venus</hi> goddess of beautie is still the mother of <hi>Cupid</hi> or love, which notwithstanding hath many fathers because this generall beautie is joyned to many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular qualities; which causeth love in men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their inclinations and dispositions; some are in love with wars, and count militarie skill and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage a beautifull thing, so this love is begot of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> others are in love with eloquence, and thinke nothing so beautifull as that; and so <hi>Mercurie</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are parents of this love; some love Musick, and so <hi>Apollo</hi> begets this <hi>Cupid,</hi> and so we may say of all things else which we love, that there is some qualitie adherent to beautie, either true or apparent, which causeth love in us; now that love which all creatures have to creatures of their own kind, in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying them by generation, is the childe of <hi>Vulcan</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> for it is begot of their own naturall heat &amp; outward beautie; by beauty I mean whatsoever we account pleasing to us, whether it be wealth, honour, pleasure, vertue, &amp;c. 2. The reasons why love was thus painted, I conceive to be these; <hi>Cupid</hi> is a childe, because love must be still young, for true love cannot grow old and so die; <hi>amor qui desinere potest, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam fuit verus;</hi> Hee hath wings, for love must
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55642:55"/>
be swift; he is blind, for love must wink at many things, it covereth a multitude of sins; he is naked, for amongst friends all things should be common, the heart must not keep to it self any thing secret, which was the fault that <hi>Dalila</hi> found in <hi>Sampsons</hi> love; he is crowned with roses, for as no flower so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth the spirits, and delights our smell as the rose; so nothing doth so much sweeten and delight our life as love; but the rose is not without prickles, nor love without cares; the crown is the ensigne of a King, and no such King as love, which hath subdued all the creatures rationall, sensitive, vegetative, and senslesse have their sympathies; the image of a Lionesse with little <hi>Cupids</hi> playing about her, some tying her to a pillar, others putting drinke into her mouth with a horne, &amp;c. do shew how the most fierce creatures are made tame by love; therefore he hath a rose in one and a Dolphin in the other, to shew the qualitie of love; which is swift and officious like the Dolphin, delectable and sweet like the rose; his arrows do teach us that love wounds deeply, when we cannot obtain what we love; some of his arrows are pointed with lead, some with gold; he is wounded with a golden arrow, that aimes at a rich wife, and cannot obtain her; to be wounded with leaden arrows, is to be afflicted for want of ordinary objects which we love; and so his burning torches, shew that a lover is consumed with grief, for not obtaining the thing lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the wax is with heat; <hi>Ardet amans Dido; Vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur infaelix; Caeco carpitur igne, Est mollis flamma me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullas; Haeret lateri laethalis arundo &amp;c.</hi> These are my

                  <head>THE MYSTERIES.</head>
                  <p>THese <hi>Cyclopes</hi> are by some meant the vapours which by the influence of heaven are drawn out of the earth and sea, and being in the air, ingender thunder and lightning to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> as their <note n="a" place="bottom">Brontes, Steropes, Harpes, Pyracmon.</note> names shew; they dwelt in <hi>Sicilie</hi> about hill <hi>Aetna,</hi> because heat is the breeder of thunder; they were thrust down to Hell by their father, and came up againe, because in the cold winter these vapours lie in the earth, and by heat of the spring are elevated; wise <hi>Vlisses</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> that is, man by his wisdome and observation found out the secrets of these naturall things and causes thereof; <hi>Apollo</hi> was sayd to kill these <hi>Cyclopes,</hi> because the Sun dispelleth vapours. 2. I think by these <hi>Cyclopes</hi> may be understood the evill spirits, whose habitation is in burning <hi>Aetna,</hi> that is, in Hell burning with fire and brimstone, being thrown down justly by God, from heaven for their pride, but are permitted sometimes for our sins to rule in the air, whose service God useth sometimes, in sending thunder and stormes to punish the wicked; they may well be called <hi>Cyclopes</hi> from their round eye, and circular motion; for as they have a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eye, which is not easily shut, so they compasse the earth to and fro; they may be sayd to have but one eye, to wit, of knowledge which is great; for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55642:58"/>
outward eyes they have not; their chief food and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in the destroying of mankinde; <hi>Polyphemus</hi> or <hi>Belzebub</hi> is the chief, who having devoured <hi>Vlisses</hi> fellowes, that is, mankinde; the true <hi>Vlisses,</hi> Christ the wisdom of the father, came, and having powred unto him the full cup of the Red wine of his wrath, bound him, and thrust out his eye; that is, both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained his power and policie; these evill spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the chief sowers of sedition and wars among men, may be said to make <hi>Mars</hi> his chariots. 3. Here we see that little <hi>Vlisses</hi> overcame tall <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemus;</hi> policie overcomes strength. 4. We see also the effects of drunkennesse, by it we lose both our strength, and the eye of reason. 5. <hi>Servius</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">In Lib. 3. Aen.</note> thinks that <hi>Polyphemus</hi> was a wise man, because he had his eye in his forehead neere the braine, but I say, he was but a foole because he had but one eye, which only looked to things present; he wanted the eye of providence, which looks to future dangers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents them. 6. Here we are taught to beware of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, and securitie, for they are here justly punished. 7. The state of <hi>Rome,</hi> which at first had two eyes, to wit, two Consulls, became a <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> a huge bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with one eye when one Emperor guided all; this Gyant fed upon the flesh of Christians in bloody persecutions; but when she was drunk with the blood of the Saints, <hi>Vlisses,</hi> that is, wise <hi>Constantine,</hi> thrust out the eye, and weakned the power of <hi>Rome;</hi> of that Gyant which had made so much thunder of war in the world, and so many chariots for <hi>Mars.</hi>

wings of faith. 2. They that give themselves to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull pleasures, with <hi>Pasiphae,</hi> shall bring forth that Monster which will devoure them. 3. <hi>Daedalus</hi> made this labyrinth, and was cast into it himself; so the wicked are caught in their own nets, and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pit which they dig for others. 4. <hi>Daedalus</hi> was guiltie of murther, therefore is justly pursued, for murther is never secure. 5 <hi>Icarus</hi> is justly punished for refusing to hearken to his fathers counsell, a good lesson for all children. 6. Let us take heed of curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, pry not too much into the secrets of God, least we have <hi>Icarus</hi> his reward; for all human reason is but waxen wings. 7. Here we see for the most part that young men are high-minded and proud, but pride alwayes hath a fall. 8. Astronomers, and such as will undertake to foretell future contingencies, or will take upon them such things as passe humane power, are like <hi>Icarus;</hi> they fall at last into a Sea of contempt and scorn. 9. The golden mean is still best, with what wings soever we flye; whether with the wings of honour, or of wealth, or of knowledge and speculation; not to flye too high in pride, nor too low in basenesse. 10. If we will fly to Christ with the wings of faith, we must not mount too high in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, nor fall too low by desperation. 11. We see by <hi>Pasiphae,</hi> that a dishonest, and disloyall woman, will leave no means unattempted, to fulfill her lustfull and wanton desires. 12. Many women are like <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siphae,</hi> outwardly they seem to be mortified, having the skin of a dead Cow, or woodden cover; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they burne with wanton lusts.</p>

By this fiction, the Gentiles might have taught themselves the doctrine of the resurection; for if stones cast on the ground could become men; why should they not beleeve that <note n="a" place="bottom">Idoneus est reficere qui fecit.

he would fain fly up to heaven with the wings of devotion, but the Lyons and Leopards in his hands with which he devoures mens estates, keeps him back.

               <p>HE was a fair shepherd, who falling in love with <hi>Iuno,</hi> who was presented to him in the forme of a cloud, was thrust down from heaven, into a cave, where he slept 30 years, with whom the Moon being in love came down oftentimes to visit and kisse him.</p>

                  <head>THE MYSTERIES.</head>
                  <p>IT is thought that <hi>Endymeon</hi> being an Astronomer, and one that first observed the divers motions of the Moon, gave occasion to this fiction, that the Moon loved him; but I think these uses may be made of this fiction. 1. <hi>Endymeon</hi> is a rich man; and riches make men fair, though never so deformed; and with such the Moon, that is, the world, as unconstant as the Moon, is in love, these are the men whom the world kisses and honoreth, but when these rich <hi>Endymeons</hi> set their affections upon wealth, (for <hi>Iuno</hi> is the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of wealth) then do they lose heaven, and fall into the sleep of securitie, saying, <hi>Soul take thy rest, thou hast store layd up for many years,</hi> with that rich farmer in the Gospell; and so they lose their souls for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55642:69"/>
a shadow, for such is wealth; and this shadow brings upon them spirituall stupiditie, they that cannot be roused from their cave, though Gods word should shine on them as cleer as the Moon. 2. By <hi>Endy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon, Adam</hi> may be meant, who was fair whilst Gods image continued with him, but when he fell in love with <hi>Iuno, Iupiters</hi> wife, that is, affected equalitie with his maker; he was thrust out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, into this world as unto a cave; where he was cast into a dead sleep, or the sleep of death, from which he shall not be awaked though the Moon so often visit him, that is, so long as the Moon shall shine and visit the earth, which shall be till the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of all things, man shall sleep in the grave. 3. By <hi>Endymeon</hi> may be meant these, over whom the Moon hath dominion; for Astrologers observe, that every man is subject to one Planet, or other, more or lesse, such men then over whom the Moon ruleth are instable, subject to many changes; nimble bodied, quick in apprehension, desirous of glory, and such a one perhaps was <hi>Endymeon;</hi> therefore the Moon was sayd to love them; and such because they affect hohour and popular applause, which is but air, may be sayd to be in love with <hi>Iuno,</hi> which is the air, and indeed honour is but air, or a cloud. 4. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man may be called <hi>Endymeon,</hi> for we are all in love with air and emptie clouds, with toyes and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which makes us so sleepie and dull in heavenly things, and the Moon is in love with us; changes and inconstancie, still accompanie mans life, to signifie which instabilitie of human affaires, the feast of new

Moons was kept among the <hi>Iews;</hi> and the Roman Nobilitie used to weare little pictures of the Moon on their shooes, to shew that we are never in one stay; for which cause I thinke the <hi>Turks</hi> have the half Moon for their Armes. 5. When <hi>Endymeon,</hi> that is, mankinde slept in sin; the Moon, that is, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ, (whose flesh is compared to the Moon, <note n="a" place="bottom">In Psal. 73.</note> by <hi>S. Augustin,</hi> as his divinitie to the Sun) in his flesh visited us, and dwelt amongst us, this Moon was eclipsed in the passion, and this Moon slept in the cave with <hi>Adam;</hi> and the full of this Moon was seen in the resurrection; this is he who hath kissed us with the kisses of his mouth, whose love is better then wine, whose light shined in darknesse, and the darknesse comprehended it not. 6. The Moon fals in love with sleepie <hi>Endymeons;</hi> that is, carnall and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall pleasures, and earthly thoughts invade those, that give themselves to idlenesse, securitie, and lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for the Moon, in regard of her vicinitie to the earth may be the Symboll of earthly mindes; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is the mistris of the night, and of darknesse, the time when carnall delights are most exercised, she may be the Symboll of such delights; and because of her often changing she may represent to us the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fooles, which delight in idlenesse, as the Moon did in <hi>Endymeon. 7. Endymeon</hi> in this may signifie the Sun, with whom the Moon is in love; rejoycing, and as it were laughing in her full light, when she hath the whole veiw of him; and every month run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him, and overtaking him, whose motion is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55642:70"/>
slow, and therefore he seems to sleep in regard of her velocitie.</p>

                  <p>FOrtune is either an unexpected event, or else the hid cause of that event; the blinde Gentiles made her a blinde goddesse, ruling things by her will, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by counsell; therefore they used to raile at her, because she favoured bad men, rather then good; and called her blinde, as not regarding mens worth; but I think, that the wiser sort, by fortune understood Gods will or providence; which the Poet <note n="a" place="bottom">Aen. 8. ia omnire dominatur.

to shew her dominion of this world, and the heaven on her head, did shew that there is her begining; the helm &amp; the horn of plentie in her hands, are to shew, that the government of this world, and the plenty we injoy is from this divine providence; and though they called her blinde, yet we know the contrarie, for she is that eye which seeth all things, and a far off, and before they are, as the word <hi>provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia</hi> signifieth; therefore they called her, and her horses blinde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were blinde themselves, not being able to know the wonderfull wayes and secret ends of this providence, why good men should here live in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and miserie, and the wicked in honor and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie; wheras they should have known, as some of the wiser men did, that no miserie could befall a good man, <note n="a" place="bottom">Boetius, l. 4.

he is the preserver of man and beast, his Sun shineth, and his rain falleth upon all alike; now the 4 horses that draw fortune, are the four branches of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whereby Gods love is communicated to us; to wit, creation, preservation, gubernation, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all things to their ends. In that they called fortune the daughter of the Sea; by this they would shew her instabilitie still ebbing and flowing like the Sea; therefore they made her stand upon a wheel, and she was called in a common by-word <hi>fortuna Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Eras. in adag.</note> because of the often ebbing and flowing therof, I grant, that as one and the same effect may be called fortune and providence; fortune in respect of the particular cause, but providence in regard of the first, and generall cause, which is God; so the same may be called instable in respect of the particular cause, but most stable in respect of God, with whom there is no variablenesse, nor shadow of turning; though contingent causes produce contingent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, yet nothing is contingent to God, for all things come to passe which he foreseeth, and yet his foreknowledge imposeth no necessity on contingent things, but indeed we are instable our selves and evil, and we accuse fortune of instabilitie and evill; a good man may make his fortune good; <hi>quis<expan>

the mutable and various effects of fortune, she was represented by a woman, the Symbol of mutabilitie; but the Romans upon better consideration, made her both male and female, to shew, that though the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and secondary causes, of fortunall effects be various and unconstant like women, yet the supreme cause hath the staidnesse of a man; the fire and water shews, that our firie afflictions (which fall not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods providence;) are so tempered with water of mercy, that though they burne good men, yet they consume them not; as we are taught by <hi>Moses</hi> fierie bush, and the furnace of Babylon.</p>

               <p>HE was the King of <hi>Troys</hi> son, who whilst he was hunting, was caught up to heaven by an Eagle, <hi>Iupiters</hi> bird; and because of his extraordinary beautie, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> made him his Cup-bearer.</p>

                        </gap>.</note> divine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell or wisdom; and wisdom is the true beautie of the minde, wherin God takes pleasure. 2. Every Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle is not <hi>Iupiters</hi> bird, as <hi>Aelian</hi> observeth, but that onely which abstains from flesh, and rapine; and that was the bird that caught up <hi>Ganimedes;</hi> so fleshly mindes, and thoughts set upon rapine and carnall pleasures, are not fit to serve God, nor to carrie the soul up to heaven. 3. The quick-sighted Eagle, is divine contemplation or meditation, by which <hi>Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> the soul is caught up to heaven. 4 When by holy raptures, we are carried up to heaven, the best Nectar that we can power out to God, is the teares
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55642:80"/>
of repentance, and of a broken heart. 5. <hi>Ganimedes</hi> was caught up by one Eagle only; but if we have the true inward beauty of the minde, we shall be caught up in the air by Legions of Angels, to meet the Lord, and shall for ever serve him, at his table in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven. 6. I wish that the Roman Eagle would not delight so much in rapine and mans flesh, as he doth; but rather endeavour to be carried up to heaven, that is, o their ancient dignity, the decayed and ruinated parts of the Empire. 7. As the Eagle caught up <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> so the wings of a great Eagle were given to the woman, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. to carry her from the Dragons persecution; the great Eagle was the Roman Empire, whereof <hi>Constantine</hi> was the head, by whose power and help the Church was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. 8. Our Saviour Christ is the true <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> the son of the great King, the fairest among the sons of men, the wisdom and counsell of the father, in whom God delighted, and was well pleased, who by the power, and on the wings of his Divinity, was caught up to heaven, where he is powring out his prayers and merits before God for us; and like <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> (to which <hi>Ganimedes</hi> was converted) is powring down the plentifull showers of his grace upon us. 9. <hi>Vespasian</hi> set up the image of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Ganime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> caught by the Eagle in the Temple of peace; so the image of God, and heavenly raptures, are found in that soul wherein is the peace of conscience. 10. As the Eagle carried <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> so <hi>Moses</hi> compareth God to an Eagle, who carried the Israelites on his wings through the desert; and S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, that

moats in other mens eyes, but not beames in their own. 2. Satan deals with us, as <hi>Persius</hi> did with <hi>Medusa,</hi> he first steales away our knowledge, then with the more ease he destroyes our soules. 3. Wee see here in <hi>Medusa,</hi> that pride, sacriledge, and whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shall not go unpunished. 4. From whence let us learne not to be proud of our beauty, for all beauty, like the <hi>Gorgons</hi> shall end in deformitie, and as <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> hair and <hi>Medusas</hi> here, brought destruction on them; so it may bring upon others; and shall if they doat too much on it. 5. The sight of these <hi>Gorgones,</hi> turned men into stones, and so many men are bereft of their sences and reason, by doating too much on womens beauty. 6. They that would get the maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Satan that terrible <hi>Gorgon,</hi> must be armed as <hi>Persius</hi> was; to wit, with the helmet of Salvation, the shield of faith, and the sword of the word. 7. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> by means of her shield, on which was fastned <hi>Medusas</hi> head, turned men to stones; so the nature of wisdom is, to make men solid, constant unmovable. 8. I wish that among Christians there were but one eye of faith and religion, and one tooth, one common defence, that so they might be <hi>Gorgons</hi> indeed, and terrible to the <hi>Turks</hi> their enemies; that with a brasen hand they might crush the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and with the golden wings of victorie, they might fly again over those territories which they have lost. 9. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusa</hi> by seeing her own face in <hi>Persius</hi> his bright shield, as in a glasse, she fell into a deep sleepe, and so became a prey to <hi>Persius;</hi> so many falling in love with themselves; grow insolent and carelesse, and falling

into the sleepe of securitie, become a prey to their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemie. 10. If a woman once loose her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie and honor, be she never so fair, she will seeme to wisemen but an ill-favored <hi>Gorgon,</hi> he accounts her hair as snakes, her beauty as deformitie. 11. A Captain or whosoever will encounter with a snakie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haired <hi>Gorgon,</hi> that is, a subtile headed enemie, stands in need of <hi>Minerva</hi> for wisdom, of <hi>Mercurie</hi> for elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and expedition, and of <hi>Vulcan</hi> for courage. 12. <hi>Persius</hi> got the victorie over <hi>Gorgon</hi> by covering his face with the helmet; that he might not be seen of her; the best way to overcome the temptations of lewd women, is to keep out of their sight, and to make a covenant with our eyes. 13. The <hi>Gorgons</hi> are like those that live at home a private life; and so make no use of their eye of prudence, till they be called abroad to some eminent place and publick office. 14. They that have fascinating and bewitching eyes, by which many are hurt and infected, especially yong children, may be called <hi>Gorgons,</hi> and that such are, both ancient records, experience, and reason doth teach us, for from a malignant eye, issues out infections, vapors or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which make easie impressions on infants and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der natures,; therefore the Gentiles had the goddesse of cradles called <hi>Cunina,</hi> to guard infants from fasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and we read that in <hi>Scythia</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> were women whose eyes were double balled, killing and bewitching with their sight, these were called <hi>Bithiae</hi> and <hi>Thibiae</hi> and they used the word <hi>praefiscine,</hi> as a charme against fascination, and in <hi>Africa</hi> whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles of these fascinating haggs were wont to be; and</p>
