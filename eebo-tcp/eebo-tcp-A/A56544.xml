            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS Humbly offered to the Conſideration of the Parliament, To repair the Loſs by Three Millions of Clipp'd Money, without any charge to the Nation for Fifteen Years, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is in the Million-Lottery Adventure 97500 Blank Tickets, and each Ticket entitles the Bearer to 1 <hi>l.</hi> a Year for fifteen Years, which muſt produce 15 <hi>l.</hi> in fifteen Years.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is humbly propoſed, That a new Act may paſs for the Lottery Fund to be continued five Years longer, which will be no charge till the fifteen Years are expired.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the Owner of each Blank Ticket bringing his Blank to an Office appointed for that purpoſe, and with it 11 <hi>l.</hi> in Clipp'd Money, the Blank ſo brought in to be fill'd up and regiſtred, the Clipp'd Money to be melted down at the Mint, and Coin'd into Mill'd Money; whoever brings a Prize of 10 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> may have it valued equal to ten Blanks, and ſo in proportion for the higheſt Prize in the Million Lottery.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Perſon that brings in the Blank Ticket with 11 <hi>l.</hi> in Clipp'd Money, ſhall at the ſame time receive a Bill for 20 <hi>l.</hi> to this effect.</p>
            <p n="5">V. To take off the inconveniency of Clipp'd and Counterfeit Money; it is enacted, That this Bill ſhall paſs, and be accounted as 20 <hi>l. Sterling</hi> in all Payments, as well in publick Receipts, as otherwiſe, under the Penalty of forfeiting — by any Perſon that ſhall refuſe the ſame. Foreign Bills only excepted.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That whoever is poſſeſſed of any of theſe 20 <hi>l.</hi> Bills at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1696. may ſend the ſame to the ſaid Office, and receive 1 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, and a new Bill for 19 <hi>l.</hi>which Bill muſt paſs in payment till <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1697. and then receive 1 <hi>l.</hi> more, and exchange his Bill of 19 <hi>l.</hi> for a new Bill of 18 <hi>l.</hi> and ſo ſucceſſively till the twenty Years are expired, by which means every one will receive his full value in Caſh for each Bill.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. By this means more than one Million and a half of Clipp'd Money will come into the Mint, without any charge to the Nation, or loſs to any one Perſon; for the Perſon that brings in the Clipp'd Money will have a Bill which is as good as Money, and the Government will be at no charge to pay the Bill, becauſe the 1 <hi>l.</hi> that is paid Annually upon each Bill will be raiſed out of the Fund that pays the Blank Tickets and Prizes, ſo that the Million and half of Clipp'd Money will enable the Government to Coin Mill'd Money, and be ready with that to Change a Million and half more of Clipp'd Money, and give good Money for it, which will make this Propoſal good, of repairing the loſs by three Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Clipp'd Money.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. When three Millions of Clipp'd Money is melted down, it will much leſſen the Quantity, and is hoped will take it all away; but if more remains, this Propoſal may be enlarged to take off the Remainder without any further charge for twenty Years.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. That a ſhort Day be prefixt to forbid paſſing Clipp'd Money in payment, and whoever does not bring his Clipp'd Money to be changed by the Day limited, ſhall loſe the benefit of having it changed, and proſecuted as a Clipper if he or ſhe offers any in payment; by which means the Broad Money may venture ſafely abroad without fear of being Clipp'd, and will be uſeful, which now is laid up and becomes uſeleſs, both to the Owner and Nation.</p>
            <p n="10">X. But if all Clipp'd Money be call'd in, and nothing left to ſupply Trade, all Commerce muſt ceaſe till new Money can be Coin'd, therefore it will be neceſſary that ſomething equivalent to Money be ordered to ſupply the place thereof, which theſe Bills here propoſed will effectually do, if this Honourable Houſe ſhall think fit by any Act to make them paſs.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. If theſe Bills ſhall be thought too large, they may for the conveniency of payment be made into 10 and 5 <hi>l.</hi> Bills; and if found incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, when the War is ended, may be paid off by ſuch a Tax as the Parliament ſhall think fit, and then the Fund may ceaſe.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. To prevent the Counterfeiting theſe Bills, and give all Perſons aſſurance of their being Authentick and True, ſuch Methods will further be offered to this Honourable Houſe, or any Committee they ſhall think fit to appoint, as will it's hoped Anſwer all Objections in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>Object. I. <hi>It may be objected that this Bill ought not to be forced in payment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither ought Clipp'd Money; and altho by the Law no one is compell'd to take it, nevertheleſs Cuſtom and Neceſſity has made it currant Payment; therefore of two Evils it is ſafeſt to chuſe the leaſt. Now it is evident, the Bills are the leaſt, becauſe they do leſſen every Year by Annual Payments, but the Clipp'd and Counterfeit Money daily encreaſes upon us, and has neither a preſent nor relative Value, which the Bills have, being ſecured upon a good Fund.</p>
            <p>Object. II. <hi>Great number of Blanks and Prizes are bought up, and made a Fund for the Million Bank, and not to be had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Blanks are not more worth than 6 <hi>l.</hi> 18 <hi>s.</hi> and the Prizes than ſeven Years purchaſe, and no doubt but profit will bring them out where-ever they are; for by this Propoſal there will be near 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> advantage, beſides the benefit of getting clear of the Clipp'd Money.</p>
            <p>Object. III. <hi>Some Perſons have Tickets, but have not Money to pay in upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe that have not Money, may be ſupplied by others that have no Tickets; ſo that they will be mutually Serviceable to each other; and whoever has more Tickets than he ſhall make uſe of himſelf, making it publick he need not doubt a Chapman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which is humbly ſubmitted to the Conſideration of this Honourable Houſe.</hi> By</p>
