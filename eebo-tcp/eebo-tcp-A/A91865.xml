            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A WORD of PITTY to the</hi> PROPHANE <hi>and to the</hi> UNRULY RULERS <hi>in this GENERATION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>OH People! when on your behalfs ſorrow had filled my heart; the Word was unto me, Write: And, what ſhall I write? God hath pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, God hath ſpared you till many thouſands of you have ſinned out the Day of your Viſitation; and now there is no Remedy. In your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable wickedneſs you have out-done the former Generations, and the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God of irreſiſtable Power is ſuddenly to plead with you.</p>
            <p>Oh! Is there no room among you to receive his Teſtimony, who hath felt the Wrath of God, revealed againſt the Man of Sin, in his own particular? who would now cry out among you in the ardour of his Soul, <hi>Repent, Repent,</hi> yet <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> before ye be cut off: For, this I declare unto you, in the Name, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Living God, and from a meaſure of his Counſel opened in me, That a ſhorter Day hath rarely remained to any Generation, than the little breathing that is now allowed you; And neither Hills nor Mountains, Corners nor ſecret Chambers, ſhall be able to hide any this day from the Wrath of the Lamb: wherefore come down, come down; you high ones, come forth, come forth, you covered and not with the Spirit; all People come forth quickly to this bright Day of God.</p>
            <p>Oh! hear, fear, and tremble, you tall, you ſturdy Oaks: for he who is God over all, will level you with the Earth: Lo, I have ſeen the dreadful Day that is to be revealed upon you. A Fire ſhall enter into your Bowels, and burn, and there ſhall be no remedy; yea, a Day of blaſting, and mildew; ſcattering, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, ſcattering, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts, ſhall enter among the Heathen; a Day of my Vengeance, and Fury, and my Recompence upon them, ſaith the mighty God. They have ſcattered my Heritage, and ſlain my living Witneſſe in them, which called them to Repentance. And now, who will ſtand up and plead? Though my Servants ſhould, them would I juſtify, yet I would not hear, for the Day of my Vengeance is in my heart, and the Year of my Redeemed is come, wherein I will render Fury to my Adverſaries, Recompence to my Enemies, that I may ſave my afflicted People, that the ſpringing Tree may grow, (known in my Beloved to be the Tree of Life) and bear Leaves and Fruit; whoſe Leaves ſhall heal the Nations, and its Fruit ſhall be Food to my Children. Then hinder this if you can, ye ſwarms of Locuſts, now crawling up from the Pit, to devour our Harveſt. But lo! you ſhall not; for, a Wind from the Lord ſhall drive you away.</p>
            <p>Oh! hear you Rulers of the Nations, (for, and through whom, a mighty Burden hath been upon me) foraſmuch as your wickedneſs is now beyond utterance. This is the Meſſage I am to declare unto you; <hi>That He, who is wonderful in Counſel, and excellent in Working, is ariſing in his Power, to raze your Foundation; And your Day ſhall be ſhort, your End ſhall be notable, and the ſhame of your Fall ſhall triple the glory of your Riſing; you ſhall leave your Houſes deſolate, and you Widows ſhall mourn.</hi>
