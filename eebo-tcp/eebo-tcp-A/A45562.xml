            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. This phrase, <hi>the Lord shall be my God,</hi> is capable of a double <hi>construction,</hi> either in a way of <hi>descending</hi> from <hi>God</hi> to <hi>man,</hi> or in a way of <hi>ascending</hi> from <hi>man</hi> to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>descending</hi> from <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Lord is his God,</hi> to whom he vouchsafes a <hi>peculiar favour,</hi> and of whom he is pleased to take a <hi>speciall care.</hi> In this sense he is called <hi>the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,</hi>

               <hi>matter</hi> of it is onely that which <hi>followes</hi> in the next <hi>verse.</hi> But had these words been intended by <hi>Jacob</hi> as a part of the <hi>condition</hi> of his <hi>vow,</hi> he would probably have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in the <hi>beginning,</hi> since this near <hi>relation</hi> of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Lord to be his God,</hi> is the <hi>foundation</hi> of all the rest; and therefore according to this construction, the rational <hi>order</hi> of the words had been thus; <hi>If the Lord shall be my God, and be with me, and keep me in the way that I shall goe, &amp;c.</hi> Nor is there any <hi>need,</hi> (as will hereafter appear) of <hi>fastning this</hi> interpretation upon the words to avoid any <hi>objection</hi> which may be made against the <hi>other,</hi> to which (with the generality of <hi>Expositors</hi>) I shall rather adhere, and accordingly construe the words.</p>

            <p n="2">2. That even in this <hi>latter</hi> construction, the words are capable of a double notion: The one <hi>generall</hi> and ordinary, the other <hi>speciall</hi> and extraordinary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>generall</hi> and common notion, <hi>The Lord is his God,</hi> who makes him the <hi>sole</hi> and whole object of his <hi>trust, love, fear, worship</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> Those Divine <hi>Attributes</hi> which are praedicated of the <hi>Deity,</hi> do justly call for all these.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Bonum indebitum,</hi> such a good as we were <hi>not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged</hi> to before our Vow. Indeed this must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in a <hi>qualified</hi> sense, by distinguishing between the <hi>substantials</hi> and the <hi>circumstantials</hi> of that good we vow; as also between an <hi>expresse</hi> and a <hi>virtual</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

            <p>To bring this home to the present case, though that <hi>Iacob</hi> should <hi>have the Lord for his God,</hi> is for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it an <hi>expresse</hi> command, yet to have him for

For <hi>Zacheus</hi> to <hi>give his goods to the poor</hi> is that which the <hi>law of God</hi> obliged him to; but to <hi>give half his goods</hi> was a <hi>free-will</hi> offering, the law having no where <hi>precisely</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined <hi>how much</hi> of our goods we should give.

            <p>I shall <hi>close</hi> up this with a short <hi>meditation: When we expect extraordinary favours, it is but reasonable we should vow some eminent service.</hi> That <hi>Merchant</hi> did very well in <hi>making</hi> (had he done as well in <hi>keeping</hi>) his <hi>vow,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. This <hi>practise</hi> of <hi>Gods servants</hi> is founded upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>good reason</hi>; For</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>prayer of the upright</hi> (according to <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverb) <hi>is Gods delight: Christ</hi> saith unto his <hi>Spouse,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Divine promises are so far from being impediments, that they are incouragements to prayer:</hi> If I know that <hi>he</hi> to whom I <hi>petition</hi> is <hi>well-affected</hi> towards <hi>me,</hi> and <hi>well-pleased</hi> with what I <hi>desire</hi> of him, it cannot but <hi>embolden</hi> me to go to him; what are the <hi>promises,</hi> but <hi>declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>Gods good will</hi> towards us, and what he is ready to do for us? and therefore we are justly animated <hi>to go boldly to the throne of grace.</hi>

               <hi>thou saidest thou wouldst do me good</hi>; with which that of <hi>David</hi> agreeth, <hi>deal well with thy servant according to thy word:</hi> and therefore instead of <hi>desisting</hi> from <hi>prayer,</hi> because of a <hi>promise,</hi> we should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>plead</hi> the <hi>promise</hi> in our <hi>prayer.</hi>

               <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them.</hi> As <hi>Repentance</hi> is the condition (if not alwaies <hi>expressed</hi> yet <hi>implied</hi>) of <hi>avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> what he hath <hi>threatned</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so is <hi>prayer</hi> of <hi>obtaining</hi> what he hath <hi>promised:</hi> and as the <hi>space</hi> between the <hi>denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> and <hi>executing</hi> of the <hi>menace</hi> is the <hi>time</hi> for the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise</hi> of <hi>repentance,</hi> that the evil <hi>threatned</hi> may not be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted</hi>; so the <hi>space</hi> between the <hi>making</hi> and <hi>accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>promise,</hi> is the <hi>time</hi> for the exercise of <hi>prayer,</hi> that the good <hi>promised</hi> may be <hi>performed.</hi> The <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> are as it were a <hi>store-house</hi> of blessings, but <hi>prayer</hi> is the <hi>key</hi> that opens it; they are as it were the <hi>well</hi> of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi> but <hi>prayer</hi> is the <hi>bucket</hi> which must draw out the water.</p>

               <hi>if any of you lack wisdome, let him aske of God, but let him ask in faith</hi>; now the choice <hi>prop</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> is the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> for though we believe <hi>God is able,</hi> yet we cannot believe <hi>he is willing</hi> to <hi>grant</hi> our desires unless we have a <hi>promise</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> it.

            <p>Having observed these <hi>rules,</hi> go forth (<hi>in Gods name) cheerfully, couragiously, confidently,</hi> expecting <hi>divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> to accompany thee: And whereas,

            <p>It hath pleased <hi>Divine providence</hi> to call you <hi>forth,</hi> from your <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>Fathers house</hi>: The <hi>way</hi> you are to go is <hi>long,</hi> to the remote parts of the world, and in that respect may seem <hi>tedious</hi>; your <hi>passage</hi> is by <hi>Sea,</hi> and that may prove <hi>perillous</hi>; the <hi>dangers</hi> of the <hi>Sea</hi> being probably <hi>more</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> then those of the <hi>land:</hi> But withall, your <hi>employment</hi> is not onely <hi>lawfull,</hi> but <hi>laudable, just,</hi> but <hi>honourable</hi>; you are intrusted with the <hi>goods,</hi> and imployed for the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>many,</hi> in which respect you are likely to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a <hi>common good.</hi> Besides, (which is no small comfort) <hi>God</hi> hath provided for you a <hi>meet help,</hi> a loving <hi>yoke-fellow,</hi> to go <hi>with you,</hi> one whose <hi>society</hi> wil recompense the <hi>absence</hi> of your <hi>other friends,</hi> and <hi>beguile</hi> the <hi>tediousnesse</hi> of the <hi>way,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Nothing now <hi>remaineth</hi> but to make sure that <hi>God may</hi> be <hi>with you</hi> in the way you are to go: in order to <hi>which</hi> the <hi>example</hi> of this holy <hi>Patriarch</hi> is well worthy your <hi>imitation</hi>; as <hi>he</hi> did, so do <hi>you bind</hi> your self to <hi>God</hi> by some solemn <hi>vow</hi> at your going <hi>forth,</hi> to do some <hi>extraordinary</hi> act of <hi>piety,</hi> of <hi>charity,</hi> at your <hi>coming home</hi>; and not onely so, but while it is called <hi>to day, consecrate</hi> your self to his <hi>service</hi>; throughout the whole <hi>time</hi> of your <hi>voyage walk</hi> with him, <hi>cleave</hi> to him, ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that of <hi>Azariah</hi> to <hi>Asa, The Lord is with you while ye be with him, and if ye seek him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chr. 15.2.</note> 
               <hi>he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him he will forsake you.</hi> Nor let this onely be your <hi>personall</hi> care, but what lieth in you take care that those who are <hi>under you</hi> may <hi>serve the Lord,</hi> so as the glorious <hi>name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> may not be <hi>blasphemed</hi> among the <hi>Indians</hi> by the prophane, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate</hi> and <hi>unclean</hi> lives of <hi>English</hi> Christians. Thus <hi>doing,</hi> doubt not of the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon you for <hi>good,</hi> &amp; for your greater <hi>incouragement</hi> cal to <hi>mind</hi> former <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences,</hi> remember how <hi>God hath been with you and kept you in this very way that you are now to go, so that you came again to your Fathers house in peace</hi>; his <hi>hand</hi> is not <hi>shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,</hi> that it cannot <hi>save,</hi> nor is he <hi>less</hi> willing to <hi>keep</hi> you now, if you <hi>keep close</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>I shall end my hortatory <hi>consolation</hi> to <hi>you</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessory <hi>supplication</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for <hi>you,</hi> for your <hi>Dear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,</hi> and all that goe along <hi>with you.</hi> Nor do I doubt but all your <hi>friends</hi> here present will <hi>joyn</hi> with me; nor shall we onely <hi>now</hi> but <hi>continually</hi> make mention of you in our prayers; and by the way it may be a <hi>comfort</hi> to you when you are upon the <hi>tempestuous Sea,</hi> and in that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52966:29"/>
               <hi>Barbarous land,</hi> that you have a <hi>stock</hi> of <hi>prayers</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> going for you.</p>
            <p>And now, what <hi>better, fitter, fuller</hi> prayer can be made for <hi>you</hi> by <hi>us</hi> or by your <hi>self,</hi> then that which here in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Jacob</hi> maketh for <hi>himself? That God Almighty would vouchsafe to be with you and keep you in the way which you go, and at last bring you again to your fathers house in peace, so as your friends who now part from you mournfully, may then meet you joyfully, and our prayers may be turned into praises and songs of deliverance.</hi> Finally, not onely that <hi>you may come to your Native Country in peace, but, that when you come again, you may find it in peace, the breaches of Church and State healed, every one enjoying his rights in quiet, sitting under his own fig-tree, and eating the fruit of his labours with joy and thankfulnesse:</hi> and let <hi>all</hi> that wish well to <hi>you,</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> to the <hi>Land,</hi> say <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
