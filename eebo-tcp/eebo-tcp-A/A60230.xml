            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE LIFE OF CAIUS SILIUS ITALICUS.</head>
                  <p>CAIUS SILIUS ITALICUS (whether born in SPAIN, but of ITALIAN Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or in ITALY, but of SPANISH Predecessors, I shall leave PETRUS CRINITUS, GYRALDUS, and others to dispute) in his Youth, applying himself to the Study of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, was a close Imitatour of CICERO, as the most perfect Pattern of ROMANE Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; after whose Example, he pleaded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Causes, with such Success, and Reputation, that he was, in a short time, made a Judg among the CENTUM-VIRI: nor was that Honour the sole Reward of his Virtues, though he lived in the Reign of the worst of Emperours; for he was thrice Consul, and his first Consulship was signalized with (that great felicity to the RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANE Empire) the Death of NERO. He was Pro-Consul of ASIA, and returned to ROME from that Province, with great advantage, both
<pb facs="tcp:99740:8"/>
of VVealth, and Honour. It is no mean Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his wisdom, and Prudence, that in the most troublesome Changes of the Empire, he never fell under the displeasure of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Party: For, as he was the last Consul, that NERO made, so he dyed the last of all, that had been Consuls under him. Among the chief of the City, neither covetous of Power, nor Obnoxious to Envy, he was reverenced, and esteemed by all: and of such Integrity in the Opinion of VITELLIUS, that, when he despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Force to resist the Power of VESPASIAN, he selected him, with CLUVIUS RUFUS, and SABINUS, to Treat his Conditions with the Conquerour. Nor did his Friendship with VITELLIUS, eclipse him with VESPASIAN, having ever entertained it with Prudence, and Moderation; so, that he survived that Noble Emperour, and was Honoured with a third Consulship by his Son DOMITIAN. Under whom, finding the weight of Business too heavy for his declining years, he retired into CAMPANIA, and recreated himself with the MUSES: and, as his Veneration of CICE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RO had moved him to purchase a Lordship, called by that Renowned ORATOUR, His Academy (in imitation of that of ATHENS) where he composed his Books, entituled his ACADEMIQUES. So his high Esteem of VIRGIL caused him to buy a Farm, once belonging to that Prince of Latine Poets, to whose Tombe (near NAPLES) as to a Temple, he frequently repaired; and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<pb facs="tcp:99740:8"/>
his Birth-Day, more Religiously, then his own. Nor was he onely a Devote to his Memory, but a Noble Emulatour of his Muse, after whose Example, he compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this Immortal Work, supplying with his Care, and Judgment, the Defects of Nature. He was Co-temporary with many other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Wits, as LUCAN, STATIUS, PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIUS, JUNIUS AQUINAS, and MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIAL, who is frequent in his Praises, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to his Censure his own VVorks, in this Epigram, among many other, excellently Englished by my worthy Friend JO: HEATH Esquire.
