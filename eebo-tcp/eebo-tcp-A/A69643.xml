         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That ſide of the Quadrant
where the Sights are, is the
Meridian, or XII a Clocke
line, unto which is joyned the ſcale of Moneths
with every fift Day, untill they grow
ſo little toward the Solſticeas, that they
cannot bee diſtinguiſhed. This ſcale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath five
Rowes, the midſt whereof hath the very
ſame diviſions which are on the Meridian line:
The two next on both ſides are for the parts of
the Moneths, which in the two outermoſt
Rowes are noted by their firſt Letters.</p>
            <p>The other ſide of the Quadrant hath on it the
ſcale of Altitudes above the Horizon.</p>
            <p>The ſhort Arching lines within the Quadrant
beſide the Meridian, are Houre-lines, noted by
their Figures, both for the forenoone, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39505:4"/>
and halfe Houre lines: each halfe houre
containing 30 min. of an hour, or Deg. 7. 30.
Of theſe Horary lines, thoſe which ſerve in the
morning before the Sunne is full Eaſt, or in the
evening paſt the Weſt, (which is onely in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
halfe yeare) are reverſed. And all the Hour
lines are noted with two Figures; whereof
the upper next the Center and ſcale of Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
ſerve for the afternoon; and the lower
for the forenoon. The two Arches which croſſe
the Houre lines, and meet at the beginning of
the Horizon and ſcale of Altitudes, are two
Quarters of the Ecliptic, and are divided into
90 Degr. a piece, in which are noted the XII
Signes by their proper Characters, namely on
the upper next the Center are ♈ ♉ ♊ &amp;
♋ ♌ ♍, the Summer or Northerne Signes:
and on the lower next the Horizon are ♎ ♏ ♐
&amp; ♑ ♒ ♓, the Winter or Southerne Signes,
and contain 30 Degr. a piece. This is the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

            <p>The long Arches, which beginning at the
Scale of moneths in the Meridian betwixt the
two Quarters of the Ecliptic, croſſe all the
Houre lines, are the parallels of Declination,
or the Semidiurnall Arches of the Sunne; the
middlemoſt of which is the Equinoctiall, the
outermoſt above is the Tropick of ♋, and the
outermoſt below is the Tropick of ♑: although
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39505:4"/>
between the Equinoctiall and each Tropick
Innumerable parallels are underſtood to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
yet thoſe which are in the Inſtrument
drawne, at every ſecond Degree of Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may be ſufficient to direct the eye in tracing
out an imaginary parallel from every point gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

            <p>The Equinoctiall and every tenth parallel are
for diſtinction ſake made ſomewhat groſſer
than the reſt, and all the Summer parallels at
the Eaſt and Weſt line are continued reverſedly
back unto the Horizon.</p>
            <p>Note that upon the right eſtimation of that
imaginary parallel, the manifold uſe of this
Inſtrument doth eſpecially rely; becauſe the
true place of the Sunne all that day is in ſome
part or point of the ſame Circle.</p>
            <p>And note that in this Inſtrument, the direct
Horary lines, and parallels before their reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <hi>Uſe I.</hi> To finde the Declination of the Sun
every day.</p>
            <p>Seek the day propoſed in the Scale of moneths
very exactly, &amp; mark upon what point it falleth
in the middle Row of that Scale, or (which is
all one) in the Meridian, for there is the Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39505:5"/>
of the Sunne from the Equinoctiall,

upon a parallel, but in the ſpace between
two, ſuppoſing each halfe of that ſpace to
containe 60 minutes, eſtimate with your eye
proportionally what minute the point giveth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example</hi> 1. What is the Sunnes Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clition
upon <hi>Novemb.</hi> 13? the day will fall in the

            <p>Note that the Declination thus found is to

from that point by the eſtimation of your eye,

               <hi>Uſe III.</hi> To finde the time of the Sunes Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and Setting every day.</p>
            <p>Seek out the imaginary parallel, or Semidiur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Arch of the Sun for that day by <hi>Vſe II,</hi> and
marke where it meeteth with the Horizon;
for that is the very point of the Sunnes riſing
and ſetting, and the Hour-lines on both ſides of
it, (by proportioning the diſtance reaſonably,
according to 30 minutes for halfe an houre)
will ſhew the time of the Sunnes riſing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>Thus at <hi>London, Novem.</hi> 13. the Sun will
be found to riſe at 9 min. before 8, and to ſet at
9 min. after 4. Alſo <hi>Auguſt</hi> 19, the Sunne will
be found to riſe 12 min. after 5. and to ſet 12
min. before 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe IV.</hi> To finde the Suns Amplitude, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Occaſive: that is, how many Degrees
of the Horizon the Sunne riſeth and ſetteth
from the true Eaſt and Weſt points every day.</p>
            <p>The imaginary parallel of the Sunne, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the time of the Sunnes riſing, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
ſheweth upon the Horizon the Degree of
his Amplitude from Eaſt and Weſt, which in all
the Northerne parallels is on the North ſide,
and in the Southerne on the South ſide.</p>
            <p>Thus at <hi>London, Novem.</hi> 13. the Ampl. Ort.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39505:6"/>
will be found 34 Degreees. Alſo <hi>Aug.</hi> 19. the
Ampl. Ort. will be found 15°. 10′.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe V.</hi> To find the Length of every day and
night.</p>
            <p>Double the houre of the ſunnes-ſetting, and
you ſhal have the Length of the day: or double
the houre of the ſunnes-riſing, and you ſhall
have the Length of the night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 6. To know the reaſon and manner of
the Increaſing and Decreaſing of the Dayes
and Nights throughout the whole yeare.</p>
            <p>When the Sunne is in the Equinoctial, it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
and ſetteth at 6 a Clocke: But if the
Sunne be out of the Equinoctial, declining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the North, the Interſection of the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
of the Sunne with the Horizon is before 6
in the morning, and after 6 in the evening; and
the Diurnall Arch greater than 12 houres, and
ſo much more great, the greater the Northerne
Declination is. Againe, if the Sunne be decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
toward the South, the Interſection of the
parallel of the Sunne with the Horizon is after
6 in the morning, and before 6 in the evening;
and the Diurnall Arch leſſer than 12 hours, and
by ſo much leſſer, the greater the Southern De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
is.</p>
            <p>And in thoſe places of the Ecliptic in
which the Sunne moſt ſpeedily changeth his
Declination, the Length alſo of the day is moſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39505:6"/>
altered; and where the Ecliptic goeth moſt
parallell to the Equinoctiall, changing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
ſlowly, the length of the day is but
little altered. As for Example; When the Sun
is neare unto the Equinoctiall on both ſides, the
dayes Increaſe and alſo Decreaſe ſuddenly and
apace; becauſe in thoſe places the Ecliptic
inclineth to the Equinoctiall in a manner like a
ſtraight Line, making ſenſible Declination.
Againe, when the Sunne is neare his greateſt
Declination, as in the height of Summer, and
the depth of Winter, the dayes keep for a

               <hi>Uſe XVII.</hi> To finde out the MeridianLine

            <p>About the middle of your plaine deſcribe
a Circle; and in the Center thereof erect a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39505:10"/>
ſtraight Piece of Wire perpendicularly. When
the Sunne ſhineth, note the point of the
Circle which the ſhadow of the Wire cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
which I therefore call the ſhadow point;
and inſtantly by <hi>Vſe IX.</hi> ſeeke the Sunnes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zumith
from the South or North: keepe it in
minde. Then from the ſhadow point, if your
obſervation be in the foore-noon, reckon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the circle an Arch equall to the Azumith
kept in minde, that way the Sunne moveth,
if the Azumith bee South: Or the contrary
way if it bee North. But if your obſervation
bee in the afternoone, reckon the North A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zumith
that way the Sunne moveth; Or the
South Azumith the contrary way.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, through the end of the Azumith
and the center, protract a Diameter for the
Meridian line ſought: which you may note
with <hi>S.</hi> at the south end, and with N. at the
North end.</p>
            <p>You may alſo note the point of the Circle
Diametrally oppoſite to the ſhadow point
with ſun;, becauſe it is the Azumith place of
the Sun, at the moment of your obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe XVIII.</hi> To finde the Declination of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Wall or plaine.</p>
            <p>The ſafeſt way (becauſe the Magneticall
Needle is apt to be drawne awry) will be by an
Inſtrument made in this manner. Provide a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39505:10"/>
rectangular board about ten Inches long, and
five broad: in the midſt whereof, croſſe the
breadth, ſtrike a Line perpendicular to the ſides;
and taking upon it a Center, deſcribe a Circle
interſecting the ſame Line, in two oppoſite
points, to be noted with the Letters T. and A:
divide each ſemicircle into two Quadrants,
and every Quadrant into 90 Degrees, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the points T and A, both wayes; the
firſt Quad. beginning on the left hand of T. the
ſecond Quadrant on the right hand: the third
Quadrant above it toward A: And laſtly, the
fourth Quadrant. And in the Center erect a
Wier at right Angles.</p>
            <p>The uſe of this Inſtrument. Apply the long
ſide of the board next T to the Wall when the
Sunne ſhineth upon it, holding it parallel to the
Horizon, that it may repreſent an Horizontall
plaine. Marke what Degree the ſhadow of the
Wyer cutteth in the Circle; and inſtantly ſeek
the Sunnes Azumith, either South or North:
Reckon it on the Circle from the ſhadow to
the Meridian, as was taught in the <hi>Uſe</hi> next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
noting that end with the Letter contrary
to that of the Azumith: as if the Azumith bee
South, note it N. and the oppoſite end S;
if the Azumith bee North, note it S, and the
oppoſite end N: whereby alſo you have the
Eaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Weſt ſides: So ſhall the Arch S A.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39505:11"/>
or N A. give the Declination of the plaine,
and the point A, the coaſt or quarter into which
it is.</p>
            <p>Example, <hi>June</hi> 2 in the forenoone, applying
the inſtrument to a wall, I found the ſhadow
in 23 Degr. of Quadr. 2. and the height of the
Sunne was 26 Degrees, whereby I found
the Azumith to be North 84 Degr. which rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
from the ſhadow againſt the Sunne, fell
upon 61 Degr. in Quad. 1. for one end of the
Meridian; and the Oppoſite end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is N.
upon 61 Degr. in Quad. 3. And A was on the
Eaſt ſide of N. Wherefore the Declination of
that Wall is 61 Deg. from the North Eaſtward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe XIX.</hi> To finde the Declination of an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

comming to it, or leaving it. And contrariwiſe,
the Declination of an upright Wall being known
to finde at what time the Sunne will come into
it.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Declination of a plain is an arch
of the Equinoctiall intercepted between the
Horizontall ſection of the plaine: and the Eaſt
or Weſt points: Or elſe (which is all one) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Meridian, and A, the <hi>axis</hi> of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontall
ſexion. Watch till you ſee the Center
of the Sunnejuſt even with the edge of the
Wall: then inſtantly take the Sunnes Azumith
from Eaſt or Weſt, by <hi>Uſe IX.</hi> the ſame is the
Declination of the wall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:39505:11"/>
Likewiſe if the Declination be given, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
it upon the Limbe of your Quadrant from
the Eaſt and Weſt point; and the thread being
applyed to the end of that Arch, ſhal in the Suns

be for the Southerne or winter parellels: and
thoſe beneath the Equinoctiall, for the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
