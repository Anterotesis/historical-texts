         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

be excepted againſt in Mr. Baxters
book, Stiled,
The Cure of Church Diviſions.</head>
            <p>THe whole Deſign of this Book being to make ſuch as at
this day are careful to keep themſelves <hi>Pure</hi> from all
defilements in <hi>Falſe Worſhip,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Except. 1.</note> Odious, it may well be
affirmed, that this was neither <hi>Seaſonable,</hi> nor <hi>Honeſt,</hi>
ſince the crying Sin this day, is not <hi>Separation;</hi> but <hi>Injuſt</hi> and
<hi>Violent Perſecutions</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks very little againſt,
although it be without any Compariſon, a greater Sin then the
other: Since <hi>Separation</hi> in many Caſes, is a Duty, which <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions</hi>
never can be.</p>
            <p>In the Preface,<note place="margin">Except. 2.</note> and in other places of his book,<note n="a" place="margin">p. 25. 6.</note> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
mentions with much <hi>bitterneſs,</hi> what was formerly done in the
time of the War; which is in him a moſt unbecoming practice,
becauſe (Firſt) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was as guilty of ſtirring up and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
that War, as any one whatſoever; and none ought to
blame the <hi>Effects,</hi> who gave riſe and encouragement to the
<hi>Cauſe.</hi> (Secondly) There is an <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> already paſt for all
actions of that kind, which none, that pretends to an <hi>Healing</hi> &amp;
<hi>Peaceable Spirit</hi> ſhould dare to think of Violating: (thirdly)
There is daily much greater prophaneneſs, and the conſequent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64466:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Prophaneneſs, Immorality acted by thoſe, whom yet Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> never mentions but with Honour, as if no Sins or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
were to be blamed, but theirs, who are unable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves.</p>
            <p>He ſpeaks much againſt telling<note place="margin">Except. 3.</note> others of their ſins in furious
words;<note place="margin">Pref. Par. 12</note> and yet allows himſelf a great and maſterly Liberty in

he cloſeth that Paragraph, with ſuch an expreſſion: <hi>If this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation

an abundance (he knows not how many) of good people of the
darker ſort, for their overvaluing him and his underſtanding. That
<note n="g" place="margin">p 383</note> Reproofs have been patiently born from him, becauſe he was
looked upon as not aiming to depreſs the honour of true and ſerious
Religion. <hi>Theſe, with many expreſſions of the like import, do
abundantly diſcover that Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>is full of great thoughts

an <hi>Aſſert</hi> unto what we knew was ſinful, ſo that we may ſay

               <hi>we diſown them,</hi> (i. e. The <hi>Biſhops</hi> and the <hi>impoſing

<hi>He ſays are</hi> abuſed by abundance of ignorant profeſſors, as if they
had commanded us to ſeparate from the colder and comon ſort of
Chriſtians, and to come out of the Church whereof they are members
<hi>this he calls</hi> a prophaning of Gods word, and a groſs and palpable

            <p>It were eaſie to return theſe ill words, but we will allow
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> a Priviledge to uſe them, and to his argument we
anſwer, That it is no <hi>prophaning,</hi> but a ſober and Religious
Interpreting of Scripture, to take the words of it, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64466:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were ſpoken concerning one thing. and by way of <hi>proportion</hi>

they belong to others, that under the Name of being
Chriſtians, are guilty of the ſame crimes, And therefore we
are commanded ſtrictly to ſeparate from <hi>every one that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a brother, of he be covetous, or a Railer,</hi> or the like, if any
<hi>Church,</hi> will receive ſuch for their <hi>Members,</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

own ſuch a <hi>Church,</hi> as a <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> and therefore muſt
<hi>come out of it, leaſt we partake of her ſins,</hi> and if this way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
from <hi>Analogy,</hi> be not good and ſafe, we doubt whether
Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> hath any thing to defend <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> with;
ſince the beſt argument, that all learned men have ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it by, is the proportion it hath to <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> from
whence they conclude by a parity of Reaſon, that what was
uſed to <hi>Infants</hi> before, in order to their admiſſion unto
<hi>Church priviledges,</hi> may be continued now to them under a
New adminiſtration, and the very ſame manner of reaſoning
will hold in the preſent caſe, which is not an effect of
<hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Raſhneſs,</hi> but of <hi>Spiritual Soundneſs, and
Sobriety.</hi>

            <p>He doth at large recite the <hi>Corruptions,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Dir. 5. p. 33.</note>
where <hi>ſuch corruptions</hi> are ſtill continued; But this he doth
very Impertinently, For though many errors, both in Doctrine
and Life, were formerly admitted, yet none of them were
impoſed as <hi>Conditions of Communion,</hi> which is at this day
the complaint and grievance of all the <hi>Separate,</hi> and of
which they have frequently deſired redreſs, but in vain, in
order to communion.</p>

               <hi>He relates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Excep. 8. p. 55.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> he hath met with many conſcientious profeſſors, who
would not communicate with the Pariſh Churches, becauſe the
people were ignorant, who when he had examined them, have

proved ignorant of the very ſubstance of Chriſtianity, <hi>It is hardly
poſſible to believe that he hath met</hi> with many ſuch, <hi>or if he
had, yet ought not ſuch things to be concealed?
are not we commanded</hi> not to reveal the ſecret of another, <hi>which
pious and prudent Rule Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>hath not ſcrupled to
