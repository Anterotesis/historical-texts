            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But here is not only mention of the <hi>breaking in of the Plague,</hi> in the XXIX Verse; but of the <hi>stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ceasing of the Plague,</hi> in the XXX.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>whatsoeverthings were written aforetime,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.4.</note> 
               <hi>were written for our learning;</hi> and so was this Text. Vnder one, to teach us how the <hi>Plague</hi> comes, and how it may be <hi>staied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Plague</hi> is a <hi>disease.</hi> In every <hi>disease,</hi> we <note place="margin">The Division</note> consider the <hi>cause</hi> and the <hi>cure.</hi> Both which are here set forth unto us in these two Verses. In the <hi>former,</hi> the <hi>cause</hi> how it comes. In the <hi>latter,</hi> the <hi>cure</hi> how it may be staid. To know the <hi>cause</hi> is expedient; for if we know it not, our <hi>cure</hi> will be but <hi>palliative,</hi> as not going to the right. And if knowing the <hi>cause,</hi> we adde not the <hi>cure,</hi> when we are taught it, who will pitty us? For, none is then to blame, but our selves.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Of the <hi>cause</hi> first: and then of the <hi>cure.</hi> The <hi>cause</hi> is set downe to be twofold: <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
               <hi>Gods anger:</hi> and <hi rend="sup">2</hi> their <hi>inventions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gods anger,</hi> by the which: and their <hi>inventions,</hi> for the which, the <hi>Plague brake in among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>cure</hi> is likewise set downe: and it is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, out of <hi>two</hi> significations of one word, the word (<hi>Palal</hi>) in the Verse. <hi>Phinees prayed</hi> (some reade it,) <hi>Phinees executed judgement</hi> (some other;) and the word beares both. Two then, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
               <hi>Phinees prayer,</hi> one: <hi rend="sup">2</hi> 
               <hi>Phinees executing judgement,</hi> the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14039:3"/>
other; by both which the <hi>Plague</hi> ceased. His <hi>prayer</hi> referring to <hi>Gods anger:</hi> His <hi>executing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to their <hi>inventions. Gods wrath</hi> was appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by his <hi>prayer: Prayer</hi> refers to that. <hi>Their inventions</hi> were removed by his executing of <hi>judgement:</hi> The <hi>execution</hi> of <hi>judgement</hi> refers to that. If His <hi>anger</hi> provoked do send the <hi>Plague;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 99.8.</note> His <hi>anger</hi> appeased will stay it. If our <hi>inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> provoke his anger, the <hi>punishing</hi> of our <hi>inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> will appease it. The one worketh upon <hi>God,</hi> pacifieth <hi>Him:</hi> The other worketh upon our <hi>soule,</hi> and <hi>cures</hi> it. For there is a <hi>cure</hi> of the <hi>soule,</hi> no lesse then of the <hi>body,</hi> as appeareth by the <hi>Psalme, heale my soule, for I have sinned against thee.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 41.4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We are to begin with the <hi>cause</hi> of the plague, in the first Verse: And so, to come to the <hi>cure</hi> in the second.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">

            <p>And indeed the very name of the <hi>Plague</hi> doth tell us as much. For <hi>Deber</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> sheweth, <note place="margin">

               <hi>The</hi> Humours. <hi>For to that doth</hi> King David <note place="margin">2 The <hi>Humors corrupted.</hi> Psal. 3 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>ascribe the</hi> cause <hi>of his</hi> disease: (<hi>that is</hi>) <hi>that his</hi> moisture in him was corrupt, dried up, turned into the drought of Summer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Contagion.</hi> Which is cleare by the Law: where, the <hi>leprous</hi> person for feare of <hi>contagion</hi> from him, <note place="margin">3 <hi>Contagion.</hi> Lev. 13.45, 46. <unclear>52</unclear>.</note> was ordered to cry, that <hi>no body should come neere him:</hi> To dwell apart from other men: The clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he had worne to be <hi>washed,</hi> and in some case to be <hi>burnt:</hi> The house-wals he had dwelt in, to be <hi>scraped;</hi> and in some case, the <hi>house</hi> it selfe to be pulled <hi>downe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all which three respects, <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>A wise man feareth the plague and departeth from it,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14.16.</note> 
               <hi>and fooles run on and be carelesse.</hi> A <hi>wise man</hi> doth it, and a <hi>good man</hi> too. For <hi>King David</hi> himselfe durst not goe to the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>God</hi> at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> to enquire of <hi>God</hi> there, because the <hi>Angell that smote the people with the plague, stood betweene him and it:</hi> (that is) because he was to passe through <note place="margin">1 Chro. 21. 30.</note> 
               <hi>infected places</hi> thither.</p>
            <p>But as we acknowledge these to be true, that <note place="margin">2 Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> in all <hi>diseases,</hi> and even in this also, there is a <note place="margin">By which, GOD.</note> 
               <hi>naturall cause:</hi> so wee say, there is somewhat more, something <hi>divine,</hi> and <hi>above nature.</hi> As somewhat, which the <hi>Physitian</hi> is to looke unto, in the <hi>Plague:</hi> so likewise something for <hi>Phinees</hi> to doe, and <hi>Phinees</hi> was a <hi>Priest.</hi> And so some worke for the <hi>Priest,</hi> as well as for the <hi>Physitian,</hi> and more, then (it may be.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:14039:5"/>
It was <hi>King Asa's</hi> fault. He in his sicknesse, looked all to <hi>Physitians,</hi> and looked not after <hi>God</hi> at all. That is noted as his fault. It seemes his conceit was, there was nothing in a disease, but <hi>naturall,</hi> nothing but bodily: which is not so. For, <hi>infirmity,</hi> is not onely a thing <hi>bodily;</hi> there is a <hi>Spirit of infirmity,</hi> we finde, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.11. And something <hi>spirituall</hi> there is, in all infirmities; something in the <hi>soule</hi> to be healed. In all, but specially in this: Wherein that we might know it to be <hi>spirituall,</hi> we finde it oft times to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by <hi>spirits.</hi> We see an <hi>Angell,</hi> a <hi>destroying Angell,</hi> in the <hi>Plague</hi> of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> another in the <note place="margin">Exod. 12.13. Esay 37. 36. 1 Chro. 21.16 Rev. 16.2.</note> 
               <hi>Plague in Senacheribs Campe:</hi> a third in the <hi>Plague at Ierusalem</hi> under <hi>David:</hi> a fourth, pouring his phiall upon earth, <hi>and there fell a noisome plague upon man and beast.</hi> So that no man looketh deeply enough into the <hi>cause</hi> of his sicknesse, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he acknowledge the finger of God in it, over and above any causes naturall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> then hath his part. <hi>God;</hi> but how affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? <hi>God provoked to anger:</hi> so it is in the Text: <note place="margin">God provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to auger.</note> His <hi>anger,</hi> His <hi>wrath</hi> it is, that bringeth the <hi>plague</hi> among us. The Verse is plaine; <hi>They provoked him to anger, and the plague brake in among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Generally, there is no evill (saith <hi>Iob</hi>) but it is <note place="margin">Iob 5. 6.</note> a sparke <hi>of</hi> GODS <hi>wrath.</hi> And of all evils, the <hi>Plague by name. There is wrath gone out from</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Chro. 21.7.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord, and the plague is begunne</hi> (saith <hi>Moses, Numbers</hi> 16.46.) So it is said, <hi>God was</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with <hi>David, and he smote Israel with the plague.</hi> So that if there bee a <hi>plague,</hi> GOD is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14039:5"/>
angry: and if there be a great <hi>plague, God</hi> is very angry. Thus much for <hi>By what;</hi> for the <hi>anger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by which the <hi>plague</hi> is sent. Now for <hi>what.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a cause in GOD, <hi>that he is angry.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">For which. <hi>sin in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi> Hab. 3.8.</note> And there is a <hi>cause,</hi> for which he is <hi>angry.</hi> For he is not <hi>angry</hi> without a <hi>cause.</hi> And what is that cause? For what is GOD <hi>angry? What, is God angry with the waters when he sends a tempest?</hi> (it is <hi>Habacucks</hi> question.) Or is GOD <hi>angry</hi> with the <hi>earth,</hi> when hee sends <hi>barrennesse?</hi> Or with the <hi>aire,</hi> when he makes it <hi>contagious?</hi> No indeed, His <hi>anger</hi> is not against the <hi>Elements,</hi> they <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him not.</hi> Against them it is, that <hi>provoke</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephos. 5.6.</note> him to <hi>anger;</hi> against <hi>Men</hi> it is, and against their <hi>sinnes,</hi> and <hi>for them commeth the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the very <hi>cause</hi> indeed. As there is <hi>Putredo humorum;</hi> so there is also <hi>putredo morum.</hi> And <hi>putredo morum,</hi> is more a <hi>cause,</hi> than <hi>putredo humorum.</hi> The <hi>corruption</hi> of the <hi>soule,</hi> the <note n="a" place="margin">Mica. 7.3.</note> 
               <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our wayes,</hi> more than the <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 6 12.</note>

               <hi>The cause of death</hi> (that is) <hi>sinne,</hi> the same is the <hi>cause,</hi> of this <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 38.5.</note>

who is the onely <hi>Physitian</hi> of the diseases of the <hi>soule.</hi>

            <p>But shall we say, the wrath of GOD for <hi>sins</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Particular</hi> sin.</note> 
               <hi>indefinitely?</hi> That were somewhat <hi>too generall:</hi> may we not specifie them, or set them downe in <hi>particular?</hi> Yes, I will point you at three or foure.</p>
            <p>First, this <hi>Plague</hi> here, as appeareth by the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1</hi> Fornication.</note> XXVIII Verse, the Verse next before, came for the sinne of <hi>Peor</hi> (that is) for <hi>fornication</hi> (as you may reade.) And not every <hi>fornication,</hi> but <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication past shame;</hi> as was that of <hi>Zamri</hi> there, with a <hi>daughter of Moab.</hi> And indeed if wee <note place="margin">Num. 25.1.</note> marke it well, it fits well. For, that kinde of sin (<hi>fornication</hi>) doth end in <hi>Vlcers</hi> and <hi>sores;</hi> and those as infectious as the <hi>Plague</hi> it selfe: a proper punishment; such <hi>sore</hi> for such <hi>evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Davids plague of seventy thousand</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2</hi> Pride.</note> (which wee mention in our Prayer) that, came <note place="margin">1 Chro. 21.14.</note> for Pride, plainly: <hi>His heart was lifted up to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the people.</hi> And that seemes somewhat kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, and to agree with this disease. That <hi>pride,</hi> which <hi>swels</hi> it selfe, should end in a <hi>tumor,</hi> or <hi>swelling;</hi> as for the most part this disease doth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:14039:6"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Senacheribs plague</hi> (it is plaine) came <note place="margin">3 <hi>Blasphemy.</hi> Esay 37. 36.</note> from <hi>Rabshakes blasphemy: Blasphemie</hi> able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>aire,</hi> it was so foule. In which regard, <hi>Aarons</hi> act might be justified, in putting odours <note place="margin">Num. 16.46.</note> into his <hi>Censer,</hi> to purifie the <hi>Aire</hi> from such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>And last, the Apostle sets downe the <hi>cause</hi> of <note place="margin">4 <hi>Neglect of the Sacrament.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.30.</note> the <hi>plague</hi> at <hi>Corinth: For this cause</hi> (saith hee) that is, <hi>for neglect of the Sacrament:</hi> Either in not <hi>caring</hi> to come to it; or in <hi>comming</hi> to it, we care not how: <hi>For this cause,</hi> is there a <hi>mortality</hi> among you; <hi>and many are sicke, and many are weake, and many are fallen asleepe.</hi> And this is no new thing. <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe, his neglect of the <note place="margin">Exod. 4.24.</note> 
               <hi>Sacrament,</hi> made him be stricken of GOD, that it was like to have cost him his life. And hee saith plainly to <hi>Pharaoh: If they neglected their sacrifice, God would fall upon them with the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. 5.3.</note> which appeareth by this, that the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>passeover,</hi> and the <hi>bloud</hi> of it, was the meanes to save them from the <hi>plague</hi> of the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Angell in Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little now of the <hi>phrase;</hi> that <hi>their sins</hi> are <note place="margin">The phrase for sin, <hi>Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</hi>
               </note> here called by the name of <hi>their inventions.</hi> And so (sure) they are: as no wayes taught us by <hi>God,</hi> but of <hi>our owne imagining</hi> or finding out. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, our <hi>inventions</hi> are the <hi>cause</hi> of all <hi>sinnes.</hi> And if wee looke well into it wee shall finde our <hi>inventions</hi> are so. By <hi>Gods</hi> injunction we should <note place="margin">In matters of Religion.</note> all live, and his injunction is: <hi>You shall not doe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man what seemes good in his owne eyes</hi> (or <hi>findes</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:14039:7"/>
               <hi>out in his owne braines) but, whatsoever I command</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 12.8.</note> 
               <hi>you, that onely shall you doe.</hi> But we, setting light by that charge of his, out of the old disease of our <hi>Father Adam (Eritic sicut Dii, scientes bonum &amp; malum)</hi> thinke it a goodly matter to be <hi>witty,</hi> &amp; to <hi>find out</hi> things our selves to <hi>make to our selves,</hi> to be Authors, and inventors of somewhat, that so we may seeme to be as wise as <hi>God,</hi> if not wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser: and to know what is for our turnes, as well as he, if not better. It was <hi>Sauls</hi> fault. GOD bade destroy <hi>Amalek</hi> all; and hee would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a better way to save some (forsooth) for <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> which GOD could not thinke of. And it was S. <hi>Peters</hi> fault, when he perswaded <hi>Christ</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16.22.</note> from His Passion, and found out a better way (as he thought) than <hi>Christ</hi> could devise.</p>
            <p>This is the proud invention, which will not be kept in, but makes men even not to forbeare in things pertaining to <hi>Gods worship;</hi> but there, to be still devising new tricks, opinions and fashions, fresh and newly taken up, which their <hi>Fathers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32.17.</note> 
               <hi>knew of.</hi> And this is that, which makes men that have <hi>itching eares, to heape to themselves</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.3.</note> 
               <hi>Teachers, according to their owne lusts,</hi> which may fill their heads full, with new inventions.</p>
            <p>And this is that, that even out of <hi>Religion,</hi> in <note place="margin">In the <hi>common life.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>common</hi> life, spoiles all. The <hi>wanton inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in finding out new <hi>meats</hi> in diet, in inventing new fashions in <hi>apparell,</hi> which men so dote on (as the Psalme saith at the 39. Verse) as <hi>they even go a whoring with them,</hi> with <hi>their owne inventions,</hi> and care not what they spend on them. And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14039:7"/>
know no end of them: but as fast as they are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of one, a new invention is found out; which <hi>whatsoever it cost,</hi> how much soever it take from our <hi>Almes,</hi> or <hi>good deeds,</hi> must bee had, till all come to nought. That the Psalmist hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen a very fit word, that <hi>for our inventions,</hi> the <hi>plague</hi> breakes in among us: for them, as for the <hi>primarie,</hi> or first moving cause of all. Indeed for them, as much and more than for any thing else.</p>
            <p>Wee see then, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> First, that a <hi>cause</hi> there is. <hi rend="sup">2</hi> That that <hi>cause</hi> is not onely <hi>naturall,</hi> but that <hi>God</hi> Himselfe hath a hand in it. <hi rend="sup">3</hi> 
               <hi>God</hi> as being provoked to anger. <hi rend="sup">4</hi> To anger for our sinnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generall (and for what sins in speciall.) For our <hi>sins</hi> proceeding from nothing, but our <hi>inventions.</hi> Which <hi>cause</hi> if it continue, and yet we turne not to the <hi>Lord</hi> (as <hi>Amos</hi> the 4.) <hi>then will not his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bee turned away, but His hand will bee stretched out still</hi> (as <hi>Esay</hi> the 9.) And <hi>no way to avoide the one, but by appeasing the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>cure</hi> now. <hi>One contrary is ever cured by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">II. Of the <hi>Cure.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>another.</hi> If then it be <hi>anger;</hi> which is the <hi>cause in God, anger</hi> would be <hi>appeased.</hi> If it be <hi>inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which is the <hi>cause in us,</hi> of the <hi>anger of God,</hi> they would be <hi>punished</hi> and <hi>removed.</hi> That so, the <hi>cause</hi> being taken away, the <hi>effect</hi> may cease. Take away our <hi>inventions, Gods anger</hi> will cease. Take away <hi>Gods anger,</hi> the <hi>plague</hi> will cease.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two</hi> Readings (we said) there were: <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
               <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees prayed,</hi> or <hi rend="sup">2</hi> 
               <hi>Phinees executed judgement. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lal,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:14039:8"/>
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word will beare both. And both are <hi>good:</hi> And so we will take them both in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer</hi> is good against the <hi>plague,</hi> as appeareth: Not onely in this <hi>plague</hi> in the Text, wherein all <note place="margin">

               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 24.17</note> 
               <hi>Davids plague</hi> also; where wee see what his <hi>prayer</hi> was, and the very words of it.</p>
            <p>And in <note n="c" place="margin">Esay 38. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Ezekiahs plague,</hi> who turned <hi>his face to the wall, and prayed unto</hi> GOD (and his <hi>prayer</hi> is set downe:) God heard his <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>healed</hi> him. And (for a generall rule) <note n="d" place="margin">1 Kings 8. 37, 38, 39.</note>

            <p>And it standeth with good reason. For, as the <hi>Aire</hi> is infected with <hi>noisome sents</hi> or <hi>smels,</hi> so the <hi>infection</hi> is removed by <hi>sweet odours,</hi> or <hi>incense:</hi> which <hi>Aaron</hi> did in the <hi>Plague (put sweet odours</hi>

            <p>As (we know) the <hi>Office of a Sergeant</hi> being to <hi>arrest;</hi> the <hi>office</hi> of a <hi>Notarie</hi> to make <hi>acts;</hi> the <hi>act</hi> that is done by one of them, is much more <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall,</hi> then that which is done by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">Heb. 5.1.</note> person. <hi>So every Priest being taken from among men, and ordained for men, in things pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to</hi> God, <hi>that he may offer prayers:</hi> the <hi>prayers</hi> hee offereth, hee offereth out of his <hi>office,</hi> and so even in that respect there is (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) a more force, and energie in them, as comming from Him, whose <hi>calling it is to offer them;</hi> than in those that come from another, whose calling it is not so to doe.</p>
            <p>To this end, God saith to <hi>Abimelech; Abraham is a Prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live.</hi> So that the prayer of a Prophet, in that he <note place="margin">Gen. 20.7.</note> is a Prophet, is more effectuall.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Law,</hi> you shall finde it all along: when men come to bring their sacrifice for their sins, it is said, <hi>the Priest shall make an attonement for them before the Lord, and their sins shall be forgiven them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Prophets we see plainly, in time of distresse, <hi>Ezekia</hi> sent unto the <hi>Prophet Esay,</hi> to entreat him to lift up his <hi>prayer</hi> for the remnant that were left: and so he did, and was heard by GOD.</p>
            <p>And in the new Testament, S. <hi>Iames</hi> advice is, <hi>In time of sicknesse to call for the Priests, and they to</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:14039:9"/>
               <hi>pray over the party,</hi> and that <hi>prayer</hi> shall worke his health; <hi>and if he have committed sinnes, they shall be forgiven him.</hi> For where the grace of prayer is, and the calling both, they cannot but availe more, than where no calling is, but the <hi>grace</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>The <hi>prayer of Phinees,</hi> and of <hi>Phinees</hi> standing. What need there be any mention of <hi>Phinees</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? Was it not enough to say <hi>Phinees</hi> prayed? It skils not whether he <hi>sate</hi> or <hi>stood;</hi> for praying it selfe was enough.</p>
            <p>No: wee must not thinke, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> sets downe any thing that is <hi>superfluous.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what there is, in that he <hi>stood.</hi> Of <hi>Moses</hi> it is said <note place="margin">Ier. 18.20.</note> before in this <hi>Psalme,</hi> that hee <hi>stood in the gap to turne away the wrath of God.</hi> In <hi>Ieremie</hi> it is said, though <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> stood before me: So there is mention made of <hi>standing</hi> also. And the <hi>Prophet</hi> himselfe puts God in mind, that he <hi>stood before him, to speake good for the people,</hi> and <hi>to turne away his wrath from them</hi> (that is) <hi>put God in mind of the very sight of his body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, though <hi>God</hi> be a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and so <hi>in Spirit</hi> to <note place="margin">Iohn 4.24.</note> be <hi>worshipped;</hi> yet in as much as he hath given us a body, with that also are we <hi>to worship Him,</hi> and <hi>to glorifie him in our body and spirit,</hi> which both <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6 20. Rom 12.1.</note> 
               <hi>are Gods:</hi> and <hi>to present</hi> (or offer) <hi>our bodies to God, as a holy and acceptable sacrifice, in the reasonable service of Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to present them decently. For that also is <hi>required in the service of God.</hi> Now <hi>judge in</hi>

               <hi>sitting? Sedentem or are, extra disciplinam est</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) to pray <hi>sitting,</hi> or <hi>sit praying,</hi> is <hi>against the order of the Church.</hi> The <hi>Church of God</hi> never had, nor hath any such fashion.</p>
            <p>All tendeth to this, as <hi>Cyprians</hi> advice is, <hi>Eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am habitu corporis placere Deo,</hi> even by our very <hi>gesture,</hi> and the <hi>carriage</hi> of our body, to behave our selves so, as with it we may <hi>please God. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent, carelesse, undevout behaviour</hi> pleaseth Him not.</p>
            <p>It is noted of the very <hi>Angels, Iob</hi> 1.6. <hi>Esa.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. that they were <hi>standing before God.</hi> If them it becomes; if <hi>Phinees,</hi> if <hi>Moses,</hi> if <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Ieremie,</hi> it may well become us to learne our <hi>gesture</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer</hi> is availeable to appease <hi>Gods wrath,</hi> and <note place="margin">Against their inventions. 1 Execution of judgement.</note> so consequently to remove the <hi>Plague:</hi> but not <hi>prayer</hi> alone. For though it abate the anger of <hi>God</hi> (which is the first) yet it goeth not high enough, takes not away the second <hi>cause</hi> (that is) our inventions, which are the cause of <hi>Gods anger.</hi> We see it plaine in <hi>Num.</hi> 25.6. they were all at <hi>prayers,</hi> and <hi>Phinees</hi> among them, he and the rest. <note place="margin">Num. 25.7.8.</note> But yet the <hi>plague</hi> ceased not for all that: till (in the verse following) <hi>Phinees</hi> tooke his <hi>javelin,</hi> wherewith in the very act of <hi>fornication he thrust them both through, Zamri</hi> and his <hi>woman,</hi> and then the <hi>plague</hi> was stayed from the children of <hi>Israel.</hi> For, as prayer referreth properly to anger: so so doth <hi>executing judgement to sin,</hi> or to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions the cause of it.</p>
            <p>Prayer then doth well: but prayer and doing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14039:10"/>
               <hi>justice,</hi> both these together (joyntly) will doe it indeed. And if you <hi>disjoyne</hi> or separate them, nothing will be done. <hi>If we draw neere to God with our mouthes, and honour Him with our lips,</hi> it will not availe us, if <hi>judgement be turned back,</hi> or <hi>justice</hi>

               <hi>stand afaroff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two persons. Both of them were <note place="margin">2 By <hi>Phinees</hi> as a <hi>Prince</hi> in his <hi>Tribe,</hi> and a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</note> in <hi>Phinees.</hi> For, as he was a <hi>Priest;</hi> so he was a <hi>Prince</hi> of his Tribe. So then, both these must joyne together, as well the <hi>devotion</hi> of the <hi>Priest in prayer,</hi> which is his <hi>Office:</hi> as the <hi>zeale</hi> of the Magistrate in executing <hi>judgement,</hi> which is His. For, <hi>Phinees</hi> the Priest, must not onely stand up, and pray: but <hi>Moses</hi> (the Magistrate also) must <hi>stand in the gap to turne away the wrath of God, that he destroy not the people.</hi> No lesse he, <hi>than Aaron</hi> with his <hi>golden Censer, to run into the midst of the Congregation, to make attonement for them when the plague is begun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses,</hi> he gave in charge for the executing of them, that were <hi>joyned to Baal-Peor, Num.</hi> 25.4. <hi>Phinees,</hi> he executed the <hi>charge: Moses stood in the gap,</hi> when he gave the sentence: <hi>Phinees stood up,</hi> when he did the <hi>execution.</hi> And these <hi>two</hi> are a <hi>blessed conjunction.</hi> One of them without the other, may misse; but both together never faile. For when <hi>Zamri</hi> was slaine; and so when <hi>Rabsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi> perished; and so when the <hi>incestuous Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> was <hi>excommunicated;</hi> in all three, the plague ceased.</p>
            <p>But what if <hi>Moses</hi> give no charge: what if <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>3</hi> By every man upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> doe no <hi>execution,</hi> as oft it falleth out? How
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14039:10"/>
then? In that case, every private man is to bee <hi>Phinees to himselfe;</hi> is not onely to <hi>pray</hi> to God, but to be <hi>wreaked,</hi> doe <hi>judgement, chasten his owne body;</hi> and so <hi>judge himselfe, that he may not be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord.</hi> For every one, for his part, is a cause of the <hi>judgements of God</hi> sent downe; and so <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.11.</note> may bee, and is to bee, a cause of the <hi>removing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor 9.<abbr>1</abbr>7.</note> 
               <hi>them.</hi> Somewhile the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> by the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11 3.</note> 
               <hi>pride</hi> of his <hi>heart.</hi> Otherwhile the <hi>people,</hi> by their <hi>murmuring</hi> against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> So that, <hi>King</hi> and <hi>people</hi> both, must <hi>judge themselves,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private offender, himselfe. <hi>Zamri,</hi> if he had <hi>judged himselfe, Phinees</hi> should not have <hi>judged</hi> him. The <hi>incestuous Corinthian,</hi> if he had <hi>judged</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Chr. 21. 1.8.</note> himselfe, S. <hi>Paul</hi> had not <hi>judged</hi> him. For, either <note place="margin">Num. 16.3.</note> by <hi>our selves,</hi> or by the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> or if by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both, by <hi>God</hi> Himselfe. For, one way or other sin must be <hi>judged. Zamri,</hi> by his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; <hi>Phinees,</hi> by his <hi>prayer,</hi> or doing <hi>justice;</hi> or <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>plague</hi> sent among them.</p>
            <p>Now then, these two; <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
               <hi>Phinees stood up and prayed,</hi> 
               <hi rend="sup">2</hi> and <hi>Phinees stood up and executed judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> if they might be coupled together, I durst undertake, the conclusion would be, <hi>and the plague ceased.</hi> But either of them wanting I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise nothing.</p>
            <p>To conclude then. 1. The <hi>plague</hi> comes not by chance, but hath a <hi>cause.</hi> 2. That <hi>cause</hi> is not altogether naturall, and pertaines to <hi>Physicke;</hi> but hath something <hi>supernaturall</hi> in it, and pertaines to Divinity. 3. That <hi>supernaturall cause</hi> is the <hi>wrath of God.</hi> 4. Which yet is not the <hi>first cause.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:14039:11"/>
For, the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> would not rise, but that he is provoked by our sins (and the certaine sinnes, that provoke it, have beene set downe.) 5. And the <hi>cause</hi> of them, <hi>our owne inventions.</hi> So, our <hi>inventions beget sin; sin provokes the wrath of God: the wrath of God</hi> sends the plague among us. To stay the <hi>plague, Gods wrath</hi> must be <hi>stayed:</hi> To stay it, there must be a <hi>ceasing from sin:</hi> That <hi>sin</hi> may cease, we must be out of love with our owne <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and not go awhoring after them.</hi> Prayer, that asswageth anger: To <hi>executejustice,</hi> that aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth sin: to execute <hi>justice,</hi> either <hi>publikely,</hi> as doth the Magistrate; or privately, as every man doth, or may doe upon himselfe, which joyned with prayer, and prayer with it, will soone rid us of that we complaine; and otherwise, <hi>his anger will not be turned away, but his hand stretched out still.</hi>
