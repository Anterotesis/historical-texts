            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

1. For his Perſon. Several Learned men
have concluded that this holy man and St.
<hi>Bartholomew</hi> were one and the ſame Perſon,
it being uſual with the Jews to be call'd by
two Names, their own, and that of their
Fathers; So <hi>Peter</hi> is call'd <hi>Barjona, Joſeph,
Barſabas; Joſes, Barnabas;</hi> and <hi>Nathanael,
Bartholomew;</hi> that is, the Son of <hi>Tholmai:</hi>
And that which gives credit to this Opinion,
is firſt, That <hi>Nathanael</hi> is reckon'd up with
the other Apoſtles, to whom our Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
at the Sea of <hi>Tiberias</hi> after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
 <hi>There were together,</hi> ſays the Text,<note place="margin">John 21. ver. 2.</note>
Simon Peter, <hi>and</hi> Thomas <hi>and</hi> Nathanael <hi>of</hi>
Cana <hi>in</hi> Galilee, <hi>and the Sons of</hi> Zebedee, <hi>and
two other of his Diſciples.</hi> 'Tis alſo obſerv'd,
that, as our Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi> never ſets
down <hi>Bartholomew</hi> in the number of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
ſo the other three take as little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of <hi>Nathanael;</hi> and as in this Chapter,
<hi>Phillip</hi> and <hi>Nathanael</hi> are joyn'd together in
coming to Chriſt, ſo the reſt of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
have <hi>Phillip</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For his Country. And that we are
told plainly in the fore-quoted place, was
<hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee:</hi> What his Profeſſion was, is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98234:4"/>
not ſo certain;<note place="margin">Tract. 7. in Joan.</note> St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tells us that he
was a Civilian, a learned Doctor of the Law;
But, if we take him to be the ſame with
<hi>Bartholomew,</hi> that, which <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and ſome
other of the Fathers affirm, is the more
likely, <hi>viz.</hi> that not only he, but all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
in general, were Fiſhermen. God
making choice of ſuch mean Inſtruments to
propagate the Goſpel, that ſo his power in
carrying it on might be made the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
through their weakneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the manner of his Converſion.
We have that in the 45th Verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
he was firſt brought to Chriſt by <hi>Phillip,</hi>
who told him, <hi>That they had found him, of
whom</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Law and the Prophets did
write, Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>the Son of</hi> Joſeph.
And when he alledg'd <hi>that no good thing could
come out of</hi> Nazareth, and conſequently that
the Meſſiah could not be born there (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he was not, but at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but only
ſuppoſed to be of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> becauſe he was
educated there) <hi>Phillip</hi> bids him come and
ſee the Perſon, and ſatisfie himſelf: At his
firſt approach our Saviour welcomes him
with this high Encomium in the Text, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98234:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.
Nathanael</hi> wondring at the Salutation, asks
our Saviour, <hi>how he came to know him ſo well,</hi>
ſince he had had hitherto no acquaintance
with him; Our Saviour anſwer'd him, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that</hi> Phillip <hi>called thee, when thou waſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Fig-tree, I ſaw thee.</hi> Convinc't with
this inſtance of our Lords Divinity, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he makes this Confeſſion, <hi>Rabbi, thou
art the Son of God, thou art the King of</hi> Iſrael.
As if he had ſaid, I do now believe, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of <hi>Phillips</hi> ſaying, but becauſe I have
heard thee my ſelf, and know that thou art
indeed the promiſed Meſſiah, the Perſon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by God to be the King and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are now come to conſider the
Character here given him by our Saviour.
<hi>An Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile;</hi>
that is, he was a true honeſt hearted man; a
perſon of great ſimplicity and integrity; <hi>An
Iſraelite indeed,</hi> like <hi>Jaacob</hi> the Father of them,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 27.</note>
               <hi>a plain man.</hi>

But that I may give you the more lively

him with the greater advantage to your i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
I ſhall be a little more particular;
and, firſt, give you an account of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deportment towards God; and, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
of his Civil converſation with
men.</p>
            <p n="I">I. For his Religious Deportment towards
God; and ſo he is one,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who is Religious out of good Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
ſuch as theſe, that there is an eternal
God, infinitely good, wiſe land powerful,
who is in every place, ſees every thing, and
not only takes notice of our actions, but
knows our very hearts, and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thoughts and intentions of them. That
this God, as Governour of the World, and
Judge of men, concerns himſelf in all humane
affairs, diſpoſes of all events, requires punctual
obedience to his Laws, and will juſtly reward
every man according as their hearts and
practices bear a conformity to them. By
ſuch Principles as theſe, he is influenc'd on
all occaſions; here he begins and here he
ends all his actions; thus he conſiders and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98234:6"/>
propoſes to himſelf; Verily there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for the Righteous, therefore I'l be juſt
and righteous in all my Dealings; the Poor
in Spirit ſhall inherit Heaven, therefore I'l la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to ſubdue my Pride; I'l forgive the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
that are done to me, becauſe he that
forgives, ſhall be forgiven; I'l be merciful
to them in miſery, becauſe the merciful ſhall
obtain mercy; I'l love my Enemies, becauſe
this makes me like to God and fit for Heaven;
I'l bleſs them that curſe me, becauſe they
that bleſs ſhall at laſt be moſt certainly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whoſe Religion is inward, in the heart
and ſoul, and not only in the outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whoſe Religion conſiſts not meerly in
External Services, or Bodily Exerciſes, but in
an inward good complexion and virtuous
diſpoſition of Soul. This is that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
told his Diſciples, and in them us, <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 20.</note>
               <hi>Except
your Righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the Righteouſneſs
of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of the Scribes and Phariſees was an
External Righteouſneſs, conſiſting of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rites, as Circumciſion and Sacrifices;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98234:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
depending upon External Priviledges, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Seed of <hi>Abram</hi> and Stock of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi>
pretending to an external Sanctity and
blameleſneſs of Converſation; Theſe were
the great Doctors of the Jewiſh Church, and
they Expounded the Law no farther; with
them no man was a Murderer, but he that
ſheath'd his Sword in his Brothers bowels;
no man, an Adulterer, but he that actually
lay with his Neighbours Wife; they thought
it no Injuſtice or Irreligion to return an Eye
for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate
and revenge in the higheſt degree; ſo
that, at the ſame time, their outward man
might keep the Law, whilſt their inward man
brake it. But the Religion of a true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
ſinks deeper, enters into his Soul, renews
his Nature, curbing every exorbitant deſire,
and ſuppreſſing every irregular motion and
affection of the Heart; hence, he is ſaid to
be<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 6. 15.</note> 
               <hi>a new Creature,</hi>

is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and
not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whoſe Religion is regular and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as well as pure; he never runs away with
Objections upon hear-ſay, nor beſpatters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
legal Conſtitutions before he examines
them; he ſcruples not the uſe of ſome things
that ſeem inconvenient to him, provided
they are not ſinful, (there being no Church
under Heaven free from all exceptions as to
matters of Diſcipline and Worſhip) and
quietly and prudently ſubmits to the lawful,
nay, doubtful appointments of men, rather
than the Bonds of Peace and Unity ſhould
be broken. He very well knows what a
mortal Enemy all Factions and Diviſions are
to Religion, how, like a Canker, they eat out
the Soul and Life of it, and therefore he ſets
himſelf with all his might and skill to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and ſuppreſs all religious Differences,
and like that brave Roman, is ready to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
himſelf to fill up the wide Gulph that
mens Contentions have made in the World.
All ſeparating Principles he abominates, and
thinks nothing too deare a price to be laid
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98234:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
down for Peace but Truth and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He never takes up a Religion to ſerve
a turn, to make it an Art to thrive by, or a
Footſtool to climb up to his affected Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
He hates nothing more than to ſee
men make Religion a Pander to Vice, and an
Engine to give credit to their unwarrantable
Undertakings; than to ſee them entitle God
to their Villanies, and father their Pride and
their Paſſion, their Enthuſiaſtick Freaks and
Deluſions upon his Holy Spirit; ſuch are
they, who perſonate the Saint that they may
with leſs ſuſpicion play the Devil; that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
Religion to bad purpoſes, and uſe it as
a paint to make ugly Deſigns look well-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd.
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 7.</note> Such an one was <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretence of Devotion, and paying
his Vows to God, deſign'd and plotted Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt his Prince and Father; ſuch an
one was <hi>Ahab,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 21. 9.</note> who proclaim'd a Faſt that
he might kill <hi>Naboth,</hi> and take poſſeſſion of
his Vineyard; ſuch were the Phariſees of
old,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 16.</note> what heavenly looks, what devout ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
what long prayers, what frequent
faſtings, had they more than other men?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98234:8"/>
you might have found them praying in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
corner of the Street, and ſome of them
did almoſt nothing elſe but pray; and yet
all this did theſe demure Hypocrites make
uſe of but as a Cloak to cover their Malice
and ill Nature, their Rapine and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As he does not take up Religion out of
any worldly ends and deſigns, ſo neither
does he lay it down upon ſuch. As he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes
the flatteries of the World, ſo hee's
not afraid of its frowns; <hi>he fears not them
that can kill the body,</hi> and chooſes rather to
looſe all, than to let go his Integrity. How
yielding and complying ſoever he may be in
all matters of an indifferent nature, yet in
a matter of plain Duty, when the honour
of God and the intereſt of Religion is at
ſtake, he is a man of the moſt ſteady and
unſhaken Principles, whom not all the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of his Adverſaries can make to flinch
or give way. How eaſily might <hi>Daniel,</hi> by
omitting his Devotions to the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
but thirty days,<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 7.</note> have outwitted his Enemies
Malice, and diſappointed the Law, that he
knew was contrived on purpoſe againſt him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98234:9"/>
               <hi>viz. That whoſoever ſhould ask a Petition of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
God or Man for thirty days, ſave of the King,
ſhould be caſt into the Den of Lions;</hi> yet, what
does he? he was neither afraid of theirs, nor
the Lions rage, but although <note place="margin">Dan. 6. 10.</note>
               <hi>he knew the
Writing was ſign'd, went into his Houſe, open'd
his windows, and pray'd three times a day to his
God as afore time.</hi> What a little meaſure of
cunning and policy would many times have
ſerv'd to have brought off the primitive
Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. 8. c. 3.</note> when they were apprehended
and arraigned at the barr of their bloody
Perſecutors? when with money they might
either have been excus'd from ſacrificing,
or ſuborn'd Witneſſes that they had done it,
though they did it not; when by making
Friends, or complying in any the leaſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
with their Idolatrous Worſhip, they
might have eſcap'd; they choſe rather to
dye, than to be guilty in any degree of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
their holy Religion. The time
would fail me, ſhould I ſpeak of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bended
Conſtancy (or as the Heathens ſtil'd
it,) obſtinacy of <hi>Ignatius, Policarp, Juſtine,</hi>
and thoſe innumerable Armies of holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
who, with one word <hi>(Chriſtiani ſumus)</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98234:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tired out the Cruelties, and vanquiſht the
Tyrannies of their proudeſt Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>Having thus given you an Account of the
true Iſraelite's religious Deportment towards
God; I proceed</p>
            <p n="II">II. To repreſent to you his Civil conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with men. As he throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
his Relations, Duties and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in reſpect of men, ſo hee's careful to
diſcharge them with no leſs uprightneſs and
integrity. But here, that I may not be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
I muſt croud up many Particulars in a
little room; He is one,</p>
            <p>Who is immoveably Loyal to his Prince,
and thinks himſelf bound to be ſo by the
ſame Principles, as he is, to be Religious,
namely, of Conſcience and the higheſt fear.
<hi>Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 2, 5.</note> 
               <hi>not only for
wrath, but for conſcience ſake: They that reſiſt,
receive to themſelves damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who is ſincere in his words, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſpeaks, takes care that his words tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expreſs the thoughts and intentions of his
mind. And though ſometimes, for good
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98234:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reaſons he may conceal his mind, and not at
every turn ſhoot his Bolt, and ſatisfie every
impertinent Enquirer, yet he never denies or
minces the Truth when he ought, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to declare it. His mind and his tongue
ever go together, and without the help of an
equivocation or mental reſervation, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found at a perfect agreement with one
another. This is that ſimplicity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
our Saviour requires,when he
ſays, <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Let your Communication be Yea, yea; Nay,
nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who is faithful in his Promiſes, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fails to make them good, although it be
to his own prejudice; as he is careful not to
run himſelf into Inconveniences by haſty
Promiſes, ſo he is as ſollicitous to crown
them with honeſt performance; chooſing
rather to keep his word with loſs, than to
break it for his advantage. Remembring
that Gods Promiſes are Yea and Amen; hee's
never at eaſe till his are ſo too, and it can be
nothing but an utter diſability in him, if at
any time he proves worſe than his word.
This the Pſalmiſt makes one chief ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
in the true Iſraelite,<note place="margin">Pſalm 15. 4.</note> 
               <hi>He that ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

to his own hurt, and changeth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who is upright in his Dealings; whom
no temptations of profit, nor freedon from
the fears of diſcovery can entice, either by
fraud or violence, to do the leaſt wrong or
injury to his Neighbour; He takes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of no mans ignorance or unskilfulneſs to
outwit or over-reach him; of no mans over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
or miſtake, to turn it to his own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;
of no mans eaſineſs or confidence in
him, to beguile or betray him: The more
likely he is to be believ'd, the more careful
he is what he ſpeaks; the leſs liable to be
ſuſpected, the cloſer he keeps to the Rules
of Honeſty: So exact is he in his Trading,
and ſo afraid of the unclean portion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
that he ſtudiouſly declines all thoſe
ways of gaining that have but a bad name,
and are only ſuſpected to be evil, chooſing
rather to be poor,<note place="margin">Jer. 17. 11.</note> 
               <hi>than to get riches, and not
by right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who is above all flattery and diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he never fawns upon any mans perſon
to gain his favour, nor complies with any
mans humour by ſpeaking or acting againſt
the ſenſe of his mind; and although he be

a man of great Candour and Ingenuity, of
great ſweetneſs and obligingneſs in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and Converſation, yet he never

cares not much what offence his Diſcourſe
gives,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 29.</note> ſo it be uſeful and according to
Truth.</p>
            <p>Who perfectly hates all Slander and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny;
who is ſo far from inventing evil

and when an evil Report is brought

of love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To name no more: Who is true to his
truſt, and if by the Providence of God he
comes to be rais'd to the Office of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
he conſiders more the duty of his
place than the honour and dignity of it;
and laying aſide all by-ends of popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
and worldly advantages, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
the ſmiles or the frowns of men,
their diſlikes or their approbations, ſets
himſelf to do that, which in his Conſcience
he thinketh to be juſt and fit, moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
to the Glory of God and the publick
Good.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewn you what it is to be an
Iſraelite indeed, I come now to ſet before
you thoſe Conſiderations that may engage
you to be ſo. To this purpoſe</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98234:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1. This is the beſt and moſt honourable
Character that can be given of a man.
Therefore it is that our Saviour calls us to
<hi>behold</hi> Nathanael, as a rare and excellent
Perſon. <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed.</hi> After
the ſame manner does God ſpeak of <hi>Job,</hi>
he brings him in, (if the expreſſion may
be pardon'd) as it were in a boaſting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<note place="margin">Job 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Haſt thou conſider'd my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>that
there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect
and an upright man, one that feareth God, and
eſcheweth evil?</hi> This is the Character of a
man that's bleſſed, and to whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
no ſin:<note place="margin">Pſalm 32. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the
Lord imputeth no ſin, and in whoſe ſpirit there
is no guile.</hi> The Character of a man that's
fit to approach the Glory and Preſence of
God; <hi>Lord, who ſhall dwell in thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle?
who ſhall reſt upon thy holy Hill? he
that walketh uprightly and worketh righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſpeaketh the Truth in his heart.</hi> This
is the Character, that's given of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 22.</note> 
               <hi>who did no ſin, neither was guile found
in his mouth.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98234:12"/>
2. The upright man is moſt likely to
find ſafety and protection in this World.
He deſigning only that which is fair and
reaſonable, he giving no juſt occaſion of
offence or provocation to any, is not
likely to meet with many Adverſaries,
at leaſt not with many ſuch as will
prove very miſchievous and mortal to him.
No Wiſe man will trouble him, all good
men will love him, and ſo prudently does
he mannage himſelf and his Affairs, that
thoſe that love him not, cannot eaſily find
an occaſion to do him much hurt; <hi>Who is
he that will harm you,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>if
ye be followers of that which is good?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 13.</note> To this
we may add, that his integrity entitles him
to the promiſe of God, and the care of
his particular Providence. Righteouſneſs
being the Glory of Gods own Nature, and
that for which he infinitely loves and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems
himſelf, cannot, whereſoever it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
but engage God for its protection:
There is a near reſemblance, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
a kind of friendſhip between God
and all good men, ſo that it is not in his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98234:13"/>
power not to be good to the good.<note place="margin">Pſalm 11. 7.</note> 
               <hi>The
righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
beholds the upright. God is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of all men in general,</hi> ſays <hi>Salvian,
but eſpecially of thoſe that deſerve to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned;</hi>
that is, that deſerve better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men. Great was that ſaying of <hi>Hermoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
in <hi>Plutarch, The Gods that know all things,
and can do all things, are ſo much my Friends, and
ſo highly concern'd for my welfare, that I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
night nor day out of their watchful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
whatever I do I have their aſſiſtance; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I deſign I have their direction; wherever I go
I am under their wing and protection.</hi> Now
the protection God affords good men is
uſually by the Miniſtry of holy Angels.
The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> tell us, That as men change
their Natures, and grow either better or
worſe, they have the higher or lower
<hi>Genij</hi> or Angels to attend upon them. And
ſo much is ſaid of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s <hi>Genius,</hi> that it
hath fill'd the Antients with matter of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and Writing too: This is certain,
that all good men are the particular charge
of holy Angels; for them do thoſe morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stars riſe and ſet; for them do thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98234:13"/>
winged Meſſengers of Heaven go forth
and return.<note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 7.</note> 
               <hi>The Angel of the Lord pitcheth
his Tents about thoſe that fear him, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Are they not all Miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

be heirs of Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Upright man is moſt certain to
find comfort and ſupport in the midſt of
all thoſe Troubles and Calamities that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
him in this World. Integrity indeed
is the beſt Security that can be againſt them;
but ſo bad is the World, that ſometimes an
Upright man ſuffers in it, and that too, for
his uprightneſs; but then his uprightneſs
fills him with joy and peace unſpeakable in
the midſt of them.<note place="margin">Pſalm 119. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

nothing ſhall offend them:</hi> Not, but that
the Winds may blow as fiercely, and the
Storm fall as heavily upon them as upon
others; but then, they have that within,
which others want, a good Conſcience
and a ſenſe of the Divine Favour, to bear
them up from fainting under them. A
ſtrong high wind may ſhake his Branches,
and cauſe his Leaves to fall, may ſtrip him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98234:14"/>
of all his outward Beauty and Glory, but
it can never pull him up by the Roots, and
make him fall. A violent Storm and a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

to fly to, when he is beaten out of

for all the Threatnings of his Adverſaries,
who knows that his heavenly Father holds
their Malice in a Chain, and how fiercely
ſoever they may bark, will not ſuffer them
to bite him, but when it is for his good,

            <p n="4">4. The Upright man is in the direct way
to Eternal Happineſs: At that great and laſt

practices of unjuſt and malitious Guile be
expos'd to ſhame; when no man ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

What I have here ſaid of the Upright
man in general; 'tis moſt eaſie to Apply.
I believe it hath been done all this while
by them that knew the Vertuous and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Mind that lately inhabited this Body.
They know the truth of all I ſhall ſay, and
much more that might be juſtly ſaid in his
Praiſe and Commendation.</p>
            <p>To paſs over the Quality of his Birth and
Extraction, although he had the Bleſſing
to be deſcended from a Worthy and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Family, whoſe Zeal for God and his
Church, as well as the Advantages of Birth
and Eſtate made them eminent in their
Country.</p>
            <p>Not to mention likewiſe the Natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of his Mind, though they were
much above the rate of ordinary mens; in
whom was found ſo happy a Conjunction
of a tenacious Memory and ſtrong Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of a ſharp Wit and piercing Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that it made him excellent in his
Profeſſion, admirably accompliſht for a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98234:15"/>
diſcreet diſpatch of Buſineſs, and a moſt
uſeful Member to the Publick in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Not to inſiſt on theſe, I chooſe to ſpeak
of his Moral qualifications, and theſe the
rather, as being in the Judgment of Chriſt
himſelf, moſt deſerving our notice and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:
Here then alſo you may <hi>behold
an Iſraelite indeed, in whom there</hi> was <hi>no
guile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not tell you, that His Profeſſion
was that of the Reform'd Religion, as the
Doctrine and Diſcipline of it is eſtabliſht
by Law in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if a conſtant and devout attendance
on the Worſhip and Service of God, a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
Zeal for his Church, an unceſſant
Care for it's Proſperity, an univerſal love
and concern for all that own'd it, be any
convincing Arguments of a man's Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in his Religion, never was there any
Perſon who gave a clearer teſtimony of it,
than he did. Such was his love to all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98234:16"/>
Solemnities of Worſhip, that he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
fai'd (unleſs prevented by Sickneſs
or moſt indiſpenſable Occaſions) to be
preſent at them; and ſo humble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
was his Carriage and Demeanour in
them, that 'twas hard for any perſon to
obſerve it, and not to be warm'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by his Flames. So ſteady and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Member was he to this Church, that
he could not ſpeak of its Dangers without
ſome diſturbance to himſelf, nor mention
its Diviſions without tears; How unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
was he in his Endeavours to promote
its Intereſt, to win upon its Enemies, and
to encourage its Friends? Amongſt others,
the Clergy and Miniſters of it had not the
leaſt ſhare in his eſteem and affection; he
never ſeem'd more chearful than when he
was in their Company; never better pleas'd
than when they were at his Table: To all
men he was very Courteous and Obliging;
but 'twas here that he ſhew'd his reſpects
with delight and complacency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98234:16"/>
Anſwerable to this his Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, was his Converſation with
Men. It would be too tedious to name
all Particulars; therefore not to mention
the Vertues that are more common, thoſe
that ſhone brighteſt in him, were ſuch as
in this looſe and diſtracted Age, are not
to be found in many, I mean, his Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to his Prince, and his Charity to all that
ſtood in need of it.</p>
            <p>His was true primitive Loyalty, without
any Roman Shifts or Jeſuitical Evaſions
or Fanatical Diſtinctions, holding himſelf
oblig'd in all Caſes that are not ſinful,
actively and chearfully to obey, but in
no caſe and for no reaſon whatſoever, to
reſiſt, Authority. He was the man, that
inſtead of finding fault with Governours,
ſought God for them; inſtead of ſcanning
and cenſuring Acts of State, earneſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored
Gods direction of them; inſtead of
venting complaints about the ſtate of things,
daily petition'd God for the Setlement of
of them in good order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98234:17"/>
And of the ſame genuin ſtamp was his
Benevolence and Charity to his Fellow-Subjects,
which he on all occaſions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,
by compoſing their Differences
and relieving their Neceſſities. Theſe were
more than any thing his daily buſineſs,
his Meat and Drink, his Pleaſure and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation:
In his younger years, when he
practis'd, what pains would he take to looſe
a Client, and to prevent a Law Suit? How
ready was he at all times to take up
Quarrels, and how unwearied, till he had
put an end to them, never medling with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens buſineſs, but only when 'twas to
oblige them, or to make them Friends?</p>
            <p>To this bleſſed work of making Peace,
did he add that other of ſhewing Mercy.
His Charity was very large and diffuſive, not
confin'd to his Kindred and Relations, but
flowing in ſeveral Channels, to all that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, to more than ask't it, moſt of all to
the Widows and Orphans of ſuch, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Churchmen, whoſe narrow Fortunes, or
untimely deaths, whoſe Fidelity to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98234:17"/>
Crown, or Sufferings for the Church, had
diſabled them to make any better proviſion
for them; a conſiderable number whereof,
as I am credibly inform'd, had the greateſt
part of their Livelyhood, if not their total
Subſiſtence from him. And as he liv'd
daily doing good, ſo was he not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to leave ſufficient Evidences of his kind
and charitable Diſpoſition at his Death,
having bequeath'd, almoſt to all the places
where he had ſpent any conſiderable part
of his Life, ſeveral large Legacies either for
the Poor's Relief, or other pious and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Uſes. In ſum, ſuch was his uniforme
and comely Demeanour, ſuch his comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and inoffenſive Converſation, ſuch his
fair and punctual Dealing, ſuch his univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally-loving
and benign temper of Mind,
that they deſervedly begat in all that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
him, a very great eſteem and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for him, inſomuch, that its not eaſie
to name the Perſon, that had more Friends
or fewer Enemies.</p>
            <p>I have but one thing more to add, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98234:18"/>
yet gives a farther luſtre to this excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and that is, the admirable Patience and
great conſtancy of Mind, wherewith he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
his Diſeaſe, encountred Death, and
triumpht over it. For any man to bear miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, has been ever accounted ſo great an
honour, that ſome of the Ancient Heathens
have too extravagantly thought, it equal'd
men to God himſelf, who is not capable of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery;
<hi>That</hi> (ſays one of them) <hi>is truly Divine, to
have the frailties of a man, the ſecurity of a God.</hi>
Now in all the time of his long and painful
Sickneſs; who ever ſaw him diſcompoſed?
who ever heard an impatient or diſcontented
word from him? It was my happineſs to be
frequently with him, (I call it ſo, there being
very much to be learn'd from his example)
at all times I ſaw great cauſe to admire his
Faith towards God, his Zeal for his Church,
his conſtancy of Mind, his contempt of the
World, his willingneſs to dye, and his chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hopes of Eternity. And in this ſerene
and undiſturb'd temper of Soul, full of Faith
and Hope, he fell aſleep, and exchang'd this
Life for a better. Now farewel pious and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98234:18"/>
vertuous Soul, the Poor's Relief, the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's
Patron, the Church's Friend, the King's
Loyal Subject, and Gods moſt faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
May thy Name and Memory ever
live in our breaſts! And may thy Vertues and
Example be ever fruitful in our Lives! That
ſo at the great and laſt day we may meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
again in unſpeakable Joy, where Sin
and Sorrow and Death ſhall be no more.
Which God of his infinite Mercy grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
