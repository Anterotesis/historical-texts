            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as I am come to this place, to make use of my
Papers, I dare not trust my self otherwise.</p>
            <p>Good people,</p>
            <p>This is a very uncomfortable place to preach in, and yet I shall
begin with a Text of Scripture, in the twelfth of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <q>Let us runne with patience that race that is set before us, looking unto
Iesus the Author and finisher of our fait<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have been long in my race, and how I have looked unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
the Author and finisher of my faith, is best knowne to him:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110234:3"/>
I am now come to the end of my race and here I finde the
Crosse, a death of shame, but the shame must be despised, or there
is no comming to the right hand of God; Jesus despis'd the shame
for me, and God-forebid but I should despise the shame, for him;
I am going apace, as you see towards the Red-sea, and my feet
are upon the very brinks of it, an Argument, I hope that God is
bringing me to the Land of promise, for that was the way by
which of old he led his people: But before they came to the
Sea, he instituted a passover for them, a Lamb it was to bee
eaten with very sowre Herbs, as in the twelfe of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall obey, and labour to digest the sowre Herbs, as well as
the Lamb, and I shall remember that it is the Lords Passeover;
I shall not think of the Herbs, nor be angry with the hands which
gathered them, but look up onely to him who instituted the
one, and governeth the other: For men can have no more
power over me, then that which is given them from above; I am
not in love with this passage through the Red-sea, for I have the
weaknesse and infirmity of flesh and blood in mee, and I have
prayed as my Saviour taught me, and exampled me <hi>Vt tansiret ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix ista.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Cup of red Wine might passe away from me, but
since it is not that my will may, his will be done; and I shall most
willingly drink of this Cup as deep as he pleases, and enter into
this Sea, I and passe through it, in the way that he shall bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to leade me.</p>
            <p>And yet (Good people,) it would be remembred, That when
the servants of God, old <hi>Israel,</hi> were in this boistrous Sea, and
<hi>Aaron</hi> with them, the Egyptians which persecuted them, and did
in a manner drive them into that Sea, were drowned in the same
waters, while they were in pursuit of them: I know my God whom
I serve, is as able to deliver me from this Sea of blood as hee was
to deliver the three Children from the fornace <hi>Daniel 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I must humbly thank my Saviour for it, my Resolution is
now, as theirs was then: their Resolution was, They would not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110234:3"/>
worship the Image which the King had set up: nor shall I the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
which the people are setting up, nor will I forsake the
Temple, and the truth of GOD, to follow the Bleating of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi>
Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and in <hi>Bethel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I pray God blesse all this people, and open their eyes, that
they may see the right way: For if it fall out that the blinde lead
the blinde, doubtlesse they will both into the ditch: For my self,
I am,) and I acknowledge it in all humility) a most grievous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
many wayes, by thought, word and deed, and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doubt but that God hath mercie in store for mee a poore
penitent, as well as for other sinners: I have upon this sad occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ransack'd every corner of my heart, and yet I thank God, I
have not found any of my sinnes that are there, any sins now deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
death by any known law of this Kingdome: and yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I charge nothing upon my Judges (I humbly beseech you I
may be rightly understood, I charge nothing in the least degree
upon my Judges) for they are to proceed by proof, by valuable
Witnesses, and in that way I or any innocent in the world may
justly be condemned: And I thank God, though the weight of
the Sentence Iye verie heavie upon me, yet I am as quiet within,
as (I thank Christ for it) I ever was in my life: And though I
am not onely the first Archbishop, but the first man that dyed in
this way, yet some of my predecessors have gone this way, though
not by this meanes: For <hi>Elfegus</hi> was hurried away and lost his head
by the Dans; and <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> in the fury of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and his
fellowes: And long before these Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had his head
danced of by a lewd woman, and Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> Arch-bishop of
Carthage submitting his head to a persecuting sword. Many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
great and good, and they teach me patience, for I hope
my cause in Heaven will looke of another dye then the colours,
that is put upon it here upon earth, and some comfort it is to me,
not onely that I goe the way of these great men in their severall
generations, but also that my charge (if I may not be partiall)
looks somewhat like that against S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 25. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110234:4"/>
he was accused for the Law and the Temple, that is the Law and
Religion: and like that of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> in the sixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> for
breaking the Ordinances which <hi>Moses</hi> gave us, which Ordinances
were Law and Religion; but you'l say, do I then compare my self
with the integritie of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Stephen:</hi> no, God
forbid, farre be it from mee: I onely raise a comfort to my selfe
that these great Saints and servants of God were thus laid up in
their severall times: And it is very memorable that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
who was one of them, and a great one, that helped on the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> fell afterwards into the selfe same
accusation himselfe, yet both of them great Saints and servants
of God, I but perhaps a great clamour there is, that I would have
brought in Poperie, I shall answer that more fully by and by,
in the meane time, you know what the Pharisees said against
Christ himselfe in the eleventh of <hi>Iohn, If yee let him alone, all
men will believe on him</hi> Et veninnt Romani, <hi>and the Romanes will
come and take away both our place and our Nation.</hi> Here was a cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
cry against Christ that the Romanes would come, and
see how just the Judgement of God was, they crucified Chriss for
feare least the Romanes should come, and his death was that that
brought in the Romanes upon them, God punishing them with
that which they most feared: and I pray God this clamour of
<hi>veniunt Romani</hi> (of which I have given to my knowledge no just
cause) helpe not to bring him in: for the Pope never had such a
Harvest in England since the Reformation, as he hath now upon
the Sects and divisions that are amongst us: in the meane time, <hi>by
honour and dishonour, by good report and evill report, as a deceiver, and
yet true,</hi> am I now passing out of this world.</p>
            <p>Some particulars also I thinke not amisse to speak of, and first this
I shall be bold to speake of the King, our gracious Soveraigne,
He hath been much traduced by some for labouring to bring in
Poperie, but upon my conscience (of which I am now going to
give God a present account) I know him to bee as free from this
Charge I thinke as any man living, and I hold him to be as sound
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110234:4"/>
a Protestant, according to the Religion by Law established as any
man in this Kingdome, and that he will venter his Life as farre
and as freely for it: and I thinke I doe or should know both his
affections to Religion, and His grounds upon which that affection
is built, as fully as any man in England</p>
            <p>The second particular is concerning this great and populous
City, which God blesse: here hath been of late a fashion to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bands, and then go to the Honourable and great Court of the
Kingdome, the Parliament, &amp; clamour for Justice, as if that great &amp;
wise Court, (before whom the causes come which are unknown to
many:) could not or would not do Justice, but at their call and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment:
a way which may endanger many innocent man, and
pluck innocent bloud upon their own heads, and perhaps upon this
Citie also, which God forbid: and this hath been lately practiz'd
against my self, God forgive the setters of this, with all my heart
I beg it, but many well meaning people are caught by it: In S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi>
case, when nothing else would serve, they stirred up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
against him, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. and <hi>Herod</hi> went just the selfe same way,
for when he had killed Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> hee would not venture upon
S. <hi>Peter</hi> too, till he saw how the people took it, and were pleased
with it, in the 12 of the <hi>Acts.</hi> But take heed of having your hands
full of bloud, in the first of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> for there is a time best known
to himselfe, when God amongst other sinnes makes inquisition
for bloud: and when inquisition is on foot, Psalmest tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi>
9. that God remembers, that is not all, <hi>that God remembers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
not</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>the complaint of the poore,</hi> and hee
tells you what poore they are in the ninth verse, the poore whose
bloud is shed by such kind of means: Take heed of this, <hi>It is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing</hi> (at any time) <hi>to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> in
the 12. of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> but it is fearfull indeed, and then especially,
when he is making his Inquisition for bloud, and therefore with
prayer to advert the prophesie from the Citie, let me desire that this
my cup would remember the Prophesie that is expressed, <hi>Ier. 26. 15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third particular, is this poore Church of England, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110234:5"/>
hath flourished and been a shelter to other neighbouring Churches,
when stormes have driven on them, but, alas, now it is in a storme
it self, and God knows whether, or how it shall get out; and which
is worse then a storme from without, it is become like an Oake cleft
to shivers with wedges made out of its owne body, and that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cleft prophanesse and irreligion is creeping in apace: while as
<hi>Prosper</hi> saith, Men that introduce, prophanesse are cloacked with a
name of imaginarie religion: for wee have in a manner almost lost
the substance, and dwell much, nay too much a great deale in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
and that Church which all the Jesuites machinations in these
parts of Christendome could not ruine, is now fallen into a great
deal of danger by her owne.</p>
            <p>The last particular (for I am not willing to be tedious, I shall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
to go out of this miserable world) is my self, and I beseech you;
as many as are within hearing, observe me: I was borne and baptized
in the bosome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it stands yet established
by Law, in that profession I have ever since lived, and in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the Protestant Religion here established I come now to
die: this is no time to dissemble with God, least of all in matter of
Religion; and therefore I desire it may be remembred: I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
lived in the Protestant Religion established in <hi>England,</hi> and in
that I come now to die: what Clamors and Slanders I have endured
labouring to keep an Vniformity in the external service of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Doctrine and Discipline of this Church, all men
knows, &amp; I have abundantly felt: Now at last I am accused of high
Treason in Parliament, a crime which my soul ever abhorred: This
Treason was charged upon me to consist of two parts: An endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to subvert the Law of the Realme, and a like to overthrow the
true Protestant Religion established by those Lawes, Besides
my answers which I gave to the severall Charges, I protested my
innocency in both Houses: It was said, Prisoners Protestations at
the Barre must not be taken <hi>de ipso:</hi> I can bring no witnesse of
my heart, and the intentions thereof, therefore I must come to my
Protestation, not at the Barre, but to my Protestation at this houre
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110234:5"/>
and instant of death, in which (as I said before) I hope all men
will be such charitable Christians as not to thinke I would die, and
dissemble my Religion, I doe therefore here, with that caution
that I delivered before, without all prejudice in the world to my
Judges, that are to proceed <hi>secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> and so to
be understood, I die in the presence of Almighty God, and all his
holy and blessed Angels; and I take it now on my death, that I
never endeavoured the subversion of the Laws of the Realme, nor
never any change of the Protestant Religion into Popish supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and I desire you all to remember this Protest of mine, for my
innocency in these, and from all manner of Treasons whatsomever.</p>
            <p>I have been accused likewise as an enemie to Parliaments, no,
God forbid, I understood them, and the benefits that comes by
them, a great deal too well to bee so; but I did indeed dislike
some misgovernments (as I conceived) of some few one or two
Parliaments: And I did conceive humbly that I might have reason
for it; for <hi>corruptio optimi est pessima:</hi> There is no corruption in the
world so bad, as that which is in the best thing it self, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the thing is in nature, the worse it is corrupted: And this being
the highest and greatest Court, over which none other can have
the jurisdiction in the Kingdome, if any way a mis-government
(which God forbid) should any wayes fall upon it, the subjects of
this Kingdome are left without all manner of remedy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God preserve them, blesse them, and direct them, that there
may be no misconceit, much lesse misgovernment amongst them.
I will not inlarge my self any further, I have done, I forgive all the
world, all and every of those bitter enemies, or others whatsoever
they have been, which any wise prosecuted me in this kinde, and I
humbly desire to be forgiven first of God, and then of every man,
whether I have offended him or no, if hee doe but conceive that I
have, Lord do thou forgive me, and I beg forgivenesse of him, and
so I heartily desire you to joyne with me in prayer.</p>

me, but not till thou hast nailed my sinnes to the Crosse of Christ: looke
upon me, but not till thou hast bathed me in the bloud of Christ: look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, but not till I have hid my selfe in the wounds of Christ, that so
the punishment that is due to my sinnes may passe away and go over mee:
And since thou art pleased to try me to the uttermost, I humblie beseech

and when thou hast given me strength to beare it, then doe with mee as
seemes best in thine owne eyes: And carrie mee through death, that I
may looke upon it in what visage soever it shall appeare to mee, and that
there may bee a stoppe of this issue of bloud in this more than miserable
Kingdome. I shall desire that I may pray for the people too, as well as
for my selfe: O Lord, I beseech thee give grace of repentance unto all
people, that have a thirst for bloud, but if they will not repent, then
scatter their devices so, and such as are, or shall be contrarie to the
glorie of thy great Name, the Truth and Sinceritie of Religion, the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of the King, and his posteritie after him, in their just Rights,

ancient and just power, the preservation of this poore Church in

and distressed people under their ancient laws, and in their native Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and when thou hast done all this, in meere mercie for them, O
Lord, fill their hearts with thankfullnesse, and with religious dutifull
obedience to thee and thy Commandements all their dayes: So Amen,
Lord Iesus, And I beseech thee, receive my Soule to mercie. Our Father
which art in Heaven. Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdome come.
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our dayly
