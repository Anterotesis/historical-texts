            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Let Woman rule thee with her sparkling Eyes;</l>
               <l>Base Wretch, that for th' Effects of Lust will sell</l>
               <l>Thy birth-right, thy power; thy Heaven for Hell!</l>
               <l>My Soul's too great, and can no bondage bear;</l>
               <l>My Will's too free, and cannot fetters wear.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Woman!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Since Heaven's Sacred Laws, cannot restrain</l>
               <l>Thy Will, and threaten'd Vengeance is in vain;</l>
               <l>Since to live peaceful is thy greatest pain,</l>
               <l>Proceed, and thou shalt Queen of Devils reign.</l>

               <head>A Satyr on Woman's Lust.</head>
               <l>HOt Lust within her reigns in every part;</l>
               <l>The foulest Sins possess her filthy heart:</l>
               <l>Incest, and the many Sins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> are</l>
               <l>Dull satisfaction to the lustful Fair:</l>
               <l>T'attain her ends she Mountains would remove;</l>
               <l>And knows no bliss but in lascivious love.</l>
               <l>She'll travel all the foulest Roads of Hell,</l>
               <l>Commit such Vice as ne're knew parallel:</l>
               <l>Till she enjoyes, no rest shall close her eyes;</l>
               <l>Enjoyment is her only Paradise.</l>
               <l>Missing her man, some ugly mungril must</l>
               <l>Give satisfaction, to her raging lust:</l>
               <l>Her appetite's so strong, that to fulfill</l>
               <l>Her damn'd desires, she'll try Infernals skill:</l>
               <l>No monstrous object can deter her mind;</l>
               <l>She'l use a Dog or Devil for Mankind.</l>
               <l>But if in all her Lust prevention find,</l>
               <l>'Twill gnaw, and eat her own distracted mind;</l>
               <l>Burst into Envy, and ten thousand more</l>
               <l>Such monstrous Sins, as Hell n'ere knew before:</l>
               <l>Hell! Hell's no abyss if compar'd to this,</l>
               <l>'Tis Woman's Lust is only bottomless.</l>
               <l>Her Lust deny'd! she'll rend the Earth and Skies,</l>
               <l>And thunder forth most horrid blasphemies;</l>
               <l>She'll roar, and cry, and scratch, she'll howl and tear,</l>
               <l>Like Devils who the greatest torments wear.</l>
               <l>Thus burning Lust doth set her Soul on fire,</l>
               <l>Which will for ever flame with hot desire:</l>
               <l>Life will with Lust together both expire,</l>
               <l>And will accompany her Soul to Hell,</l>
               <l>And there with lustful <hi>Demons</hi> ever dwell;</l>
               <l>Then her enjoyments will eternal prove,</l>
               <l>Where <hi>Pluto</hi> takes her for his hellish Love.</l>

               <head>In Praise of a Deformed, but Virtuous Lady; OR, A Satyr on Beauty.</head>
               <l>FIne Shape, good Features, and a handsom Face;</l>
               <l>Such do the glory of the Mind deface;</l>
               <l>But Virtue is the best and only grace.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> Man's mind enslames with lustful fires,</l>
               <l>Consumes his Reason and burns his best Desires.</l>
               <l>Wer't thou my Soul but from my body free,</l>
               <l>Had flesh and blood no influence on thee,</l>
               <l>Then would'st thou love a Woman, and would'st choose</l>
               <l>The Soul, fair she, to be thy blessed Spouse.</l>
               <l>Beauty's corrupt, and like a Flower stands</l>
               <l>To be collected by impure hands.</l>
               <l>'Tis hard as 'tis impossible to find,</l>
               <l>Virtue and <hi>Venus</hi> both together joyn'd.</l>
               <l>For the Fair She, who knows the force and strength</l>
               <l>Of Beauty's charms, grows proud; and then at length</l>
               <l>Lust and ambition will possess her breast,</l>
               <l>Which always will disturb man's peaceful rest.</l>
               <l>She will adore her self, and disesteem</l>
               <l>All others that in truth more comely seem:</l>
               <l>She thinks besides she is ador'd by all,</l>
               <l>And that Mankind must at her footstool fall;</l>
               <l>And thus is <hi>Beauty</hi> prejudicial.</l>
               <l>Beware my Soul, lest she ensnare thy Sence,</l>
               <l>Against her Wiles let Virtue be thy fence.</l>
               <l>Some please their fancies with a Picture well,</l>
               <l>And for meer toys do real Pleasures sell.</l>
               <l>Some shadows love, beyond substantial things:</l>
               <l>Such faults are sometimes seen in Sacred Kings.</l>
               <l>Fancy's a microscope which cheats the Eye,</l>
               <l>Who looks through that, their Judgments falsify.</l>
               <l>No bliss fond <hi>Cupid</hi> thinks, but what is in</l>
               <l>The smoothing, of his Ladie's tender skin;</l>
               <l>Her snowy breasts, her sparkling sable eyes,</l>
               <l>Her charming looks, her blooming cheeks surprise;</l>
               <l>Her ebony brows, her bright forehead high,</l>
               <l>Her soft belly, and her ivory thigh,</l>
               <l>In these his best and chiefest Pleasures lye.</l>
               <l>What other parts she can for pleasures show,</l>
               <l>You can produce as well as she, I know.</l>

               <l>Fearful to see the bristles on her chin,</l>

               <l>My Mistriss is more lovely, and more fair,</l>
               <l>Graces divine in her more brighter are;</l>
               <l>She is the source of bliss, whil'st Virtue reigns</l>
               <l>In her, all things impure her Soul disdains.</l>

               <l>Of Lust, or once its horrid venom drink:</l>
               <l>You are an Object that will soon dispell</l>
