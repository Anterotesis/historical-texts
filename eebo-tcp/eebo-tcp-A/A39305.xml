            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>fly to Commemorate the gracious Dealings of the Lord with his People;</hi> and, as in a general way, to remind you of the many Attempts the Enemy hath made, by Force and Fraud, to hinder the Work of God from going on: So more particularly, to <hi>Warn you to beware of that Spirit of Contention and Division, which hath appeared of late in</hi> George Keith, <hi>and some few others that join with him, who have made a Breach and Separation from Friends, in some parts of</hi> America. In writing that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, I did not consult Flesh and Blood, neither had I an Eye to my own ease and quiet, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, (for I had no reason to expect rest from so restless a Man, nor fair Treatment from one, who in his late Writings and personal Debates,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109396:3"/>
hath so notoriously let loose his Pen and Tongue, to an <hi>unbridled liberty</hi> of Railing and Reviling.) But I cleared my Conscience, in discharging my Duty to God, and to his Church, and therein have that Peace, which all his Abuses cannot disturb.</p>
            <p>After that Epistle of mine had been sometime abroad, <hi>G. K.</hi> published a Sheet of Paper, which he called, <hi>A loving Epistle to all the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, judicious and impartial among the People called Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. In that Sheet he charged me with Fifty Perversions, Forgeries, and false Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, which he said he had noted in my Book; but left his Proofs behind, to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in another Book, which he then threatned should be published, if my Book was not called in and disowned. Some Weeks after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of that Sheet, he hath now sent forth his threatned Book, pretended to be an Answer to that Epistle of mine, and containing his Proofs, (such as they are) of the Charge he had made publick so long before. As soon as I had notice of the coming forth of his last (which he calls, <hi>A Seasonable Information,</hi> &amp;c.) I gave direction for the stopping what I had before written and sent to <hi>London</hi> (in Answer to his other Sheet) chusing rather to make but one work of it, than to multiply Books, as he does; who (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his alledging, that the Scripture says, <hi>Of making many Books there is no end)</hi> seems to have an <hi>Itch</hi> to writing, and a <hi>Pride</hi> in Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>He begins his Epistle with a double or two fold Boast. One of his <hi>Labours</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109396:4"/>
the Truth; to which perhaps I may say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hereafter. The other, of the <hi>considerable Number</hi> of those that (he says) he has <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> are in true Unity with him. To which, at present, I shall only say, If that were true, the more were the pity. But as I am far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it to be true: So I wish (for his own sake, as well as others) he may be as much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, concerning the number of his Favourers, as those few that do favour him are, concerning his <hi>Sincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His second page, and part of his third, is in a manner wholly filled with Railing at me. He says, <hi>I labour to take from him his Innocency, and Christian Reputation and Testimony.</hi> Of all which, I think he brought but little (if any) into <hi>England.</hi> What stock of each he carried with him into <hi>America,</hi> he has (I fear) made <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack</hi> of there. He charges me with <hi>a sordid way of Sophist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>l Wrangling, Perversions, Forgeries, and false Accusations, to the number of Fifty, and upwards.</hi> This Charge he sent abroad in his Printed Epistle, in <hi>general</hi> Terms, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancing the Particulars; which he kept in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, to furnish out another Book. But was not this a sordid way of Sophistical Wrangling in him, thus to Charge, without making Proof? How often and highly does he complain, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his former Treatises, of being charged <hi>in generals,</hi> without producing particular Proofs? In his Plea of the Innocent, <hi>p.</hi> 8. He, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Party, say, <hi>Seeing their Accusations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> G. K. <hi>lye much in bare generals, we see no cause further to take notice of them,—but to shew,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:109396:4"/>
               <hi>that for want of particular matter against him, they thus labour to defame him in bare generals; a way</hi> (says he) <hi>common to all Sophisters and false Acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> Did he not then take the way which he says is common to all Sophisters and false Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, when he accused me in <hi>bare generals,</hi> without producing the Particulars? Did he not take the most deceitful way he could, when he accused me in <hi>bare generals,</hi> seeing himself says, <hi>(p.</hi> 17. of his Plea) <hi>Nothing is more deceitful than bare gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals?</hi> It will not excuse him, that he has now at length, in another Treatise, set forth the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of his Charge; that being but (to use his own Phrase) <hi>like Mustard after Meat.</hi> If he had intended to deal fairly, he should either have brought his Proofs with his Charge, or kept his Charge, till he could <hi>find</hi> his Proofs. But so far was he from that, that he expected his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der should give Judgment against me, upon his general Accusation, without proof (for <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> he says, <hi>prove nothing;</hi> Causless Ground of Surmises, <hi>p.</hi> 2.) Hear how he bespeaks it. <hi>I appeal,</hi> says he, <hi>to all moderate, judicious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Persons, called Quakers, Whether</hi> T. E. <hi>hath not shewed himself as a Man hurried and carried away as with a Tempest and impetuous Current of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice against me, not only to heap so many Perversions; Misrepresentations, Forgeries and false Accusations against me; but,</hi> &amp;c. This is in his <hi>Loving Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> before he had brought forth the Instances to prove his Charge by. So that the moderate, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and impartial Persons he appealed to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wore to take it for granted, upon his <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>general</hi> Accusation, that I had heaped so many
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109396:5"/>
Perversions, Forgeries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> against him: How else could they answer his Appeal? By this, Friends, ye may see what he meant by mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, judicious and impartial Persons, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as would give Judgment upon his Accusation, <hi>in bare generals,</hi> then, and take his word for proof, till his other Book should come forth. But no such Persons will he ever find, I hope, among the Quakers. Yet that this was his expectation and desire, that other passage, in the close of his Epistle, proves beyond doubting. Where threatning to publish his Answer to mine (in which he said he had noted Fifty of my Perversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> he does it with this Reserve and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso, <hi>If nothing be done forthwith by that Party that hath approved and promoted his Book, to call it in and disown it.</hi> This plainly shews, he expected Friends should have called in and disowned my Book, upon his <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>general</hi> Accusation, without seeing the Fifty Perversions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he talked of, or hearing what they were. For the calling in, and disowning my Book, was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by him as an Expedient, to prevent his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the Proofs of that Accusation, upon which he would have had it called in and disowned: But did he herein like a Christian? Like a Wise Man? Like a Scholar? Or at all like a Man? Surely, more <hi>discretion,</hi> at least, if not <hi>Iustice,</hi> was expected from <hi>George Keith:</hi> And the truly moderate, judicious and impartial will easily see, that he hath used those Epithets but <hi>artificially,</hi> and to deceive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:109396:5"/>
He is in great Confusion, in this part of his Work. For he calls his Book <hi>a just and necessary Defense of the Truth, as well as of himself;</hi> and yet he is fain to <hi>intreat and request,</hi> over and over, his moderate, judicious and impartial Persons, and that <hi>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nestly</hi> too, to <hi>excuse</hi> him, and not be <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi> with him for it. Surely, if he believed, what he writ was a just and necessary defense of the Truth, he might have trusted it boldly with the moderate, judicious and impartial, without begging their Excuse, or fearing to offend them.</p>
            <p>He goes on thus against me, <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>But when he cannot heap up so many</hi> Perversions, &amp;c.) <hi>as he would, he goes about by an Art of wrangling and sophistry of Words, to prove me guilty, when his Evidence in matter of Fact doth utterly fail him;</hi> (of this he gives no Instance neither, but says I do it) <hi>even as a Man would go before an Assize to prove one guilty of Theft or Felony, by false Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisms, when his Evidence is short in matter of Fast, thus arguing against an innocent Person; some Man is a Thief, but</hi> A B, <hi>is some Man, therefore</hi> A. B. <hi>is</hi> a <hi>Thief.</hi> Upon this he enters a new Appeal (not so restrained as before, to the moderate, judicious and impartial; but more at large) <hi>I appeal,</hi> says he, <hi>to all that know the Truth</hi> (of which, he knows, there are, <hi>besides himself,</hi> too many that do not walk in it) <hi>whether this sort of Sophistical Arguing, doth Agree to that Simplicity of Truth, and plainness both of Doctrine and Practice, that we generally have professed.</hi> This shews he is well versed in the <hi>Fallacies</hi> of Logick, and is ready at making <hi>false Syllogisms:</hi> and it also
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109396:6"/>
shews his unfair dealing. For, Friends, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you, who not only know the Truth, but dwell and walk in it, whether I have used such sort of Arguing against him, as he hath here charged me with? He says, <hi>I go about, by an Art of wrangling, and sophistry of words, to prove him guilty, when my Evidence in matter of Fact doth utterly fail me:</hi> And he says, <hi>I do this, even as a Man would go before an Assize to prove one guilty of Felony, by false Syllogisms, when his Evidence is short in matter of Fact, thus arguing against an innocent Person, some Man is a Thief, but</hi> A. B. <hi>is some Man, therefore</hi> A. B. <hi>is a Thief,</hi> Friends, my Book, out of which he pretends to <hi>make</hi> this Charge against me, is in your hands; pray search and examine it throughly: see if you can find any such false syllogism in it, or any such manner of Arguing as he hath here taxed me with. If ye cannot (as I am sure ye cannot) then pray reflect your thoughts upon <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider seriously what a sort of Man he must be, to deal thus <hi>Injuriously</hi> with both you and me. Hath not he himself acted like a Man that should go before an Assize, to accuse an innocentPerson of some heinous Crime, and though he brough <hi>no evidence</hi> to convict him by, should yet press to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>?</hi> Sure I am, such Dealing is very far from the Simplicity, plainness and justice of Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we profess: Yet so, ye may see, he hath dealt by me in that Epistle of his. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>aks of <hi>some,</hi> in his Third <hi>page, who,</hi> he says,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109396:6"/>
               <hi>have plucked out their Eyes, and given them away to such as would deceive them.</hi> How he should know that some have done so, unless they have brought their Eyes to him to keep for them, I who have kept my Eyes to my self, don't see. But questionless, if he knows any such, that have pluct out their Eyes, and given them away to such as would deceive them, it must be to them he made his Appeal <hi>before he brought his Prooss:</hi> for none, he might be sure, that had Eyes in their heads, and knew how to use them, would give Judgment upon his Appeal before they had seen his Proofs.</p>
            <p>His mentioning how much Friends have been <hi>warned to beware lest any spoil them through Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and vain Deceit, and impose upon them by the Wisdom of words,</hi> gives me occasion to say, If he had been wary, and not suffered himself to be spoyled through deceit and vain Philosophy, he would not have so far shamed himself, by imposing upon others, as he too often does, by words without Wisdom.</p>
            <p>In his Third <hi>p.</hi> he hath a fling at the second days morning Meeting in London, which, ye know, consists mostly of Ministring Friends, with whom he is seldom pleased. At this time his quarrel with that Meeting is for authorizing or allowing my Book to come out. Yet that he may keep steady to his Intention of <hi>Dividing,</hi> he deals with that Meeting, as he did before with the Yearly Meeting, representing this also to be what he would have it, divided into Parties. He says of my Book, that it came out <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized or allowed, either by the second days Meeting</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:109396:7"/>
               <hi>at London, or at least by a Leading or Prevailing Party of them.</hi> I mention this, Friends, not that I think there needs any Refutation of it (the <hi>Falsness</hi> thereof being so well known:) but that all may see his <hi>Splitting Design,</hi> and none may give way thereto. In the same <hi>page</hi> he casts a wicked <hi>Scoff</hi> at that Meeting, thus. <hi>And must all this,</hi> says he, <hi>be fathered upon the Spirit of God? It being their constant pretension to have the Spirit of God Directing and assisting them in all their Chambers Affairs and Meetings.</hi> This needs no Comment neither, Friends, it is enough but to repeat it, ye cannot but savour what Spirit it came from.</p>
            <p>The rest of his Third <hi>page,</hi> and so on, almost to the end of his Sheet, he spends in <hi>quibbling</hi> on a Passage in my Book, <hi>p.</hi> 49. where to shew the emptiness of his great Boast, <q>That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Objections, and severe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, that some have made against his late Books, and a strict Examination of them by some that had so complained, there is not any Line or Sentence in any of them, that they have made to appear to contain any Untruth or Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in them, either in matter of Doctrine or Fact;</q> I said <q>This has <hi>nothing of Note</hi> in it: For (supposing it were true in Fact, that no Untruth or Falshood in matter of Fact had been disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in his Books) it was not the proper busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Yearly Meeting (which here, as elsewhere, he strikes at) to judge of the matters of Fact contained in his Books, which were alledged to have been done in <hi>America,</hi> by Persons not here to answer to, or give account of them.</q> From the former part of these words
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109396:7"/>
(contained in the first Parenthesis) he would fain strain such a Concession, as might justifie all the Matters contained in his Books. He says, <hi>p.</hi> 4. I have been <hi>so liberal to him, to grant, by way of supposition,</hi> all those particulars which he there enumerates (comprehending, I think, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Scandalous Books written in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica) and his Books to contain nothing, yet discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of Untruth or Falshood.</hi> This he calls my <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Concession,</hi> and is so fond of the word, that he repeats it no less than <hi>seven</hi> times in his fifth page. He knew, I perceive, the need he had of a <hi>Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and a <hi>liberal</hi> one too; but he should not have been so <hi>liberal</hi> to himself, in making <hi>Concessions</hi> from my words, to his own advantage, against the plain sense of my words, and of my mind: For, I assure him, if I had made him such a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> as he pretends to, it would have been as far from my <hi>intention,</hi> as from his <hi>Desert.</hi> But let us see, whether there be such a <hi>Concession,</hi> or no, in those words of mine. A <hi>Concession</hi> is a <hi>Grant,</hi> and differs much from a <hi>Supposition,</hi> whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises that usual Form of Speech, <hi>Supposing, but not Granting</hi> (which is implied even where it is not exprest.) Now, Friends, if ye observe my words in the place before quoted <hi>(p.</hi> 49. of my former Epistle) ye will find, I do not say <hi>Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it to be true in Fact, but <hi>supposing</hi> it were true in Fact. I was so far from Granting it <hi>to be</hi> true in Fact, that I did not so much as suppose it to be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e in Fact, but said, supposing <hi>it were</hi> true in Fact, which implies it was <hi>not true</hi> in Fact, and plainly proves I did not grant it to be true in Fact, no not so much as by supposition. And in the very
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109396:8"/>
next Sentence, I affirmed that there is Untruth or Falshood in his Books, in matter of Fact, and that it was made appear, and wherein. This was far from a <hi>Concession,</hi> Grant, or Allowance, that all the Matters of Fact mentioned in his Books are true. Nay, to prevent any such Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehension, I added this Caution, p. 50. <hi>Therefore let none think that because the Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did not declare the Matters of Fact in his Books to be false, therefore they are all true. They remain to be proved by him that has affirmed them, and to be answered by them who are charged therein.</hi> Ye see now Friends, how far I was from <hi>granting</hi> the Matters of Fact in his Books <hi>to be true,</hi> and what little ground he had for his great <hi>glorying</hi> in that which he calls my <hi>liberal Concession.</hi> By which if he <hi>gain</hi> any thing with the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> he will <hi>lose</hi> more with the <hi>Iudicious,</hi> who by this will see him to be a <hi>meer Sophister,</hi> and conclude his Cause to be bad indeed, that hath driven so <hi>able a Man</hi> (in his own Opinion, as well as in the Opinion of some others) to make use of so <hi>mean</hi> a shift, which a true Scholar would have been ashamed of.</p>
            <p>He charges me also with <hi>contradicting</hi> the Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting, in saying, It was not the proper bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of that Meeting to judge of the Matters of Fact, contained in his Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he would hence infer, that <hi>the Yearly Meeting both medled and judged in that which was not their proper business.</hi> But in this he deals unfairly and weak ly, as well as in the former. For ye may see, Friends, in the fore-quoted place of my Epistle, <hi>p.</hi> 49, 50. the Matters of Fact I there say, it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109396:8"/>
was not the proper business of the Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to judge, were such as were <hi>alledged to have been done in</hi> America, <hi>by Persons not here to answer to, or give account of them.</hi> For which reason that Meeting did forbear to give Judgment in those Matters, though they could not forbear to hear them, being complicated with others, and related or read together. But it doth not thence follow, that that Meeting had not power to judge of those Matters, which were of themselves, or by his Books, <hi>apparent</hi> to the Meeting, and which did not depend upon the Proofs or Defences of <hi>absent</hi> Persons. Such as are the <hi>Breach</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi> he has made in <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>separate</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he has set up, or caused to be set up there, (of which his own Books give Proofs sufficient) the <hi>scandalous Books</hi> he has written there, and which have been published both there, here and else where, to the great dishonour of God, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our holy Profession, and reproach and grief of Friends.</p>
            <p>He would also <hi>squeeze</hi> some advantage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out of that saying of mine in my former Epistle, <hi>p.</hi> 72. <q>That the way to recover the Deceived, is to discover, lay open, and witness against the Deceivers.</q> From hence he would fain justifie himself for publishing his abusive and <hi>scandalous Books.</hi> But this will not yield him any defence, unless he could prove them Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whom in those Books he hath written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. Which he no otherwise here attempts to do, than by begging it from that which he calls my liberal Concession: For thus he says, <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>By his liberal Concession, supposing it to be true in</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:109396:9"/>
               <hi>matter of Fact that I have charged upon some Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in</hi> America, <hi>as above-mentioned, they are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</hi> But he should have remembred the Rule, <hi>supposition proves nothing;</hi> and not have built upon a <hi>supposed Concession,</hi> which hath no Foundation, but in his own Imagination. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though that Assertion of mine, <hi>[That the way to recover the Deceived, is to discover, lay open, and witness against the Deceivers]</hi> will not stand him in stead: Yet <hi>it is true,</hi> and will stand the Truth in stead against him, and all that turn against it. And by it all (that have not pluckt out their Eyes, and given them to him) may see, that what he suggests of the Yearly Meeting and me, that we would have vile and gross Errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Covered and Cloak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is a vile and gross Slander and Calumny of his.</p>
            <p>Thus, Friends, I have gone through his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and toucht, I think, the most material parts of it. In which, if I would have imitated his Example, I might probably have picks up as many <hi>real</hi> Perversions, Forgeries and false Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, out of that one Sheet; as he hath <hi>feigned ones</hi> out of my Epistle of near Five Sheets. But I will not imitate his Trifling. I come now to his other Book, called, <hi>A Seasonable Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c:</hi> wherein he pretends to set forth Fifty Perversions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in his former Sheet he said he had noted in my Book, most of which are so <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>silly,</hi> that he has rendred himself not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ridiculous in noting them. But before he comes at them, he suggests, in his Introduction, that I printed that Book <hi>in great disunity, and</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:109396:9"/>
               <hi>against the mind of many Friends, although approved and promoted by a Party equally prejudiced</hi> (he says) <hi>against him for his faithful Christian Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Truth of Christ.</hi> Now Friends, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his Falshood in this is sufficiently known to many Friends in <hi>London;</hi> yet because his Books are usually spread (by the help of other Separatists) into divers parts of this Kingdom, as well as beyond the Seas, I think fit, for the information of all Friends every where, to let you know how I proceeded therein. After I had written that Book, called, <hi>An Epistle to Friends,</hi> I went up to <hi>London</hi> with it, and presented it to the Second Days Morning Meeting, where such Writings of Friends, as are intended for the Press, are to be read and considered. I read it throughout in that Meeting: And, to the best of my remembrance, there was not one Friend there, (though the Meeting was pretty full) that shewed any disunity therewith, or made any exception against it; but the Meeting left me to my freedom, for the publishing thereof, which ye may be sure they would not have done, had they had disunity therewith. So that I took, (as I conceive) the right way and method, in publishing that Epistle, and proceeded in the same course, that all Friends do, who stand in unity with the Body of Friends, when they have any thing to Print. And though one Friend (who did not hear it read, nor uses to be at that Meeting) meeting me casually in the Street, after it was in the Press, would have disswaded me from printing it at that time; and, as I have heard, one or two other Friends
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109396:10"/>
(who do not use to go to that Meeting neither) when it was well nigh finished, finding what a heat and fret the report of it had put <hi>G. K.</hi> into, did move to have the publication thereof <hi>defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a while,</hi> to see if they could bring <hi>G. K.</hi> to a better mind: Yet no Friend, either then, or since, to this day, hath signified to me any disunity with the Book, or with me for publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. But if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>had gone out of the way of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in the publishing that Book, was <hi>G. K.</hi> of all Men, fit to charge me with it, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has not set one foot therein, in the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the Pamphlets he hath written, since he came into <hi>England,</hi> to say nothing here of his other Scandalous Books written in <hi>America?</hi> Hath he offered any of his late Books to the Judgment of that Meeting, to which I brought mine, and other Friends bring theirs, and he (I suppose) formerly, while he stood in Unity with Friends, used to bring his? Nay, did he not publish his Book, called, The Causless Ground of Surmises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only <hi>not with,</hi> but <hi>against the Unity,</hi> and against the Judgment even of those Friends, whom he himself made choice of <hi>privately</hi> to shew it to? But why give I instances here of his disunion with Friends, of whose Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Friends no instance can be given? I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to his Fifty Perversions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First is, That I <hi>falsly</hi> (he says) <hi>accuse him</hi> (in my Title Page) <hi>of a Spirit of Contention and Division, that</hi> (I say) <hi>hath lately appeared in him, and some few others that join with him, who have made a Breach and Separation from Friends in</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:109396:10"/>
               <hi>America.</hi> That a Spirit of Contention and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision hath of late appeared in him, and some few others that join with him, is a thing so <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently seen,</hi> and known to them that converse with him, or read his late Contentious Books, that he might, with like modesty, deny the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sun at Noon in the clearest Day. And that he and they have made a <hi>Breach</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> from Friends in <hi>America,</hi> is so fully proved upon him in my last, that I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leave it to the Readers Judgment. And whereas he says, <hi>Those,</hi> I call <hi>some few, are about sixteen Meetings:</hi> I say, If that be true (which I question) his Guilt is the greater, in having mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so many.</p>
            <p>His Second Charge he takes out of my ninth Page, where he says, <hi>I falsly accuse him, that he blames Friends, that they were gone too much from the Outward to the Inward.</hi> This he says, <hi>is a downright Forgery,</hi> and that <hi>he never blamed any for going too much to the inward.</hi> But in this he hath <hi>perverted</hi> my words. For I did not say he bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Friends for going too much to the Inward, but for going too much <hi>from the Outward</hi> to the Inward. The words <hi>[too much]</hi> there related to their going <hi>from the Outward;</hi> which in the following words, I shewed, saying, <hi>For</hi> G. K<hi>'s Complaint and Charge is, That Friends do not preach the Outward Appearance and Manifestation of Christ in the Flesh enough, or oft enough.</hi> I did not say his Complaint was, that they preached the Inward Appearance of Christ <hi>too much;</hi> but that they did not preach his <hi>Outward</hi> Appearance
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109396:11"/>
               <hi>enough,</hi> or <hi>oft</hi> enough. And that he did so, he himself proves in <hi>p.</hi> 10. of his last Book, where he says, <hi>I have blamed some Persons for not rightly and fully preaching Christ Without, &amp;c.</hi> His say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same place, that from my manner of charging him, it plainly appears, as well as from the words of some others, that <hi>it was our sense, To preach Christ without, and Faith in him, it draws from the inward,</hi> &amp;c. is a <hi>gross Perversion</hi> and <hi>false Accusation</hi> in him, as appears from my following words in that ninth page of my former Epistle, where I say to Friends, <q>Ye know this Charge of his to be <hi>false,</hi> and that the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Truth hath always been acknowledged and born by Friends from the beginning, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has offered, to the <hi>Outward</hi> Manifestation and Appearance of Christ, as well as to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>His Third Charge is, That I <hi>falsly and unjustly charge him with</hi> Robert Hannay<hi>'s Book, as if it were his, both for Matter and Style,</hi> and that I <hi>cast it upon him.</hi> For this he cunningly quotes my <hi>15th.</hi> page, where I say least of it; (for there I only said, <q>Considering the manner of that Pamphlet's coming forth, the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Style</hi> thereof, and his refusing to disown it, I shall leave it (my Friends) to your impartial Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether the <hi>Reflections</hi> contained in that Pamphlet against the Yearly Meeting, are not justly to be charged upon him.)</q> But in my <hi>11th.</hi> and <hi>12th.</hi> pages, speaking of it, I said, <q>How far <hi>G. K.</hi> had <hi>an hand,</hi> or was <hi>concerned,</hi> in the Writing of that Book, I will not here say.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109396:11"/>
But I may say, the matter of the Queries in that Book, is so much the same with the matter of the other Book publisht soon after with <hi>G. K</hi>'s Name to it, and the Style thereof so agreeable to his Style, in that and his other Writings, that whoever shall take him for the Author of it, will, I think, be very <hi>excusable,</hi> though he should prove in part mistaken.</q> And a little after, <q>But in as much as they are <hi>both of a Party,</hi> and <hi>R. Hannay</hi> is at <hi>G. K</hi>'s right Hand in his Work of Contention and Division, and <hi>G. K.</hi> (though often put upon it) hath not publickly disowned that Pamphlet, which <hi>R. H</hi>'s Name is to, I do not think I shall wrong <hi>G. K.</hi> (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I would not) in supposing him to have at least a share therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> This was uot direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charging him with it, nor casting it upon him. Yet I declare, I am more strongly now perswaded that he had the greatest hand in it, than I was before. For mark but what he now says, <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>As I had no hand in the Printing it, but was against it; so diverse things in it, that seemed to some most offensive, I was not concerned in.</hi> He does not say he had <hi>no hand</hi> in the <hi>Writing</hi> it; but he had no hand in the <hi>Printing</hi> it (that is, he did not actually work at the Press;) but was against it, he says; That proves he was <hi>privy</hi> to the Printing, how else could he be against it? Next he says, he was not concern'd in <hi>divers</hi> things in it; does not that imply he was concerned in the <hi>main?</hi> And lastly, the divers things he says he was not concerned in, were those that seemed most offensive to <hi>some,</hi> he does not say they seem'd most offensive to <hi>him.</hi> See now, whether
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109396:12"/>
he has any whit mended the matter, in clearing himself of being a Party (at least) to that Book, and consequently guilty of that <hi>Insincerity,</hi> which in my last I charged upon him.</p>
            <p>His Fourth Charge is, That I <hi>not only falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him, but am guilty of an absolute Forgery and Fiction in matter of Fact, That he refused to go out at the Yearly Meeting in</hi> Philadelphia, <hi>held in the Seventh Month,</hi> 1691, <hi>and that his refusal to go out was the occasion of their delay to give Iudgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> W. Stockdale, <hi>for which, as a proof, I cite his Book,</hi> called, Some Reasons and Causes, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 14. In this I acknowledge a <hi>mistake</hi> on my part; not in saying, he refused to go out at the Yearly Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> (for that I understand he did:) But my mistake was, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to a place in his Book for Proof of this, when as that place, it seems, related not to that Yearly Meeting, but to a Quarterly Meeting. In which mistake, I think I am the more excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being led into it by his <hi>obscure way</hi> of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For neither in that <hi>14th.</hi> page of his said Book, called, <hi>Some Reasons, &amp;c.</hi> (formerly quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by me,) Nor in the <hi>18th.</hi> page of the same (now quoted by himself) is there any Day, Month, or Year set, wherein either the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly or Yearly Meeting was held. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he quotes his <hi>18th.</hi> page to prove he did go out as the Yearly Meeting; there is a <hi>Fallacy</hi> in that: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>r there being (as he notes) <hi>Six</hi> Meetings in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>st. But he is too eager, in calling this a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109396:12"/>
an absolute Forgery and Fiction, a gross Forgery, (so he endeavours to aggravate it) and that too in <hi>matter of Fact.</hi> For the <hi>matter of Fact</hi> is, that <hi>he did refuse to go out of the Meeting,</hi> wherein his Charge and Proofs against <hi>W. Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> were to be considered of, though he was by the Meeting desired to withdraw. Whether that Meeting was Yearly, or Quarterly, and on what Day, or in what Month it was held, or where, are but Circumstances of Time and Place. The <hi>matter of Fact, viz.</hi> That he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to go out, at the Meeting's desire, <hi>is true,</hi> and proved by his own Confession, not only in the place before quoted by me (though misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied there as to the particular Meeting) but even in this last Book also, <hi>p.</hi> 11. where he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges his refusal to go out, and gives the same reason for it, as he gave before in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. But to make him amends for my former mistake, I will now put him in mind, that not at that Quarterly Meeting only, but at <hi>another</hi> Meeting also, where, it seems, his Complaint was depending, he refused to go forth, though desired by the Meeting, and that by his own Confession, in his Book called, <hi>Some Reasons, &amp;c.</hi> p. 18. to which he has now referr'd me, and thereby helped me to this additional Proof against him. There he brings it in with a Note thus; <hi>Note, That whereas it hath been said by some, That they would have dealt with these men, who have been guilty of those Errors, but that</hi> G. K. <hi>would not go forth, being desired to withdraw at the Meeting at</hi> R. E's, <hi>and at the Quarterly Meeting. To which his Answer is, That</hi> G. K. <hi>had good reason</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:109396:13"/>
               <hi>not to withdraw at Both these times.</hi> This, I hope, proves the <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> in both points, both that he refused to withdraw, though desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that at two several Meetings, while his Charge and Proofs were to have been considered of; and that his so refusing did delay or hinder the Meeting from dealing (as they otherwise would have done) with those he had accused. And thus his Charge of <hi>Forgery,</hi> absolute <hi>Forgery,</hi> gross <hi>Forgery,</hi> double <hi>Forgery,</hi> with which he hath made such a vaunting Flourish, falls to the Ground. And I might, (if I had his Forehead) recharge him with Forgery, in saying, I charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with refusing to go out at the Yearly Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> held in the Seventh Month 1691. which last words, relating to the time of it, are not in my Book. But I need no such <hi>little Tricks,</hi> though he doth.</p>
            <p>His Fifth Charge he takes out of <hi>p.</hi> 22. of mine, where I inferr'd from the Judgment given by the Yearly Meeting against <hi>W. S.</hi> 
               <q>That that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not at a stand (as <hi>G. K.</hi> abusively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents them) to determine whether the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was true or false: But, if they were at a stand at all, it was to determine whether the Charge exhibited by <hi>G. K.</hi> against <hi>W. S.</hi> was true or false; <hi>W. S.</hi> both then (and to his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day) denying that he spake those words, which <hi>G. K.</hi> charged him with.</q> This he says, <hi>I falsly alledge,</hi> and that <hi>he has fully proved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi> urging for his Proof, that <hi>in the Iudgment that Meeting gave, they grant,</hi> That Proof was made by Two <hi>Witnesses, that the Charge exhibited</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:109396:13"/>
               <hi>was true; and if they had been at a stand on that Point, it is not like that they would have given any Iudgment against him at all.</hi> This is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o Proof at all, that they were not at a stand and did demur whether the Charge exhibited were true or no. For though they might have great reason to doubt the Truth of the Evidence of those two witnesses, who were both known to be <hi>strong in Party</hi> with G. <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>great adversaries</hi> to W. S. and might thence have just cause to <hi>suspend</hi> their Judgment for a while, and take the <hi>longer time</hi> to examine, sift and try the matter to the utmost: Yet unless <hi>W.</hi> S. could have <hi>disproved</hi> that Evidence, the Meeting could not well do other than give Judgment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Evidence, though they might not have compleat satisfaction of the Veracity of the Witnesses. For even in worldly Courts (where Justice is to be exceeded by the Disciples of Christ) Judgment is to be given <hi>(Secundum Allegata &amp; Probata)</hi> according to what is alledged and proved; and often is so, where yet the truth of the Evidence is <hi>much doubted,</hi> and sometimes wholy disbelived by the Court that gives it. Here then his hold fails him.</p>
            <p>Ye may remember, Friends, that in my former Epistle, <hi>p.</hi> 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to manifest that <hi>G. K.</hi> quarrelled with that Yearly Meeting at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> and published his Anathema's against them without just cause, I shewed from his own Books, That that Meeting, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive his Charge against <hi>W. S.</hi> but did give a determination therein, a Judgment against
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109396:14"/>
               <hi>W. S.</hi> Under this I perceive <hi>G. K.</hi> lies <hi>very uneasy,</hi> and would fain cast it <hi>off,</hi> that he might have some colourable pretence for his disorderly <hi>casting off</hi> that Meeting. First, he cavils at them for <hi>not publishing their Iudgment till nine Months after.</hi> How to understand that, I cannot well tell: for if, as he says, that Yearly Meeting was held in the Seventh Month, 1691. it was not 9. Months to the adjourned monthly Meeting in the Twelth Month 1691. nor full Six neither: And yet it should seem to have been published <hi>before that,</hi> because in the Judgment of that Meeting, this Judgment of the Yearly Meeting was in part recited. Next he finds fault with the Excuse he says they make for not publishing it sooner, which was that <hi>they were prevented by reason of his unruly Behaviour, and extream Passion.</hi> This he calls <hi>a most deceitful pretence.</hi> What other Causes of delay they might have in publishing their Judgment, I know not; but that this was one, I am the more easily induced to believe, from what I my self observed of his <hi>Unruly behaviour, and extream Passion</hi> in our late Yearly Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> of which, Friends, many of you were <hi>grieved Witnesses,</hi> as well as I. He asks, in the next place, <hi>why they contradicted the sound Iudgment of a Monthly Meeting at</hi> Philadelphia, <hi>passing due Censure upon W.</hi> S. <hi>Six Months thereafter?</hi> Methinks this doth not sound, as if it came from <hi>a sound Iudgment.</hi> Is it proper to say, that he or they that give a Judgment <hi>now,</hi> do contradict that Judgment that shall or may be given by others <hi>Six Months</hi> hence. If they gave their Judgment at
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109396:14"/>
that Yearly Meeting, near Six Months <hi>before</hi> the other Judgment (if that was another) was given, how then can the first be said to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the latter, when the latter was <hi>not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> when the First was given. One would think if there be Contradiction in the two Judgments, the latter should rather contradict the former. But to speak plain my sense of them, according to what I have seen of them both, in his Books, I do not find that either of them contradicts the other; but that the <hi>latter</hi> Judgment (to wit that of the adjourned Meeting) reciting, at least in part, the <hi>former</hi> Judgment of the Yearly Meeting, doth (for ought I see) approve it, and carry it on further. Yet he says, of that Judgment of the Yearly Meeting, <hi>it is Sufficiently apparent from this (viz.</hi> its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting, I think he means, the Judgment of the adjourned Meeting, which had no being till about Six Months after) <hi>it was no cordial, nor Sincere Iudgment.</hi> But let me ask him, if this was not a sincere Judgment, but, as he also calls it, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical,</hi> how came it to pass that his adjourned Meeting, which he celebrates for giving <hi>sound</hi> Judgment, and says they gave it <hi>Sincerely,</hi> not only recited part of this Judgment, but <hi>built theirs upon it?</hi> For thus in his <hi>Reasons of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration p.</hi> 11. he has delivered their Judgment to us. <q>Whereas <hi>W.</hi>—having formerly accused <hi>G.</hi> K. with preaching two Christs, and the Charge and matter having been fully debated at the last Yearly Meeting, before publick Friends, and others, who did deliver it as their Sense and Judgment, that the said W.—had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109396:15"/>
abused <hi>G. K.</hi> thereby, and that <hi>G. K</hi>'s. Doctrine was right and true in his preaching Faith in Christ within, and Faith in Christ without, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> See here the <hi>Basis</hi> upon which they build their Judgment. Would they build their Judgment upon an insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, hypocritical Judgment, methinks it should not become <hi>G. K.</hi> to fasten such a foul <hi>Blemish</hi> upon his adjourned Meeting, which he <hi>Praises</hi> so highly for giving <hi>sound</hi> Judgment, and that <hi>sincerely.</hi> Another Objection he makes against that Yearly Meeting, that <hi>they did not all that time intervening, bring</hi> W. S. <hi>to any Conviction, but mightily supported him as an innocent Person.</hi> Can any one believe this, <hi>viz.</hi> that they mightily supported him as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Person, who at the same time shall read in <hi>G. K</hi>'s own Books, that <hi>they delivered it as their Sense and Iudgment, that he had abused</hi> G. K. <hi>and that he was reproveable and blame-worthy,</hi> &amp;c? But as for <hi>G. K</hi>'s. saying, They did not bring <hi>W. S.</hi> to <hi>any Conviction</hi> (which he very often repeats) I know not well what to make of it. I know he understands Words well enough, when he is <hi>cool:</hi> Which makes me question whether his <hi>Heat</hi> has not transported him beyond his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. If he means that they did not bring him to an <hi>inward</hi> Sense, and Conviction in himself, that he had done or said Evil, they cannot be justly blamed for that, since that is not in the power of Man to do, and if <hi>W. S.</hi> knew himself <hi>innocent</hi> (as, it seems, to the last, he affirm'd he was) it was not possible they could bring him to <hi>such</hi> a Conviction; nor do I find, the <hi>sound</hi> Judgment, as <hi>G. K.</hi> calls it, of the adjourned Meeting (how <hi>sincerely</hi> soever given)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109396:15"/>
wrought <hi>that</hi> Effect on him, any more than the Judgment of the Yearly Meeting had done. But if he means by <hi>Conviction,</hi> (according to the <hi>usual</hi> acceptation of the Word, especially in Judicial Proceedings,) a proving him guilty by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Witnesses, it is to be hoped, they brought him to <hi>some sort</hi> of Conviction that way, before they gave Sentence of Condemnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; nay, it appears by <hi>G. K</hi>'s own Book they did. Yet <hi>G. K.</hi> says, they did not bring him to <hi>any</hi> Conviction. <hi>G. K.</hi> will needs have it, that the determination given by the Yearly Meeting against <hi>W. S.</hi> was <hi>not sincere:</hi> Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he cannot make it out, he first <hi>begs the Question,</hi> and then offers a <hi>precarious</hi> Proof. Thus he doth it, in answer to my saying, A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination then, it seems, was given, by his own acknowledgment. <hi>I answer,</hi> says he, <hi>seeing it was not sincere, but hypocritical</hi> (there he <hi>begs</hi> the Question:) <hi>as appears,</hi> says he, <hi>by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting the Iudgment of the Monthly Meeting that gave it sincerely and duly.</hi> (There's his <hi>precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Proof.) But first, how does it appear that the Yearly Meeting, (about Six Months before the Monthly Meeting, as he calls it, gave any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all) <hi>contradicted</hi> the Judgment which that Meeting gave near Six Months after? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how does it appear that his Monthly Meeting gave their Judgment <hi>sincerely</hi> and duly? Why, <hi>Ipse Tixit,</hi> he has affirm'd it; and they that will believe it may: But the best on't is, they that will not believe it, upon his bare word, may chuse, and I know not how he will help himself. But is it not strange, that so strong a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109396:16"/>
Man should argue so <hi>weakly?</hi> He repeats also, the Yearly Meeting's publishing their Judgment <hi>Nine Months after,</hi> and he thereupon calls it <hi>an Abortive, out of due time.</hi> But I doubt the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> that read that, will <hi>smile</hi> at him, for calling <hi>a Birth of Nine Months, an Abortive.</hi> He objects also, <hi>p.</hi> 12. that <hi>when they published it, they did not own the words spoken to be any offence against God, or Christ, but to sound and tender Friends.</hi> But if this was so great an offence in the Yearly Meeting, what will he say for his Adjourned Meeting, who in their Judgment, as he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it, do not <hi>own</hi> (to use his own word, I should else have said <hi>declare)</hi> the words spoken by <hi>W. S.</hi> to be any offence against God, or Christ, or to sound or tender Friends either. So that they went <hi>not so far</hi> in expressing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as the Yearly Meeting did, and yet he calls theirs a <hi>sound</hi> Judgment, and given <hi>sincerely.</hi> But where is the <hi>soundness</hi> of his Judgment, and his <hi>sincerity</hi> the mean while?</p>
            <p>His Sixth Charge against me is thus worded. <hi>He falsly and most fictitiously alledgeth, That</hi> Tho. Fitzwater <hi>sufficiently proved his Charge against me, for which he refers to my own Books; but this is a great Forgery, for his Charge was, That I denied the sufficiency of the Light, and this his Four Credible Witnesses did not prove against me, but it was quite another thing that the Monthly Meeting of the other side alledgeth, they proved against me,</hi> viz. <hi>That I did not believe the Light was sufficient without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else.</hi> Where's the <hi>great Forgery</hi> here? If there be any, it will lye at his Door, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109396:16"/>
me to have alledged that <hi>T. Fitzwater</hi> sufficiently proved his Charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas my words are, <hi>It seems T. F.</hi> sufficiently proved the words he charged <hi>G. K.</hi> with speaking, and so I think it <hi>will seem</hi> to any one that considers the words <hi>charged,</hi> and the words <hi>proved.</hi> The words <hi>charged</hi> were, <hi>That he denied the sufficiency of the Light:</hi> The words <hi>proved</hi> were, that <hi>he did not believe the Light was sufficient without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else:</hi> And these last words, he says, is <hi>quite another thing</hi> than the former; so that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, not sufficient without something else, is <hi>quite another thing</hi> than, not sufficient. But I think it will be hard for him to make that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently out. Nor doth the asserting the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Light, <hi>exclude</hi> (as he would falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously infer) <hi>the Man Christ without us:</hi> For the Man Christ without us, in his glorified state, in which he is united with the Godhead, is Light. And though <hi>G. K.</hi> to compass his Design, doth <hi>cunningly</hi> slide in the word <hi>within;</hi> yet he knows it was not in the words <hi>charged,</hi> nor in the words <hi>proved:</hi> The Charge was, That <hi>he denied the sufficiency of the Light.</hi> The Proof was, that <hi>he did not believe the Light was sufficient without something else.</hi> Here was the Light mentioned <hi>indefinitely;</hi> not a word of <hi>within:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he does not fairly, nor like a Disputant, to thrust it in afterwards. His charging me with excluding the Man Christ without us, is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse; and his telling me of <hi>Ieffery Bullock,</hi> an idle Bugbear. <hi>He has clear'd me himself,</hi> beyond what he is able to asperse me with, by Citing those Passages out of a former Book of mine,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109396:17"/>
called, <hi>The Foundation of Tythes shaken,</hi> p. 238. where, in answer to my Opponent, a Priest, that had in Print affirmed, <q>That some Quakers (slighting the Merit and Necessity of Christ's Death) ascribe Salvation to the following the Light within; I rejected his Charge, and in the Name of the Quakers denied it; putting him to Name those Quakers, and solemnly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring I knew no such.</q> Then added, <q>Nor do the Quakers ascribe Salvation to the following the Light within, but they ascribe Salvation to Christ Jesus, to whom the Light within doth lead those that truly follow it.</q> And in <hi>p.</hi> 240. I said, <q>If any one expects Remission of Sins by any other way than the Death of Christ, he renders the Death of Christ useless.</q> These Passages <hi>G. K.</hi> hath now Cited, in his <hi>Seasonable Information,</hi> p. 12. and that <hi>with approbation,</hi> (save only that he would have the word <hi>Only</hi> added to the <hi>Light within;</hi> which, to gratifie him, I am content to do, thereby expressing what was before implied:) And as this was my Judgment and Testimony <hi>then;</hi> so it is <hi>now:</hi> Which sufficiently clears me from his slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Suggestion, that I exclude the Man Christ without us, from having any part or concern in our Salvation. And truly, Friends, by his thus dealing with me, I have a great guess at his way of dealing with Friends in <hi>America,</hi> and after what manner he has gathered up the gross and vile Errors, and Damnable Heresies, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Devils he so liberally charges them with; and so I hope will ye too, upon the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this.</p>

I leave to you, Friends, to judge, from the Account I have herein given before, of the manner of its coming forth. And as to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of want of Gospel Order, I desire you to consider, that before my Book was written, <hi>he had refused to hear the Church,</hi> not only in <hi>America,</hi> (where he was openly and judicially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied) but here also, in not following the advice and counsel thereof. And truly I think, the Church would be in but an ill condition, if one, under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And what Gospel Order hath he given to either the Yearly Meeting, or the Second Day's Morning Meeting, before he exposed them in Print? He says, <hi>It has not been in the least intimated to him, that any Meeting in</hi> London, <hi>where he now lives, hath denied him.</hi> By this it seems as if he expected to be <hi>as oft</hi> denied as he removes his seat. What if a Meeting in <hi>London</hi> had denied him, and he should thereupon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109396:21"/>
remove to <hi>Bristol,</hi> and from thence to <hi>York?</hi> Would not his having been denied in <hi>London</hi> serve his Turn, unless he were in like manner denied again in each of the other Places also? But what need was there that any Meeting in <hi>London</hi> should intimate to him their denyal of him, who hath <hi>cut off himself</hi> from friends, by open Separation, and denied both the Yearly and Second Day's Morning Meeting in <hi>London?</hi> Besides he hath set up his Standard, Proclaimed War, begun it in <hi>America,</hi> transferr'd it hither, and, is eagerly carrying it on here; And he knows the saying, <hi>Inter arma silent leges.</hi> Can he reasonably expect the exactne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that speaking of a Monthly Meeting in the First Month last, he set no Year either when that was, or when his Book was Printed, as there is scarce to any of his late Printed things, which re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ys true.

And in that he says <hi>False;</hi> no such thing appearing plainly, or at all.

               </gap>are of a Letter, Written the 15th. of the Third Month, 1692. without any mention of the Meeting in the First Month last. That First Month <hi>last</hi> must be the First Month <hi>next before</hi> the Book, in which it is mentioned, was Printed. For the date of the Book therefore I searched, both in the Title page, and at the End: But it doth

            <p>This Objection I remember he made in the Yearly Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> and it was there An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and I took notice of both the Objection and Answer in my former Epistle, p. 31. thus, <q>I remember indeed (which I would here note) <hi>G. K.</hi> did object, That <hi>the Meeting was removed that Year somewhat earlier, than it had been some other Year's.</hi> But to that it was replied, by the Friends of <hi>Pensilvania</hi> then present, that there was no <hi>certain</hi> day prefix'd and settled for the removing thereof; but it was either earlier or later in the Year, according as the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109396:23"/>
Seasons of the Year proved fair or foul for weather.</q> This <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>full</hi> Answer to his Objection <hi>G. K.</hi> takes <hi>no notice of;</hi> but urges afresh, that the time of the Course of changing the Meeting was not yet come, as a Proof that my saying it was changed in Course is False and a Fiction. But this stands still in his way, and he must remove this, before he can get forward. He must prove that there was a <hi>prefixt</hi> day for the removing of the Meeting, and that Friends removed it before that fixt day was come, e're his Proof will stand him in any stead. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Friends, I hope ye will take notice, that by his saying, The time of the Course of it was not yet come, nor did come either so soon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after, he grants <hi>the Meeting had a Course of Removing,</hi> and that both before and after. See now how unfair he was, to charge Friends there with assuming a Power to change the Meetings, when the Meetings were, by his own acknowledgment, <hi>to be changed in Course.</hi> And judge whether the Friends removing the Meeting from one House to the other, as it used in <hi>Course</hi> to be, either was an Act of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in them, or could be a just ground to <hi>G. K.</hi> and his Party, to separate from them. The other part of his Proof, that my saying the Meeting was changed in Course is False, and a Fiction, is, that <hi>T. L.</hi> put it to the vote, by giving a sign, whether it should be removed or not. But this is so far from being a Proof, that it self wants a Proof, and may be false and a Fiction, for ought appears: For he gives it but upon the credit of his own word.</p>

In my 32, and 33, pages, I shewed, that not the Friends, in removing the Meeting <hi>of Course;</hi> but he and his, in keeping a Meeting at the Bank <hi>out of Course,</hi> when the Meeting was <hi>in Course</hi> removed, made and begun the Separation. It had concerned him to have Answered this, and cleared himself of it (and so no doubt he would if he could) but he takes <hi>no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This is his Twelfth Charge. Now <hi>T. W</hi>'s. Evidence was, that, having asked <hi>G. K.

                  </gap> they that used that force towards me, were guilty of the Separation.</hi> But how proves he that any did use sorce, or intended to use force towards him? The Friends did not say so; <hi>T. Wilson</hi> did not say so: 'Twas only <hi>he himself</hi> said <hi>he believed</hi> they did it to force him to Meet with them. But his believing so (if he did really believe so) does not prove it was so. But if he did believe so, he was (as I observed in my former) the more to be blamed, in urging the removing of that Meeting as an Instance, or Proof, that the Friends began the Separation: For to separate themselves from him, and to force him to Meet with them, are <hi>contrary enough.</hi> But where's his Proof that I have perverted <hi>Tho.

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that <hi>by my Sentiment, Men must not instruct their Families, nor pray in their Families, without authority and appointment of the Mens Meeting, or if they do, they must let none other be present.</hi> All this is but empty noise raised artificially to amuse his Reader.

And because that Proposition did not take, (the Friends would not loose their Meeting so) he thereupon, when the Meeting was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Bank to the Centre, <hi>set up</hi> an Evening Meeting in his Family, which being done in a Spirit of contention, opposition and division, was the same in nature and ground with his other open separate Meetings. This he seemed to be sensible of himself, and therefore to obviate the Objection that he saw might be made, he said in his Reasons of the Separation, p. 15. <hi>That could be counted no Separate Meeting for that day.</hi> This led me to say, <q>As he gives no Account by <hi>whose appointment,</hi> or <hi>what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> that Meeting was held: So he offers no reason why it could not be accounted a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109396:25"/>
Separate Meeting;</q> nor do I think, indeed, that he can give any. For though M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>n may instruct their Families, and pray in their Families (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly moved thereunto) yet a private Meeting in a Family, set up in <hi>Opposition</hi> to publick Meetings, and in <hi>Disunion</hi> to Friends, is as really a Separate Meeting, as the openly Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Meetings are.</p>
            <p>He says, <hi>My Clamour about their Meeting at the</hi> Barbadoes-<hi>House, is idle and impertinent.</hi> So he is willing to turn off any thing that he cannot answer. But it's so pertinent, that it fastens the Separation upon him and his Party so close, that he cannot shake it off. He says, <hi>We met not there till they had separated themselves from us, and denied the Monthly Meeting.</hi> This is but a <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That the Friends, in removing the Meeting from the Bank to the Centre, did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themselves from him and his Party, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. That the Meeting which the Friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and whose Acts the Quarterly Meeting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to Record, was a rightly constituted Monthly Meeting, is denied. These are main Points, which he ought to have <hi>proved:</hi> But not being able to do that, he <hi>begs</hi> them; too meanly for him. But what can a Man do, though his Abilities be <hi>great,</hi> when his Cause is <hi>not good?</hi> He adds, <hi>Besides that, they not only threatned to keep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

out at the Bank Meeting: The highest he goes, is, that they were threatned to be kept out; and for the Truth of that, we have but his word. But it is a known Truth (which I suppose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is not ignorant of) that Friends in <hi>England</hi> have been actually kept out of their Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses by those Separatists, whom he is now fallen in with. As for what he says of being rudely abused, they must be <hi>rudely abusive</hi> indeed, that could exceed him that way.

He should have done well to have told how that Gallery of his came to be set up, and when.

when it was known, and known to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Consent of the Meeting, or of those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends who were the Trustees for the Meeting-house, two of the Trustees went in a peaceable manner, to take it down again: W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is confirmed by their Practice, which was pursuant to this their <hi>Intention.</hi> For as it was their declared <hi>Intention</hi> and Sense, (for I think their Intention went before their Sense) that it were good to have but one publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109396:27"/>
on First Days: So, when they found that Friends would not let fall their Afternoons Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he and his Party stuck to their own <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and withdrew from it, keeping but one pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meeting on that Day. As they had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their <hi>Intention</hi> and Sense, that the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Day should be used for private Meetings in Families: So when Friends would not change their publick for his private Family-meetings, he and his Party stuck to their own <hi>Intention,</hi> and held a private Family-meeting in his House. <hi>(Some of us met,</hi> says he, <hi>as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Family-meeting in the Evening, at the House of</hi> G.

And after all this, when he <hi>saw</hi> that private Family-meetings would not do; he with his Party, <hi>assumed a Power</hi> to set up, and did set up, a new publick Afternoons Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>(Their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>His Fifteenth Instance of my perverting his Words, that <hi>because he said, It was good to have but one publick Meeting on First Days, I</hi> (he says) <hi>thereby inferr'd that it was not good, according to his Sense, but evil, to have two publick Meetings on First Days, and that therefore to keep two was against</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:109396:27"/>
               <hi>his Conscience.</hi> I did not say against his <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but against his declared <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Sense.</hi> What that was I know: But what his Conscience is I don't know. But be it what it will, I think I made appear that in his setting up his After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons Meeting, in opposition to the Ancient Meeting of Friends, and <hi>contrary to his before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared Intention and Sense,</hi> he went not upon a sincere, godly, conscientious Ground, respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Honour of God, the Propagation of Truth, the Edification and Benefit of the Church: But a Political, Popular, worldly Ground, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting his own Reputation and Honour, that he, and they with him, might not be thought less Zealous, than the Friends they had separated from, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was fairly deduced from the reason he gave for his setting up that Meeting, viz. <hi>Their keeping up their publick Afternoons Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath given us just occasion at present to have a publick Afternoons Meeting as well as they, for we hope they shall not have cause to say against us, that we are short of them in our Zeal for good Meetings</hi> This, in the <hi>37th.</hi> page of my Epistle, I quoted out of his Reasons of the Separation, <hi>p.</hi> 16. and argued largely on it; which he has not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As indeed he seldom does any thing that is Argumentative; but catches at words, and quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles on them. Thus what I offered in <hi>p.</hi> 38. to shew, from his saying, That <hi>the Separation was well warranted both by Scripture-Testimony and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>That he took the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon himself, because it would be (as I there argued) an apparent Self-condemnation in him to say, the Friends had separated from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109396:28"/>
him, and that their so separating was well-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Scripture and Command of Christ.</q> This, I say, he skips lightly over; and catches at another Quotation I gave out of him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he charges me with Perversion and Forgery, but without cause.</p>
            <p>This he assigns for my Sixteenth Perversion, saying, That <hi>in labouring to cast the Separation on him, by writing some of his words, I leave out a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Clause in the Sentence that cleareth him; the whole Sentence being this, Now the Scriptures that warrant us in this Separation, (altho', as is said, first made by them) are these following,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The words [altho', as is said, first made by them] which</hi> (he says) <hi>clear him fully, that he did not take the Separation on him,</hi> he says, <hi>I fraudulently leave out.</hi> But in this he deals <hi>fraudulently</hi> with me, and with his Reader. For the Inference I made from those words of his, <hi>viz. [the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that warrant us in this Separation]</hi> was not so much designed to prove he <hi>began</hi> the Separation, as that <hi>he is in it.</hi> I had proved just before, from his saying, <hi>[This Separation was well-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted,</hi> &amp;c.] that he <hi>began it,</hi> or took it upon himself. And by his after words, I shew'd that <hi>he was in it.</hi> The Scriptures that warrant us (says he) in this Separation. There I stopt with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to shew that was not all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Then making my Inference thus, <hi>This is a sufficient Warrant sure to lay the Separation at his Door; for here is a plain acknowledgment that he is in it,</hi> I added (to have prevented this Cavil) <hi>tho' he Idly pretends that others began it.</hi> And this, I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109396:28"/>
think will shew that he idly charges this as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Forgery on me.</p>
            <p>In his Seventeenth, he quibbles on the words <hi>Separate</hi> and <hi>Separation,</hi> only to amuze and puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle his Reader. I had quoted another passage of his, to shew he had taken (though perhaps, unwittingly) the Separation upon him. It was this; <hi>We are convinced and perswaded in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, that God calleth us to separate from such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,</hi> (so he branded Friends there.) Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I said, <q>This sure is a full proof, not only that they are in the Separation, but that they began it: For if the Friends (whom he calls unbelievers) had first separated from them, then how could he say God called them to separate from the unbelievers, when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers (in his sense) had separated from them before.</q> And carrying on my Argument, I said, <q>A Separation from a Thing or Person, implies a being joyned to that Thing or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son before, and till such separation be made.</q> 
               <hi>G. K:</hi> Passing by my Arguments, catches hold on the word <hi>Separate;</hi> and plays upon it, and putting some cavilling Questions about it (not very difficult, but very impertinent, to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered) cries out <hi>I have shewed my great Ignorance</hi> (which is a sort of <hi>art</hi> he uses, to <hi>huff</hi> his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, and <hi>damp</hi> him, if he can) and at last, his great Knowledge brings the matter to this Issue, that <hi>the Word Separate hath several signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</hi> What then? Hath it not the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I used it in, <hi>(viz.</hi> an Implication that the things or Persons separated were first joyned)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109396:29"/>
Will he deny that the Word Separation implies a being joyned before? Nay: He grants it in the present Case; saying, <hi>It being granted that we were formerly joyned, with them, this doth not prove,</hi> &amp;c. So that what has all his <hi>quibbling</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word <hi>Separate,</hi> come to, but to shew a <hi>Disposition to Cavilling,</hi> and thereby to <hi>evade</hi> an Argument.</p>
            <p>He says, <hi>It being granted that we were formerly joined with them, this doth not prove that we begun the Separation.</hi> No sure! for this is sufficiently proved by other mediums. But what <hi>Trifling</hi> is it in him so to argue? <hi>But after it was made by them,</hi> says he, <hi>we were warranted and justified by the Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to remain separate from them.</hi> This is pitiful shuffling, by which he would wind himself off, from having taken the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon himself, when he said, <hi>This Separation is well warranted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Scriptures that warrant us in it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We are convinced and perswaded in our Consciences, that God calleth us to separate,</hi> &amp;c. But it will not help him. For to separate (in that sense especially, which is proper to this Subject) is <hi>to withdraw from.</hi> So a Separatist, in the common acceptation of the word, is one that hath <hi>withdrawn himself</hi> from the Society, Communion, or Fellowship of Others, whom he was joyned with before. But <hi>G. K.</hi> has found out a <hi>new</hi> way of Separation, and a <hi>new notion</hi> of the Word, whereby he would make them the Separatists that are withdrawn from, not them that withdrew. Had I argued thus, he would have paid me off, with his fine Terms of gross Ignorance, ridiculous Folly, and the like, which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109396:29"/>
he liberally bestows. But it is evident he is forwarder to Cavil and Rail, than to Answer an Argument: For after all his noise about the Word [Separate,] he leaves my Arguments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answered, p. 39. and 40. whereby I proved from his own Words, that he began the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And seeing he would over-look them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Ple set them before him again. From his having said (in his Reasons of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, p. 22.) <hi>We are convinced and perswaded in our Consciences, that God calleth us to separate from such Unbeilevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I argue thus. <q>If the Friends (whom he calls Unbelievers) had first Separated from them, then how could he say God had called them to Separate from the Unbelievers, when the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers (in his Sense) had Separated from them before. A Separation (said I, and I say it again) from a thing or Person, implies a being joyned to that thing or Person before, and till such Separation be made. But if the Friends there, had begun the Separation before, then they had thereby disjoyned themselves from <hi>G. K.</hi> and his Party; and <hi>G. K.</hi> and his Party could not have afterwards Separated from them; because they were not, then joyned to them; consequently it could not be, that God should call them to Separate from the others, if the others had Separated themselves from them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If therefore they are convinced and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded in their Consciences (as <hi>G. K.</hi> says they are) that God called them to Separate from these whom he calls unbeleivers, and that they answered that Call, they must then acknowledge
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109396:30"/>
that they began the Separation. And that they did so, his following words shew, <hi>p.</hi> 23. Where he says, <hi>We have great clearnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

K.</hi> and his Party reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, drew back, or withdrew, and Separated themselves; and that purposely with design to to Separate: For he adds (alittle after) <hi>Yet we design not any Separation from our faithful Brethren here, or elsewhere.</hi> A Separation then, it seems, they did design, though not from such as they account their faithful Brethren, <hi>

               </q> Thus in my former. And can he be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, to think he answers all this by saying. <hi>After the Separation was made by them, we were warrated and justified by the Scripture without, and the Spirit of Truth within, to romain Separate from them?</hi> Doth this answer his own terms, wherein he exprest himself before, when he said, <hi>We are convinced and perswaded in our Consciences, that God calleth us to separate</hi> (an Active Voice) <hi>from such unbelivers;</hi> when he said, <hi>We have great clearness and peace in the Lord</hi> (what to do? to rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>? No.) <hi>to retire and Separate from such,</hi> &amp;c. And how? <hi>As we have formerly done from other Professions.</hi> How was that?) Did other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions first Separate from them, and they remain in their old Meeting Places, which those other Professions had left, forsaken, retired, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from?

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109396:30"/>
from their Society, Fellowship and Meeting Places. Mark this well, Friends; If G.

Book, I observe he makes a great <hi>Noise</hi> and <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry</hi> of gross and vile Errors held by some, and them upheld by others, which he gives for one Reason or Cause of the Separation. But in as much as this is only his Charge without due proof, and the Persons, by him Charged with those vile Errors, are not here present, to make Answer to his Charge, and defend themselves, or to shew the Occasions that led to, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that attended those Discourses, from which he pick'd the words he charges them
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109396:31"/>
with, and to explain their meanings therein, I have not thought it fit, or becoming me, on no better ground, to meddle with those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, being alike unwilling to justifie them, if in any thing they have done or said amiss, as to condemn them unheard, upon the report of another, and him their professed Adversary.</q> Here I joyned together his <hi>twofold</hi> Outcry, that gross and vile Errors were held by some, and that they that held them were upheld by others, (which was the third and main Reason he assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Separation; and I said that this was without due Proof. This he says, <hi>is a Forgery,</hi> and that <hi>it is apparent from the Testimonies of those whom I pretend greatly to credit.</hi> The First he offers is, <hi>That Iudgment</hi> (which he says was) <hi>given out from the Meeting of Ministring Friends, as 'tis called, the fourth of the fourth Month:</hi> (in some Year: or other, I suppose; but he tells us not here in what:) That Judgment (he says) doth declare, <hi>that Proof was made by two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that</hi> W. S. <hi>should say, That</hi> George Keith<hi>'s. Preaching Christ without, and Christ within, was Preaching two Christs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I say, This is no <hi>due</hi> Proof, that <hi>W. S.</hi> was guilty of holding that vile Error <hi>G. K.</hi> charges him with, That to Preach <hi>Faith in Christ without, and Faith in Christ within,</hi> is to Preach <hi>two Christs.</hi> For the Terms are different. And although to Preach <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> without, and <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> within, is not to Preach two Christs: Yet <hi>G. K.</hi> might so Preach Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and Christ within, that it might seem like a Preaching of two Christs, for ought appears
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109396:31"/>
to the Contrary. And indeed, although <hi>G. K.</hi> brought two Witnesses to attest that <hi>W. S.</hi> did say (as <hi>G. K.</hi> here reports it) that <hi>G. K</hi>'s. Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Christ without, and Christ within, was Preaching two Christs; yet the credit of their Testimony is justly questionable, both as they were chief Men in <hi>G. K</hi>'s. Party, and as <hi>G. K.</hi> himself doth <hi>vary</hi> in his Charge against <hi>W. S.</hi> from their Testimony. For their Evidence (as he reports it from the Judgment of the Meeting) was expresly, <hi>That</hi> W. S. <hi>should say, That</hi> G. K<hi>'s. Preaching Christ without, and Christ within, was Preaching two Christs.</hi> But <hi>G. K.</hi> himself charges him with saying, <hi>Christ within and Christ without are two Christs,</hi> p. 3. And afterwards, in the same page, he alters the Charge again, alledging he said, <hi>To Preach Faith in Christ within, and Faith in Christ without, was to Preach two Christs,</hi> Plea of Innocent, Page 3. so again he reports it in Page 22. And in Page 23. he asks, <hi>Why do not the words of their Iudgment run thus, That</hi> W. S. <hi>did say, To Preach Faith in Christ without, and in Christ within, was to Preach two Christs?</hi> So that he would have had the words of their Judgment, to have run otherwise than the Words of his Witnesses Evidence did run; by which they that run may read how little regard he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had to his own Witnesses Evidence. And although that Meeting, proceeding upon that Evidence (such as it was) did blame <hi>W. S.</hi> for uttering those words, which those Witnesses did witness against him: Yet it is plain that <hi>W. S.</hi> was <hi>not guilty</hi> of holding that Error <hi>G. K.</hi> charges him with, That <hi>to Preach Christ without,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:109396:32"/>
               <hi>and Christ within, was to Preach two Christs,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he always denied that he spake those words; whereas if he had been guilty of such an Error in his Judgment, it may reasonably be supposed he would have owned the words charged upon him, and have laboured to <hi>maintain</hi> and defend <hi>his Error,</hi> that being the Common way of the Erroneous. But, if <hi>W. S.</hi> had been really guilty of holding such an Error, yet certainly that Man must be made up of Errors that can believe, the Judgment of that Meeting which condemned him for speaking (as the Witnesses attested) those words which are charged upon him as his Error, to be a due proof that that Meeting upheld him in that Error. And therefore hitherto it is no Forgery, nor fault, in me to say, <hi>G. K</hi>'s. great <hi>Outcry</hi> of gross and vile Errors, held by some, and then upheld by others, <hi>has not been duly proved.</hi> His Second Instance, that he hath proved his Charge <hi>(viz.</hi> That some are guilty of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gross and vile Errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And others of upholding them therein) is, That <hi>he stands Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded</hi> (as he says,) <hi>on the Monthly Meeting Book at</hi> Philadelphia, <hi>by the Monthly Meetings Iudgment given out against him, and clearing</hi> T. Fitzwater, <hi>the Twenty sixth of the third Month,</hi> (in what Year?) <hi>For accusing him that he denied the sufficiency of the Light; and the Evidence against him was, that he said he did not believe the Light was sufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out something else; whereby</hi> (says he) <hi>it is evident, they exclude Christ's manhood, Death and Sufferings, Blood and Intercession for them in Heaven; from having any part in our Salvation.</hi> This is far from being a Proof, either that that <hi>T. F.</hi> did exclude
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109396:32"/>
Christ's Manhood, Death and Sufferings, Blood and Intercession for us in Heaven, from having any part in our Salvation, or that the Meeting there upheld him in it. For it is but <hi>G. K</hi>'s. own Inference, and that unfairly drawn. <hi>T. F.</hi> it seems, charged <hi>G. K.</hi> with denying the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Light. <hi>G. K.</hi> put him to prove it. He proved by four Credible Witnesses, that <hi>G. K.</hi> said, <hi>He did not believe the Light was sufficient, without something else.</hi> What <hi>G. K.</hi> meant by that something else, I do not find was <hi>then</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained or discoursed. <hi>Afterwards,</hi> it seems, <hi>G. K.</hi> alledged, that by that something else, he meant Christ's Manhood, Sufferings, Death, Blood, Resurection, Ascension, Intercession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Did the Meeting condemn <hi>G. K.</hi> for this? I find no such thing. But because they did not at his Instigation, condemn <hi>T. F.</hi> for accusing <hi>G. K.</hi> falsly, in saying he denied the sufficiency of the Light (which he proved against him by four Witnesses,) therefore he flies out against both <hi>T. F.</hi> and the Meeting, charging them with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Man Christ Jesus, his Sufferings, Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from having any part in our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which was no Doctrine nor Tenet of theirs, but a false Inference of his own, and is as forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against himself, as it can be against them. For in his Reasons of the Separation, p. 8. he says, <hi>divers were present at the place and time where and when</hi> W—<hi>alledged he heard</hi> G. K. <hi>deny the sufficiency of the Light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that cleared him, that they heard him both then and at all occasions, that he delivered his mind on that subject, always bear Testimony to the Sufficiency of the Light to Salvation.</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:109396:33"/>
Here ye see, he makes his own Witnesses speak as fully and expresly of his Testimony to the sufficiency of the Light to Salvation, as <hi>T. F.</hi> or any other could do, and that <hi>without any express reserve</hi> for something else. So that if <hi>T. F</hi>'s. charging him with denying the sufficiency of the Light, simply and without Explication, doth exclude the Man Christ Jesus, his Sufferings, Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from having any part in our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>G. K</hi>'s. asserting the sufficiency of the Light to Salvation, simply and without explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as in the place before quoted he does) doth the same. And therefore <hi>G. K.</hi> is the more to be blamed, for casting so <hi>foul a slander</hi> upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which from his own words might with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Reason be cast upon himself. But, Friends, ye know we never did nor do, oppose the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Appearance of Christ in Man, to that <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Appearance of him in that prepared Body, wherein he obtained Redemption for Man; nor by asserting the sufficiency of the Light, do we exclude, or intend to exclude the Man Christ Jesus, his Sufferings, Death, Blood-shedding, Resurrection, Ascension, Intercession, nor any thing that he wrought on Earth for us, or now, by his Mediation with his Father, worketh for us in Heaven, from having a part our Salvation; And <hi>G. K.</hi> hath not yet proved that any in our society hath so done. His third Instance he gives to prove that he has proved his Charge <hi>(viz.</hi> That some are guilty of holding gross and vile Errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and others of upholding them therein) is, The Paper, called, A true Account of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the Yearly Meeting at <hi>Lond.</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:109396:33"/>
the second Month, 1694. <hi>which,</hi> he says, <hi>doth plainly declare, that some were guilty of Erroneous Doctrines, or unsound Expressions,</hi> their words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these following; <hi>And although it appears that some few Persons have given Offence, either through Erroneous Doctrines, unsound Expressions, or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Forwardness, want of Wisdom, and right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> &amp;c. This doth not declare what he says it doth plainly declare, Namely, that some <hi>were guilty</hi> of Erroneous or Unsound Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions: For it appears some few Persons have given offence, <hi>either</hi> through Erroneous Doctrine, unsound Expressions, <hi>or</hi> Weakness, Forwardness, want of Wisdom, and right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. So that, what Offence was given, might as well be through Weakness, forwardness, want of Wisdom, and right Understanding, as through Erroneous Doctrines or unfound Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. Nay, if it were through unsound Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions (though they are not to be excused, yet) that doth not prove a Man guilty of <hi>holding gross and vile Errors,</hi> &amp;c. For a Man that is <hi>sound in Iudgment,</hi> and Doctrine, may <hi>chance to drop</hi> an unsound Expression, through weakness, as some perhaps in <hi>America,</hi> through <hi>G. K</hi>'s. catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Questions, may have been drawn to do, whose <hi>weakness</hi> for him to expose in Print, in that aggravating manner as he has done, to the reproach of the whole Profession, is very great <hi>Wickedness</hi> in him, and for which <hi>his Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from God <hi>slumbers not.</hi> His last Instance is, that <hi>He produced above six Manuscripts,</hi> (What means he by <hi>above six?</hi> Does he mean six and a half? For if they had been Seven
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109396:34"/>
or Eight, he might as well have said so, as above six;) <hi>signed with the Persons own hands, that were read at the Yearly Meeting, that proved them suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently guilty of vile Errors, &amp;c.</hi> He being a <hi>Party</hi> is not a competent <hi>Iudge,</hi> what is <hi>sufficient</hi> Proof in this Case. That some <hi>Manuscripts</hi> were read in the Yearly Meeting by him, or on his Part, I remember; how many they were, or whether signed by the Persons own hands, I know not. But, supposing (not granting) those <hi>Manuscripts</hi> to be either <hi>Autographs,</hi> or <hi>Authentick</hi> Copies, I believe he himself would think much, to be concluded and condemned from <hi>Inferences,</hi> or <hi>Constructions</hi> made upon <hi>Manuscripts</hi> (especially if they be private Letters, as I think some of those he had read, were) without his being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and having the liberty to <hi>open</hi> and <hi>explain</hi> his <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> in any Passage, Word, or sentence in them. Having gone through his Proofs, (which, I think, I have shewed amount to no Proof) he <hi>threatens, if I or any others persist to charge him, that he has wrongfully charged them in</hi> Pensilvania, <hi>these Manuscripts then read, with some others, may be made publick for his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clearing.</hi> For my part, I am of Opinion, that his publishing those Manuscripts, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens us with, will be so far from clearing him, that it will make his <hi>guilt</hi> appear the more clearly; and I am perswaded that is the chief (if not only) Reason, why he has not published them all this while.</p>

His Nineteenth taxes me <hi>with Fallacy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, in covering</hi> W. Southbe, <hi>by concealing those Words in his Letter, where he confesseth, that he called it doubtful Questions, whether the Patriarchs have received the Resurrection?</hi> This is a very <hi>Idle Cavil;</hi> yet serves to shew what sort of Questions he used to put, to draw some simple plain Friends to drop such Expressions as he might <hi>pick</hi> some advantage out of against them: And this may be one, of many Instances that might be given, <hi>of his picking words from their Discourses,</hi> to Charge them with; which, in his last Head, he Charged me with <hi>Forgery,</hi> for but mentioning. But if <hi>W. Southbe,</hi> did account that a doubtful Question, is that any more than he himself does? What means he, when (enumerating many Doctrines, which he says we hold in common with other Professions, <hi>Causeless Ground, p.</hi> 4.) he says, <hi>The deceased Saints have not yet</hi> (generally) <hi>received the Resurrection of the Body,</hi> &amp;c. Why <hi>generally,</hi> if he did not either think some had, or doubt whether they had or no? Must <hi>W. Southbe</hi> be Unchristianed, rendred guilty of holding gross and vile Errors, Damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and Doctrines of Devils; for only calling it a <hi>doubtful</hi> Question, whether the Patriarchs have received the Resurrection; and that by him, who seems himself to doubt it, either of them, or some other deceased Saints? For his saying, the deceased Saints have not yet <hi>(generally)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Resurrection, implies, he thinks some have. But that <hi>W. Southbe</hi> does believe a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Day of Judgment, and the Resurrection of the Dead at that Day, I shewed before from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109396:35"/>
his own Letter, where having set forth <hi>G. K</hi>'s Charge against him, that he denied any general Day of Judgment, and the Resurrection of the Dead; but only what every one Witnesseth within here, he Solemnly <hi>denies the Charge,</hi> calls that Doctrine <hi>Damnable</hi> and Athiestical, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that <hi>he believes the Resurrection according to the Scriptures,</hi> and the Antient Doctrine of Friends concerning it; which was enough, one would think, to satisfy a wise Man (one espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that pretended to be of the same Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:) and <hi>Paul</hi> himself could not satisfy the <hi>Fool</hi> about the Resurrection. <hi>G. K.</hi> says, <hi>T. E.</hi>'s <hi>Fallacy is the more manifest, that in</hi> W. Southbe's <hi>Confession of Faith, recited by him, there is not one word concerning the resurrection of the Dead, nor of Christ's coming without us, to Iudge the Quick and the Dead,</hi> &amp;c. As to the Resurrection he had spoken largely of it, in the same Letter, before, which I suppose to be the reason, why he did not repeat it expresly by that Name after: Yet in that Declaration of his Faith, having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Christ's Ascension into Heaven, and his Sitting at the Right hand of the Majesty on High, he adds, <hi>And that every one must appear before his Iudgment-Seat, to receive their Reward, according to their Deeds done in this Mortal Body, even at that great and dreadful Day of a general Account,</hi> &amp;c. G. K. quarrels further with <hi>W. Southbe</hi> for saying he doth not own the day of Judgment now, in or after the same manner, as he did when he was a Papist; for then he owned it <hi>very Carnally</hi> and outward, <hi>viz. That the great Iudgment should be in an outward valley called</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:109396:35"/>
               <hi>the valley of Iehosaphat, in the Land of Israel, and and that we should see with these outward Eyes;</hi> But (says he) I believe now it will be <hi>more Spiritual.</hi> This doth not please G. K. who catching hold of his words, that <hi>when a Papist, he owned it very carnally and outward,</hi> he would slily suggest from thence, as if his Belief of it was worse now, than when he was a Papist. Perhaps indeed, his Belief of it when a Papist might best fit G. K's. notion of it, who (I have heard) did jump in with the Papists, in pitching upon the Valley of Jehosaphat for the Place, till a Traveller telling him that Place was too Streight, he took wing from the <hi>Valley</hi> into the <hi>Air.</hi> But I see no cause G. K. hath to condemn <hi>W. Southbe,</hi> for belive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it will be <hi>more Spiritual</hi> than the Papist hold; nor to infer from thence, that it will <hi>not be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> since doubtless it may be <hi>more</hi> Spiritual than the Papists hold, and yet be <hi>outward also.</hi> But I had best have a care how I meddle too far in this matter, lest G. K. put me into <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> also, and bring me upon <hi>Examination</hi> again, which if he should, I am like enough to answer him, that I believe in this, as in other Divine things, <hi>according to the holy Scriptures;</hi> and that I doubt would anger him afresh.</p>
            <p>For he makes it the Ground of his Twentieth Perversion, that I clear <hi>T. L. A. C. S. I.</hi> and <hi>I. D.</hi> by Printing part of a Paper, Subscribed by them, on behalf of themselves, and many others, and directed to him and others, wherein they say, <q>As to Unity in Doctrine, so much seemingly profest by you, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109396:36"/>
of many unwary People, we hereby sincerely Declare, that we are herein one with our Antient and Faithful Brethren, firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what is upon Record in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, concerning God, concerning our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, both with Respect to his appearance in the Flesh, and to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Spirit, concerning the Holy Ghost, the Resurrection-State, and Eternal Judgment, which, though offered unto you, to the same purpose, and that several times; yet was rejected, as insufficient by you.</q> And so, it seems, it is now too. For he objects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, First, that it is <hi>two short,</hi> as being but about <hi>Eleven Lines:</hi> So that it seems, <hi>a multitude of words</hi> would have pleased him better. But I thought, in things of this Nature Especially, he would have regarded <hi>weight,</hi> rather than <hi>Number</hi> of words. And as few Lines as this is contained in, I know not whether that called <hi>The Apostles Creed</hi> be much longer. He thinks much to be put off with <hi>Eleven Lines</hi> of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith: And I do not think <hi>Eleven Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes</hi> would satisfy him, unless they were of his own writing. But he that shall heedfully read these <hi>Eleven Lines,</hi> shall find they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>Principal</hi> Doctrines, about which he pretended to be dissatisfied. But it is not the <hi>Brevity</hi> only that troubles him. He is offended that they say, they <hi>Firmly believe what is upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Holy Scriptures.</hi> At this he <hi>huffs,</hi> saying, <hi>so will every Papist say, every Socinian say, and every Mugletonian; for it is a common Fallacy, that the Vilest of Hereticks use, whereby to deceive</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:109396:36"/>
               <hi>People, to tell them they Firmly believe all that is Recorded in the Holy Scriptures concerning God, Christ,</hi> &amp;c. I know not whether <hi>Tertullus,</hi> who accused <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Felix</hi> (Acts 24.) were <hi>a greater Orator</hi> than G. K. but I am perswaded he was <hi>not so great a Sophister,</hi> nor so void of common Charity. Neither would the Apostle have gon off as he did, had G. K. been then, and in <hi>Tertullus</hi> his place, when <hi>Paul</hi> said He <hi>believed all things that were written in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> ver. 14. G. K. asks, <hi>why have the People called Quakers, Separated from the several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of Christianity, upon the account of Errors in Doctrine, which they did charge them with, seeing all these Professions in general terms say as much as we, that they Firmly believe what is upon Record in the Holy Scriptures?</hi> I answer, First, That the People called Quakers did Separate from other Professions, <hi>not only</hi> because of the Errors in Doctrine which they charged them with, <hi>but also</hi> because those Professions in general, were departed from the Power and Life of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and withstood and denied the Inward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Christ in his People. And Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, As far as they did separate on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Doctrines, it was because they found those Doctrines, even as those Professions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had stated them, to be <hi>not according,</hi> but <hi>contrary to</hi> what was upon record in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>He says, <hi>VVe have often told</hi> T. L. &amp;c. <hi>Let them condemn those gross and vile Errors, which we have proved some of them guilty of, and others cloak and excuse them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that shall satisfie us in</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:109396:37"/>
               <hi>this point.</hi> But have not <hi>T. L.</hi> and Friends, often, if not as often, told him, that <hi>he has not proved them guilty</hi> of those gross and vile Eerrors he talks of, nor others of cloaking and excusing them? And yet he will not be satisfied; of which more in his next Perversion.</p>
            <p>He says, <hi>Many hold, to my certain knowledge, That the Resurrection is the New Birth, and nothing else: Others say, Immediately after Death we get the Resurrection fully.</hi> If by <hi>many</hi> that hold thus, he means many of the People called Quakers, I neither own nor know any that hold such Doctrines.</p>
            <p>So also his other saying, viz. <hi>This gross and vile Error, That Christ is not to come without us, in his glorified Body to judge all mankind, I find too many in</hi> England <hi>guilty of;</hi> I esteem as a vile slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; if, by many, he intend many of the People called Quakers. And his suggesting, <hi>that too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they have drunk it in from some unsound Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in some of the printed Books too generally owned by them,</hi> discovers in him an unsound and evil mind: And speaks his inclination to quarrel with Friends in <hi>England,</hi> as well as he has already done in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Twenty First Charge against me is, Of <hi>Perversion</hi> and <hi>Fallacy,</hi> in <hi>covering these Men,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their saying in their Papers, <hi>If any of us, or any countenanced by us have given you any Offence, either by any unsound Expressions, or by any ungospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Conversation, and the same be made to appear by credible Testimonies, We promise unto you, that if the Parties concerned do not condemn the same,</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:109396:37"/>
               <hi>they shall be disowned therein.</hi> To this fair offer he says, <hi>What more credible VVitnesses could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, than the several Manuscripts signed with their own hands, whom they have owned,</hi> &amp;c? But I ask him, Did he upon this Offer, complain to those Friends who made it, of any of them, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by them, that had used unsound Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions? Did he produce the Manuscripts he mentions, as Witnesses against those that Writ them? Did the Monthly Meeting to which the Parties belonged refuse to hear his Complaint? Did they reject his Manuscript Evidences? If he did, upon this offer, make such Complaint, if he did produce his Manuscripts in Evidence, let him make appear when, where, at what Monthly Meeting he did this. But if he did not this, what he says now of it is but <hi>Fallacy</hi> and <hi>Deceit.</hi> Nor do I think it proper to take notice of what he now mentions out of his Manuscripts, because I do not think it safe to take it upon his Report.</p>
            <p>His Twenty Second, He calls my Perversion of his words, which were <hi>That</hi> (after the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was actually begun, and he and his Party met apart from Friends) <hi>he went to the Friends Meeting, and did there declare, that He and his Friends had Unity with the most there as to the main.</hi> 
               <q>From whence I inferr'd, If there had been such gross, vile and unchristian Errors, against the Fundamental Doctrines of the Christian Faith, such damnable Heresies, and Doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vlls, held amongst them, as he suggests, and cloaked, or covered, and tolerated by them,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109396:38"/>
How could he say that he and his Friends had Unity with the most there, as to the Main?</q> This he would shift off, by alledging, That <hi>more than two thirds of that Meeting were Country Friends, who were come to that Meeting upon notice that</hi> J. Dickinson <hi>was to be there, and that there had not been any Breach between those Country Friends and him at that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is a <hi>meer Fallacy.</hi> For it was not with respect to those Country Friends, that he said he had Unity with the most there; but with respect to the Friends of that Meeting: For he says, he also <hi>signified his desire to be United to that Meeting;</hi> not to the Friends of other Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Country (for with them, he says, he had had no Breach) but <hi>to that</hi> Meeting.</p>
            <p>And his connecting his Desire to be united <hi>to that</hi> Meeting, with his Declaration, that he and his Friends had Unity with the most <hi>there,</hi> restrains his declared Unity to the Friends <hi>of that</hi> Meeting; and that Unity being declared to be as <hi>to the main,</hi> (that is in the main and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrines of Christianity,) his separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from that whole Society, or Meeting of Friends, with the <hi>most</hi> of whom he declared he had Unity <hi>in the Main,</hi> even after he had sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them, is a Fault he can never justifie, nor excuse, by all the Fallacies he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>

as he would; and <hi>G. K</hi>'s. blaming them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed his Books here, not for reprinting them, but only for altering their Titles, he passes over in silence, and Cavils at my shewing his Deceit in the use of the word <hi>many</hi> (in his Causeless Ground, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>From hence I inferr'd, <q>He will not allow it (it seems) to the People called Quakers, or to the Body of Friends, as a People, no not so much as from a charitable Perswasion.</q> And how insincere he was, in pretending to allow it to very many of that People, I shewed by his following words, which were, <hi>Having an experimental Proof, through intimate Conversation, and frequent verbal Communication with many of them, that they are sincere in the Christian Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From whence I shew'd, <q>To what a narrow scantling he had reduced his application of the name Christian among the Quakers, and how few he meant by <hi>very many;</hi> even just so many as he hath an experimental Proof of, through intimate Conversation, and frequent verbal Communication with them, which how many they may be, judge ye (said I) considering how short a time he had then been in <hi>England,</hi> and in that time scarce or little out of <hi>London,</hi> nor very conversant with Friends there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This he calls (as he doth most things) a gross Forgery and Perversion; and says, <hi>I did really mean not them only, but all them, whom I have at</hi>

For as his <hi>Charitable Perswasion</hi> is grounded on his <hi>Experimental Proof,</hi> and that <hi>Proof</hi> drawn from <hi>intimate Conversation,</hi> and frequent <hi>verbal Communication:</hi> So that intimate Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and frequent verbal Communication is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, by his own Words, to the time since he came last into <hi>England.</hi> For it is all in the <hi>Present Tense,</hi> none in the Preterit; <hi>Having</hi> (not having had, but now having) <hi>an Experimental Proof through intimate Conversation, and frequent verbal Communication, with many of them, that they are</hi> (not that they have been formerly, many Years ago, when I was in <hi>England</hi> before; but that they now are) <hi>sincere in the Christian Faith, and whose Life and Conversation doth seal</hi> (not hath sealed) <hi>unto the sincerity of their Christian Profession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this, Friends, ye may see that I neither forged, nor Perverted his Words: But that he hath now put a false meaning upon his Words, which they will not bear. And that by <hi>very many,</hi> he meant <hi>those only</hi> that cleave to, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him, may be gathered from the <hi>boast</hi> he makes at the Entrance of his <hi>Loving Epistle</hi> (as he calls it) of the <hi>considerable</hi> Number he hath <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> are in Unity with him.</p>

He calls it a Perversion of his words, that when (in contradiction to the Advice of the Yearly Meeting, that he should call in his Books, or at least publish something innocently and effectually, to clear the Body of the People called Quakers, and their Ministers, from those gross Errors charged on some few in <hi>America)</hi> he denied that he had charged the People called Quakers, either in general, or in the plurality; I said, I had not found in his last Book, that he had cleared, or attempted to clear, the People called Quakers, there in general, or in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; and that he was scarce willing to allow the Name Christian to any more of them, than he had had experimental proof of, through inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Conversation and frequent verbal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this he says I pervert his words, and yet labours to justifie himself, for not allowing the Name Christian to the People called Quakers, from an Epistle of <hi>G.

For, says he, <hi>Nothing can be said against my printed Books, in reference to my publick witnessing against the Errors in Principles, whereof some are guilty in</hi> Pensylvania, <hi>and elsewhere, but what may be as much said against</hi> G.

He would seem here to be very Zealous for the Yearly Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> and arraigns me for gross Perversion and Reflection on the Yearly Meeting: And yet before he passeth from this Head; he kicks the Yearly Meeting out of Doors, and disowns it to be a Yearly Meeting, or any duly constituted Meeting at all. <hi>Nor can it be said,</hi> (says he, p. 27.) <hi>that that called the Yearly Meeting, was a free Meeting, for it was too private, and limited to too small a number,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore it cannot be owned to be the Yearly Meeting, nor any Meeting duly and regularly constituted,</hi> &amp;c. Ye see now, Friends, whither he is run, and to what a pass he is come; having <hi>outrun,</hi> in this, (so far as I remember) all the Apostates that have gone before him. He disowns it to be a Yearly Meeting, or any Meeting at all duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted; and yet takes upon him to impeach me of Perversion and Reflection on the Yearly Meeting. Is not this <hi>gross Hypocrisie</hi> in him?</p>
            <p>The Perversion and Reflection he charges me with, is my saying, <q>(Supposing it were true in Fact, that no Untruth or Falshood in matter of Fact, had been discovered in his Books) it was not the proper business of the Yearly Meeting to judge of the matters of Fact, contained in his Books, which were alledged to have been done in <hi>America,</hi> by Persons not here to answer to, or give account of them. And that none should think, that because the Yearly Meeting
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:109396:41"/>
did not declare the matters of Fact in his Books to be false, therefore they are all true. They remain, said I, to be proved by him that has affirmed them, and to be answered by them who are charged therein.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, though I suppose I have said enough to this matter, in the former part of this Book, in Answer to his <hi>Loving Epistle</hi> (as he calls it) to satisfie any reasonable Person. Yet because he repeats it here, I will not stick to take notice of it again. From my last Cited words, he notes, that I <hi>grant the Yearly Meeting did not declare the matter of Fact in his Books to be false; and seeing</hi> (as he says) <hi>for matter of Doctrine they did not blame him, and yet he is blamed, he thinks I cast an unparalleled instance of Injustice on the Yearly Meeting, to blame him for things in his Book, that are neither matter of Doctrine, nor matter of Fact.</hi> In this he is very fallacious, playing upon the Words <hi>[Matters of Fact.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Books contain many particular Matters, alledged by him to have been said or done, by many particular Persons in <hi>America,</hi> who were not at the Yearly Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> to Answer to, or give an Account of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These</hi> Matters of Fact, I said, it was not the proper business of the Yearly Meeting to judge of; (so were my words expresly, Epistle p. 49. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>It was not the proper business of the Yearly Meeting, to judge of the Matters of Fact, contained in his Books, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have been done in <hi>America,</hi> by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not here to answer to, or give account of them.)</q>

And to <hi>these</hi> Matters of Fact I referr'd, when I added, p. 50. <q>Therefore let none think that because the Yearly Meeting did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Matters of Fact in his Books to be false, therefore they are all true. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be proved (said I) by him that has affirmed them; and to be answered by them who are charged therein.</q>

Now, (besides that his Argument is faulty and naught, the Terms in his Consequence not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the Terms in his premises) his way or manner of arguing here is meerly Sophistical, and grounded upon a false Position; That I say, the Yearly Meeting hath not declared <hi>[This]</hi> to be false, <hi>(This, viz.</hi> His clearing himself of the blame of the Separation) whereas I never said so; and his saying I have said so, is that in him, which he would have called gross Perversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if not Forgery in me.

            <p>Nor will his other shift stand him in any stead, to acquit him from being the <hi>culpable</hi> Cause of the Separation; which he endeavours to draw from those words in the Yearly Meetings Paper, <hi>viz.

            <p>He says, The Paper called, <hi>A true Account of the Proceedings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>doth own them of the other side to be guilty of unsound and Erroneous Doctrines.</hi> How false and unfair he is in this, the words of that Paper shall shew, which are these; <hi>And although it appears that some few Persons have given Offence, either through Erroneous Doctrines, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound Expressions, or Weakness, Forwardness, want of Wisdom and right Understanding;</hi> yet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Here ye see, Friends, that that Paper of the Yearly Meeting is so far from owning them of the other side as he calls them (that is, the Friends in <hi>America)</hi> to be guilty of unsound and Erroneous Doctrines (which <hi>G.

            <p>This looks the worse in him, in as much as he, who here says, the Yearly Meeting owns them of the other side to be guilty of Unsound and Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Doctrines, doth (in his causeless ground of surmises, p. 5.) secretly smite at that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for <hi>lessening</hi> and <hi>extennating</hi> such gross and

vile Errors with the <hi>smooth name of Weakness.</hi> So that when his Blow is at the Yearly Meeting, he supposes them <hi>not to own</hi> the Friends guilty of Erroneous Doctrines, but of Weakness only: But when he strikes at the Friends in <hi>America,</hi> he affirms the Meeting <hi>doth own</hi> them guilty of Erroneous Doctrines: Thus, <hi>Ambodexter-</hi>like, he <hi>plays with both hands,</hi> as he apprehends it will make for his advantage.</p>
            <p>Now this feigned Proof of his, being taken away, his Argument falls; and his supposing the Original ground and Cause of the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to be the Unsoundand Erroneous Doctrines held by them of the other side, is but a vain Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Question.

28. His next Cavil, which he calls Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Fallacy in me, is, <hi>that I seem to own the Doctrine in his Book, and yet altogether wave the chief thing of Doctrin, wherein the Controversie,</hi> he says, <hi>lieth betwixt them of the other side and him, and as he judges betwixt him and me,</hi> viz. <hi>That the faith of Christ, as he died for our Sins, and rose again; is necessary to our Christianity and Salvation; that God doth justifie us, and pardon our Sins for Christ's sake, who died for us; through our Faith in him, that is always accompanied with sincere Repentance.</hi> In this he hath judged wrong; for I have no Controversie with him about this Doctrine, which I own as well as he. And if he had not had a <hi>wilfully bad</hi> memory, he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that himself hath cited a Passage out of a former Book of mine, <hi>(Foundation of Tythes shaken,</hi> p. 240.) where I say, <q>If any one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects Remission of Sins by any other way than the Death of Christ, he renders the Death of Christ us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ss.</q> This Passage which I then ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against the Priest, on behalf of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, clears me now from <hi>G. K</hi>'s. groundless suggestion. His Cavil at me now is, for not reciting the fore-mentioned Doctrine (of the Faith of Christ, as he died for our Sins, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> when I recited other Doctrines out of his Book; and he takes advantage thence to call <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>is <hi>the chief Doctrine in Controversie</hi> betwixt him and them of the other side. By this I perceive I must either quote <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> out of his Books, if I mean to escape his Censure; for I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded had I recited this, and omitted any other of the Doctrines he mentioned, that Doctrine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109396:46"/>
should then have been singled out for the <hi>chief</hi> Doctrine in Controversie betwixt him and them, whatever it had been. The truth is, I omitted to recite that, as not understanding he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted that a Doctrine in Controversie between him and them. And therefore I chose to recite those Doctrines about which I apprehended he had made the greatest Clamour. He would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his own, and others Jealousie concerning me, <hi>by noticing, that I joyn not</hi> (as he says) <hi>the works of Sanctification in the Heart, to Christ's out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance, but to his inward Appearance.</hi> This he labours to shew, from several Passages in my Epistle, which mention Christ's inward Appearance, and work of Sanctification in the Heart: To all which, I give this short and plain Answer; I do not <hi>divide</hi> Christ, nor set his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance in opposition to his outward. And therefore when I speak of Christ's inward Appearance in the Heart, and the work of Sanctification wrought there, I do not <hi>exclude,</hi> nor intend to exclude, his outward Appearance in the Flesh, and what he did and suffered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for Man's Redemption, from being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Sanctification, through a living Faith in him. But I do not allow, that the work of Sanctification is wrought in any, by that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance of Christ in the Flesh, in whom his inward Appearance, by his Light, Grace and Spirit in the Heart, is not known, received and subjected unto. And it is this inward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Christ, that gives Man a right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, and saving faith of the outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Christ.</p>

29. His next is no less a Charge against me, than that of <hi>gross and bold Fiction and Forgery,</hi> in saying, <q>Whatever Jealousies and Dissatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions any of other Professions had entertained against us on this account before, they had no ground or occasion given them therefore; whereas now he has given them occasion, though unjustly, and without cause, to entertain wrong jealousies of us.</q> This he says is <hi>false in both parts:</hi> 1. <hi>That other Professions had no ground of Dissatisfaction given them, touching these Doctrines, before his Books came forth; for they had</hi> (he says) <hi>but too much ground from too many unsound Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions contained in their Books;</hi> (In whose Books? he must needs mean the Books of Friends; and why not in his own Books, as likely as in any others?) <hi>and which,</hi> says he, <hi>some of that Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion hath objected unto me.</hi> That Profession, what Profession? We spake of other Professions in <hi>general,</hi> not of any one Profession in <hi>particular.</hi> But whatever Profession it was that objected, or whatever were the Expressions objected against, they were <hi>such,</hi> he says, <hi>as he could not answer, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than to acknowledge them to be unsound.</hi> If this be true, I am perswaded it was since he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self came to be unsound. And this Passage of his puts me in mind of that filthy Libel, lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished with the Letters <hi>D. S.</hi> to it, in which I thought I trackt the <hi>print of his Foot.</hi> 2. He says, <hi>it is false that he has now given them occasion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain wrong Iealousies of us.</hi> But in this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts Experience, and the several Pamphlets that some of other Professions, <hi>grafting on his Crab-stock,</hi> have either reprinted of his, or print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109396:47"/>
of their own, grounded on his, against us, prove what I said to be true. His saying, <hi>That it is clear, as the Light of the Noon Day, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons among us, are chargeable with erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Doctrines,</hi> is without Proof. And if when he says, It is clear, he means <hi>by his Books,</hi> it is so far from being clear as the Light of the <hi>Noon Day,</hi> that it is not near so clear as <hi>Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="30">30. He quarrels with me for construing his Words, <hi>That the Doctrine of Christ crucified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was buried in silence, as if he understood it generally and universally; whereas</hi> (he says) <hi>his Words have a Restriction and Limitation very expresly; for</hi> (says he, <hi>I do not say buried in silence by all or most part, or opposed by all, or most part; but buried in silence by some, and opposed by others.</hi> So I cited his Words before, and thereupon put the Question, <q>What saving is here, what Exception made, either of the Quakers in general, or in the Plurality, or indeed of any at all?</q> Buried by some, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by others, will hardly pass for a <hi>very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi> Restriction and Limitation. Nay, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to common manner of speaking, some, and others, may be taken to comprehend all in this case; especially, when we shall consider, that he represents these Doctrines as Dead, let fall, extinct; which (as I noted before, though he takes no notice of it) is implied by his Words <hi>[to revive and raise up].</hi> Nor does his <hi>later</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention help him, to wit, that <hi>he did chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this, with respect to those parts of</hi> America <hi>where the Controversie began;</hi> for his Word <hi>[Chiefly]</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:109396:48"/>
shews he did intend it <hi>elsewhere</hi> besides <hi>America.</hi> And he now says, <hi>he finds it buried with too many hereaway in</hi> England, <hi>as well as in</hi> America: Nay, <hi>he can conclude no other,</hi> he says, <hi>concerning me.</hi> But the best on't is, I am not to be concluded by his Conclusions.</p>
            <p n="31">31. His One and Thirtieth is worded non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensically: But that which I gather to be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it is, that my saying, <hi>The Servant is not to frame his Message himself, but to deliver the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage his Lord gives him to deliver;</hi> (which was said to answer, or rather obviate an Objection, That those Doctrines relating the Birth; Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, Ascension, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Christ, as to the outward Body, are not so frequently or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly declared in our publick Meetings, as those that relate to the inward Appearance and work of Christ in the heart.) He says, <hi>imports, that the Lord doth not call his Servants so frequently to preach the Faith of Christ without, as of Christ within; and this,</hi> he saith, <hi>proveth, that in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of</hi> T. E. <hi>the Doctrine and Faith of Christ without, is not so necessary to Regeneration, as the Faith of Christ within, or rather not at all absolutely necessary.</hi> This is a <hi>grosser Perversion,</hi> on his part of my Words, than any he can charge on me; for the Reason I gave for this, was, not that it was <hi>less necessary,</hi> but that it was <hi>more known.</hi> Therefore I said, <hi>p.</hi> 55. <q>When it pleased God to raise up, and send forth a true Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was agreeable to the Divine Wisdom, to bring to light that which had been <hi>hidden,</hi> to restore to the Nations that which had
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109396:48"/>
been <hi>lost,</hi> to turn People to that which they had been <hi>turned from,</hi> to instruct them in that which they were most <hi>ignorant of,</hi> &amp;c. Hence (said I,) I conceive it hath come to pass, that they whom the Lord have sent forth to preach the everlasting Gospel in this Day, have been led and guided by him, to teach People that which they knew not, rather than that which they profest to know before; to open those Doctrines of Life and Salvation, which the People were ignorant of, and Strangers to, rather than those which they were acquainted with, and had been all along trained up in.</q> From all which it is very apparent, that I did not deny the Doctrine and Faith of Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, to be necessary to our Regeneration, as well as that of Christ within; but that that without was <hi>more</hi> known <hi>already</hi> to the People, than that within.</p>
            <p n="32">32. He quarrels with me for saying, That <hi>though, as the Apostasy from the life and power of Christianity gained place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the inward Appearance of Christ by his Spirit in the Heart, was departed from, and the Doctrines thereof generally lost and forgotten: Yet the Doctrines relating to the outward Appearance of Christ in the Flesh, and what he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did, and suffered for Man's Redemption, were not lost, but retained and preached through all Ages, and by every sort or sect of professed Christians; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that</hi> G. K. <hi>now calls those Doctrines which he pretends to be raised up to revive and raise up, such Doctrines as are held in common by us with all other Professions.</hi> This angers him so, that I have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:109396:49"/>
scarce found him more fretful in any part of his Book than here: From whence I conclude he finds himself pincht, and would supply his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and want of Argument, with noise and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry words. He calls it <hi>Fallacy, Perversion, Feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Threadbare Excuse, Fig-leaf that cannot cover, deceitful Excuse, frivolous Excuse,</hi> &amp;c. His Answer is, <hi>The true Doctrin of the Faith of Christ without, as he came in the Flesh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was as much lost in the time of the Apostasy, as the true Doctrine of the Faith of Christ within;</hi> to wit, <hi>not the bare histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical literal faith of Christ, that I confess was not lost; but the true living Faith, and the Doctrine of it, was as much lost, as that of his inward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he <hi>varies the Terms</hi> from the Doctrines relating to the outward Appearance of Christ, (which was the subject we were upon,) to the true living Faith, and the Doctrine of it, (which was not the Subject we were upon.) And to prove his Charge against me, of Fallacy, Perversion, Feigning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He alledges that the true living Faith, and the Doctrine of it, was lost in the Apostasy; which it might be, and yet the Doctrines relating to the outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Christ in the Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might not be lost, as I asserted they were not. This shifting the Terms, is a Fallacy and Perversion in him, and seems to be done with design to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self off from what he was upon. But he cannot so escape, he has hampered himself too fast to get off: For in his Causeless Ground, <hi>p.</hi> 3. this very Doctrine of the Faith of Christ without, viz. <hi>That the Faith of Christ, as he died for our</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:109396:49"/>
               <hi>Sins, and rose again, is necessary to our Christianity and Salvation, and that God doth justify us, and pardon our Sins for Christ's sake, who died for us, through faith in him, that is always accompanied with sincere Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. This I say, (which he now says, was as much lost as the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Faith of Christ within,) is there set by <hi>G. K.</hi> amongst the many great Doctrines of the Christian Faith, (and the first of them,) which he says <hi>we hold in common with all sorts of other Professions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this Doctrine of the Faith of Christ without was <hi>lost,</hi> as he says it was, how comes it that all sorts of other Professions have it, and hold it <hi>in common</hi> with him, as he says they do? If he and they hold <hi>it in common,</hi> they must hold it as he doth. And that he holds they do so, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his saying, <hi>Many of all sorts that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent our Meetings, of other Professions, are well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with our Testimony, to the inward Appearance of God in Christ, together with the Holy Spirit in Mens Hearts, while they find us warm and zealous in our Testimony to the other great Doctrines of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, held in common with them.</hi> Of which, in the next Line, he gives this Doctrine of the Faith of Christ without, for the first instance, as I have cited it before. But if all sorts of other Professions hold it, and hold it as he doth, (which they must, if he hold it in common with them,) how can he say (and say truly,) that it hath been <hi>as much lost</hi> in the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasy, as the true Doctrine of the Faith of Christ within?

in common by him, with them of all sorts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Professions.</p>

            <p>His 33d, 34th, 35th Charges, relate all to one matter, and seem to be divided and subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by him, to make the <hi>greater shew.</hi> The first he calls <hi>a Perversion of his modest Proposition, about correcting some unsound Words in some Friends Books, as if with purpose he would hunt for, discover and expose, if he can, the nakedness of such as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of himself, may justly be reputed and called Fathers in the Truth.</hi> This he thinks an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table construction of his Words, and that <hi>no good Christian that loves the Truth more than Men, would judge the worse of him for correcting them tenderly and Christianly, not as an Enemy, but as a Friend and Brother.</hi> But it may be guessed how tenderly and Christianly he would deal with the <hi>Dead,</hi> by his <hi>harsh</hi> and <hi>unchristian</hi> dealing with the <hi>Living,</hi> whom he has not dealt with us as a Friend and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109396:50"/>
Brother, but as an Enemy: His comparing his correcting work to <hi>Sem</hi>'s and <hi>Iaphet</hi>'s going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to cover their Father's Nakedness, gave me fit occasion to tell him he had mistook his point, and taken up <hi>Ham</hi>'s work, instead of <hi>Sem</hi>'s and <hi>Iaphet</hi>'s. For <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> covered the Nekedness, which execrable <hi>Ham</hi> had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and exposed, as <hi>G. K.</hi> would do. In this he says, <hi>I falsly accuse him;</hi> but instead of proving I do so, he turns off, and says, <hi>I reflect not only on him, but on the late Christian Teachers and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who have corrected the Errors and unsound Expressions contained in the Books of them, called the</hi> Greek and Latin Fathers. In comparing the Books of Friends, to the Books of them called <hi>The Greek and Latin Fathers,</hi> he has not done as a Friend and Brother, but as an Enemy; in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Friends Books to have been written by no better guidance, nor clearer sight, than theirs who lived and writ in those dark times.</p>
            <p>He is so idle, as to charge me with <hi>perverting the Scripture Words,</hi> in saying, <hi>Blessed</hi> Sem <hi>and</hi> Japhet <hi>did therefore go backward, that they might not see their Father's Nakedness.</hi> And he makes this one of my 50 Perversions, by which you may see how hard he was put to it to make his number up. But instead of proving this a Perversion, he says, <hi>As if there were not a further matter and mystery in it.</hi> Perhaps there might be; but if there were, he hath not shewed it, nor my Perversion. But he says, <hi>If it had been only that they must not see their Father's nakedness, they might have covered their Face and Eyes, and gone forward, and not see their Father's Nakedness.</hi> But they took a more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109396:51"/>
sure way in going backward, and that which freed them from all suspicion of seeing, or being willing to see their Father's Nakedness.</p>
            <p n="36">36. He says, I pervert <hi>his modest Proposition,</hi> (for every Proposition of his is modest with him; and perhaps none but his.) <hi>That every one owned by us to be a Member of our Christian Society, give some Declaration of their Faith.</hi> This which he calls a <hi>modest Proposition,</hi> I shewed from his own Words, was an <hi>Imposition</hi> of a Verbal Confession of Faith, without which none should be admitted into Church fellowship with him. His Words are, <hi>We are convinced and perswaded in our Consciences, that God calleth us to separate from such Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and not to be yoked together in Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Discipline with any that we have not proof of by Confession of the Mouth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Reas. of Sep.</hi> p. 22.</p>
            <p n="37">37. He complains also, and makes it his 37th Charge, that I pervert his Words, that <hi>he makes a verbal Confession, the Door of admittance into our Society; which,</hi> he says, <hi>is altogether false.</hi> This depends upon the former, and is proved by those Words of his which I gave for proof of that, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>We are convinced (said he) and perswaded in our Consciences, that God calleth us to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not to be yoked together in Church-fellowship and Discipline, with any that we have not proof of, <hi>by Confession of the Mouth,</hi> &amp;c.</q> This is that I call Verbal Confession. If he like not the Word <hi>Verbal,</hi> let him take
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109396:51"/>
               <hi>Oral,</hi> or Confession of the <hi>Mouth,</hi> which is all one.</p>
            <p>From my observing out of <hi>R. Barclay</hi>'s Book, called the <hi>Anarchy,</hi> p. 48. (which <hi>G. K.</hi> had perversly quoted,) that <hi>R. B.</hi> doth not make a bare Profession, verbal Confession or Declaration of Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be any Terms at all of Church-Communion, <hi>G. K.</hi> taking it to himself, charges a Perversion on me, and says, <hi>This is false, I make them not the Terms at all, when the Profession is but barely verbal.</hi> But he hath no such guard in the Place before quoted, where he says, <hi>We are convinced,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that God calleth us to separate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and not to be yoked in Church fellowship,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with any that we have not proof of by Confession of the Mouth, that they are sound in the Faith.</hi> So that he makes a Verbal Confession, a proof of their being sound in the Faith, and this makes a Verbal Confession, yea, a bare verbal Confession, sufficient to yoke them, (as he phrases it) together in Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship.</p>
            <p>His 39th, 40th, and 41st, Relate to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Quotations out of <hi>R. Barclay</hi>'s Book, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, and my Observations thereupon, from which he picks several Quarrels; one, that from his saying (as <hi>the express Doctrine of</hi> R. B. though it be not,) <hi>That some Principles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Points of Faith are necessary to be agreed upon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to be owned, professed and declared by us, to be as it were the Terms that draw us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Bond by which we become centred into one Body and Fellowship,</hi> &amp;c. He says, <hi>I pervert his Words to a wrong sense; as if his Sense were, That</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:109396:52"/>
               <hi>Men were to contrive and cut out their own Terms, and before they entred into a Society or Fellowship, should consider, consult and conclude among themselves what Principles, Doctrines and Practices they would have to be the Terms and Bond of their Society.</hi> Though this was not spoken directly of him, (but with respect to the Quotation he <hi>feigned</hi> to give out of <hi>R. B.)</hi> yet he did well enough to take it to himself; for I verily think it to be his Sense, and the Terms he propounded it in, speak the same. And though he says he did not mean by agreeing, <hi>a humane, political Contrivance or Design,</hi> but a <hi>Divine Agreement;</hi> yet I make no question but he meant an Agreement of his <hi>own contriving</hi> and cutting out: And I doubt not that he would call any such thing Divine, that were of his Contriving. He asks, <hi>If I know not that Men may well agree together in one Faith, by the Spirit's inward working in their Hearts, as well as they may agree together in one Prayer, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> &amp;c? I answer, Yes, I do. But would he have some certain <hi>Form of Prayer</hi> agreed upon, and set forth, for all to be obliged to pray by at all times, because Men may agree together in one Prayer by the Spirit? That would be <hi>Common Prayer</hi> indeed. It is one thing to propose cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Principles, Doctrines and Points of Faith to be necessarily agreed upon, and being so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, a Confession thereof to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be owned, professed and declared to be, as it were, terms of Communion, and the Bond of Fellowship: And it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to be drawn together by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force and vertue of Truth, through the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109396:52"/>
Operation of the Divine Spirit in the Heart, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Agreement in the Belief of the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Doctrines and Points of Faith; and so also to agree substantially in making confession thereof, when and wheresoever the honour of God requires it of us.</p>
            <p>My Discovery that he has falsly quoted <hi>R. B.</hi> angers him extreamly, and he <hi>rails</hi> at me for it like himself; but that will not clear him. He says, <hi>I most fraudulently put a false gloss upon his Words, about the Word [agreed on];</hi> and next, <hi>that I deceive and abuse my Reader, as if he</hi> (G. K.) <hi>did put the same Gloss upon</hi> R. B<hi>'s Words.</hi> But all this is trifling; both his Book and mine are in the Reader's Hands, and I dare trust it to the Impartial Reader's Judgment. He complains that I endeavour to make the Reader believe he wronged R. B. in citing some Words of his, and that because he <hi>cited not so many of his Words, as I cited after him.</hi> This is a foul fallacy; for <hi>G. K</hi>'s Blame lies not in giving a Quotation out of R. B. <hi>too short,</hi> but in giving a <hi>false</hi> Quotation for a true one; or in <hi>forging</hi> a Quotation. For neither in the Words he quoted, nor in that Page, nor in that Book, nor in all the Books of R B. can G. K. find that which he has pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give, as the <hi>express Doctrine</hi> and Testimony of R. B. in the 48th Page of R. B's Book, called <hi>the Anarchy</hi> &amp;c. He struggles to get loose, but cannot; He says, he cited as many of R. B's Words, as were sufficient to prove, that it is R. B's Doctrine and Testimony, that Principles and Doctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are as it were the Terms that have drawn us together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But R. B.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109396:53"/>
doth not say so of Principles and Doctrines inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, or of the Principles and Doctrines in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that we will agree upon to be such; but of those Principles, Doctrines and Practices, into the belief of which we are gathered together, without any Constraint or Worldly respect, by the meer force of Truth upon our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and its power and influence upon our Hearts.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>G. K.</hi> says he did not say R. B. used the Word <hi>[Agreed]:</hi> See his own Words, in <hi>p.</hi> 8. of his Book called <hi>The causeless Ground of Surmises,</hi> which are these, <hi>That some Principles and Doctrines, and Points of Faith, are necessary to be agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is the express Doctrine and Testimony of</hi> R. Barclay<hi>'s Book above mentioned,</hi> pag. 48. Judge now how little this Man is to be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>He calls it a gross Perversion in me, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ating, that in his Book (Some Reasons and Causes, <hi>pag.</hi> 16.) He had cited R. B's Words. <hi>But it was not</hi> (says he) <hi>his Words, but his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that I mention in that place, as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, but not as to that particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of answering to some plain Questions with Yea; or nay.</hi> Had not I discovered his Falshood in this, he had gon off snug with his Quotation, as a very fair Quotation taken out of R. B's Book. But now he is put to his shifts; and to shift it off, he pretends now that he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give R. B's <hi>Words,</hi> but his <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and lest that cover should prove too short for him, he falls from the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to the <hi>substance</hi> of the Doctrine. Now let us repeat again the Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109396:53"/>
he gave, and then let the Reader Judge of it. It is in <hi>p.</hi> 16. <hi>of his Reason of the Separation,</hi> where he proposes, <hi>that we agree together to put</hi> Rob. Barclay<hi>'s Doctrine into Practice, which,</hi> says he, <hi>is</hi> (He does not say, the substance of which is, but which is) <hi>to declare our Faith and Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in certain Fundamental Doctrines of the Christian Faith and Religion, that by the same, as well as by a good Life and Conversation, it may be known who are qualified to be Members of our Church, and that every one owned to be a Member of our Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Faith and Perswasion in every one of these Fundamentals, which is a Secondary Bond of our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Spirit being the Principal, which may be easily done by answering to some plain questions, with Yea, or Nay.</hi> Let any one now, that reads these words, Judge whether they were not designed to perswade the Reader, that not only this was <hi>R.</hi> B.'s Doctrine, but that these were the very words in which he had delivered it. Whereas ye see now, <hi>G. K.</hi> not only confesses they are <hi>not his words,</hi> but dares not adventure to say, they are <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> his Doctrine; but the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of his Doctrine: And yet even that I deny. I say they are neither <hi>R.</hi> B.'s, <hi>Words</hi> nor <hi>Doctrine,</hi> nor the <hi>Substance</hi> of his Doctrine. And had his Quotation lain in a tolerable compass to be reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I would have given it: But he cites for it, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4, <hi>p.</hi> 32, 33. and <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 48, 49. to which I again refer and recommend every Reader, that has or can proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:109396:54"/>
               <hi>He says all my proof, that it is not</hi> R. B.<hi>'s Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, is, that I assure the Reader, it is not: But</hi> (says he) <hi>let the Reader compare my Citations at length,) in my</hi> Reason and Cause of Separation, <hi>p.</hi> 24, 25. <hi>and he shall find it is his Doctrine.</hi> But, besides my assuring the Reader it is not so, and my Referring him for certainty to the <hi>Original</hi> Book; I have now too other proofs to offer, which though not positive and direct, are <hi>strong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptives</hi> against <hi>G. K.</hi> One is, that he hath not attempted to Prove that this is the Doctrine or Substance of the Doctrine of <hi>R.</hi> B. in that Book, by producing now <hi>R.</hi> B.'s <hi>own words</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it. And the other is, that he doth not now refer his Reader to <hi>R.</hi> B.'s Book for Satisfaction; but to his <hi>own Book,</hi> and the Quotations therein, which he pretends to have taken out of <hi>R.</hi> B.'s Book, which perhaps he may have falsified, as well as this.</p>
            <p n="42">42. His next Cavil is grounded on a Quibble, In his <hi>Causless ground of Surmises,</hi> p. 10. he said, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> it not high time that by the general Consent, advice and approbation of the most Iudicious, Wise and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Friends now alive, all the most necessary Principles and Doctrines of our Faith, both common and peculiar, should be published and made known?</hi> &amp;c. I minding more the <hi>Substance</hi> of his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, than <hi>Circumstances,</hi> Answered, <hi>Is that, as a new thing, to be done now?</hi> adding, <hi>What Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Doctrine of our Faith, either common or peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, can he assign, that hath not been published and made known, perhaps before he knew either our Faith or us?</hi> He calls this a Perversion, and says, <hi>It is a new thing</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:109396:54"/>
               <hi>yet to be done; and he believes I am not able to shew him that Book where it is done by general Consent.</hi> So that I perceive he expects it <hi>all</hi> in <hi>one</hi> Book. But what if it be done in several Books, and that by some that are <hi>not now</hi> alive, who yet perhaps might be as Judicious, Wise and Understanding, as any that are now alive? Will not this serve his turn? I doubt, Not: For he will <hi>object</hi> perhaps that it has not been<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> done by general Consent of the most Judicious, Wise and Understanding Friends? He says, <hi>It is not the consent of a few, or of the Second Days Meeting at</hi> London, <hi>who</hi> (that he may speak in the words, as well as from the Spirit of <hi>Core)</hi> he says <hi>take too much upon them, that he means, but the general Consent of the most Iudicious Friends.</hi> But how will he do to find out the <hi>most Iudicious</hi> Friends now alive? Who, does he think (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self excepted) Judicious enough to Judge, who are the <hi>most Iudicious,</hi> Wise and Understanding Friends now alive? But before so great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a work be undertaken, it may be fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what need there is of this. The Apostles of our Lord, and the Primitive Christians, contented themselves without it. Did they ever get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the most Judicious, Wise and understanding amongst them, to publish by their general Consent all the most necessary Principles and Doctrines of their Faith, both common and peculiar? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is not able to shew me that Book where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that is done. Yet the necessary Principles and Doctrines, of their Faith, both common and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, were published and made known by some or other of them, in their several writings, though not in one Book, or by such general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109396:55"/>
advice and approbation, as he now propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And he hath not assigned any Principle, or Doctrine of our Faith, (which is the same with theirs of old) that hath not been already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and made known.</p>
            <p>His 43, 44, 45. Charges relate to <hi>his Suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that Friends make plain Language, plain ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Terms of their Communion; which I refuted so fully before, that I see no cause to say more to it now, especially since he offers nothing of moment now against what I then writ.</p>
            <p>His 46. he calls Perversion in me, for charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with <hi>Spurning disdainfully at the advice given him, to retract the Bitter Language in his Books. Whereas,</hi> says he, <hi>I modestly promise to do it, when they have told me what hard or bitter words I have given to any, that are not due to them, withall desiring some to give me their good Example. Is this,</hi> says he, <hi>any disdainful Spurning?</hi> What is disdainful Spurning of advice? If to <hi>recriminate</hi> the Advisers, and charge them <hi>higher</hi> in the same kind, be not? For <hi>to their Advice,</hi> says he, <hi>I Answer, some who have so advised me, should give me their good Example, by retracting their much more bitter Language, and more hard and severe Names they have given,</hi> &amp;c. Is not this disdainful Spurning? And whereas he pretends, that he <hi>modestly</hi> promised to retract, when they have told him what hard or bitter words he hath given to any that he cannot prove to be due unto them; he must remember I put him formerly in mind, that by his own confession he gave his hard Names
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109396:55"/>
and words <hi>without proof</hi> of their being due to them. For in his <hi>Plea of the Innocent</hi> p. 11. he says, <hi>As for his giving hard Names and Words to any, it was but conditional, upon Supposition of their holding such Errors which they did seem to favour.</hi> Was this <hi>modestly</hi> done? Or like a Christian, to <hi>revile</hi> and <hi>abuse</hi> Persons <hi>conditionally,</hi> and upon <hi>Supposition?</hi> Why did he not clear himself of this? Or confess his fault in it? Was it not because he could not do the one, and hath not honesty enough to do the other.</p>
            <p n="47">47. He persists in <hi>retracting the acknowledgment he made in the Yearly Meeting, of his passions,</hi> &amp;c. Yet <hi>blames me for saying he retracted,</hi> and denies he acknowledged he had justly offended any in words or deeds, relating to the differences in <hi>Pensilvania,</hi> or elsewhere. But he answers not what I writ of that before (in my 64, 65, 66, and 67. <hi>pages,)</hi> which lies still on him, and will.</p>
            <p n="48">48. So will also what I there said (from <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 26. and 3. 11. 12.) concerning his <hi>unbridled</hi> Tongue; which he in vain retorts on me, as guilty of the Perversions, Fictions and Forgeries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he charges: Which being not <hi>real</hi> but <hi>feigned</hi> by him, and charged <hi>without proof,</hi> is a further proof against him, that his Fountain is bitter, and his Religion vain.</p>
            <p n="49">49. His charging me with Perversion, in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that <hi>he was not condemned in</hi> Pensilvania <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hearing Conviction and Trial,</hi> is a Perversion of his own. For (though I believe it is true that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109396:56"/>
he was not) yet I did not so affirm; but taking notice of his frequent Complaining that he had been Condemned in <hi>America,</hi> without all hearing Conviction or Trial, I said, in a Parenthesis, <hi>(though that is both denied and disapproved by the Friends there.)</hi> So that his is rather a Perversion, or false Charge upon me.</p>
            <p n="50">50. The last of his Fifty Charges, he calls a Complex and Bundle of false Accusations and Misrepresentations. The parts whereof are;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>I say he is not in Unity with faithful Friends.</hi> This is not only too true, but too plain to be doubted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>I accuse him of hardness in his</hi> saying, <hi>I declare my real Intention to remain in Unity with all Faithful Friends.</hi> What else could it be, but <hi>extream Hardness,</hi> for him to declare his real intention to remain in Unity with all Faithful Friends every where, after he had (as I there shewed) broken from the Unity, and gone out into an open Separation from Friends?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>his Meeting with Friends, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to exercise his Gift of Ministry</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>amongst them, is a very great Exercise and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Friends.</hi> I was not positive it is. But I said to Friends, <q>If he continue to Meet with you in the same Spirit, and mind, in which he went out from Friends, and made the Breach and Separation elsewhere, his Meeting with you will be but a Burden to you, and an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Condemnation to himself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And with respect to his Preaching in Friends Meetings, I said, <q>While he continues in that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109396:56"/>
Evil Mind, and Spirit of Contention, Division, and Discord, wherein he hath of late appeared, it must needs be a very great Exercise and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But I am not dissatisfied with his changing the Words from [Will be] and [must needs be], to [is]: For I am fully satisfied it is so; and ye, my Friends, whose suffering Lot it is to hear him, I make no question, find and feel it so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That <hi>he gave such Interruption, and made so great disturbance at the First Publick Meeting he appeared in at</hi> London (which was at the <hi>Bull and Mouth,) as the like hath scarce been known in any Meeting in that City.</hi> Of this there were so many Witnesses present, that he might with the like Modesty deny he was at that Meeting, as that he made such a Disturbance there.</p>
            <p>He asserts again his being in Unity, thus; <hi>As I am at present in Unity with Faithful Friends, so I still declare my sincere Intention to remain in Unity with Faithful Friends.</hi> But as he is <hi>not</hi> at present <hi>in Unity:</hi> So his declared intention to remain in Unity, is <hi>not sincere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He says, <hi>Neither I, nor any of my Abettors, can prove him guilty of making any Breach, or Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of true Unity with Faithful Friends.</hi> Friends, Ye who have his Books, and mine, before you, are the proper Judges of that; and to your Judgment I leave it. But what heed can be given to the Words of a Man, who speaks not plainly, but with Equivocation? In his Cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Ground of Jealousies, <hi>he tenderly intreated that none would apply or construe any Words</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:109396:57"/>
               <hi>therein, as intended by him in way of Reflection, blame or Charge against either the Body of Friends in general, or any particular Meeting,</hi> &amp;c. Yet in that Book reflected on, blamed and charged the Yearly Meeting highly. But he had an <hi>Equivocating Salvo</hi> to himself, which was that he did not own that to be the Yearly Meeting, or any Meeting at all duly and regularly Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>
            <p>Now he cryes he is in Unity with all Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends. And how (in his reserved sense) can that be otherwise, since he owns none for Faithful Friends, but such as are in Unity with him?</p>
            <p>He refers to the Innocency of his Life and Conversation, for Proof of the sincerity of his Spirit and Heart. But he will get little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that way. It is not enough for a Man to be free from gross Immoralities, and the common Debaucheries of the Age: (For that an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite will take care to be:) But he that will recommend the sincerity of his Heart and Spirit, by his Conversation, must have his Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on blameless towards God, as well as towards Man: For there is a Conversation in the Church, as well as in the World; and he that orders his Conversation aright, will be careful not to give Offence to the Church of God, as well as not to the World.</p>
            <p>What <hi>G. K</hi>'s. Conversation is in the World, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ddle not with. But what his Conversation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>to Years hath been, <hi>in the Church,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>and Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Friends at his pleasure, is too notoriously manifest to need proof. And therefore, while his Tree brings forth such Evil Fruits, he can have no Relief, by urging, That <hi>the Tree should be judged by its Fruits;</hi> by which it is already judged, and found to be of a corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>He suggests that <hi>I,</hi> and some others who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote my Book, <hi>seek to drive him forth from the Unity and Fellowship of Friends, and from abiding in the Inheritance of the Lord;</hi> Whereas it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and evident, that he was gone from the Unity and Fellowship of Friends, <hi>before</hi> my Book was Written, or I had any thing to do with him. And how little he regards the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Lord, to abide in it, may be gathered, not only from his joyning himself to the Separate Meeting in <hi>Harp-Lane,</hi> but his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Meetings of other Professions of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all sorts.</p>
            <p>He would shake off the blame, of having made that disturbance, which was at the <hi>Bull-Meeting</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> presently after he came over, by saying, <hi>Many can, and do bear him witness, that he was not the Cause, nor beginning of it.</hi> This I leave to you, Friends of <hi>London,</hi> who were then present, to judge of, and to measure the Truth of what he says in other things, by his falseness in this.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>It ought not to be reckoned a distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, when Errors and false Doctrine is Preached in a publick Assembly, in a Zealous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:109396:58"/>
               <hi>Spirit to reprove it, when things are come to that pass especially, that private Reproof is not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> By this he suggests, that Error, and false Doctrine was Preached in that publick Assembly at the <hi>Bull,</hi> and that by some whom he had repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved privately for the same before.</p>
            <p>But of this he hath given no Proof, nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; both which unless he do, he is justly to be reputed a false Accuser and Slanderer. But to balance the Disturbance made at the <hi>Bull,</hi> he puts me in mind of a Disturbance, which he says I made at <hi>Grace-Church-</hi>street Meeting, in speaking against a Person, whose Ministry (he says) was well owned by Hundreds, some of which, he says, cryed out on me; <hi>Shame, Shame.</hi> To which I say, I remember well both the time and occasion of that Disturbance; which was not made by me, but by a sort of <hi>Unruly</hi> People that joyned with that unruly Person.</p>
            <p>As for my part, I did not in that Meeting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt that Person while he was speaking, but waited long (under a <hi>very great weight</hi> and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that his Preaching brought upon me) until he had done, before I spake a word. And when I had cleared my Conscience in a short Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Meeting, I sate down <hi>peaceably</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and did not enter into any Debate, or Strife with those unruly People of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, by railing at me, on his behalf, made that Disturbance that was; and whose <hi>abusive rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> towards me, made some cry out on them; <hi>Shame, Shame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:109396:58"/>
And surely if <hi>G. K.</hi> thinks (as he seems here to do) that neither I, nor any other should call it a Disturbance in him to bear a publick Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against a Man, that <hi>ought not</hi> (he says) <hi>to be owned to be a Minister of Christ:</hi> He ought not to call it a disturbance in me, to bear a publick Testimony against that Man, that I then testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied against, <hi>who ought not to be owned to be a Minister of Christ,</hi> not only because he hat divided him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the Church of Christ, by going into, and keeping up an open Separation; but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters also, relating to Conversation, which that Man well knows, I know of him, and have both privately and publickly reproved him for some of them.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>G. K.</hi>'s saying, that my speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that Person, gave offence to <hi>Hundreds,</hi> it is not to be regarded; it being his way, and words of course with him, when he has a mind to <hi>magnify</hi> his matter by Numbers, to use the word <hi>Hundreds</hi> at a venture. So he does here, thrice in one <hi>page,—gave great Offence to Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds;—whose Ministry was well owned by Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds;—Hundreds hear Witness,</hi> &amp;c. now that these are but <hi>words</hi> of <hi>course</hi> with him, and used only to deceive, may be seen in this last Instance, of his <hi>Hundreds</hi> of witnesses, by taking notice what he says they bear witness too, <hi>viz</hi> that <hi>my Ministry</hi> (says he) <hi>is both refreshing and edifying to them, and is burdensom to none, but to the Ignorant and unfaithful,</hi> &amp;c. If his Hundreds of witnesses could have witnessed truly, that his Ministry is refreshing and edifying to them: Yet if they will take upon them to witness, that it is <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:109396:59"/>
               <hi>to none,</hi> but the Ignorant Unfaithful and prejudiced, it is an Hundred to one, if one in an hundred believe them. But by this hint, it may be seen what little weight there is in his talk of Hundreds, both in this and his other Books.</p>
            <p>He complains of me, for <hi>accusing his innocent true words, as savouring of a Boasting Spirit, because</hi> (says he) <hi>I humbly and modestly did mention my Thirty Years Labour in the work of the Ministry, and God having blest my Labours with great Success, in being an Instrument to the bringing many into the blessed Unity,</hi> &amp;c. And he <hi>appeals to all that have a true savour, whether these words savour of a boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, he</hi> (as he says) <hi>only using them by way of argument, to perswade some that had a wrong jealousy of him, that he intends no breach among faithful Friends.</hi> His modesty and humility is pretty well seen and known by this time. And had not this <hi>boasting Vanity</hi> been deeply rooted in his Nature, the gentle Touch I gave him in my former Epistle <hi>p.</hi> 70. upon this passage now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, of his setting forth his <hi>Thirty</hi> Years La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the work of the Ministry, and his <hi>Great</hi> Success therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might have taught him to think <hi>more modestly</hi> and humbly of himself. But he was so far from taking warning by that, that he begins his Epistle, which he writ since, much after the same manner, thus. <hi>Notwithstanding that I find some (of whom with respect both to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Labour of love and Service in the Truth, towards them, and to my present Service in the Truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I might have expected better things) so deeply prejudiced,</hi> &amp;c. What else doth this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109396:59"/>
but a <hi>fond Conceit</hi> of his own Doings? Many, I believe, who have <hi>deserved more,</hi> have <hi>less sought</hi> Commendation for their Services. And had he been in the <hi>true Humility,</hi> and in that Charity, which <hi>va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nteth not</hi> it self, and is <hi>not puffed up,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. he would have followed the Apostle's Counsel, not to think of himself <hi>more highly than he ought to think,</hi> Rom. 12. 13. But if it might have becomed him at any time, to have spoken so highly of his own Services: Yet his doing it now, is as unseasonable, as if a Cow, that had given a good soop of Milk, should boast of the goodness or quantity thereof, after she had spilt it, by kicking down the Pail. I have no inclination to render his former Services Cheap; which I think he hath but too much done himself (though he sees it not) by coupling them with his present Doings. And I give but a Touch on this, not doubting, Friends, that ye will observe in those Expressions of his, <hi>A Vein of Spiritual Pride;</hi> which he in vain endeavours to cover, by pretending he used them by way of Argument, to perswade some; that he intended no breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Faithful Friends. Which yet, could be but a weak Argument, to them that know and consider, that Others before him (some of whom had laboured long in the Work of the Ministry, and perhaps as successfully as he) have turned aside, as well as he, and made Breaches among Friends; of which he himself seemed formerly sensible.</p>
            <p>Thus, Friends, I have gone through his Fifty Charges, And said more to them, than either they or he deserved of me. Which I have done
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109396:60"/>
for Truth's sake, and yours, more than for my own. For I dare trust to the Goodness of the Cause I have undertaken, and the Innocency of my Intention, in undertaking it; an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of which I have no doubt to find in the Heart of Faithful Friends.</p>
            <p>But my Desire and Care is, so plainly and nakedly to lay open before you, <hi>what Spirit he is of,</hi> and is acted by, and the <hi>mischievous Design</hi> thereof, that none may be longer deceived by him; nor any, by <hi>seeming</hi> to countenance him, may strengthen and harden him in his Opposition to Truth, to their hurt and his Ruin. I confess I cannot treat him as a Friend, because I find him <hi>an Enemy to Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet none could be more glad than I, to see him return to a <hi>right mind.</hi> For then he would see himself to be, what you and I see him to be; and would be more forward to condemn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, than to quarrel with others.</p>
            <p>But I must needs say, I have little hopes to see so good an effect wrought on him; because <hi>I cannot find sincerity in him.</hi> I gave many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in my former Epistle of his Insincerity and double Dealing. Since which he hath sent forth,</p>
            <p>First, That Sheet single by it self, which he calls a Loving Epistle, but without any spark or appearance of Love in it. He directs it to all the Moderate, Judicious, and Impartial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People called Quakers, intimating thereby, that (in his Opinion) the Quakers, as a Body, or People, are not Moderate, Judicious, or Impartial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:109396:60"/>
I dare say, should any one of those, that have appeared most favourable to him, but thwart him in his way, or reprove him for his Unruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and disorderly Doings, he shall forthwith reject such an One, and rase him out of his Roll of Moderate, Judicious, and Impartial Ones. And I am perswaded, should all Friends deal so with him (which they have just cause to do) he would reject them all, and not own one Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Judicious, or Impartial among us.</p>
            <p>Do ye not see, Friends, how he Slights, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and casts off, not only Persons, but Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, at his pleasure, if they answer not his mind?</p>
            <p>The Second Day's Morning Meeting, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mostly (as ye know) of Ministring Friends, he Derives and Scoffs, and Represents it as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by Parties.</p>
            <p>The Yearly Meeting he represented in his former Paper, (called <hi>The Causeless Ground,</hi> &amp;c.) as divided: For which I tax'd him in my last. In his Epistolary Sheet, he doth not vouchsafe to acknowledge it for a Yearly Meeting; but, when he speaks of it, says, <hi>That</hi> which <hi>he called the Yearly Meeting,</hi> p. 4. so p. 5. and so p. 7. Nay, he there suggests, as if that Paper, called <hi>A true Account of the Proceedings of the Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> was not given forth by the Yearly Meeting: For speaking of it, he says, p. 4. <hi>The Paper said to be given out by the Yearly Meeting;</hi> though after he had heard it Read, it was deliver'd to him, in the Yearly Meeting, in the Name, and as the Act of the Yearly Meeting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:109396:61"/>
But now in his last Book, which he calls <hi>A seasonable Information,</hi> &amp;c. He says downright, p. 28. <hi>As for that, called The Yearly Meetings Iudgment, I own it not to be such.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of the Meeting its self, he says, <hi>It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be owned to be the Yearly Meeting, nor any Meeting</hi> duly and regularly constitute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 27. So that, Friends, the nearer ye look upon this Man, and the more exactly ye weigh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider his Words and Actions, the more plainly ye will see his Shifting, Shuffling and Double-Dealing, and that <hi>he is departed from the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Truth;</hi> yet uses the Terms of Truth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the Simple by.</p>
            <p>For ye see, he calls his Sheet <hi>A Loving Epistle</hi> Addresses it to you, under the kind Compellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Dear Friends and Brethren;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that <hi>he remains in true Love your Friend in the Truth:</hi> As if, Who but he to Friends! And who but Friends to him! Whereas, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions that have hitherto Offered since his last Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in <hi>England,</hi> (so far at least as hath come to my notice) when Friends have had to do with him, he regards neither Friend, nor Friends, nor Meetings of Friends, if they do not answer his humour.</p>
            <p>And Friends, it is observable, and worth your taking notice of, that in the <hi>Idle Challenge</hi> he made (in the Postscript to his Epistle) to me, and those Friends that approve my Book, for a publick Meeting between him and us, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides by a particular Caution, that <hi>all Sober and Moderate Persons, whether Friends, or Friendly People, may have freedom to be present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:109396:61"/>
What else doth this bespeak, but that he hath <hi>more Confidence</hi> in the Populace, than in Friends? In those that are not, of us, Than in those that are? Do ye not see, Friends, even by this, Where his Life lies? Doth it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he is departed from the Communion of the Saints in Light, and from the Fellowship of the Faithful, whose Unity is with the Father, and with the Son, in the Eternal Spirit?</p>
            <p>And though he directs his Epistle to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, Judicious, and Impartial among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers:</hi> Yet it is the Moderate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (as he calls them) that are <hi>not Quakers,</hi> whom he would have present, to make his Appeal to, <hi>against the Quakers,</hi> could he but get a Stage to wrangle on. To procure which, he urges that the Scripture says, <hi>Of making many Books there is no end.</hi> But how unseasonably is this urged by him now, when he should defend his Books, who hath <hi>tumbled out</hi> so many Scandalous Books to the dishonour of the Truth, and Reproach of Friends, as he has done, without any regard to that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? He urges also the Example of the <hi>Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Meeting,</hi> thereby setting, not me only, but the Second Days Morning Meeting, and all Friends that approve and promote my Book, in the place of those envious Baptists, that then made War against Truth and Friends. By this, Friends, ye may see to what a degree he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and whither his Envy has run him. But as there is no parallel between that Case and this, (those Baptists having Blasphemed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple we prosess, traduced the whole Body of Friends, and in a Mock-Meeting condemned su
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:109396:62"/>
unheard) so their yeilding to such a Meeting at Friends demand, will neither excuse him for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the like, nor would have blamed Friends had it been denied. But since by his publishing his Fifty Charges against me, with such proofless Proofs as he was able to make thereof, he has put the Cause into another way of Tryal, and given every Reader opportunity to judge, both of his Charges and Proofs; I think not my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take any farther notice of his daring Challenge, than to tell him, that, had he not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self superseeded it by Printing, I should have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected some assurance of his being reclaimed from that abusive rudeness, wherewith he usually treats those he contends with, before I should have given him such an Opportunity to gratifie the Rabble; (who in such Assemblies, and on such Occasions, commonly make the greater part:) And to disgrace his Profession he yet makes of Truth, by so publick a discovery of his ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Passions; the remembrance of which, from the Yearly Meeting, makes me desire never to see the like again.</p>
            <p>But Friends, I desire that both you and I may be kept in the weighty Life, and may dwell in a sensible feeling thereof continually, and grow up therein, from day to day, that we may not only be thereby enabled to savour, discern, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish Right from Wrong, Good from Evil, that which is of God, from that which is of the Enemy, in his most specious appearances; but so to cleave to the one, and reject the other, that nothing that is of the Evil one, and which tends to make Rents, Di isions, and Breaches

among Brethren, or draw from the Holy Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Gospel of Peace, and throw publick Scandals upon our Religious Profession, may receive any Strength, Incouragement, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from any that profess the Truth: But that we may all watch over our selves, and over one another for good, in that which is of God. To whose Impartial Witness in every one of your Hearts, I recommend the foregoing Lines; and in that Love that desires, and seeks the good of the whole Body, and of every particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof; I remain</p>

But <hi>George Keith</hi>'s <hi>mean</hi> mind could not, it seems, withstand the <hi>slight Temptation</hi> of <hi>Iohn Raunce</hi>'s Offer, to take off an Hundred of his Books: (Besides, that he was glad of any help to run down his Opponent, if he could, with Slanders, which he found he could not do with Arguments.)

He had spread a Report above a Year ago, That <hi>I did not allow my Father a Shrowd, but that he was wrapt in an Old Moth-eaten Blanket.</hi> When I heard this (and with what Joy, and Glorying, he published it) I took notice of it, in a Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script to that Book (which was then just ready for the Press) and I therein <hi>disproved</hi> his False Report. But because I said, <hi>I hear Iohn Raunce hath hatched another false Story against me,</hi> he (wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what I had there said to clear my self of it) catches hold of the Word <hi>[Hatched]</hi> and, under pretence of clearing himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>not from having <hi>reported</hi> and <hi>spread,</hi> but) from having <hi>hatched</hi> that:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:109396:63"/>
Story, he takes theadvantage of publishing it again, at the end of <hi>G. K</hi>'s Book, that wheresoever that Book shall go, he might defame me. The Account he hath now given of it, is, <hi>That my Father had no other Shrowd but somewhat of an Old Moth-eaten Blanket; and it was so little and so short, that it would scare co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Body.</hi> That <hi>he had no Cap on his Head, nor any Muffler for his Iaws:</hi> And that <hi>The Shrowd was so sorry a Thing, that the Man, he</hi> pretends to have had his Relation from, said, <hi>He would not have given</hi> 6 d. <hi>for it.</hi> This Account he pretends to have had from a Man, who, he says, helped to lay my Father into his Coffin, and saw him Nailed up in the Coffin. But he Names not the Man, nor where he lives, that he might be spoken with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: Which shews he had no mind his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Author should be found out, and spoken with, lest his own Falshood should be found out also. However, upon <hi>Iohn Raunce</hi>'s Publishing this Account, I desired two Friends of <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> viz. <hi>Thomas Olliffe,</hi> and <hi>Iames Smith,</hi> to go to <hi>Holton</hi> (the Town where my Father died) and inform themselves as fully as they could, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter. I chose rather to imploy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this Work, than to go my self, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Account should be given thereof, it might be free from all suspicion. Accordingly those two Friends went to the Place, and though they could not find out any such Man as <hi>Iohn Raunce</hi> speaks of (not having his Name to inquire by:) Yet they spake with the Man in whose House my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died, and with the two Women that laid out the Body, from whom, and under whose hands, they received the following Certificates.</p>
