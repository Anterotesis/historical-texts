         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS may be thought a
very improper Text for
the Feast of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Birth, when our
Mouths ought to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Praises of
God, and sing with the whole Quire of
Angels, <hi>Glory be to God in the highest,
on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi>
This indeed is that Peace, which the
World cannot give, and which the
World cannot take away; whatever the
External Appearances of Providence are,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63307:4"/>
here we find a safe retreat, and a never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing
Spring of Joy: For <hi>he that spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not his own Son, but delivered him
up for us all, how shall he not with him
also freely give us all things? Who</hi> then
<hi>Shall jeparate us from the love of Christ?
Shall Tribulation, or Distress, or Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
or Famine, or Nakedness, or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,
or Sword?—Nay, in all these
we are more than Conquerors through him
that loved us. For I am perswaded,
that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature, shall
he able to separate us from the love of
God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord,</hi>
8. Rom. 32, 35, 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> While our
minds are warmed with such thoughts
as these, we shall be able to bear up
under the greatest Trials, if not with
Chearfulness, yet at least with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63307:4"/>
and a quiet Submission to the Will of
God. And if ever there were occasion
for such Comfortable and Supporting
Thoughts, the Divine Providence has
made it too necessary at this time, to bear
the Loss of an Incomparable Lady, our
most Gracious Queen; whose Death all
good Subjects must Lament, and I pray
God forgive those that do not. Such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Providences as these, will teach the
greatest and most unbroken Minds, <hi>to
serve the Lord with fear, and to rejoice with
trembling.</hi> But how severe soever Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is in some particular instances, the
sense of the Divine Goodness in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Mankind by the Incarnation
and Death of his own Son; should teach
us to be <hi>dumb, and not open our mouths, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is his doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In speaking to which words, I shall
Inquire, What may be called the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63307:5"/>
doings of the Lord? 2. What it is to
be dumb, and not to open our Mouths?
3. The force of this Argument to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to a quiet and patient Submission
under the greatest sufferings, That it is
God's doing.</p>
            <p>1. What may be called <hi>the doing of
the Lord?</hi> This may be thought a very
needless question; for are there any
Events, Good or Evil, which are not
God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s doing? If we believe a particular
Providence, we must answer, No; and
yet some things are more peculiarly God's
doings, than others are, with respect to
this present Argument, as God's doing
it, is a reason for a quiet and patient
Submission to the Divine Will.</p>
            <p>In many cases men bring Ruine and
Misery upon themselves by their own sin
and folly, and then they may thank
themselves for it; but have no reason
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63307:5"/>
to complain of Providence; and when
they cannot charge Providence with their
misfortunes, patience it self is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a Submission to God; because their
sufferings are no more God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s will, than
their sin and folly is.</p>
            <p>If men destroy their Estates by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseness
and prodigality, and their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
by intemperance and lust; if ill-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
Friendships, indiscreet Bargains,
or an ungovernable Tongue, perplex their
Affairs, and prove very troublesome or
dangerous, all this is owing not merely to
Providence, but to themselves; and they
must be contented to reap the fruit of their
own doings, and to implore the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Goodness and Providence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them from the evil consequences
of their own sin and folly.</p>
            <p>Whatever evils we suffer, which are
not the natural or moral effects of our own
sin or folly, they are properly God's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63307:6"/>
as inflicted by God, either for the
punishment of our sins, or for the trial
and exercise of our virtues, or to serve
the wise ends of his Providence in the
world.</p>
            <p>Those Evils which we do not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
bring upon our selves, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
on us, either by the ministry of
wicked and injurious men, or by the
disorders of Natural Causes, or by some
seeming casual and fortuitous Events; for
the Actions of Men, the Powers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and what we call Chance and
Fortune, are all in the hands of God,
and therefore are more or less his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>But if we may say, that some things
are more peculiarly the care of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
than others, Life and Death are
certainly so; no man can be Born or
Die, without the particular Order and
Appointment of God: Our Saviour
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63307:6"/>
tells us, <hi>not a sparrow falls to the ground
without our Father,</hi> much less men; and
assures his Disciples, that <hi>all the hairs of
their head are numbred;</hi> and their Lives
are more sacred than their Hairs. Some
men are of opinion, That God has ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
Decreed the certain term and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of every man's life; But I know no
foundation for this, neither in Scripture
nor Reason; nor does any man believe
it, but those who subject all Mankind,
and all the Things of this world, to irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versible
Necessity and Fate, which is the
strength of the Atheistick Hypothesis;
though incautiously espoused by some
men, who are so far from being Atheists,
that I hope they are very good Christians.
And therefore, I suppose, these Christian
Fatalists, if I may so call them, mean no
more than what we all own, That no
Sparrow, much less a Man, falls to the
ground without our Father; that God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63307:7"/>
not only foreknows the period of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man's Life, and by what means he
shall Die, but with infinite Wisdom
and Justice, Orders and Appoints it;
not by an absolute and unconditional
Decree, but as the Wise Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of a Free and Just Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>And if God have any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
for Nations and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
than he has for particular men
(as we, who can attend but a few
things at once, and therefore make the
matters of greatest importance our more
particular care, are apt to conceive)
then the Lives and Deaths of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
must be more particularly Ordered
and Determined by God; because Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it may be many Nations and
Countries, more than their own, are
concerned in the consequence of it;
and of the more universal concernment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63307:7"/>
any thing is, the more we are apt
to think it belongs to the Care of
God.</p>
            <p>For this reason some Philosophers have
confined the Providence of God to the
Heavens, and Heavenly Bodies, which
have such a universal influence on things
below; or to Nations and Publick Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and to the several kinds and species
of Beings, not to particular Men or
Creatures.</p>
            <p>And so far they were in the right,
that if the Divine Providence could not
equally take care of the whole World,
and of every particular Creature in it;
it would certainly in the first place
take care of the great Springs of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But though this be no reason for
God's peculiar care of one thing more
than another, because his All-seeing
Eye, and Almighty Arm, can equally
take care of all; yet our Saviour has
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63307:8"/>
taught us from the worth and value
of things, that God will certainly
take the more care of them, and in case
of any Competition give the preference
to things of the greatest moment. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the fowls of the air, for they sow
not, neither do they reap, nor gather into
barns, yet your heavenly Father feedeth
them; are ye not much better than they?</hi>
And <hi>if God so clothe the grass of the field,
which to day is, and to morrow is cast into
the oven, shall he not much more clothe you,
O ye of little faith?</hi> 6. Matth. 26, 30.
Where from God's care of mean Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Creatures, the Fowls of the Air,
and the Grass of the Field, he more
strongly concludes his care of Men; and
by the same reason from his care of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men, we may more strongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
his care of Kingdoms and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and therefore of the Lives of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who are the great Ministers of his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63307:8"/>
Government and Providence, and whose
Lives or Deaths make such a mighty
Change in the Affairs of the world.
So that when, or by what means soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Princes dye, this is God's doings;
and how severe soever we may feel it,
<hi>We must be dumb, and not open our
mouths, because he has done it;</hi> which is
the</p>
            <p>2. Thing to be explained, What is
meant by being <hi>dumb, and not opening our
mouths.</hi> For this seems a very hard say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the strict literal sense, that we must
not complain of our Sufferings, when
we feel 'em smart: Humane Nature
can't bear this, we must feel our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and when we feel them, we must
complain: To have no sense of what
we suffer, is Stupidity, not Submission;
it is irreverence for the Judgments of
God, and in some cases the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63307:9"/>
baseness and ingratitude to
Men. To be unconcerned for the Death
of our dearest Friends, or greatest Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
and Benefactors, not to pay Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Tribute to their Memories in a
Sigh and a Tear; not to long after
them, and send some vain Wishes to call
them back; not to preserve their Idea
fresh in our minds, and to think with
some uneasiness of those happy hours
which their Conversation sweetned; to
part with our Friends, as if we suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing by their loss, and were as
well without them, is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Virtue, that such a man is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ever being a Friend, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deserves to have any; much more
then, when we lose a Publick Friend
and Benefactor, the greatest of Friends
and Benefactors, which is a good
Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63307:9"/>
Let us briefly consider, what we have
lost in the loss of our Gracious Queen, and
try if we can bear the thoughts of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
complaining. She was the Glory of
her Sex, and an Ornament to the Crown
she wore; made truly Great by Nature,
Birth, and Education. She had a large
and capacious Mind, a quick and lively
Apprehension, and a piercing and solid
Judgment: She had a strength and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mind beyond her Sex, and such a
dexterity in managing the greatest Affairs,
as would have become the greatest and most
experienced Ministers. Never was there
greater skill in Government with less fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for it, which she could take up and lay
down, with the same equality and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency
of Mind: Though, I doubt, I must
unsay that; for she was always grieved at
the occasion of taking the Government,
and as glad to resign it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63307:10"/>
Never was Majesty better tempered
with easiness and sweetness. She knew
how to be familiar, without making her
self cheap, and to condescend without
meanness She had all the Greatness of
Majesty, with all the Vertues of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;
and knew very well, what became
her Table, and what became the Council-Board.</p>
            <p>She understood her Religion, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, and practised it; and was the
greatest Example of the Age, of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
regular, unaffected Devotion, and of
all the eminent Vertues of a <hi>Christian Life.</hi>
In the midst of all the great <hi>Affairs</hi> of
<hi>State,</hi> she would rather spare time from her
sleep, than from her Prayers, where she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
appeared with that great composure
and seriousness of Mind, as if her Court
had been a Nunnery, and she had had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to do in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63307:10"/>
In all the Ease and Prosperity of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
she had that tenderness and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for those, who suffered, which suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
themselves cannot teach meaner Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
She was Charitable to the utmost
of her Power, amidst all the Expences of
War and Government, and when a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Object was presented to her, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
pleased, when she could grant their
requests, and very uneasie to deny.</p>
            <p>In short, her greatest and most implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Enemies, (for Vertue it self will meet
with Enemies in this World) had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fault to charge her with, but her
Throne; which is the only thing, for which
most other Princes are valuable. She as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
the Throne indeed before she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
it, but was thrust into it, not by an
hasty Ambition, but to save a sinking
Church and Kingdom: And I hope <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
will always have reason to say, That
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63307:11"/>
an empty Throne could never have been
filled with a nobler Pair.</p>
            <p>But though the necessary absence of the
King, to give check to the Progress of a
powerful and insulting Monarch, engaged
her more than she desired in <hi>State Affairs,</hi>
yet the promoting of true Religion, and
the service of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> [the
greatest and best Nursery of it, since the
Apostolick Age,] was her constant and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Care. This her Thoughts were full
of, and she had formed great and noble
Designs, had she out-lived the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Expences of War; and been
at leisure to attend the peaceful Arts of
Government.</p>
            <p>I have reason to say this, from
those frequent Intimations I have had
from our late admirable Primate, who
had great designs Himself to serve the
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> in its truest Interests; and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63307:11"/>
had inspired Their Majesties; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Queen, who had more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for such Thoughts, with the same
great and pious Designs: It may be no
Church-man ever had, I am sure not more
deservedly, a greater Interest in his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's
Favour; and the great Use he made
of it, was to do publick service to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and, whatever some Men might
suspect, to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> though
it may be not perfectly in their Way: And
the greatest Fault I know he had, was, That
some envious and ambitious Men could
not bear his Greatness, which he himself
never courted, nay, which he industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
avoided.</p>
            <p>Before this, all <hi>England</hi> knew and
owned his Worth; and had it been put
to the Poll, there had been vast Odds
on his side, that he would have been vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the See of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> for no
Man had ever a clearer and brighter Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63307:12"/>
a truer Judgment, a more easie and
happy Expression, nor a more inflexible,
fearless Honesty: He was a true and
hearty Friend, and was a true Friend
where-ever he professed to be so: Though
he had many Enemies at last, he took
care to make none. He was obliging to
all Men; and though he could not easily
part with a Friend, he could easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
an Enemy, as that Bundel of Libels
witnesses, which was found among his
other Papers, with this Inscription: <hi>These
are Libels; I pray God forgive them;w I
do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I cannot give you the just Character
of this Great Man now; what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said, I confess, is an Excursion,
which I hope you will pardon to the
Passion of an old Friend; and learn from
Two great Examples, that neither the
greatest Innocence, Vertue, or Merit,
can defend, either Crowned or Mitred
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63307:12"/>
Heads, from the lash of spiteful and enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed
Tongues. But what a Loss has
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in
such a critical Time, in the Death of
such a <hi>Queen,</hi> and such a <hi>Prelate!</hi> I pray
God make up this Loss.</p>
            <p>In a word, That great Passion which
afflicts and oppresses our good King, gives
an unexceptionable Testimony to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Worth of our deceased
<hi>Queen:</hi> The too severe and visible Effects
of it, shew, that it is not an ordinary,
nor a dissembled Passion: Nor is it an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
thing, for a Prince of so great a
Mind, who can look the most formidable
Dangers, and Death it self, in the face,
without fear; whom all the Powers of
<hi>France</hi> cannot make look pale or tremble,
to sink and faint, and to feel all the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Death in the dying Looks of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Consort. All Story cannot furnish
us with many Examples of such soft and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63307:13"/>
tender Passions, in such a warlike and
fearless Mind; and what but a mighty
Vertue could so charm a Prince, as to
forget his natural Constancy and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
I'm sure, though we pay very dear
for the Experiment in the loss of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Queen,</hi> we have so much the more
reason to think our selves happy in a
<hi>King;</hi> for a due mixture and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such fearless Courage and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and such tender Passions, is the
most perfect Composition of an excellent
Prince.</p>
            <p>And now it may be, you will tell me,
that I have taken great Pains to conhute
my Text, and that I have done it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
for we ought not to be dumb, but
may very justly complain of such a loss as
this.</p>
            <p>This I readily grant, That we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of such a loss; but this is no confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of my Text. We may complain,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63307:13"/>
and give Ease and Vent to our Sorrows
by such Complaints, while we do not
complain against God, and accuse him fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly.
To submit to the Will of God,
which is here exprest by being <hi>Dumb, and
not opening our Mouths,</hi> does not signifie,
not to feel our losses and Sufferings, or not
to complain of them; but not to reproach
the divine Providence, nor to cast off
our hope and Trust in God. <hi>Job</hi> felt
his Sufferings, and complained of them
in as moving and tragical Expressions, as
any other Man could, and yet is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to us, as an Example, of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Patience, because he did not <hi>charge
God folishly,</hi> nor cast off his Hope in
him.</p>
            <p>This we never can have any reason for;
for whatever we suffer, it is a wise and
merciful Providence which inflicts it: But
yet Mankind are very apt, when they
suffer hard things, either to deny a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63307:14"/>
or which is more absurd, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
to reproach it; for if there be
a God, he is Wise, and Good, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
and Just, which is the Notion all
Mankind have of God; and if this God
governs the World, all Events are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Wisdom, Justice, and Goodness;
and all thinking Men, in cool and sober
Thoughts, will be ashamed to quarrel
with such a Providence.</p>
            <p>But yet we are very apt to ask Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
which we cannot easily answer, and
then to make our own Ignorance an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against the Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>As in the Case before us, the sudden
and untimely Death of an excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
who had Strength and Vigour of
Age, which promised a much longer Life,
and who would certainly have done great
Good to the World, as long as she had
lived; but is cut off in the Vigour and
Strength of Age, and all her Thoughts,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63307:14"/>
even all her great and excellent Designs
of doing Good to the World, perish with
her; while Tyrants and Oppressors live
to be the Plagues and Scourges of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Now though we do not know the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Reasons of such Providences, yet
it is easie to frame some general Answers,
which may satisfie all the Friends of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>If the Objection relates to our selves,
who suffer by this loss, there is a very plain
Answer to it, but a very terrible one;
That God is Angry with us, and by the
untimely Death of an excellent Princess,
who made it her whole Study and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to do us Good, threatens his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against us, if we do not take Care
to prevent them by a timely Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>If the Objection relates only to the
untimely Death of an excellent Princess,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63307:15"/>
that the should so suddenly be snatched
away from the Joys and Pleasures of a
Throne; this is no Objection at all; at
least not an Objection fit for Christians
to make: For can we think, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and most happy Monarch, loses any
thing by the Exchange, if he be transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Earth to Heaven? That the
Joys of Paradise are not greater than a
Crown? Our good <hi>Queen</hi> did not think
so, who knew what an Earthly Crown
meant, but was willing to part with it
for Heaven; who saw Death approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without fear, and prepared to receive
its Stroke with that calmness and sedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mind, as nothing could give but
an innocent Conscience, and much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Hopes</p>
            <p>But as for our selves, though we must
acknowledge that we have received a very
great Loss, in the Death of an excellent
<hi>Queen,</hi> yet we have no reason to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63307:15"/>
at Providence, while God preserves
our King to go in and out before us. We
had indeed perpetual Day; and no sooner
was one Sun withdrawn, but another as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
our Horizon, with equal Lustre
and Brightness: This was a peculiar
Happiness which we never had before,
and which the Necessity of our Affairs
required now; but though God has cut
us short in this, we have a King still,
the Terror of <hi>France,</hi> and the Protector
of <hi>Europe;</hi> a King, whom Affection as
well as Blood has Naturalized to us;
who loves our Nation and our Church,
which he has once delivered, and God
grant he may live long to settle and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
both. We have no reason to fear
our Enemies, either at home or abroad,
while a Prince is at the Helm, who wants
neither Counsel nor Courage; especially
if we follow that noble Example, which
the Two Houses of Parliament have set
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63307:16"/>
us, to give him such fresh Assurances of
our fidelity, as may strengthen his Hands
against his and our Enemies Abroad, and
make him easie and safe at Home.</p>
            <p>To conclude, This is God's doing, and
it becomes us to be dumb, and not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
our Mouthes, because he has done it:
He is the Sovereign and Unaccountable
Lord of the World; who shall say unto
him, What dost thou? Life and Death
are in his Hands; the Fates of Princes
and Kingdoms. That he has done it,
should be a sufficient reason to us to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
because though he does things great
and wonderful, and beyond our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
yet he never does any thing but
what is wise and good: This I'm sure
is the most effectual way to turn even the
severest Judgments into Blessings, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence
God, and to humble our selves
under his mighty Hand, and to implore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63307:16"/>
his Mercy, to repair those Breaches he has
made upon us. We must not complain
of Providence; but we may make our
Complaints to God, and be the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
in our Prayers for the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our King. The Death of our
excellent Queen both calls for, and will
justifie and recommend such humble Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities;
and the Preservation of our
King, will, in a great measure, make up
this Loss to us; <hi>Which God of his infinite
Mercy grant, through our Lord Jesus
Christ; to whom with the Father, and the
Holy Ghost, be Honour, Glory, and Power,
now and for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>
