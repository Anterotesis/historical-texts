            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Brief Essay concerning the
INDEPENDENCY
OF
Church-Power.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the non-complying Bishops and
Clergy were at the Revolution duly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
in their respective Charges, is by
none denyed; that they have not as yet
been deprived by a Synod of Bishops, or
had any Ecclesiastical Censure passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gâinst
them, is equally evident. For tho' there were some
Bishops in the Upper House, when the Act of Deprivation
passed against their Brethren; yet their Votes (supposing
them Legal) were Foreign to their Character; and given
in virtue of a meerly Civil Capacity; they voted not as
Bishops, but as Lords of Parliament: And since the Right
by which they sit is a Lay-privilege, The Acts which
they do, in consequence of such a Privilege, must be of
the same Secular Nature; the Case standing thus, the
Question is,
<hi>Whether an Act of Parliament, supposing it legally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted;
can void an Ecclesiastical Authority, and
unmake the Governors of the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall briefly undertake to maintain the Negative, by
<pb facs="tcp:61081:2"/>

shewing the Churches Power to be distinct from, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
of the State.</p>
            <p>But, to prevent mis-construction, I desire to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that by Church Power, I mean only that which
is purely Spiritual: And that Ecclesiastics, as such, can
make no direct or indirect claim to any other, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>First, They are no less the Subjects of Princes than the
Laity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their meerly Secular Estates, their Civil
Privileges and Jurisdictions, are all under the Cognizance
of the State; of which they may be legally (though not
always equitably) disseized, whenever the Legislative Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a Kingdom shall think fit to do it: Having
premised this, I shall endeavour to prove their Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
in things purely relating to their Function.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the Original of Ecclesiastical Authority.</item>
               <item>2. From the End and Design of it.</item>
               <item>3. From the Practice of the Primitive Church.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. From the Original of Ecclesiastical Authority. The
Power of Governing the Church, and performing the
Offices of Religion, is neither any Gift of the People, nor
held by Commission from Kings and Princes; It springs
from a greater Original, and derives no lower than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it self. Our Blessed Saviour, who Redeemed the
Church, was pleased to settle the Administration of it by
his own Appointment: From Him the Apostles received
Authority to teach and govern such as were Converted by
them; the Words of their Commission are plain, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with all imaginable Advantage. <hi>As my Father
hath sent me, even so send I you; whosoever sins ye remit,
they are remitted,</hi> &amp;c. St. <hi>John</hi> 20. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23. Upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the Apostles are called <hi>the Ambassadors and Ministers
of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1. And the People are commanded <hi>to
obey and submit themselves to those</hi> who have this Spiritual
Authority, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Neither was this Power to expire
with the Apostles, but be conveyed by Succession
through all Ages of the World; there being the same
cause for its Continuance, as for its first Institution: And
accordingly we find from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that one reason of his
giving <hi>Titus</hi> the Super-intendency of <hi>Crete,</hi> was to <hi>Ordain
Elders in every City,</hi> Tit. 1. 5. Thus <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> (1. Ep.
<hi>ad
Cor.</hi>) tells us, the Apostles in their Travels used to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61081:3"/>
Ordain Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the advantage of such as were
only Christians in prospect, as well as for those who were
already converted. And thus the Sacred Order has been
continued without interruption for near 1700 Years: Now
our Saviour, we know, was no Temporal Prince. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to interpose in a case of Property; and declared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
that his Kingdom was not of this World, St. <hi>Luke</hi>
12. 14. St. <hi>John</hi> 18. 36. From whence 'tis plain, that the
Authority which our Saviour gave the Church, can have
no dependance upon the State, because it was never deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from thence. 'Tis true, all Power, both Sacred and
Civil, came originally from God; yet under the <hi>Jewish,</hi>
and especially under the Christian Institution, the Crown
and Mitre have been divided: And tho' the same Persons
are capable of both; yet the Claim must be made upon a
different Account, and conveyed by Titles perfectly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct.
And since the Ecclesiastical Authority doth not
hold of the Civil Magistrate, it cannot be forfeited to
Him: As the State cannot Consecrate Bishops and Priests,
so neither can they recal their Character, or restrain them
in the Exercise of their Function; there being no reason a
Privilege should be either extinguished, or limited by
those who were never Masters of the Grant: For what a
Man has no Power to give, he can have no Right to take
away. This will further appear, if we consider the Means
by which the Advantages of Christianity are conveyed to
us. Now that the Sacraments are necessary for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is evident from Scripture: For concerning Baptism
'tis said, <hi>That except a Man be born of Water, and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> St. John 3.
5. And the Lord's Supper is stiled by St. <hi>Paul</hi> (1 Cor. 10.
6.) <hi>The Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ;</hi> that is
the Means by which the Benefits of Christ's Death are
applyed to us. So that without being partakers of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
we can have no pretence to the Covenant of
Grace, no Title to the Assistance of God's Spirit; nor any
Assurance of a Blessed Immortality.</p>
            <p>Now, I suppose, none of the Laity will pretend to an
Authority to Administer the Sacraments: They will not
challenge a Right to Seal Covenants in God's Name; or
to represent Him in Acts of Solemn Blessing and Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
No Man, (as the Apostle argues) <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>take</hi> this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61081:4"/>
               <hi>Honour</hi> to <hi>himself,</hi> but <hi>he that</hi> is called <hi>of God</hi> as was <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
Heb. 5. 4. The Fate of <hi>Corah</hi> and <hi>Uzziah, (Numb.</hi> 16.
2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.) are sufficient to deter all Secular Persons
from an Encroachment of this Nature; which if made,
God would both punish the Usurpation, and null the Act:
As a Prince would be obliged to do in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if any Person should forge a Commission in his
Name. Now since the Sacraments, which are both ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make us Members of the Church, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
the Advantages of Christianity to us; are by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
special Appointment entrusted with the Clergy,
and the Administration of them is lodged in their Hands;
from hence it follows, that those who have the sole Right
of Admitting into a Society, or Excluding from it; and
of dispensing the Rewards and Punishments, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and only Governors of that Society; and can have no
Dependance upon any other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Independency of Ecclesiastical Authority
may be proved from the End and Design of it.</p>
            <p>I suppose I need not prove that the Christian Religion,
as contained in the New Testament, is the last Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which God intends to make to the World. Now this
being granted, we must suppose that our Blessed Saviour
Founded his Church upon such Laws, and gave it such
lasting Principles of Government, as should best main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
its Continuance, and secure those important Truths
He had entrusted it with. Least of all can we imagine He
would build it upon a Sandy Foundation, and make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Arbitrary Power of its Enemies. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
foresaw that all the Princes of the World would
disbelieve, and many of them Persecute his Doctrine for
several Ages together; and therefore would be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
Persons to have been trusted with the Sovereign
Administration of Ecclesiastical Affairs. Had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church been derived from them, or depended
upon their Allowance; Christianity had been a very short
liv'd Religion, and never out-grown its Infancy. In this
Case, the Publick Assemblies, Ordinations, Sacraments,
and Discipline, must have lain at the Mercy of Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
and the Clergy ought not to have executed their
Function, nor taken care of their Flock, unless the Civil
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61081:4"/>
Magistrate would have given them leave. For if the
Spiritual Supremacy were the Right of Princes, tho' they
might possibly abuse the Management of this Prerogative;
yet it ought to lie absolutely at their Disposal, and under
their Regulation: And for any Person to meddle in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Matters without a Commission from them, but
especially against their Commands, would be an open
Violation of their Right; which no Man ought to be
guilty of, tho' for the support of the best Religion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>we ought not to do Ill that Good may come of it.</hi> And
since no Society can subsist without Government and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;
if the Bishops could Exercise no Spiritual Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
without a Lay-permission, it would be in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrates Power to make the Perpetuity of the
Church impracticable; and the Christian Religion would
depend upon the pleasure of the Prince. But besides the
Absurdity of this way of Reasoning, we have in the</p>
            <p>Third Place, The Practice of the Apostles, and of the
whole Primitive Church, to prove, that the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Authority was perfectly <hi>sui juris,</hi> and never under the
Controul of the Secular Magistrate. Thus when the
Sanhedrim of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who acted by the Authority of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and had the Assistance of the Captain of the
Temple; when they Imprisoned the Apostles, and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them not to speak at all, nor teach in the Name of
Iesus,</hi> Act. 4. 19. to this their Answer is plain and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive;
<hi>whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto
you more than unto God, judge ye,</hi> verse 20. that is to say,
they had a Commission from Heaven to preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
which they were bound to execure; and which no
Temporal Jurisdiction had any Authority to revoke.
Whereas had the Church been under the Check of the
State in Matters purely Spiritual, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi>
were much to blame for <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efusing to obey their Superiors;
they ought to have acquie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ced in the Sanhedrims Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
and not to have pur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ued their Function after they
were so solemnly silenc'd; and tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by those whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
owned to be <hi>Rulers of the People,</hi> Act. 4. 8. Either
therefore the Church must be Constituted Independent of
the State; or the Apostles can never be cleared of the
Charge of Sedition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61081:5"/>The same Imputation will, upon the Modern Princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples,
affect the Bishops of the Universal Church for the
first 300 Years; who held publick Assemblies, Governed
their Clergy, and their People, and perform'd all parts of
their Office, not only without any Authority from their
respective Princes, but often contrary to their express
Commands; which matter of Fact is so well known,
that it would be superfluous to enlarge upon the proof of
it.</p>
            <p>If it be said, that these were Heathen Princes, but
when the Emperors became part of the Church, the Case
was otherwise.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, That the change of the Emperor's
Religion could not gain them any such new Jurisdiction
as is pretended. For as Magistracy in general does not
imply a Right to Spiritual Authority; so neither does
the denomination of Christian give it any such Advantage.
For, I suppose, Spiritual Dominion is no more founded in
Grace, than Temporal. In short, if Princes receive any
such Authority by virtue of their Christianity, it must be
conveyed either by Revelation, or implied in the notion
of Baptism.</p>
            <p>As to the Point of Revelation; The Scripture no where
teaches us, that Princes, upon their turning Christian,
should have their Commission enlarged with the addition
of Episcopal, or Priestly Power. I grant, it was foretold,
<hi>that Kings should be nursing Fathers to the Church,</hi> Isa. 49. 23.
but then it is added, that <hi>they shall bow down to Her with
their Faces towards the Earth;</hi> and elsewhere, <hi>that they
shall Minister to Her, or serve Her,</hi> Isa. 60. 10. We see
therefore, we must not strain upon the Letter in these
Expressions; nor press the Metaphor too far, unless we
will conclude Contradictions: Therefore the Character of
their being Nursing Fathers, is sufficiently fulfilled by
their affording Christians Protection and Encouragement
under their Government, and by finishing the Contempt
of Religion. But that the Magistrates Conversion should
alter the Seat of Ecclesiastical Government, put a Period
to the Apostolical Succession, and dissolve the Church
into the State, is not so much as the least hinted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61081:5"/>And as for Baptism, there is no Authority of any
kind implied in the Receiving that Sacrament; If there
were, every Christian would have an equal share in this
Privilege; which would make the Constitution of the
Church monstrous, in which all its Members would be
Governors, and so none under an Obligation of being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
            <p>If it is objected, that the <hi>Oxford</hi> Greek Manuscript,
published the last Year, has proved by a Collection of
several Instances, that Bishops, though unjustly deprived,
have for the sake of Peace, laid down their Function, and
not contested their Right with their Successors, provided
they were not Hereticks: And that the People made no
scruple to Communicate with the New Bishops.</p>
            <p>To this it may be returned, that this Manuscript has
been lately undertaken, and shewn to be altogether unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the Publisher's Design. (Vid. <hi>A Vindication of
the Deprived Bishops,</hi> &amp;c.) where the Learned Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
has proved.</p>
            <p>First, that though the Instances alledged in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript
were applicable to the present Dispute, they
would fall far short of gaining the Cause. I shall just
mention some of his Reasons.</p>
            <p>He hath shewn the Author of the Manuscript to be defective
in point of Antiquity, and little more than 400 Years Old; and
that none of the Instances rise higher than the fourth Century;
that they are not universal in respect of Place, all of them being
confin'd to the Greek Church; and most to the single See of
<hi>Constantinople.</hi> Farther, the Learned Vindicator observes,
that the Precedents cited by the Manuscript are nakedly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
without shewing, whether the People, who deserted the
Deprived Bishops, believed them unjustly Deprived. If they
did not, 'tis no wonder they withdrew their Obedience: Neither
do his Instances prove, that the People thought them tried by
an incompetent Authority, as well as unjustly deprived. Now
this ought to have been proved, to have made the Manuscript
serviceable to the Publishers purpose. For, though an unjust
Sentence ought to be submitted to, when pronounced by a proper
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61081:6"/>
Iudge; yet when the Cause does not lie within the Cognizance
of the Court, all the Proceedings are null and void.</p>
            <p>It should have been made out, that the Bishops insisted on
their Right, and challenged Submission from their People; for
if they acquiesced, the Case does not come up to the Matter in
Hand. But here the Manuscript fails, as it does also in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether the Behaviour of the Bishops and People was
founded upon Principles at that time owned. For, if want of
due Information, or Fear, or Interest made them act as they
did; we have no reason to be governed by their Examples.</p>
            <p>The Vindicator p<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>eeds to give in Counter-evidence, and
proves from St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who disputes the Case of Sehism at
large, and lived in an Age very valuable for Antiquity and
Integrity; That the Catholick Church maintained the Right of
Canonical Bishops, both against Secular Magistrates, and
Schismatical Intruders. As appear'd in the Case of <hi>Cornelius</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was owned by the whole Church; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Opposition made by <hi>Decius</hi> the Emperor, and
<hi>Novarian</hi> the Anti-bishop. And <hi>Martian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arles</hi>
was refused the Communion of his Brethren, for owning that of
Schismaticks. He observes, that the Principles insisted on by
St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> were not peculiar to his own Age, but maintained
likewise by St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and <hi>Optatus,</hi> in their Disputes
against the Donatists.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Vindicator pursues the Argument, and proves,</hi>
the Anti-bishops and their Adherents guilty of Heresy; for the
avoiding of which, the Author of the Manuscript himself allows
separation to be justifiable and necessary: this charge he pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
upon them, not only because they defend their Novelties by
Principles, but by such Principles, as strike at the Root of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Government. For, their being Bishops supposes all
Spiritual, as well as Civil Authority derived from the State;
which Doctrines make it impossible for the Church to subsist in a
time of Persecution. And since no Society, whether Spiritual
or Secular, can stand without an intrinsick Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the Advantages of Society cannot be had any longer
than the Society whence they arise continues. From hence it
follows, that those Opinions which destroy any Society, must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all those Advantages, which were design'd in the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and guarded by it. Such Tenents, when they relate to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61081:6"/>
Church, may, with propriety enough be called Fundamental Errors;
which brings them under the Modern, and received notion of
Heresy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Learned Vindicator, in the second part of his
Book, goes on, and shows,</hi> that though the <hi>Oxford</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
(how favourable soever) would have been a very slender
Defence for the Anti-bishops, and their Party; yet they have
not so much as the Countenance of this Record; the Instances
produced being Foreign to the present Controversy. For in all
the Cases mentioned in this Manuscript (excepting that of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linicus,</hi>
which is dubious, and not to their purpose;) either
the Deprivations were passed in an Ecclesiastical Synod; or were
grounded upon Resignation; or Heresy; or else the Deprived
Bishops insisted upon their Right; and with their People formed
distinct Communions from their Intruders. And thus in the
Course of 900 Years, which is the length of the Manuscript;
they have not one Instance to prove, that a Lay-Deprivation
had any Force against the Spiritual Authority of the Church.
So singular, as well as destructive are the Principles our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
establish themselves upon.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The Learned Vindicator subjoins a Collection of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
drawn from those called the Apostles, from the Council of
<hi>Gangra, Antioch, Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which in
all rational Conjecture were added by the Author of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,
though omitted by the Publisher. In these Canons 'tis
solemnly Decreed,</p>
            <p>That if any Deacon, or Priest, should despise their Bishop,
and hold separate Meetings from him, unless he were deprived
by a Synod, they were to be degraded: This Fault in the Laity
was punished with Excommunication. And if a Bishop withdrew
Communion from his Metropolitan (unless Synodically deprived)
he was to be deposed. <hi>By all which we may understand,
how far these Councils were from supposing that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate had any Power to deprive Ecclesiasticks
of their Spiritual Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are some of the Heads upon which the Learned
Vindicator proceeds; and which he maintains with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able
strength of Reason and Authority. If the Reader
is inclin'd to see the Argument pursu'd at Length, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61081:7"/>
with its just Advantages, he may please to consult his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Discourse.</p>
            <p>From the Independency of the Church thus proved,
these Conclusions naturally follow.</p>
            <p>First, That it is no more in the Power of the State to
deprive the Church Governors of their purely Spiritual
Authority, than it is in the Power of the Church to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Magistracy, or disincorporate the State. For
all Punishment and Censure supposes Jurisdiction in the
Person who inflicts it. But this Supposition is inconsistent
with the Notion of Independency: Those who are Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
being in this sense equal, so far as their Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
reaches; and have no Privileges to Command, or
Duties to Obey on either side. From whence it follows,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Bishops, notwithstanding the Lay-Deprivation,
have the same Spiritual Authority they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had; and their People the same Obligation to remain
in their Communion. The Consequence of which is,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Anti-bishops who are possessed of
their Sees, have no Authority to Govern. These the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are bound to avoid upon the Score of Intrusion and
Schism. I say, upon the Score of Schism. For since they
have subjected the Power of the Keys to the Civil Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;
given up, as much as in them lies, the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Rights of the Church, and made the Being of Religion
precarious, and dependent on the Pleasure of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate:
Since they have either Usurped the Authority of
Lawful and Canonical Bishops, or own'd those who are
guilty of such Invasions; the Charge of Schism and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
must lie at their own Doors. Such dangerous Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
as these, as long as they are maintained, must cut
off all Religious Correspondence, and make Communion
impracticable. Insomuch that those who joyn with the
Intruders, will justly fall under the same Imputation of
Schism, for revolting from their Lawful Bishops, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
themselves One with those who are divided from the
Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This Privilege of Independency, in Matters
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61081:7"/>
purely Spiritual, will reach the Inferior Clergy. For their
Authority being derived from the Bishops, and of the
same Nature with theirs, it can be subordinate, or rela<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted,
to no other Head of Jurisdiction: And therefore these
can be no more discharged the Exercise of their Function
by a Lay Power than the Bishops.</p>
            <p>Thus we see Communion with the pretended Church of
<hi>England</hi> must be Unlawful, even supposing the Law-Authority
unexceptionable, and that the Church-Service
remain unaltered.</p>
            <p>However, let us put the Case (for we may suppose any
thing,) that the depriving Authority was it self defective,
and illegal, and no less a Breach of the Constitution, than
an Encroachment upon the Church: Suppose farther, that
the Publick Prayers are stuffed with Immoral Petitions;
that God is made a Party to Injustice; and invoked to
prosper that which He hath threatned to punish: Such
singular Mixtures as these must give the Service a very
ill Complexion, and make Devotion look like a solemn
Iniquity.</p>
            <p>To say, we dont joyn in the exceptionable Petitions is
no answer.</p>
            <p>First, Because the Notion of Communion, the Prayers
in their Form and Rubrick, suppose the contrary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we may joyn in Communion where some
part of the Worship is sinful; then, by Parity of Reason,
we may Communicate with all Sorts of Christians; and
not only so, but with <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans;</hi> because all
these Divisions of Religion acknowledge the same God,
and have many things which are pious and commendable
in their Worship. But this part of the Argument, having
receiv'd Satisfaction from a good Hand already, needs not
be pursued any farther.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore make two or three Remarks, and so
conclude.</p>
            <p>First, This Spiritual Independency of the Church can
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61081:8"/>
give no just grounds of Jealousie to the State. Princes
need not to be awaken'd into any Suspicions of being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
in their Administrations, or having any part of
their Prerogative wrested from them; this Privilege pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to no Temporal Jurisdiction, but leaves all the
Branches of Justice and Property to the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
It never offers to support it self by violence, but
gives up Seditious Church-men to the Correction of the
State, as well as others: It allows no Liberty to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
Princes for misfortunes of Belief; It teaches no
Man to be False and Treacherous for the sake of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
nor founds any Merit upon Ingratitude and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
In short, this Authority relates only to Conscience:
And tho' it may challenge Obedience within a proper
compass; and the contempt of it will be deeply reveng'd
hereafter; yet since there is no Force claim'd for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of its Censures, it must be perfectly inoffensive
here.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Since even the Inferior Clergy are, with res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to their Spiritual Authority, Independent of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
certainly private Persons, tho' never so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
should allow them the same Advantage. Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
we see, have their Authority from God; and are
therefore his Ministers, not the Peoples; the Branches
of their Office, such as Instruction, Absolution, and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
imply Super-intendency, and Power, and ought not
to come under a servile Character. For, as on the one
side, 'tis a fault to grow vain upon their <hi>Relation,</hi> to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
the meanest Christian, or, as the Apostle speaks,
to be have themselves <hi>as Lords over God's Heritage,</hi> 1 S. Pet.
5. 3. So 'tis no less on the other, to prostitute their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to <hi>Greatness;</hi> and make themselves Servants to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi>
and <hi>State.</hi> And without doubt they may find other
ways of paying a due Regard to Persons, without making
themselves and Religion ridiculous. Neither will the
Consideration of Mony, or Entertainment degrade their
Character, and make them <hi>BELONG</hi> to those of
whom they receive it. For Money is given to Parents,
to Princes, and to God himself; and therefore does not
always suppose Subjection in the Receiver. When <hi>Micah</hi>
contracted with the <hi>Levite</hi> to perform the Offices of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in his Family; he was far from thinking he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61081:8"/>
a Servant; as we may see, Judges 17. 10. <hi>Dwell with
me, and be unto me a Father, and a Priest, and I will give
thee ten Shekels of Silver,</hi> &amp;c. And as for the Obligation,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought there was a fair Equivalent returned;
as we may perceive by his Question. <hi>If we have sow<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing, if we shall reap
your carnal things?</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 11. Indeed the notion of a
Priest supposes a peculiar, and incommunicable Relation
to God Almighty: And in this sense, Natural, as well as
Revealed Religion has understood it; the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
tho' they were vain enough, yet never pretended
to have Priests <hi>BELONG</hi> to them till they were dead,
and Deified. And if any are so extravagant as to exceed
the Pride of a Heathen Emperor, tho' in Charity we ought
to pray for them; yet I am afraid 'tis to little purpose
to pray with them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Clergy ought to form Assemblies for the
Service of God: Since our late Brethren have disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
us of our own Churches, and made it Impracticable
to come to theirs. Since Violence has removed us from
the one, and Schism from the other: Since we are banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Holy Ground, and driven from the <hi>Place</hi> where
God's <hi>Honour</hi> used to <hi>dwell.</hi> Since we cannot perform his
Worship with those Circumstances of Advantage, with
that Magnificence and Solemnity which were to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed;
let us carry the Opportunity as far as it will reach;
and do our Duty in the best manner we can. God, as the
Scripture speaks, <hi>is not</hi> confined <hi>to Temples made with Hands.</hi>
In a state of Hardship, Necessity and Devotion may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate;
and the Primitive <hi>Upper-Room</hi> will not be unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
Above all things, let us take Care not to neglect
the Service of God; least we grow indifferent to all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and by avoiding Schism, sink into Profaneness; 'tis
not the danger of Suffering will excuse us: For it was in
a time of Persecution, when the Apostle charged the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
<hi>not to forsake the assembling themselves together,</hi> Heb.
10. 25.</p>
            <p>Many are the Advantages of Publick Worship above
that which is performed in Private.</p>
            <p>By the former we pay a more solemn Homage to God,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61081:9"/>
and make a more open Acknowledgement of our Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.
In our joint and uniform Petitions we declare the
Harmony of our Judgments, and the Extent of our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and that we are willing to assist each other <hi>at the
Throne of Grace.</hi> Besides, the Occasion of coming, and the
Example of those that come, are not without their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
These Circumstances are apt to keep up Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and improve good Dispositions, and make us more
affected with the Impressions of Religion. Farther, by
our united Prayers, we may hope for a greater Support
from Heaven, than from single and solitary Devotions. It
was upon Assemblies that the miraculous Gifts of the
Holy Ghost were bestowed, as we may learn from several
Places of Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 2. 4. 31. 10. 44. And though,
since our Religion has been fully Confirm'd, these extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Assistances have been withdrawn: Yet when we
meet in Obedience to God's Command, when we serve
him with the greatest Reverence and Resolution, we may
reasonably expect a proportionable Blessing. And as the
Publick Services are more beneficial, so the use of them
can never be more necessary, than when the Church lies
under Disorder and Distress. When Atheism grows upon
us; when Virtue seems ready to expire, and the <hi>Faithful
fall from among the Children of Men;</hi> when Temptations have
the greatest Weight, and Perseverance is pressed, and
we cannot maintain our Innocency without more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Difficulty; then is the proper Time to call in all
the Aids of Religion, and to put our Devotions in the
b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st posture of Advantage. Upon such a melancholy
Occasion, we have need, if ever, to unite our Prayers,
and frequent the Sacrament, and fortify our Minds with
all the Supports of mutual and supernatural Assistance. To
stand off from danger, and confine our selves to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Security; and be frighted from Publick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
looks like the Conduct of an Army that disbands
at the Approach of an Enemy. The Honour of God,
and the Good of the Church, are (without doubt) best
promoted by an open Profession, by Resolution, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Bravery. Those who thus distinguish themselves
carry Light and Heat in their Examples. They awaken
Inquiry, and encourage Imitation, and transfuse a Spirit
of G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eatness into others. Now the Interest of another
World, all Christians grant to be incomparably the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61081:9"/>
greatest, and where there is no proportion in the Value,
one would think there should be no difficulty in the
Choice.</p>
            <p>Let nothing therefore discourage us in our Duty; for
whatever wordly Inconveniences may happen, we may
be assured of the Divine Protection: And, besides the
future Rewards of Constancy and Patience, we shall have
the present Satisfaction of Suffering for the best Cause,
and the best Communion.</p>
