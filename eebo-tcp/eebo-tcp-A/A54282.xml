            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Honourable, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Commons Houſe, now Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of <hi>Arundell Penruddock,</hi> widdow, late wife of <hi>John Penruddock,</hi> Eſquire, deceaſed.</head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> the late pretended Protector, having traiterouſly murdered the late King, by force broken the Parliament, and baniſhed his Majeſty out of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the Petitioners husband, with many others of his Majeſties Loyal Subjects in the year 1654. according to their bounden Duty, and Allegiance, and by virtue of his Majeſties Commiſſion, endeavoured by lawfull Arms, the ſuppreſſion of the Forces of the ſaid <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and the reſtitution of his Majeſty to his Right and Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>But the forces of the ſaid <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> under the command of Colonel <hi>Crook</hi> over-pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Petitioners Husband and his party, the Petitioners Husband and his party were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and impriſoned.</p>
            <p>And afterwards the ſaid pretended Protector, did grant out a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner</hi> unto <hi>John Glyn, William Steele,</hi> Serjeants at Law, and <hi>John Liſle,</hi> Eſquire, and others for the tryall of the petitioners husband, and the reſt of his party, although contrary to Articles made with them by Colonel <hi>Crooke,</hi> who afterwards perfidiouſly denyed them.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid pretended Commiſſioners, proceeding to execute that Commiſſion, cauſed the petitioners Husband (amongſt others) to be Arraigned at <hi>Exeter,</hi> at which try all the ſaid, Serjeant <hi>Glyn,</hi> and the reſt of the Commiſſioners, refuſed to allow the petitioners husband any Counſell although he took many particular exceptions to the Indictment, both for the matter and form.</p>
            <p>They alſo declared to the people and jury that to raiſe forces for his Majeſty, againſt the ſaid pretended Protector, was Treaſon, within the Statute of 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and that Arms taken againſt him, were as againſt the King, within the meaning of that Statute.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the Petitioners Husband was by a Jury (which Sir <hi>John Coppleſton,</hi> the then Sheriff) had maliciouſly packed and returned for that purpoſe) found guilty of Treaſon, and Judgement of death being paſſed upon him, by the ſaid Commiſſioners, he was afterwards beheaded by the Command of the ſaid sir <hi>John Coppleſton,</hi> to the unexpreſſible grief and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable loſſe of the diſconſolate Petitioner, and her fatherleſſe Children.</p>
            <p>That Captain <hi>James Dewy</hi> in the County of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> before Conviction, ſeized upon the eſtate of the Petitioners late husband, to the value of one thouſand pound, and converted the ſame to his own and the pretended Protectors uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which</hi> proceedings of the ſaid Commiſſioners being againſt all Right, and Juſtice, and (as the petitioner believes) againſt the Conſciences and Judgements of the Commiſſioners themſelves (they being learned in the Laws) and the Commiſſion being onely ſet on foot to maintain the Tyranny and Uſurpation of the ſaid pretended Protector againſt his Sacred Majeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Petitioner in all humility, prayes that although ſhe hath no remedy at Law by any appeale, againſt the ſaid Commiſſioners, yet that the ſaid Arbitrary and Malicious Judgement, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the ſaid Commiſſioners, contrary to the known Laws, may be condemned and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to the end that the ſaid commiſſioners may be made exemplary in this puniſhment, She humbly prayes, that the Offence of the ſaid Commiſſioners may be excepted out of the General Pardon and Oblivion:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that her ſaid Husbands eſtate may be restored by the ſaid</hi> Dewy <hi>and others, who ſeized the ſame, to the Petitioner and her Children.</hi>
