            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Shal I, Sir Iohn, a man of perfect age,</l>

               <l>For holy words were then all Hebrew and Greek.</l>

               <l>Pack-man, if thou believe the Legendary:</l>
               <l>The Mass is elder far then Christ or Mary:</l>
               <l>For all the Patriarchs, both more and less,</l>

               <speaker>Pack-man.</speaker>
               <l>But good Sir John, spake all these Fathers Latine?</l>
               <l>And said they Mass in Surplices and Satine?</l>
               <l>Could they speak Latine long ere Latine grew?</l>
               <l>And without Latine no Mass can be true.</l>
               <l>And as for Hereticks that now translate it.</l>

               <l>By Christ to Peter, when he went to heaven.</l>

               <l>Poor Peter, only thrice, did Christ deny:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36848:6"/>Once was too much: but soon he did espy</l>
               <l>How that he rashly had forsworn his Master:</l>
               <l>For which Christ shortly did apply a plaster</l>
               <l>To his sick Soul, and plac'd his grace therein,</l>
               <l>Which is the only antidote for sin.</l>
               <l>Christ turn'd and look'd on him, and was content</l>
               <l>To pardon Peter, since he did repent.</l>
               <l>But I can prove your Pope, Sir John to be</l>
               <l>Into a great deal worse estate then he:</l>
               <l>For Popes do dayly both in word and deed</l>
               <l>Deny our Lord, as after ye may read:</l>
               <l>Who derogates from Christ the full perfection</l>
               <l>Of mediation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for our Souls election;</l>
               <l>And say, his sufferings cannot satisfie</l>
               <l>For all our sins, and cure our misery:</l>
               <l>But mix their humane merite (vile ambition!)</l>
               <l>The foolish brain-sick birth of mans tradition:</l>
               <l>And als the works of Supererogation,</l>
               <l>With Christs true merite, our sole consolation.</l>
               <l>Denyes that Christ can be his only Savior:</l>
               <l>Can ye call this a Christian-like behavior?</l>
               <l>No, that ye cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we may espy all</l>
               <l>Such dealing is of Christ a flat denyal.</l>
               <l>But this your Pope doth mishently maintain,</l>
               <l>That humane merite mercy must obtain:</l>
               <l>What humane merite means, I have no skill,</l>
               <l>Go ye to Heaven by any means ye will:</l>
               <l>I hope in God that heaven I shal inherite</l>
               <l>Through Christ his only mercy-worthy merite.</l>
               <l>Your Pope denyes his Lord without repentance,</l>
               <l>For dayly profit: and draws near the sentence</l>
               <l>Of Judas case; For when the Lord had told him</l>
               <l>He should betray him, then he shortly sold him</l>
               <l>Unto the Jews, and thirty pence did take,</l>
               <l>Too smal a sum his Savior to forsake.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:36848:6"/>Yet after that he fain would have repented,</l>
               <l>But not so soon his sin he had resented:</l>
               <l>He forth-with ran in haste, and hang'd himself,</l>
               <l>Who sold his Savior for vile worldly pelf.</l>
               <l>For Judas one, each Pope may compt five hunder</l>
               <l>For every day, and do not at it wonder,</l>
               <l>Nor think him damnified by such transgression,</l>
               <l>For 'tis the richest point of his profession,</l>
               <l>And is the finest feather in his wing,</l>
               <l>Which makes him loath to quite such trafficking.</l>
               <l>And so your Pope not only doth deny Christ,</l>
               <l>But Judas-like, he sels, and Papists buy Christ.</l>

               <l>Some of the Order of Dominican,</l>
               <l>Some of the Order of proud Franciscan.</l>
               <l>And think ye not the Romish Church doth erre,</l>
               <l>When before Christ, Saint Francis they prefer?</l>
               <l>They make Christ (only) but as an Orator,</l>

               <l>And yet, Sir John, I'le show you what a story,</l>
               <l>Your ancient Fathers tell of Purgatory.</l>
               <l>They do affirm that Antichristian Cell,</l>

               <l>Untill by pray'r Gods anger be relented.</l>
               <l>And the confession hereof is, as saith</l>
               <l>Your Bellarmine, a point of Catholick faith:</l>
               <l>And so must be undoubtedly believed;</l>
               <l>Where-out, who payes most, soonest is relieved:</l>
               <l>Not by good faith, but only by good deeds,</l>
               <l>And pratling Pater nosters on their beads:</l>
               <l>By dayly sacrifices of the living,</l>
               <l>And weekly rents, and offerings largely giving:</l>
               <l>And by their publick, and proclamed alms,</l>

               <l>There was another mysterie then meaned;</l>
               <l>To wit, Matthias free election,</l>
               <l>And so Saint Peter gave direction,</l>
               <l>That (all) the six score there should bear record</l>
               <l>Of their proceedings then before the Lord:</l>
               <l>The choosing of a Pastor was in hand,</l>
               <l>Which if the Church allow not, cannot stand:</l>
               <l>And so Matthias, through the power of Heaven,</l>
               <l>By lot was held as one of the eleven.</l>
               <l>Then sayes the text, all these were still together:</l>
               <l>What all these were, let any man consider.</l>
               <l>The twelve, say I, in the last verse before;</l>
               <l>And not make Leap-year of eleven verse more,</l>
               <l>To draw all back to these hundred and twentie:</l>
               <l>Indeed this way we should have tongues in plenty:</l>
               <l>And as they differ by twelve verse or lines,</l>
               <l>So are they ten dayes different in times:</l>
               <l>The first upon the day when Christ ascended,</l>
               <l>The other when the holy Ghost descended:</l>
               <l>Such glazen arguments will bide no hammer,</l>
               <l>For they are but ill Logick, and worse Grammer.</l>
               <l>So only twelve receiv'd the holy Ghost,</l>
               <l>And so our Ladie all her tongues hath lost.</l>
               <l>Now for the holy Ghost it's truly tryed,</l>
               <l>His coming down is unto no law tyed,</l>
               <l>Sometimes invisible, and sometimes seen,</l>
               <l>As diversly at divers times hath been.</l>
               <l>His coming needs but to be seen offew,</l>
               <l>His works may serve for witnesses anew;</l>
               <l>And so Saint Paul himself I understand,</l>
               <l>But privatly by Ananias hand.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:36848:12"/>And so, Sir John, to show you all my pack,</l>
               <l>And let you see my breast as well as back;</l>
               <l>I wonder ye consider not the end,</l>
               <l>Why God the holy Ghost in tongues did send:</l>
               <l>Know ye not, Tongues were only given for tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching?</l>
               <l>Know ye not, women are forbidden preaching?</l>
               <l>Yea scarce at home have liberty of speach,</l>
               <l>But ask their husbands, and they for to teach.</l>
               <l>Since women then in Gods word may not walk,</l>
               <l>What should they do with to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues that may not talk?</l>
               <l>And then, Sir John, what worship do ye win,</l>
               <l>Unto our Ladie, when ye bring her in</l>
               <l>Iack-fellow-like with other whole six score,</l>
               <l>Who got the holy Ghost, and she no more?</l>
               <l>And where the Pope hath made her queen of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </l>
               <l>Ye make her but like one of the eleven:</l>
               <l>Surely, Sir John, this is an ill favour'd fitching;</l>
               <l>Ye thrust her from the Hall down to the kitching</l>
               <l>And this is also one of the rare Themes,</l>
               <l>Held by your reverend Iesuits of Rhemes;</l>
               <l>That Latine came not with the holy Ghost,</l>
               <l>When the cloven tongues came at the Pentecost.</l>
               <l>Now, if it came not by the holy Ghost,</l>
               <l>Whence is this holyness whereof ye boast,</l>
               <l>That in it onlie, and none other tongue,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Your last refuge will be unto the Pope:</l>
               <l>So knit up altogether in one rope.</l>
               <l>Then, good Sir John, consider but a little,</l>
               <l>How ye gave unto Marie many a tittle.</l>
               <l>Whereof ye have no warrand in the Word;</l>
               <l>And yet pursue us both with fire and sword,</l>
               <l>As Hereticks, for not doing as ye do:</l>
               <l>Yet what the Word bids, and no more, that we do.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:36848:12"/>Think ye that any man can be so mad.</l>
               <l>As to hold Christ his Savior; and so bad,</l>
               <l>As to hold Marie for his Saviors Mother,</l>
               <l>And not to love her still above all other?</l>
               <l>We love her then, though we believe not in her.</l>
               <l>Nor by will-worship think we for to win her.</l>
               <l>We hold her blessed, for Christs flesh conceiving.</l>
               <l>But far more blessed, for Christs faith receiving:</l>
               <l>She is his Mother, and the Church his Wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>Which was to him more dearer then his life.</l>
               <l>So, if the one could fall out with the other,</l>
               <l>He would respect his Wife, more then his Mother:</l>
               <l>For this is every Spouses carriage,</l>
               <l>But most in this spiritual Marriage.</l>
               <l>And as she's Mother of his humane life.</l>

               <l>I pray thee, Pack-man, this much for to tell me,</l>
               <l>Since thou presumes so far for to excell me.</l>
               <l>Were't not a very reasonable thing:</l>
               <l>If one were going to an earthly King,</l>
               <l>To get forgiveness for some great transgression,</l>
               <l>That he should shortly sute the intercession</l>
               <l>Of some great Favorite, and he for to pass</l>
               <l>To purchase pardon for his high trespass;</l>
               <l>And not the guilty person to proceed</l>
               <l>Presumptuously before the King to plead;</l>
               <l>But use his moyen by his Highness Minion.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pack-man.</speaker>
               <l>Sir John, that motion is not worth an Onion.</l>
               <l>What if the King shal hear the poor mans sute,</l>
               <l>Should he stand silent, as if he were mute?</l>
               <l>No: he should prostrate, lay his fault before him,</l>
               <l>And he himself for pity should implore him:</l>
               <l>For intercessors ofttimes lurks and lingers,</l>
               <l>Except the pleaders largely fill their fingers.</l>
               <l>There is a Proverb in the Scottish lawes,</l>
               <l>A man, a Lyon is, in his own cause.</l>
               <l>Though great abuses be in earthly things,</l>
               <l>We must not so abuse the King of Kings.</l>

               <l>I pray thee, Pack-man, hear me out the rest:</l>
               <l>And so this present purpose to conclude,</l>
               <l>Would ye think any man should be that rude,</l>
               <l>To pray to God, without Saints mediation?</l>
               <l>It would be thought a great abomination:</l>

               <l>That's not the way his fault for to diminish;</l>

               <l>Then she should show her Son what he hath said,</l>

               <l>This same is He, which is the man Christ Jesus,</l>

               <l>In case the holy Prior have no leasure,</l>

               <l>There was but one tongue at the birth of Abel,</l>

               <l>Why not in praying, as well as in preaching?</l>
               <l>Since prayer is the true and full perfection</l>

               <l>And like a Welsh-man swore a great Saint Davies,</l>
               <l>She might content Her well with Creeds &amp; Avees:</l>
               <l>And so the Clergie fearing more confusion,</l>
               <l>Were all contented with the Cooks conclusion.</l>

               <p>Pack-man, this Tale is coyned of the new.</p>

               <speaker>Pack-man.</speaker>
               <l>Sir John, I'll quyte the pack, if't be not true.</l>
               <l>Again, Sir John, ye learned Monks may read.</l>
               <l>How Christ himself taught us of his own head,</l>
               <l>That every soul that was with sin opprest,</l>
               <l>Should come to him, and he would give them rest.</l>
               <l>Come all to me, saith he, not to another.</l>
               <l>Come all to me, saith he, not to my Mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>And if I do all as Christ did command it,</l>
               <l>I hope her Ladiship will not withstand it.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:36848:15"/>And so, Sir John, if I should speak in Latine</l>
               <l>Unto the Lord, at Even-song and at Matine,</l>
               <l>And never understand what I were saying,</l>
               <l>Think ye the Lord would take this for true pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</l>
               <l>No: that ye cannot; for ye may consider,</l>
               <l>My tongue and heart should pray to God together.</l>
               <l>And hereupon ye shal hear what befell</l>
               <l>To certain Clerks, that Latine well could spell:</l>
               <l>With whom, by chance, I lodged at an Inne,</l>
               <l>Where an old wife upon a rock did spin:</l>
               <l>And towards evening she fell to and pray'd,</l>
               <l>But neither they, nor I, knew what she said.</l>
               <l>One said, the Carling counterfeits the Canting.</l>
               <l>Another said, it's but the Matrons manting.</l>
               <l>Some call'd it Gibbers, others call'd it Clavers,</l>
               <l>But still the Carling speaks, and spins, and slavers.</l>
               <l>Now good Sir John, what think ye of this Hussie?</l>
               <l>Where was her heart, when her hands were so busie?</l>
               <l>In end, one said, Dame, wot ye what ye say?</l>
               <l>No, not, saith she, but well I wot I pray.</l>
               <l>Ye pray, said he, and wots not what? I grant.</l>
               <l>Alace, how can ye be so ignorant?</l>
               <l>The Matrone musing little at the motion,</l>
               <l>Said, Ignorance is mother of devotion.</l>
               <l>Then Dame, said he, if Ignorance be the mother,</l>
               <l>Darkness must be the daughter, and none other.</l>
               <l>Pray'd ye, said he, when all the time ye span?</l>
               <l>What reck of that? said she, God's a good man,</l>
               <l>And understands all that I say in Latine,</l>
               <l>And this I do at Even-song and at Matine.</l>
               <l>Alace, Sir John, was not this wife abused,</l>
               <l>Whose soul and senses all were so confused?</l>
               <l>Ye know these unknown to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues can profit no man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>And one tongue is enough for any woman.</l>
               <l>But when one prayes in true sincerity.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:36848:15"/>As God commands, in Sprit and Verity;</l>
               <l>The heart sends up the tongue as messenger</l>
               <l>Unto the Lord a pleasant passenger.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <l>But pack-man, here's a prettie little book,</l>
               <l>Wherein if thou wilt listen for to look,</l>
               <l>Set out by a true Catholick Divine,</l>
               <l>And out of doubt will settle thine ingine.</l>
               <l>Faith, read it, Pack-man, for it is but little.</l>
               <l>The gadge of the new Gospel is it's tittle.</l>
               <l>He clearly proves by Zacharies example,</l>
               <l>When he did sacrifice within the Temple,</l>
               <l>And all the people stood and pray'd without,</l>
               <l>They knew not then what tongue he spak, no doubt:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the Mass may both be said and sung</l>
               <l>In other language then the mother tongue.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pack-man.</speaker>
               <l>Sir John, I see your holy Catholick,</l>
               <l>Upon the truth, hath put a pretty trick.</l>
               <l>Have ye not heard this proverb oftimes sounded,</l>
               <l>Homo qui malè audit malè rounded?</l>
               <l>So if the people heard not what he said,</l>
               <l>How could they know in what language he prayd?</l>
               <l>Since understanding cometh by the ear,</l>
               <l>He cannot understand that doth not hear.</l>
               <l>Or how proves this that Zacharie the Priest</l>
               <l>Spake Latine, then the language of the Beast?</l>
               <l>Were Liturgies under the Law, but so</l>
               <l>In such a tongue that all the Jews did know?</l>
               <l>What e'er he spake, himself sure understood it:</l>
               <l>And so your Catholick did ill conclude it:</l>
               <l>Because a learned Priest may pray in Latine,</l>
               <l>And mumble o'er his Even-song, Mass and Matine.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> a Pack-man to the Lord may pray,</l>
               <l>And never know a syllabe he doth say:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:36848:16"/>For when you put me to my Pater noster,</l>
               <l>I seek an egge, and ye give me an oster.</l>
               <l>And so, Sir John, I have given you a wadge,</l>
               <l>That's good enough for your new Gospel gadge.</l>
               <l>Last, since we say that God is good to speak to.</l>
               <l>Who will both hear our text, and hear our eke to:</l>
               <l>What if he answer me in the Latine tongue</l>
               <l>Wherein I pray, and wherein Mass is sung?</l>
               <l>I must say, Lord, I wot not what thou sayest.</l>
               <l>And hee'l say, Fool, thou wots not what thou prayest.</l>
               <l>Even, Lord, say I, as good Sir John did teach me.</l>
               <l>Sir John, saith he, a Priest unmeet to preach me.</l>
               <l>Or in your mishent mouths once for to name me:</l>
               <l>With different tongues and hearts, such Jock, such Jamie.</l>
               <l>For though I know mo tongues then ye can tell,</l>
               <l>False knaves, should ye not understand your sell?</l>
               <l>Gave I not you a tongue as well as heart,</l>
               <l>That both to me should play an a-fold part?</l>
               <l>But like two double devils ye have dissembled.</l>
               <l>At this Sir John, he quaked, and he trembled,</l>
               <l>And said, good Pack-man, thou art so quick witted,</l>
               <l>Unto the Prior all must be remitted.</l>
               <l>And so the Pack-man past unto his lodging.</l>
               <l>Having within his heart great grief and grudging:</l>
               <l>Sometimes he doubted if the Monks were men,</l>
               <l>Or Monsters, for his life he could not ken:</l>
               <l>He said, Sir John was a fair fat fed Ox.</l>
               <l>Sometimes he said, he looked like John Knox.</l>
               <l>But Knox was better verst into the Bible,</l>
               <l>A studie that Sir John held very idle:</l>
               <l>They dyve not deep into Divinity.</l>
               <l>And trouble them little with the Trinity.</l>
               <l>And are more learned in the Legendarie,</l>
               <l>In lives of Saints, and of the Lady Marie:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:36848:16"/>The only Idole they embrace and kiss A,</l>
               <l>Is to prove servants unto Mistress <hi>Missa.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>With such conceats the Pack-man past the night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>With little sleep, until it was day light.</l>
               <l>And by the peep of day he early rose,</l>
               <l>And trim'd him finely in his holy-days hose:</l>
               <l>And to Sir Johns own chamber straight he went,</l>
               <l>Who was attending: So with one assent,</l>
               <l>They hyed them to the Prior both in haste,</l>
               <l>To whom Sir John began to give a taste</l>
               <l>Of all the questions that had past amongst them.</l>
               <l>He call'd them Hereticks both, and vow'd to hang them.</l>
               <l>With that the Pack-man hurled through the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</l>
               <l>And there he met with an ill favour'd Foster;</l>
               <l>Who quickly twind him, and all on his back:</l>
               <l>And then he learn'd to pray, Shame fall the Pack:</l>
               <l>For if they have not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <l>They sent me lighter out then I came in.</l>
               <l>And still he cry'd, Shame fall both Monks and Fryars:</l>
               <l>For I have lost my Pack, and learn'd no Prayers.</l>
               <l>So farewell Ave, Creed, and Pater noster:</l>
               <l>I'le pray'n my mother tongue, and quite the Closter.</l>
