            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And this is the time to gain this <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe he will give us any Law upon Condition we will provide for his Journey to <hi>Flanders.</hi> Indeed our beſt Princes have always ſold us for our Money the beſt Commodities, <hi>good Laws:</hi> But even the worſt of Princes muſt give the People <hi>good Laws,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> keeps the <hi>Pu<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> and the <hi>Crown</hi> ſtands in need of our Supplies.</p>
            <p>But further, How can our <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> anſwer it to their <hi>Conſtituents,</hi> if they part with ſuch vaſt Sums, and don't obtain for them a Law, that for ſo long time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> almoſt the <hi>whole Nation</hi> has thought neceſſary, for which <hi>twelve Years agoe</hi> we would almoſt have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>given half our Limbs, and half our Fortunes?</p>
            <p>This is the Time to promote <hi>this Bill,</hi> becauſe ſome will be for it <hi>now</hi> who never were for a good Bill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Wiſe Men ſhould make uſe of the <hi>Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Intereſts</hi> of all

            <p>Nay, if the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſaw we perſued our own Principles now, and would not hurt our <hi>Conſtitution</hi> to hurt them, all amongſt that Sett of Men who have <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>Generoſity,</hi> would rather pi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty what they thought our Miſtakes, than join in our Deſtruction hereafter: So that if we cannot make the <hi>Tories</hi> wiſe at preſent, upon a <hi>Revolution</hi> we may be fairly heard by the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> and may come even to ſome Accommodation in the Principles of Government; but if we ſhew that we have no Principles, Men will never be perſuaded by <hi>inveterate Enemies,</hi> and ſuch as have appeared to be only <hi>deſigning Knaves,</hi> as ſoon as Power was in their Hands.</p>

               <hi>Impartial Trials</hi> augment the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Riches</hi> of a Countrey, which all Men of great Sence and Souls know are the <hi>Numbers</hi> of the Inhabitants. Such <hi>Impartiality</hi> not only augments
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62105:4"/>
the Numbers by <hi>preſerving</hi> thoſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals that would otherwiſe be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſty deſtroyed, but the greater Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the Lives of Subjects are in, the ſurer is that Government to be crowd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Inhabitants</hi> from abroad; and <hi>Crowds</hi> of People make <hi>Induſtry</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Suſtentation, and from <hi>Indu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> an <hi>abundance</hi> of Trade and Wealth does <hi>naturally flow,</hi> as may be ſeen by comparing <hi>Ireland</hi> with the <hi>United Provinces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, ſuch a Law gives an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reputation to a Government. The Subjects of other Princes, though they ſhould not be able to tranſport themſelves and their Fortunes hither, <hi>will all conſent to proclaim our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happy,</hi> and acknowledge that our <hi>Kings</hi> are under a <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>happy Neceſſity</hi> of not being impoſed upon by the <hi>Malice</hi> of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and the <hi>Corruption</hi> of <hi>Judges,</hi> to take away wrongfully the Lives of their Subjects.</p>
            <p>This Law will very much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Safety of the Prince; for, <hi>after ſo fair a Trial,</hi> if a Man is found Guilty, and Executed according to the Sentence, his Relations and Friends may <hi>grieve,</hi> but cannot <hi>murmur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Such Care, ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcentions, ſuch Proviſions for our Lives and our Liberties, our good Names and our Fortunes would tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the remembrance of King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> to all future Generations, as our Benefactor, our Deliverer, as one of the beſt of Princes and the common Father of our Countrey. My Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Treby,</hi> when <hi>Attorney General,</hi> at a Conference with the <hi>Lords,</hi> aſſerted, that there was nothing

in this Bill but what was originally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our Rights. We will not ſtand upon it as ſuch. We are willing to take this <hi>Law</hi> as a <hi>Grant</hi> from the <hi>Crown,</hi> and not as our <hi>Due.</hi> We would not be put to demand it as a Right, but would leave the Honour and Reputation of doing ſo acceptable a Thing to him with whom we have ſhewn but little Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to quarrel.
