            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>GOod courteous Reader, be thou young or old,</l>
               <l>Here giue me leaue to make a little bold.</l>
               <l>To shew to thee my want of learning here,</l>
               <l>Which after will in euery verse appeare,</l>
               <l>I am well knowne no Scholler for to be,</l>
               <l>Therefore marks well what I shall say to thee,</l>
               <l>A foot-man may more easilier goe a mile,</l>
               <l>Then a lame cripple may ouer a stile.</l>
               <l>A Scholler might a thing of farre more worth,</l>
               <l>With much lesse labour very well set forth,</l>
               <l>For had this by a Scholler beene set forth,</l>
               <l>It surely would haue beene of lesser worth,</l>
               <l>For he that wealthy is must liberally</l>

               <l>I seeing those that wealthy were and rich.</l>

               <l>It was my chance to meet a merry Crew,</l>
               <l>And what their talke was I will heare tell you.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Some tales and iests they had which Ile omit,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Soone ripe soone rotten, the proverb doth say:</l>

               <l>The next of all it came to mee by lot,</l>
               <l>To pay my penny to make vp the shot:</l>
               <l>I neither sung had, riddle, nor good tale,</l>
               <l>Yet faine I would the apples tast and ale.</l>
               <l>Then presently into my minde it came,</l>
               <l>That I before had made an <hi>Annagram,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Which I them told in the stead of a tale.</l>
               <l>And by that meanes I tasted of the ale.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>There bee nine Letters in the Alphabet,</l>
               <l>Which vntill death I neuer will forget,</l>
               <l>They to my minde doe giue so much delight:</l>
               <l>And which they bee I briefely will recite.</l>
               <l>The <hi>I,</hi> alwaies some ioyfull thing presage:</l>
               <l>The <hi>O,</hi> bids youth prouide against old age:</l>
               <l>The <hi>N,</hi> good newes doth euer to vs tell:</l>
               <l>The <hi>E,</hi> bids none let enuy with him dwell:</l>
               <l>The <hi>C,</hi> to all men charity doth show:</l>
               <l>The <hi>L,</hi> to all is louing where it goe.</l>
               <l>The <hi>A,</hi> is alwaies amiable to behold:</l>
               <l>The <hi>R,</hi> said he by reason ruld bee would:</l>
               <l>The <hi>K,</hi> doth keepe the key of knowledg so,</l>
               <l>That no euill thing into the house can goe.</l>
               <l>If I the reason hereof should not tell,</l>

I seeme to marre should what I haue made well,</l>
               <l>But I may boldly tell it without shame,</l>
               <l>It was the Anagram of my mothers name.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The last man whom by lot it vnto came,</l>
               <l>Said he also would tell an Anagram,</l>
               <l>Which here Ile briefly shew vnto your view,</l>
               <l>I lik't it not, no more I thinke will you.</l>
               <l>The <hi>w</hi> presageth double woe,</l>
               <l>The <hi>y</hi> nought else but yealousy doth show,</l>
               <l>The <hi>f</hi> is flattering false vnto his friend,</l>
               <l>The <hi>e</hi> thinkes euill whatsoeuer it pretend,</l>
               <l>Thus you may see that <hi>w, y, f, e,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Doth bring a man from wealth to misery.</l>
               <l>If euery man were minded like to me,</l>
               <l>Then surely they would maried neuer be,</l>
               <l>Then said I, Sir, if you'll not be offended,</l>
               <l>Your Anagram you shall heare soone amended.</l>
               <l>The <hi>w</hi> doth worth and wealth presage,</l>
               <l>The <hi>y</hi> bids youth prouide against old age,</l>
               <l>The <hi>f</hi> is faithfull and doth friendship show,</l>
               <l>The <hi>e</hi> from euill bids all make hast to goe.</l>
