         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

have thought (for certainly Truth is
more ancient then Error) this being
made good, and that she did commend
them to us, in no other degree of necessity
then those former ages had done, but she
had much more reason on her side then
I had formerly conceived her to have:

            <p>On the other side, it seemed to me
somewhat hard to affirm the Papacy
had incroached on the <hi>English,</hi> and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
instance when, where, nor how.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, as I perused our ancient
Laws, and Histories, I began to observe
all changes in matters Ecclesiasticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by them; in which I had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
speech with that learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
I mention in the first chapter,
whom I ever found a person of great
candor, integrity, and a true English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
I noted likewise how the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Religion was begun with us,
how cautiously our ancestors proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not to invade the Rights of any, but

<pb facs="tcp:55565:5"/>
to conserve their own. Many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I know not by what fate, there was
put into my hands (as a piece not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of answer, in relation as well to
the fact as reason it carried) without
at all my seeking after it, or hearing of
it, a treatise of the Schisme of <hi>England,</hi>
carrying the name of one <hi>Philip Scot,</hi>
but, as told me, composed by a person
of greater eminency, dedicated to both
the Universities, and printed <hi>permissu
superiorum;</hi> truly, in my judgment, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
illiteratly nor immodestly writ: but
in reading of it, I found sundry parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
some perhaps onely intimated,
others plainly set down, I could no way
assent unto; as that <hi>Clement</hi> the vij. did
exercise no other auctority in the
Church then <hi>Gregory</hi> the great had
done, That the Religion brought hither
by <hi>Augustine</hi> varyed not from that was
before the Reformation, That the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
made the separation from the

<pb facs="tcp:55565:5"/>
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> That in doing so
we departed from the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
            <p>I was not ignorant it might be
found in the writings of some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
as if we departed from <hi>Rome;</hi>
which I conceive is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in respect of the Tenets we se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from holding Articles of
faith, not of the manner how it was
made.</p>
            <p>Having gone through the book, I
began to look over my former
notes, and putting them for my own
satisfaction in order, found them
swell farther then I expected; <hi>Vrceum
institui, exit amphora:</hi> and when they
were placed together, I shewed them
to some very good friends, to whose
earnest perswasions (being such as
might dispose of me and mine,) I
have in the end been forced to yield,
making thee partaker of that I never

<pb facs="tcp:55565:6"/>
intended should have past farther
then their eyes.</p>
            <p>Yet in obeying them I shall desire
to be rightly understood; That as I
do not in this take upon me the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
the truth of any controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siall
tenet, in difference between us
and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> so I meddle
not with any thing after <hi>Pius quintus</hi>
came to the Papacy; who first by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
practises, and then open excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of her Majesty, declared
himself an enemy, &amp; in open hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
with this state, which therefore
might have greater reason to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his endeavours, by some more
sharp laws against such as were here
of his inclination, then had been seen
formerly: with which I meddle not.</p>
            <p>Thus the Reader hath the truth,
both how I came to compose, and
how to print this. If he find any thing
in it like him, he must thank the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity

<pb facs="tcp:55565:6"/>
of others; if to misdoubt,
I give him in the margin what hath
lead me to that I affirm; if to dislike,
his losse will not be great either in
time or cost: and perhaps it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
him to do better in the same ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and shew me my errours,
which (proceeding from a mind
hath not other intent then the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of truth) no man shall be
gladder to see, and readier to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

            <head>AN Historical Vindication OF THE Church of England in point of SCHISM.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now more than twenty yeares since de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the Church of <hi>England</hi> as it was
setled 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for the most perfect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to Antiquity of any in <hi>Europe,</hi> a
Gentleman, whose conversation for his Learning, I very
much affected, tole me, He was never satisfied of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
with the Primitive Church in two particulars;
the one in denying all manner of Superiority to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to live in whose Communion the East and
Western Christian did ever highly esteem. The other,
in condemning Monastique living, so far, as not onely to
reform them, if any thing were amiss, but take down the
very houses themselves. To the first of these I said, We
did not deny such a Primacy in the Pope as the Antients
did acknowledge, but that he by that might exercise
those acts he of some years before <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> had done,
and had got by encroaching on the <hi>English</hi> Church and
State meerly by their tolerance, which when the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55565:8"/>
took to redress and restrain him in, he would needs
interpret a departing from the Church; yet if any made
the departure, it must be the Pope, the Kingdom stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely on those Rights it had ever used for its own
preservation, which putting in practice, it was interdicted
the King, excommunicated by him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which he
replyed in effect that of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth in his book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Luther,</hi> That it was very incredible the Pope
could doe those acts he had sometimes exercised here by
encroachment; for how could he gain that power and
none take notice of it? That this argument could have
no force if not made good by History, and those of our
own Nation, how he had increased his Authority here.
Which, truly, I did not well see how to deny, farther
than that we might by one particular conclude of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
As if the Church or State had a right of denying
any Clark going without License beyond Seas, it must
follow, it might bar them from going, or Appealing to
<hi>Rome:</hi> If none might be acknowledged for Pope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings approbation, it could not be denyed but
the necessity of being in union with the true Pope (at least
in time of Schism) did wholly depend on the King. And
so of some other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the other point of Monasteries, I told him, I
would not take upon me to defend all that had been done
in demolishing of them; I knew they had nourished men
of Piety and good Learning, to whom the present Age
was not a little beholding; for, what doe we know of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing past but by their labours? That divers well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the Reformation, and yet persons of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are of opinion their standing might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to the advancement of Literature, the increase of
Piety, and Relief of the Poor. That the King when
he took them down was the greatest looser by it himself.
Whose opinions I would not contradict, yet it could
not be denyed, they were so far streyed from their first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55565:8"/>
as they reteined little other than the name of
what they first were.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Upon this I began to cast with my self how I could
Historically make good that I had thus asserted, which in
general I held most true, yet had not at hand punctually
every circumstance, Law, and History that did conduce
unto it; in reading therefore I began to note apart what
might serve for proof any way concerning it: But that
Gentleman with whom I had this speech being not long
after taken away, I made no great progresse in it, till some
years after, I was constreined to abide in <hi>London</hi> (seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
not onely from publique, but even the private busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my Estate) I had often no other way of spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my time but the company a book did afford; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as I again began to turn over our ancient Laws and
Histories, both printed and written, whereof I had the
perusal of divers of good worth, whence I collected
many notes, and began farther to observe the question
between us and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in that point, not
to be whether our Ancestors did acknowledge the Pope
successor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but what that acknowledgment did
extend to: Not whether he were Vicar of Christ, had a
power from him to teach the Word of God, administer
the Sacraments, direct people in the spiritual wayes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
(for so had every Bishop, amongst which he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
held by them the first, <hi>Pater maximus in ecclesia,</hi> as one
to whom Emperours and Christians had not only allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a primacy, but had left behind them why they did it,

                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> 445. On
which grounds, if he will accept it, I know no reason to
deny his being prime) but whether they conceived his
commission from <hi>Christ</hi> did extend so far as to give him
an absolute authority over the Church and Clergy in
<hi>England,</hi> to redress, reform, correct, amend all things in

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55565:9"/>
it, not by advice, but as having power over it, with or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their own liking, and farther to remove, translate,
silence, suspend all Bishops, and others of the Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
In short, to exercise all Ecclesiastique authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Church above any whatsoever, so as all in Holy
Orders (one of the three Estates of the Kingdom) solely
and supreamly depended on him, and hee on none but
<hi>Christ;</hi> and whether our Forefathers did ever admit him
with this liberty of disposing in the <hi>English</hi> Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To wade through which question there was an eye
to be cast on all the times since <hi>Christ</hi> was heard of
in <hi>England,</hi> and therfore to be considered how Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
stood upon the conversion of the <hi>Britans,</hi> the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and since the irruption of the <hi>Normans,</hi> under the
first of these we have but little, under the second some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
yet not much, under the third the Papacy swell'd
to that height, some parts have been constrained to cast it
off, and <hi>England</hi> without his assent in that point so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it self, as to declare<note n="b" place="margin">Stat. 25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>no manner of speaking, doing,
communication, or holding against the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or
his pretensed power or authority, made or given by humane
Laws, shall be deemed to be Heresy.</hi> By which it seems those
Episcopal Functions he did exercise common with other
Bishops (as Baptizing, conferring Holy Orders, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> it
did not deny to be good and valid of his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But what those particulars were humane Laws had
conferred upon the Papacy, and by what constitutions
or Canons those preheminences were given him, was the
thing in question, and not so easie to be found, because
indeed gained by little and little, I cannot but hold Truth
more ancient than Errour, every thing to be firmest upon
its own bottom, and all novelties in the Church to be best
confuted by shewing how far they cause it to deviate
from the first original, I no way doubt but the Religion
exercised by the <hi>Britans</hi> before <hi>Augustine</hi> came, to have

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55565:9"/>
been very pure and holy: nor that planted after from S.
<hi>Gregory,</hi> though perhaps with more ceremonies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<hi>juris positivi</hi> which this Church embraced reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
or varyed from, as occasion served to be other, but
in the foundation most sound, most orthodox; that
holy man never intending such a superiority over this
Church as after was claimed. The Bishops of <hi>England</hi> in
their condemnation of <hi>Wicliffs</hi> opinions, do not at all
touch upon those<note n="c" place="margin">Apud <hi>Knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> col. 2648, &amp; in fasciculo zizaniorum <hi>Mss</hi> fol. 64. <hi>a col.</hi> 1. in bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio theca Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiscopo Armachani.</note> concerned the Popes supremacy,

and therefore subject to those<note n="e" place="margin">

the Papacy and pragmatiques it at any time hath made or
thought good to set up, in opposition of extravagancies
arising thence, in the reformation therefore of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> two things seem to be especially searcht into,
and a third arising from them fit to be examined.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> did ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any necessity <hi>jure divino</hi> of being under the Pope
united to the Church and sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> which drawes on
the consideration how his authority hath been exercised
in <hi>England</hi> under the <hi>Britons, Saxons</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> what
treasure was caryed annually hence to <hi>Rome,</hi> how it had
been gained, and how stopt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the Prince with th' advise of his Cleargy
was not ever understood to be endued with authority suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
to cause the Church within his Dominions be by

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55565:10"/>
them reformed, without using any act of power not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
invested in him, which leads me to consider what
the Royal authority <hi>in sacris</hi> is. 1. In making lawes that
God may be truly honoured. 2 things decently performed
in the Church. 3. Profainesse punished, questions of doubt
by their Cleargy to be silenced.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third how our Kings did proceed, especially
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (under whose reformation we then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
in this act of separation from the sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
carries me to shew how the Church of <hi>England</hi> was refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
Wherein I look upon the proceedings abroad and at
home against Hereticks, the obligation to generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
and some other particulars incident to those times.</p>
               <p>I do not in this at all take upon me the disputation,
much less the Theologicall determination of any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<hi>Tenet</hi> (but leave that as the proper subject to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines)
this being onely an historicall narration how some
things came amongst us, how opposed, how removed by
our ancestors, who well understanding this Church not
obliged by any forraign constitutions, but as allowed by it
self, &amp; either finding the inconvenience in having them
urged from abroad farther then their first reception heare
did warrant. Or that some of the Cleargy inforced opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as articles of faith, were no way to be admitted into
that rank, did by the same authority they were first brought
in (leaving the body or essence (as I may say) of Christian
religion untouched,) make such a declaration in those
particulars, as conserved the Royall dignity in it's ancient
splendour, without at all invading the true legall rights of
the state Ecclesiasticall, yet might keep the kingdome in
peace, the people without distruction, and the Church in
Vnity.</p>

Yet I do not say these times do not furnish examples of

that this was the first Cardinall <hi>England</hi>
ever saw a Privy Councellor. He having sometimes
sought that dignity in <hi>Henry</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> time, upon the

               <p n="39">39. The truth of this barring Appeals is so constantly
averr'd by all the ancient monuments of this Nation, as
one not finding how to deny it, falls upon another
way,<note n="s" place="margin">

concludes not the See of <hi>Rome</hi> had no jurisdiction over
this Church, except one should be so senselesse as to
imagine the Prefect of the Pretorian Court were not
subject to th' Emperors auctority, because it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55565:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
full to appeal from them, according to the Law in the

is very disputable) this Law is to be extended to th' Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
yet it proceeded from himself, who might limit
his own power: but he is desired to consider, this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of Appeals did not from any Pope; for the <hi>Africans</hi>
did, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth maintain it as an
inherent right of their own, to give Laws in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and ever had strong contests with the Papacy
about it, which held it an honour not to be parted with;
and they opposing him in it, must of necessity have
held that superintendency he exercised over them not to
be <hi>jure divino,</hi> for then no man could have exempted
himself from having recourse unto him. In <hi>France</hi> there
are severall Courts of Parliament from which no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
lies, who receiving that priviledge from the King,
it cannot be said to be in diminution of his Royalty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that they have, he gave: but if ever any of them
should claim this as of their own right, denying the
King to have at any time a power of intermedling with
them, I shall leave the objector to draw what conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
he will from it; for my part I can no other, but
that they esteemed themselves very little his subjects.</p>

&amp;c. By which we may see who of this house
went on this occasion first thither, and why it was so
earnestly urged from thence. As for the Monastery of
<hi>St. Augustins,</hi> by reason of the often contentions with
th' Archbishop, the Monks there were much more
prone to yield obedience to <hi>Rome</hi> (who maintained
them for the most against him) then these other were:
yet the first of them I find to have<note n="b" place="margin">Wmus Thorn, <hi>col.</hi> 1899, 22.</note> took this oath was
<hi>Roger</hi> the 2. elected Abbot 1253. For though the<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid. col. 1880, 3.</note> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of <hi>Robertus de Bello</hi> 1224. were at <hi>Rome,</hi> where
he gained th' Abbacy; yet there being no mention of
any oath presented to him then, we must think it came
in afterwards. But for the fuller understanding how
this visiting the <hi>Roman</hi> Church came in, the Reader will
give me leave a little to digresse.</p>
               <p n="53">53. <hi>Christians in all ages have esteemed it a point
of singular piety and devotion, for any Ghostly Father
or Doctor to have a care of those to whom they have
the relation of being a Spirituall Superior, either by
planting Christian Religion amongst them, reducing
them out of error, or otherwise some engagement on
them. Saint</hi> Paul <hi>sent for the Elders of</hi> Ephesus <hi>to come
unto him at</hi> Miletus, <hi>from whom they received those

was fully in possession of what turned so much to her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
an excuse was<note n="s" place="margin">

accordingly some other. The Papacy having by these
wayes abated the power of th' Archbishop, found it
easy, his lett removed, to bring the rest of the Clergy
wholy to depend upon it, by raising whom it liked to
oppose that Prelat, who were bound to maintain the
Papall auctority which supported them in what they
did, and wringing the Investitures (so far as lay in their
power) out of the hands of Princes, to interest the Pope
and his party in severall particulars, under the notion of
being matters Ecclesiasticall; by which he brought the
elections of Bishops solely to the Convent, excluding
both King and others, and became as Patron of most
Spirituall promotions in <hi>England:</hi> which<note n="t" place="margin">card. <hi>Ossat.</hi> Epist. 296. Rom. 22 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cembr. 1601.</note> forme he yet

               <p n="57">57. When any place became destitute of a Bishop, it
is certain, in the primitive Church, the Lay as well as the
Clergy did concur in nominating who were to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the charge; that he who was to have th' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
of all, might not be brought into it with the

the Papacy had received out of <hi>England</hi> for only the

an hundred and sixty thousand pound sterling, which is
four thousand pound by the year: an incredible summe,

as were instrumentall in the conversion of a people did

Pope began by steps (as I may say) to exercise a domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over the Clergy here, and not stopping there, upon
various pretences, by severall waies, and (as it appears)
degrees, to become so far lord of their Temporalls,
that they might not dispose of them, well, contrary to

               </p>
               <p>The second point remains, whether our Princes, by

it to belong to the temporall, for the heynousness

perhaps it would be no hard labour to shew, all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

then being excommunicated by <hi>Paulus</hi> 3. for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

no way be said to have departed from the Church; but
the Pope to have injuriously proceeded against him,

                  <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. for the manner of doing it, viz. <hi>that they,

something came from the Pope, in pursuance of that

in both Houses till Saturday the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> (when
the Parliament ended the Monday following) at which
time onely Viscount <hi>Mountague</hi> &amp; the interessed Clergy
opposed it. By which it cannot be questioned, but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of the Lords did interpret that law, no other then,
as indeed it was, a restoring the Crown to it's ancient
rights; for if otherwise, without doubt there would have
been as great an opposition at least made against it, as
some other statutes which past that Parliament met with,
that the Marquess of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> the Lords <hi>Morley,

of the words, that affirm her Highness to be <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme

the same year<note n="h" place="margin">The Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions</hi> 1 Eliz.</note> did declare, <hi>She did not challenge any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Henry <hi>the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and</hi> Edw. 6. <hi>which is, and was of ancient
time due to th' imperiall crown of this Realme; that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God to have the Soveraignty and rule over all manner
of persons born within these her realms,</hi> &amp;c. And that to
be the onely sense of the Oath she caused to be confirmed
the next<note n="i" place="margin">5 Eliz. cap. 1.</note> Parliament; at which time a Synod being
held, <hi>for avoiding diversity of opinions, and establishing

<note n="k" place="margin">Art. 37.</note> they did not give to our Princes the ministring either
of Gods Word or the Sacraments,—<hi>But that onely

is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed
to their charge by God, whether they be ecclesiasticall or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
and restrain with the civill sword the stubborn and
evil-doers,</hi> &amp;c. And these articles were likewise confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Parliament 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 12. so that no man can
doubt this to have been other then an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
what Princes had done formerly in all ages might
be justly continued; not an introductory of a new law,
but the assertion of the old right of our Kings.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another matter of great weight then likewise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedited
was, the settling the publick service of the
Church in one uniform way. King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
such a reformation as might serve for edification,
caused certain pious and learned men to meet together,
who (as it seems) taking for their pattern the practise of
the primitive times, casting out of the Liturgies then
used such particulars as were any way offensive, shew'd
their scope to be, what they pretended, to reform, not
make a new Church or Service; and thereupon had, <hi>by
the aid of the holy Ghost,</hi> (<note n="l" place="margin">Stat. 2. &amp; 3. Ed. 6. cap. 1.</note> as the Act of Parliament
speaks) concluded on, and publisht the <hi>book of Common
prayer,</hi> with a form of <hi>administration of the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
commonly called the Mass.</hi> But nothing humane
is perfect at first: this Book some few years after recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in his time alteration, and the word <hi>Mass</hi> (I know
not why more offensive in it then the<note n="m" place="margin">Cap. de Missa. Reline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Missa a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud nos, &amp; summa reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> 
                  <hi>Augustane</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession)
expunged, with some other phrases in it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But for the better understanding how Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
found this Church, it will not be amiss to look a
little back. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. dying in <hi>Ianuary 154 6/7,</hi> leaving
the <hi>Roman</hi> Service, with some alterations not greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
in it, the wisdome of the State (however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
a farther reformation) was not immediately to
abolish it; so as the Lords meeting in Parl<hi rend="sup">nt</hi>. 1547. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
the 4. though they had the Mass sung in <hi>English,</hi>
yet the Liturgy of the Church was not common in that

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55565:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
language till after <hi>Easter</hi> 1548. This Session continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till <hi>December</hi> 23. restored the Communion in both
kinds, upon which certain learned men by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
met at <hi>VVindsor,</hi> to consider of a decent Form for
the administration of it; which in <hi>March</hi> his Ma<hi rend="sup">ty</hi> gave

but I have since heard him to have been alwayes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

been reformed.</p>

learned men at <hi>Geneva</hi> were composing a Form for the
use of the <hi>English</hi> Church there, which 1556. was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>But this did not satisfy all, for Mr. <hi>Lever</hi> coming to
<hi>Frankford</hi> to be their Minister, requested they would
trust him to use such an order as should be godly, yet
without any respect to the book of <hi>Geneva</hi> or any other.
But his endeavours were soon rejected, as not fit for a
right reformed Church, and the book it self hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

her subjects, and yet not leave a license to every old
heresy, new invention, fanatick spirit, to ruffle the

difficulty. But for the better understanding of what then

of Heresy and proceeding against Hereticks hath
been, both here and elsewhere, how her Ma<hi rend="sup">ty</hi> found it

condemn it, and by their letters gave notice of what had

the presence of any famous Clerk was desired, who for

of his own home; so was<note n="g" place="margin">

confesse I did think before that law of <hi>H.</hi> 4. no Bishop in
his Diocese, without a Provinciall Councell, could have
convicted any man of heresy, so as to have caused him

angry Bishop in his Court should alone have power
of determining what was by the canonicall Sanctions so
esteemed, and whose words or writings could admit no
other sense then hereticall: and with this it seemed to
me the practice did concur, for the Deacon burnt at
<hi>Oxford</hi> suffered after conviction in a Provinciall Synod;
and the conviction of <hi>VVilliam Sautry</hi> shewes plainly to
have been after the same manner,<note n="p" place="margin">Rot. Parl. 2. Hen. 4. n. 29.</note> the Writ running,

Councell being, with divers others, printed at the end
of the constitutions of <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Othobon</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> 1504,
and since by <hi>Binius</hi> transferred into his third tome the
second part, this is alledged by some men, as if what
past at <hi>Lateran</hi> had been of undoubted validity with us;
when no question, what was done there hath never been
taken here as the decrees of a generall Councell, like
that of <hi>Nice</hi> or &amp;c. but of <hi>Innocentius 3<hi rend="sup">us</hi>,</hi> as they stand
in the Decretalls (compiled by <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

as those by him propounded, but not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded

which this Church varied as occasion served. Yet if any
shall insist this conclusion of 1222. to have been of
greater validity then I speak, I must adde, that if it really
were made with such an intent by the Ecclesiasticks, it
cannot be thought to have obliged us more then that
declaration of the Bishops 1615 did the <hi>French;</hi> who

can be no thought they would have built their Article
upon <hi>Damascens</hi> opinion onely. But by all these we may
see, Images were brought into this Church by degrees,
by little and little: First they were to have none, onely
wooden crosses were tolerated; then they might not buy
any, but being given they might accept the image of our
Lady and other Saints; then an inhibition of all Saints, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>our Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist,
to which was added the image of that Saint
their Altars were dedicated unto, and these onely by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
not bought, but given. So that it is plain, they
were then taken for things onely indifferent, as silk,
which they might use or be without, no processions,
bowings, kissing, &amp;c. of them prescribed; but how the
practise was afterward, that chapter of <hi>Arundell</hi> registred

the Catholick Church had happened in the time of
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Ambrose</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> upon which he gives this grave
censure, <hi>Quaecunque talia in catholica fiunt, ideo sunt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probanda,

               <p n="25">25. To apply this to our case; the Church Catholick
hath ever held a true fruition of the true Body of <hi>Christ</hi>

&amp;c. and therefore we can agree to these verses:
<q>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:55565:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <l>Christ was the <hi>Word</hi> that spake it,</l>
                     <l>He took the <hi>Bread</hi> and brake it:</l>
                     <l>And as that <hi>Word</hi> did make it,</l>
                     <l>So I believe and take it.</l>
                  </q>
Here is then a Catholick Sermon, commanded to be
read in the Church many years before the word <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>
was heard, as the doctrine of it, teaching me
this participation with <hi>Christ,</hi> however true, yet is not
fleshly, but spirituall: if therefore this miracle were not
to convince those held the communicating of <hi>Christ</hi> in
the Sacrament, to have been no other then fantasticall,
and the bread to have been, and conveyed no other to
us then bare bread, must not I, according to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
avoid it as the fancies of lying men, or the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of deceiving spirits? &amp;c. And this as it may serve in
generall for all miracles, so in particular for that of late di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged,
of a poor mans legg cut off in <hi>Spain</hi> and buried,
yet four years after restored: which if it be not some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,
as the golden tooth in <hi>Silesia,</hi> or of <hi>Arnald
Tilly</hi> (taken in <hi>Francis</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">ds</hi> time not onely by others,
but by the very wife of <hi>Martin Guerre,</hi> for her husband,
and which held the Parliament of <hi>Tholous</hi> so much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
to resolve) we must not (according to this holy
mans doctrine) believe for that or any of the like nature,
farther then is proved by the Law and the Prophets, &amp;c.
Yet there is one thing in my opinion very considerable;
what the Apostles did, were such, and in those places, no
man could deny them: but these the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
holds out for confirmation of their religion, are either in
corners, as <hi>Garnets</hi> Face in the Eare, with so dark proofs,
as when they are looked into, <hi>res tota cum contemptu di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missa
est;</hi> or else done in <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> where the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will suffer none but themselves to examine the
fact: whereas if they followed th' Apostles example,
they should be in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
might say, <hi>indeed a notable miracle hath been done</hi>

what I could not have looked for. Can any man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
two Archbishops, thirteen Bishops, besides divers
other personages of honour and credit, could have been
induced to subscribe so palpable a lye? as it must be, if
this and the other passages, by them there testified to be

lately framed. But the old books that yet<note n="d" place="margin">In bibliothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca publica Cant.</note> remain, writ

               <p n="29">29. But I do not take upon me to dispute matters
controversall, which I leave as the proper subject to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;
it shall suffice onely to remember, the Church of
<hi>England</hi> having with this great deliberation reformed it
self in a lawfull Synod, with a care as much as was
possible of reducing all things to the pattern of the
first and best times, was interpreted (by such as would
have it so) to depart from the Church Catholick; though
for the manner, they did nothing but warranted by the
continuall practice of their predecessors, and in the
things amended had antiquity to justify their actions:
and therefore th' Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in a provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Synod begun in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> the 3 of <hi>April</hi> 1571,
and all other Bishops of the same Province, gave e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in charge to all preachers, to<note n="r" place="margin">The book of Canons of the same Synod printed by <hi>John Day</hi> 1571.</note> 
                  <hi>chiefly take heed,
that they teach nothing in their preaching, which they
would have the people religiously to observe and believe,
but that which is agreeable to the doctrine of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the new, and that which the Catholick Fathers and
ancient Bishops have gathered out of that doctrine.</hi> So that

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55565:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing is farther off truth, then to say, such as reformed
this Church made a New religion; they having retained
onely that which is truly old and Catholick, as Articles
of their faith.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Thus was Religion reformed, and thus by the
Queen establisht in <hi>England,</hi> without either motion, or
seeking any new way not practised by our Ancestors,
but using the same courses had been formerly traced out
unto them, for stopping profaneness and impiety, when
ever they peeped in the Church. And certainly, to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
there can be none that will with indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
look upon those times, but he must (however he
mislike the thing done) approve the manner of doing it.
Yet the favorers of <hi>Rome</hi> ceased not to proclaim all had

               <p n="31">31. Upon the whole, it is so absolutely false that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> made a departure from the Church,
which is the ground and pillar of truth, as I am perswaded
it is impossible to prove she did make the separation from
the <hi>Roman</hi> it self; but that having declared in a lawfull
Synod certain opinions, held by some in her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
to be no articles of faith, and according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
of former times, and the power God and nature
had placed in her self, redressed particular abuses crept

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55565:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into her, the Pope and his adherents, without ever exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
what was the right of the Kingdom in such like
cases, that had from all antiquity done the same, would
needs interpret this a departing from the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he resolved to maintain as articles of faith, &amp; thrust
on others as such, some ambiguous disputable questions
the <hi>English</hi> did not think fit to admit into that number.
To make a departure from Christs Church is certainly
a very hainous offence, she never commanding ought
but what is conformable to his will, nor<note n="*" place="margin">

and I am confident the judgment may be referr'd
to any indifferent person (though of that belief) who
made the separation, and whether this Kingdom on so
high provocations, did any thing would not have been
parallell'd by former times, had they met with the like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Neither can the Crown in this reformation be
any way said to have enterprised on the papall primacy,

which (for ought I know) it might have acknowledged
so far as is exprest or deduced from holy Scripture, or
laid down in the ancient sacred Councells, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
writings of the orthodox primitive Fathers, and yet
done what it did;) but to have exercised that auctority
alwayes resided in it, for conserving the people under it
in unity and peace, without being destroyed by the
Canons and constitutions of others; not suffering a
forraign power ruine them to whom it owed protection.
In which it did not trench upon the rights of any, but

<hi>Rome</hi> brings as her Achilles, touching the succession and
visibility of the Protestants Church and doctrine in all
ages since Christ: for if theirs have been, it is impossible
to say the others have not; the former adding onely more
articles for a Christian to believe, which the latter will
not embrace as needfull: so that if theirs (as they so much
glory) have had the continuance from the Apostles,
these needs must, which onely denies some part of that
they hold.<note n="a" place="margin">Fortresse of faith, at the end of <hi>Bedas</hi> Hist. fol. 47. b.</note> 
                  <hi>Protestants</hi> (says Stapleton) <hi>have many things
lesse then Papists, they have taken away many things which

understanding the <hi>Romanists</hi> require of us what lies on
their part to prove; for we denying in the succession of

and so of the <hi>Britons,</hi> ever any one to have held the

degree of necessity they are now required, and for proof

but even that of <hi>Peckham,</hi> which we find so to differ from

farther then our ancestors were; they on the contrary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
all those holy Bishops preceding, not onely
believed them as these now do, but did require them of
others with the like necessity they now are; ought certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
