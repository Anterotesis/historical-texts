            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the most necessary Aid of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, when so great a part of the Knowledge of the first Ages of the World was washed away by the Deluge, and the learning and Experience of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages after, lost by the want of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which the Wars, and the rude and unruly Behaviour of those early Generations would not admit, and that to despise Records and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, is to proclaim us, as <hi>Tully</hi> the most excellent <hi>Roman</hi> Orator long ago said, to be willing to be Children as of yesterday, and to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trospect into the Wisdom of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and experiences of past Ages, teaching us wherein some have succeeded and others miscarryed, is to put our selves into as short a Memory as that of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> some of whom were Reported not to be able to number or reckon any further than four years, or to make light incertain or loose traditions, the most we can reach or attain unto, and refuse the <hi>ante Acta vitae,</hi> which were wont to be the faithfull guides and Conductors of

            <p>So as whether Reports of Cases ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in Law, be old or new, well or ill taken, both they and Histories are to acknowledge the Records to be their Superiours, and that they are in all things the better for their acquaintance.</p>
            <p>And those great Obligations must neither be denied or forgotten, which our Laws do owe unto the Records of of this Kingdom, and our great <hi>Seldens</hi> Intimacy and familiarity with them, by whose learned Labours and Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we have had the benefit of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discovery

               <p>And shortly after at a Conference in the Painted Chamber, betwixt the Lords and Commons in Parliament, some hot words happening betwixt the Marquess of <hi>Dorchester</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who upon the lye given him by the Marquess of <hi>Dorchester</hi> had pulled him by the Nose or pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off his Peruque, they were both Committed Prisoners to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and within two days after upon their submission to the House of Peers Released; but the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> coming after to the Kings Court at <hi>Whitehall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had asked leave of Him or His Pardon, the King did forbid him the Court, alleadging that howsoever the House of Peers in Parliament had

               <p>And in support of those Observations and honors so justly due unto the Place of His Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidences, the Lord Chamberlain, did lately cause a Constable to be Imprisoned for an Ignorant and Indiscreet pursuit of a <hi>French</hi> Lacquaie, who had slain an <hi>Irish</hi> Foot-boy, into <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and as far as the Royal Lodgings of the Queen, where he took him: and shortly after deservedly Imprisoned one Mr. <hi>White</hi> a Merchant, for bringing two of the Kings Marshals-men into the Privy-galleries, and neer the Council-chamber-door, the King sitting in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, bade them Arrest an Agent or Envoy of the Duke of <hi>Curlands,</hi> and he would Indempnifie them; Who were notwithstanding severely punished.</p>

some of them being expresly mentioned to have been after Judgements, and no certain evidence more than for what came directly unto those Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judges by the before mentioned Mandate of the Queen for the supposed grievances therein, which (though much be attributed to the well weighed wisdom of those grave Judges, and that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation had as much of Truth as without a hearing of all parties and legal Examination of Witnesses could be found in it) cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to be had in a judiciall way after Trials or Convictions, but received and taken in from the murmur and Complaints of some Attorneys or Parties only concerned, without hearing of the other side or parties; or that it was so prevalent with the Queen as to make any Order or restraint or cause any Act of Parliament to be made for that purpose.

which the Ambassador understanding by Sir <hi>John Finet</hi> then Master of the Ceremonies, who was to attend him thither, thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to forbear, as he did, that designed visit.</p>
               <p>For a common and innate civility and respect, which should be used amongst Servants and all others, could never yet think it consonant to reason, that a Butchers Apprentice, or the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a trim Citizens Wives shop, should take place of the Servant of any of our Princes of the Blood, Nobility, or other Persons of Honour, much less of our Kings; there being degrees and precedencies of Servants amongst all people any thing acquainted with good manners and civility, proportioned and laid out according to the ranks or qualities of their Masters; and in that also a consideration to be had of the nature of their Imployments, taught us by the difference betwixt a Footman or Coachman, and a Gentleman, wherein our gracious Soveraign did but preserve the Majesty due unto his Soveraignty, when (if report be true) he did in the later end of the year 1666. prohibit the Duke of <hi>Newcastles</hi> Footmen the wearing of black Velvet Caps, (which the Kings Footmen usually do) whilst they attend his Caroch.</p>

               <p>ANd to as little or no purpose would that antient and just Priviledge of the Kings Servants in ordinary, not to be arrested, troubled or imprisoned without leave first obtained, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them, if whilst they shall be busied in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the person of the King, or some other of his affairs, they may be sued to an Utlary, and forfeiture of all their Goods and Personal Estate, put out of the protection of the King and his Laws, and thrust under the many damages, inconveniences and incapacities which do way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and fall upon Utlawed persons, and will be hugely contradictory to the right reason and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our Laws; neither can any Sheriff retorn upon an Original Writ, retornable in the Court of Common Pleas, to which and no other Court (except in the Court of Kings Bench, in Actions of Trespass, or upon the Case importing a breach of the Peace) in all Civil Actions, the prosecution of Writs to the Utlary doth only and properly appertain; or upon a Bill of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> a great encroacher upon the Rights
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43669:142"/>
and Jurisdiction of the Court of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and a greater upon the Rights and Liberties of the people; or an Action entred in the Sheriffs Courts in the City of <hi>London,</hi> or of any other City or Corporation, that any of the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who were not wont to be either Beggars or Runagates, <hi>nichil habet, nec est inventus,</hi> (the later of which however now disused, was anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently never omitted, but as a companion in sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable upon such Retorns of Writs, went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the former) when as the Offices and Places in the Kings Court, were not usually so poor or unprofitable, as that they should be worth nothing, or those that enjoyed them so willing to leave them, as to run away from them.</p>
               <p>And then certainly if by Law any such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torns cannot in the case of the Kings Servants in ordinary, be justly or legally made, nor any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Capias,</hi> or to arrest, executed against them, without a leave or license first obtained; nor any Utlary without a <hi>Capias,</hi> after that an <hi>alias Capias,</hi> and afterwards a <hi>pluries Capias,</hi> being all three of them with fifteen dayes betwixt the <hi>Testes</hi> and Retorns first and successively to be retorned, as now the manner of retorning them of course is usually, before any Exigent can be awarded in order to an Utlary, if the Defendant do not appear before unto the Action, whether Civil or Criminal, to prevent it; which so often repeated process and warnings the Law doth so strictly enjoyn, as in the Reigns of King <hi>Henry</hi>

               <p>For if any of the Kings Servants in ordinary should be wronged by any such false Retorns, which must necessarily fore-run and open the doors of the Process of Exigent, the Prologue or Ushers to an Utlawry, they are and ought to be as justly entituled, as any of the common people of <hi>England</hi> are to an Action of the Case, against the Sheriff or any other who shall make or cause to be made any false Retorn, <hi>quod nichil habet,</hi> that he had nothing, (when as many of them have good, or great, or some Estates in Lands and Freehold in the County or place where the Action is laid) or, <hi>quod non est inventus,</hi> was not to be found in his Balywick; the later of which was in former ages used to be so ill resented, as in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. an Action was brought against one for retorning upon a Writ, <hi>quod non est inventus,</hi> that he was not to be found, whereby a <hi>Capias</hi> or Writ to arrest him was awarded against him.</p>
               <p>And as much against the mind of the Law it
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43669:143"/>
would be, and a very great distance from truth and reason, that the King in the usual process and proceedings unto or towards an Utlary, should cause an Original Writ to be directed unto the Sheriff of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> who is by Law to execute no Writ in his Court or Palace, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand one of the Kings Servants to pay a Debt demanded by the Plaintiff; or if he did not, to summon him to appear before his Justices of the Court of Common Pleas at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to shew cause why he did not, when his own Officers of his most Honourable Houshold, upon leave ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to prosecute the Debtor in the Court of Common Pleas, were more properly to have made that summons, should upon a <hi>nichil habet nec est inventus,</hi> that he hath nothing, or is not to be found retorned upon such an Original Writ by Clerks or Attorneys of course, without the warrant or privity of the Sheriff in whose name it is retorned, and to whom it is directed, suffer a <hi>Capias</hi> in his Name, and under his Seal, to arrest or take his body, to be issued out against his <hi>Yeoman of the Robes,</hi> or his Physicians in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, or some other of his Servants in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary necessarily attending him, not by courses, (as many other are by the indulgence of his Royal Majesty, for the ease of his Servants, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to officiate by turns, which within a few weeks or months brings them again into their duty and places of attendance) but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly every day and night in the year.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> That the aforesaid Priviledge of the Kings Servants in Ordinary, hath been legally imparted to such as were not the Kings Servants in Ordinary, but imployed upon some temporary and casuall affairs abroad, and out of the Kings House.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS it was desired and thought fit, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be communicated to such as were not the Kings Servants in Ordinary or his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, but only imployed as extraordinaries upon some of his special affairs or occasions, which were but Temporary, and to that end it was requisite that some signification or notice should be given that they were so imployed, and that they should not be arrested, imprisoned or disturbed in it, but be protected from it, the like being also done when any of the Kings Servants in Ordinary where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed out of the Kings House or Pallace by their Writs of Protection under the great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for otherwise probably it would not have been known, that they were his Servants either ordinary or extraordinary, or what was their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the Register of Writs, a Book in the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the second, made in the 13th year of the Reign of <note n="n" place="margin">13 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 24.</note> K. <hi>Edward</hi> the first in the year of our Lord 1285, called the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister</hi> of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and of great antiquity and authority in our Laws, and very well deserving the
