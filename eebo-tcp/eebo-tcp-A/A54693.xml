            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>So as whether Reports of Cases ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in Law, be old or new, well or ill taken, both they and Histories are to acknowledge the Records to be their Superiours, and that they are in all things the better for their acquaintance.</p>

               <p>And shortly after at a Conference in the Painted Chamber, betwixt the Lords and Commons in Parliament, some hot words happening betwixt the Marquess of <hi>Dorchester</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who upon the lye given him by the Marquess of <hi>Dorchester</hi> had pulled him by the Nose or pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off his Peruque, they were both Committed Prisoners to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and within two days after upon their submission to the House of Peers Released; but the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> coming after to the Kings Court at <hi>Whitehall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had asked leave of Him or His Pardon, the King did forbid him the Court, alleadging that howsoever the House of Peers in Parliament had

               <p>And in support of those Observations and honors so justly due unto the Place of His Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidences, the Lord Chamberlain, did lately cause a Constable to be Imprisoned for an Ignorant and Indiscreet pursuit of a <hi>French</hi> Lacquaie, who had slain an <hi>Irish</hi> Foot-boy, into <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and as far as the Royal Lodgings of the Queen, where he took him: and shortly after deservedly Imprisoned one Mr. <hi>White</hi> a Merchant, for bringing two of the Kings Marshals-men into the Privy-galleries, and neer the Council-chamber-door, the King sitting in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, bade them Arrest an Agent or Envoy of the Duke of <hi>Curlands,</hi> and he would Indempnifie them; Who were notwithstanding severely punished.</p>

was with great loss of reputation enforced to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to such Conditions as the King of <hi>France,</hi> claiming to be the eldest Son of the Church, would (besides the punishment of the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents) impose upon him, and suffer a Pillar to be erected in <hi>Rome,</hi> to testifie the outrage and the severe punishment inflicted for it, to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of many Nations and people coming thither, that he who sold so many Millions of Pardons to the living and dead, should not be able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Most Christian King a pardon and forbearance of that <hi>Pillar of Ignominy,</hi> which continuing some years, was lately as a signal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> permitted to be taken down, and no more to be remembred.</p>

times as they ought to do, those grand and more then ordinary respects, and many more not here repeated, unto the Great Officers of the Crown, Royal Houshold, and other the Servants of our Kings and Princes, and lodging so many of their grand concernments in their care and trust, did not trouble themselves, or any of our Parliaments, with any Petitions (there being none to be found amongst the Records thereof) against those antient, rational, just and legal Priviledges of the Kings Servants in Ordinary, nor any Lord Steward, Lord Chamberlain, or other Officers of the Kings most Honourable House, for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or maintaining it, (although there were some against Protections, granted to some that were not the Kings Servants in Ordinary) nor hath there been any Statute or Act of Parliament made, to take away, or so much as abridge those well deserved Priviledges which have in all ages, and by so good warrant of right reason, Laws of Nations, and the Laws and reasonable Customes of this Kingdom, appeared to be so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the Weal publique, and the affairs and business of the Head or Soveraign: For surely if there had been but the least suspicion of any Grievance in them meriting a remedy, there would not have been such a silence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Petitioning, or Complaints against it, either by themselves, or their vigilant and carefull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives in the Commons House in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which heretofore seldom or never omitted the eager pursuit, and <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> after any
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43669:137"/>
thing of Grievance which molested them. And if there had been any such Petitions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints in Parliament, that Great and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Court not giving any order, or procuring any Act of Parliament against the Priviledges of the Kings Servants, is and may be a convincing argument, that such Complaints or pretended Grievances were causeless, unfitting or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the remedies required; and will be no more an evidence or proof against what is here endeavoured to be asserted, then the Petition of the Commons in Parliament in the 21th. year of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. against the payment of 6 <hi>d.</hi> for the seal of every Original Writ in Chancery, and 7 <hi>d.</hi> for the sealing of the Writs of the Courts of Kings Bench and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas, which hath ever since been adjudged reasonable and fitting to be paid; then the many Petitions against the antient legal and rational payment of Fines upon Original Writs in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, then the Petitions of Non-conforming Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, then the many designed and desired Acts of Parliament not found to be reasonable or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and therefore laid by and miscarried in the Embrios; or multitudes of other Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions in our Parliaments, or then the many late Petitions for an imaginary liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, can or will be for what was desired, and not thought fit at those or any other times to be granted.</p>
               <p>Which antient Priviledge of the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, not to be Arrested without leave, was not

               <p>For if any of the Kings Servants in ordinary should be wronged by any such false Retorns, which must necessarily fore-run and open the doors of the Process of Exigent, the Prologue or Ushers to an Utlawry, they are and ought to be as justly entituled, as any of the common people of <hi>England</hi> are to an Action of the Case, against the Sheriff or any other who shall make or cause to be made any false Retorn, <hi>quod nichil habet,</hi> that he had nothing, (when as many of them have good, or great, or some Estates in Lands and Freehold in the County or place where the Action is laid) or, <hi>quod non est inventus,</hi> was not to be found in his Balywick; the later of which was in former ages used to be so ill resented, as in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. an Action was brought against one for retorning upon a Writ, <hi>quod non est inventus,</hi> that he was not to be found, whereby a <hi>Capias</hi> or Writ to arrest him was awarded against him.</p>

would be, and a very great distance from truth and reason, that the King in the usual process and proceedings unto or towards an Utlary, should cause an Original Writ to be directed unto the Sheriff of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> who is by Law to execute no Writ in his Court or Palace, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand one of the Kings Servants to pay a Debt demanded by the Plaintiff; or if he did not, to summon him to appear before his Justices of the Court of Common Pleas at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to shew cause why he did not, when his own Officers of his most Honourable Houshold, upon leave ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to prosecute the Debtor in the Court of Common Pleas, were more properly to have made that summons, should upon a <hi>nichil habet nec est inventus,</hi> that he hath nothing, or is not to be found retorned upon such an Original Writ by Clerks or Attorneys of course, without the warrant or privity of the Sheriff in whose name it is retorned, and to whom it is directed, suffer a <hi>Capias</hi> in his Name, and under his Seal, to arrest or take his body, to be issued out against his <hi>Yeoman of the Robes,</hi> or his Physicians in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, or some other of his Servants in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary necessarily attending him, not by courses, (as many other are by the indulgence of his Royal Majesty, for the ease of his Servants, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to officiate by turns, which within a few weeks or months brings them again into their duty and places of attendance) but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly every day and night in the year.</p>
