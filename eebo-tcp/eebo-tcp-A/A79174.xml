         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have at length gotten an opportunity to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and to give you a true account of the iſſue
of our work, being left at <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and <hi>Tinby,</hi> for
the ſetling ſome things there. Briefly, both theſe Towns
were very ſtrong, <hi>Tinby</hi> being like a Promontany in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea, the part without the walls ſtormed by <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertons</hi>
Regiament, and the Town commanded by
Col. <hi>Powel</hi> yeelded to mercy, as you have heard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pembroke</hi> the ſtrongeſt place that ever we ſate down
before, and the Caſtle even impregnable, which after
ſix weeks ſiege, conſtant rain, and much hardſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
by us and them, reduced as we deſired, Viz.</p>
            <p>5 to mercy being Leaders, 16 to 2 years baniſhment,
the reſt ſent home, The Enemy conſiſting of men of
all parts, reſolute enough, keeping it even to the laſt.
Many were the providences in that work; for which,
admire Gods goodneſſe. In taking <hi>Chepſtow Caſtle</hi> and
Town, and theſe other two, in all our long march we
have loſt about 50 or 60 men, and only one Major and
one Captain, The enemies loſſe hath been great, but
none of more concernment then Col. <hi>Botlems</hi> death,
who was kild at a window, by a ſhot ours, at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Their Intereſt was wholly changed, and from
the Parliament fell to the King, having the Princes
Commiſſion. I being commanded in at a hoſtage, and
to wait upon Major Generall <hi>Laughorn,</hi> and <hi>Poyer,</hi> I
lay in <hi>Poyers</hi> houſe, and in a Vault there, found his
Commiſſion, and the Princes Letter to him and <hi>Powel,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:162055:4"/>
with a Letter under the Princes owne hand and ſeale;
which ſhews they fought not for Arrears, beſides all
the tranſactions betwixt the Prince and them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with many other Letters of theirs, manifeſting the
whole deſigne of this years trouble, and the laying e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
peece of them in all parts of <hi>Scotland, England,</hi>
and <hi>Wales.</hi> That I can truely ſay, the beating their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
at St. <hi>Fagons,</hi> and taking in this Country, hath bin
the greateſt ſervices we have been in. The people are
a people meerly deluded by the Name of King and
Service-book, for their Religion.</p>
            <p>This I call the third teſtimony God hath given to
the world of the integrity of this Army, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
with it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the year 1645. where all the Kings power
was ſubdued by it. Secondly, when the tumults at
<hi>London</hi> cauſed us to march through the city. And,
Thirdly, this yeares commotions: which hath been
queld by the Army thus exceedingly diſperſed. Oh
that men would yet confeſſe with us, his goodneſſe, &amp;
leave off jealouſies, and wranglings, and minde their
common intereſt! We are marched back to <hi>England,</hi>
leaving a ſufficient Force here, to maintain what we
have gotten: And are yet reſolved to beare our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
witnes as the Lord ſhall direct us: We have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
with ſo many difficulties in this journey, that
we may not diſtruſt God in hardſhips: we have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
bread, lain in cold fields, conſtant rain, our Guns
ſunke in the Sea and recovered, we had a deſperate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and few friends, but a mighty God; Wee had
moſt of us no pay ſince we came from <hi>London,</hi> many
bare-footed Souldiers, yet valiant and unchangeable:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162055:5"/>
Wee are amazed at Gods bounty, and now are ſafe at
<hi>Hereford, Gloceſter,</hi> &amp;c. The honeſt true-hearted Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Generall living yet above all reproaches, of
whom, I feare the poore Nation is not worthy.</p>
            <p>Alas Sir, we now know where even all the ſecret E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Kingdome dwell, yea, ſuch as we could
not have thought to have been Enemies. The uſe I
have made of our long being in theſe parts, hath been
the diſcovery of men behinde us in other parts. Good
is the Lord.</p>
            <p>Sir, it was no ridiculous work I was about, when
I would have joyned Parliament, <hi>London,</hi> and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
together; but that City did not know its day, nor
the Aſſociated counties theirs. I wiſh ſome Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were deſigned, whether by King or otherwiſe, I
deſire a bleſſing upon it, that ſo good a God may bee
no further grieved by us. <hi>Farewell good Friend, and
remember him who is,</hi>
