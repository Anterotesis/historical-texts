            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

this worke, that by the mouth
or two or three witnesses, God
might make it more effectuall, for
accomplishing all the good his heart desireth; I could
no way justly denie the same: seeing as the ends,
which it propoundeth and wholly aimeth at, are
only to helpe to further the way to our unfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
for the generall happinesse of us all, yea even
of every soule; and that our glory may be continued
to us, and to our posteritie; so he hath long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
in the same, and used all holy meanes of triall
and examination, that there might be nothing in it,
but that which is necessarie to these ends, and which
might stand before the Lords Tribunall. For the
Author himselfe, though I have knowne him from
my childhood, being borne neere unto him, brought
up in the same Grammar Schoole, and after, in the
same Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and ever since beene
most familiarly acquainted with him, and therefore

his owne faithfull and happy labours have so
long agoe commended him, and made him and his
holy affection for the good of all, so well knowne
<pb facs="tcp:7009:4"/>
to the Church of God. As first, the first part of this
<hi>True watch, the Rule of Life,</hi> so much approved of all
religious Christians, to whose hands it hath come,
that it hath now the ninth time seene the Presse, and
gone thorow the triall,<note n="*" place="margin">See the Preface before it to the Christian Reader.</note> Wherein he hath set out to
the view of all, the holinesse and integritie of that way
of life, which we all jointly professe (according to
Gods sacred word, and the good Lawes of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Commonweale) to the justifying of our Church
against the Separatists, to be the true Church of Iesus
Christ, and that whosoever so walketh shall undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
finde eternall life, and in the meane while all
heavenly boldnesse, peace and joy. And not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, but also against the superstitious and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Papists, who herein slander our Religion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
it to be a religion of carnall libertie, theirs of
holinesse, ours full of divisions and uncertaintie, theirs
of perfect unitie, thereby to draw our people to a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of the eternall truth of our blessed God, and to a
liking of that popish way, which is nothing but meere
superstition in outward shews of devotion, according
to mens inventions, and such as God never comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or required; nay such as God hath most expresly
forbidden, as tending to utter perdition, both of soules
and bodies. So secondly, the second part of this <hi>True
watch, the Rule of Praier,</hi> in which he hath manifested
his holy desire and unfained love to the Church of
God and his native Countrie, for a perfect peace and
unitie, with all happinesse in the same, and hath so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured

in the third place in his Schoole labours, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

<pb facs="tcp:7009:5"/>
and necessitie; and when the times call us to watch
and pray, yea to fast and pray, if ever heretofore.
First I say to rise up and watch, that we may pray.
To pray for the distressed state of all the poore Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and our brethren abroad, who mourne and
wring their hands by reason of their slaveries,
butcheries, manifold feares and miseries, both of
their soules and bodies: above all for them of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia
and the Palatinate, the very chiefe of them a
principall part of our selves; and withall for our
brethren of France now in great tribulation for the
profession of Christs Gospell; taking their case to
heart as feeling members, little knowing how soone
it may be our owne, and ever fearing that terrible
curse from the Angell of the Lord;<note place="margin">Ier. 5. 23.</note> Curse ye Meroz
(said the Angell) curse the inhabitants thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they came not out to helpe the Lord against the
mightie. Secondly to watch and pray, yea to mourne
and crie for the fearfull viols of the Lords wrath (in
all likelihood) so neerely readie to be powred
downe upon our own heads, unlesse we speedily meet
the Lord in unfained repentance. If in the yeere 88.
all sorts so generally feared it; when yet at our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
humiliation in fasting and praier by publike
commandement, and our promising amendment,
God heard our cries, deferred the execution of his
wrath upon us; and contrarily fought for us from
heaven, arming the windes and waters for his
Church amongst us, how much more may we justly
feare it now. If then (I say) all joyntly confessed,
that if God had so dealt with us, as he threatned, we
had most righteously deserved it, for all our hainous
abominations, and for that no other meanes could
<pb facs="tcp:7009:5"/>
prevaile with us; and if in our severall acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
praiers and thanksgivings upon sundrie occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
since, we have againe and againe confessed as
much, how much more truly may we now at this
present? Seeing the Lord hath granted us since not
one yeere more alone, to see if wee would meet him
truly with intreatie of peace, and unfained submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but ten, yea thrice ten yeere and more, and also
used all meanes to reclaime us, both by abundant
fatherly corrections, and in his long patience and
commiseration given us our third most dreadfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
at the powder treason, never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
when he even plucked us out of the furnace;
and now that our sinnes are, in stead of repenting, ten
times more increased through all those meanes (in
the judgement of all who rightly consider of them:)
how can we expect any longer mercy? What can we
looke for now in that we see men so generally (chiefly
most of our Gallants) to make but a mocke of sinne,
yea of all Gods admonitions at home and abroad,
hating all true pietie, and scorning it under most
odious names? Or how can we thinke truly that our
land is purged of any of our abominations, but
stands presently guiltie of them all, having now fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up our measure, seeing we commit most of those
fearfull abominations so often confessed, with an
higher hand then ever heretofore? Or how can we
imagine that our land is out of danger, seeing many
amongst us begin to doat againe upon the bloudie
Romish Idolatrie; and that now our enemies are so
increased in Malice, Pride, and Multitude, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the infernall Locusts feared to be in the midst
amongst us. My desire therefore is, that as this labour
<pb facs="tcp:7009:6"/>
hath beene undertaken for the saving of us all, from
such a vengeance, as upon these grounds we have just
cause to feare, and for our perpetuall happinesse, and
must needs for that cause concerne us all, that every
one would take notice of it, and consider seriously of
every point, as God gives him opportunitie; especially
they who have leisure (and spend many houres, yea
many dayes and yeeres, either wickedly or at least
vainly, which will bring them nothing but sorrow in
the end) to helpe hereby to turne away the wrath, or
at least to save their owne soules. The worke is large
(I grant) but too large thou canst not thinke it, seeing
the Author of it desireth to make all plaine to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie
of the simplest, and truly to awake every soule,
and for that I know not of any point in it which doth
not directly tend hereunto, or can well be made shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without hurt to the whole; chiefly the generall
good considered; that every sinner that repents not,
turning from his evill way, must die. And therefore
doubtlesse no man shall haue just cause to repent him
of his labour spent in hearing or reading of it, but if
God give him an heart by the right applying of it to
helpe to appease the wrath, or at least to turne, and to
seeke to cause others to turne, he shall have cause to
blesse the God of heaven for it; which that every one
may doe, and that we may all instantly set our selves
to seeke his face and favour, I humbly intreat his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

to endeuour to set downe truly, and after to publish to all, the
first part of this watch, viz: <hi>The rule of life,</hi> contayning the
couenant which we haue all entred into with our God. To the
end to helpe to keepe all his people from the generall declining
from that his blessed couenant to profanesse and iniquitie, and
from the outragious wickednes of the rest, that we also might
all learne to watch to be preserued in the euill day.<note place="margin">So of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part, The Rule of Prayer, to stir vs all vp to watching &amp; prayer, as our sins &amp; dangers still increased.</note> And since

the Lords faithfull seruants the more speedily and instantly
to betake our selues wholly to watching and prayer, not onely
to be accounted worthy to escape the euills approching, but also
that ech of vs may still helpe to preserue the Island; like as

generally bent, it was no lesse terrible than any of the former,
but so much more fearefull, the neerer it was. Now therefore
in the third place:<note place="margin">The cause of this third part, our sins increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</note> forasmuch as all men may behold all kinde
of wickednesse and impietie still increasing fearefully without
hope of redresse, so that vnlesse we will put out our owne eyes,
we must see the iudgement of God hasting faster vpon vs, and
<pb facs="tcp:7009:28"/>
being at the very dore, I haue taken it my bounden dutie, and
my best seruice that I could doe and possibly performe, to his
heauenly Maiestie, his Church, and my Country, to adde this
third part: to the end to set before the faces of euery one of
vs, the heynousnesse of our sinnes in euery degree, and so the
equitie of the Lords proceeding against vs: that we may all
be inforced to iustifie his Maiestie, though he come to execute
whatsoeuer he hath so often threatned, when no kinde of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning
can doe vs any good. And also to try if yet at length
he will vouchsafe to recall vs againe to his couenant, and put
new life into vs, to meet him falling vpon our faces in fasting
and prayer, to pacifie his wrath, and that ech of vs may begin
to put that in practise which was intended and sought in the
two former parts, that is, to watch and pray continually, not in
words any longer, but in deed and truth; for the preseruation

opened, or who doe but beleeue his heauenly word: for that in
stead of hauing any of our greeuous abhominations (which

For this cause haue I bent my chiefe studie to helpe somewhat

the Prophet at that very instant, saying,</p>
            <p>O house of Israel, cannot I doe with you, as this Potter,
saith the Lord? Behold as the clay is in the Pottershand, so
are yee in my hand, oh house of Israel. And after he adds
these words, vers. 7. I will speake sodeinly against a Nation
to plucke it vp, and to roote it out, and destroy it. vers. 8. But
if this Nation against whom I haue pronounced, turne from
their wickednesse, I will repent of the plague which I thought
to bring vpon them. vers. 9. And I will speake sodeinly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Nation &amp; concerning a Kingdome, to build it vp, &amp;
to plant it. vers. 10. But if it do euill in my sight, &amp; heare not
my voyce, I will repent of the good which I thought to doe for
them. vers. 11. Speake now therefore vnto the men of Iudah
and to the inhabitants of Ierusalem, saying, Thus saith the

some euident warning. That he neuer warned

               <item>4. The withdrawing of the Lords glorious presence

confusions, before the destruction come. And
so what cause euery one hath to watch and to pray
that he may be so marked.</item>
               <item>8. The propertie of the godly liuing amongst the
wicked in a sinfull age,<note place="margin">4.</note> is, to mourne and cry for all

what cause all Gods seruants haue to watch and
pray for the fewnesse of such, and that ech of vs

his Church,<note place="margin">v. 2. &amp; 5.</note> are his soldiers; and therevpon
what cause we haue to giue our selues to watching

pride and malice.</item>

then comes the vengeance; for the destroyers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

them to repentance,<note place="margin">v. 4.</note> that he might spare them, and

cause why the meanes could doe them no good.
And what neede we haue therevpon to watch and

               <item>13. The seueritie of the Lords vengeance,<note place="margin">v. 5, 6, 7.</note> and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
which all sorts indured in that captiuitie,
when no other meanes could serue to reclaime
them. And thence what neede we haue all to

like, and also to be thankfull for all our former
deliuerances, from as great calamities so neere
vnto vs.</item>
               <item>14. How Gods true messengers and all his faithfull
seruants are wont to be affected when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Lords anger to be kindled,<note place="margin">v. 8.</note> and his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ready to rush vpon his people. Also the
meanes, which in this their holy affection they vse,
to preuent the euils, and to pacifie his Maiestie.
And herein likewise what cause we haue to watch
and pray for the want of these affections, and for
the generall neglect of the state of the people, and
of pacifying the Lords wrath.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7009:38"/>
15. The sinnes of a people may be so heynous,<note place="margin">vers 9, 10.</note> as that
the Lord will not be pacified at the prayers of his
deerest seruants. Also when that time is, and what
cause we haue therevpon to watch and pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</item>
               <item>16. The true obedience of Gods faithfull messengers
and seruants will bring them boldnesse to appeare
before him,<note place="margin">vers. 11.</note> and this alone when they are able to
say, in a good conscience, Lord I haue done as
thou hast commanded me. And what great cause
all of vs haue to watch and pray continually, that

                  <p>2. And behold, six men came from the way of the higher
gate, which lyeth toward the North, and every man a slaughter
weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed
with linnen, with a writers inkehorne by his side, and they went
in and stood beside the brazen Altar.</p>
                  <p>3. And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from
the Cherub whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house;
and he called to the man clothed with linnen, which had the
writers inkehorne by his side.</p>
                  <p>4. And the Lord said unto him, Go through the middst
of the Citie, through the midst of Ierusalem, and set a marke
upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all
the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</p>
                  <p>5. And to the others he said in my hearing, Go yee after
him through the Citie, and smite, let not your eye spare, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have yee pittie.</p>
                  <p>

6. Slay utterly old and young, both maides and litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

marke, and begin at my Sanctuarie; then they began at the
auncient men which were before the house.</p>
                  <p>7. And he said vnto them, Defile the house, and fill the
Courts with the slaine: goe yee forth, and they went forth,
and slew in the Citie.</p>
                  <p>8. And it came to passe, while they were slaying them,
and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cryed and said, Ah
Lord God, wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in the
powring out of thy furie upon Ierusalem?</p>
                  <p>9. Then said he unto me, The iniquitie of the house of
Israel is exceeding great, and the land is full of bloud, and
the Citie full of perversenesse: for they say, the Lord hath
forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not.</p>
                  <p>10. And as for me also, mine eyes shall not spare, neither
will I have pittie, but I will recompence their way upon their
head.</p>
                  <p>11. And behold, the man clothed with linnen, which had
the inkehorne by his side, reported the matter saying, I have
done as thou hast commanded me.</p>

the present execution of his vengeance; in this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
that he will be avenged forthwith, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his proceeding. The Chapter divideth it selfe
into five parts. 1. The Lords denuntiation of this
most grievous visitation now at hand.<note place="margin">Division of this Chapter. vers: 8.</note> 2. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Lords proceeding in two Commissions:
The first for the marking and making sure of all the
godly before the destruction come.<note place="margin">9.</note> The second for
the destruction of all the rest.<note place="margin">10.</note> 3. How the Prophet

That he will not spare, and why. 5. The returne of

               <p>In the manner of the denuntiation of this so terrible
a destruction is set out,<note place="margin">An opening of the severall parts of the Chapter.</note> First, how the Lord himselfe did
denounce it, crying with a loude voyce in the eares of
the Prophet, both to assure him of the certaintie of it,
and also to stir him up to a more due consideration of
the dreadfulnes of the same.<note place="margin">v: 1. How the Lord himselfe denounceth it. Shewing also the neernesse of the execution.</note> Secondly, the Lord shewes
unto him the neereness of the execution thereof, saying,
Cause them that have charge over the Citie to draw
neere; meaning the enemies, whom he had appointed to
be executioners of his wrath upon it, every one armed
with a weapon in his hand, as being ready to destroy it.</p>
               <p>For the manner of the execution of this slaughter,<note place="margin">v: 2. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> it
is also set forth, First, by declaring how many they were
who came to destroy, that is, six men, representing the
chiefe Captaines of the Caldeans, or the Angels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for conducting the Armie. And these six are
according to the number of the chiefe gates of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.<note place="margin">In the number of the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.</note>
To signifie that the enemies should come in so
great multitude and so mightily, that they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
the Citie on every side, so as none should escape
out; and should rush upon them so furiously in every
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7009:40"/>
street, that they should fill all with the slain, and cause
the chanels to flow with bloud.<note place="margin">From whence they came.</note> Secondly, it is set forth,
by shewing from whence these six came, which was
from the way of the upper gate looking toward the
North; signifying thereby, that these enemies should
come from Caldea or Babylon, which was northward
from Ierusalem.<note place="margin">How they were prepared.</note> Thirdly, by declaring how they were
prepared: every one in armes with his weapon in his
hand,<note place="margin">Whither they came: <hi>viz.</hi> to the Temple for the pollution of it.</note> as ready to destroy. Fourthly, by setting downe
whither these six came; which was to the great brazen
Altar in the Temple. To shew thereby that God sent
these destroyers chiefly for the pollution of his holy
things,<note place="margin">The Angell of the Covenant sent amongst them for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Elect.</note> his sacred worship and religion. Fiftly, how
amongst these destroyers, the Lord sends one speciall
Angell for the marking and preservation of his faithfull
ones in the Citie: to wit, the Angell of the Covenant,
the onely Author of the preservation and salvation of
his servants.<note place="margin">Exod. 28 42, 43. Levit: 16. 4.</note> And he appeares clothed with linnen, atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

with an inkehorne also by his side, as ready to

               <p>In the third verse is shewed,<note place="margin">Where the Lord appears.</note> how and where the Lord
appeared to give his commissions, both to the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and to the saving Angell.</p>
               <p>1. The glory of the Lord appeares, removes from

that they touched not any upon whom the marke was.</p>
               <p>3. Where they should begin to destroy. And that was
at the Sanctuarie,<note place="margin">To begin at the Sanctuarie.</note> at the wicked Priests and Levites,

The Lord so plainely foreshewing this dreadfull
captivitie, not only heere in this Vision, but also so many
other wayes, and denouncing it by his Prophets so long
before it came, declaring also the causes of it, sheweth in
the first place.</p>
               <p>That he hath not beene wont to bring any notable

sights of chariots and horsemen of fire, and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
marching towards Ierusalem; a hydeous voyce
was also heard in the Temple, at one of the Feasts, saying,
Let us goe out of the Temple, and depart hence. There
was moreover in a time of their greatest peace &amp; plenty
foure yeeres before their warre began, one of the ruder
and meaner sort, whose name was <hi>Iesus,</hi> the sonne of
<hi>Hanani,</hi> who being come forth of the country to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
at the Feast of the Tabernacles, and going into the

woe, woe to Ierusalem.</hi> And thus he cryed out, especially
on their feast dayes, and that for seven yeeres and five
moneths togither, neither was he ever thought to be
hoarse or weary; but went thus up and downe, being
taken as a mad man, untill in the time of the siege going
about upon the wall, and crying out lowder than ever
before, <hi>woe, woe to the Citie, to the Temple, and people:</hi> and
at last having added this voyce, <hi>woe also to me,</hi> he was
smitten upon the head with a stone, shot out of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that he dyed. And last of all, when they had suffred
most grievous miseries by bloodie dissensions amongst
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7009:45"/>
themselves, murthering one another, and by most piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
famine, as ever was before, that they were inforced
to eat such things as their soules did abhorre, and which
bred a most terrible pestilence amongst them, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
before the taking and sacking of the Citie, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to the sword, a voyce was heard among the
Christians,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 3. c. 3.</note> which spake to them thus, <hi>Goe forth to Pella,</hi>
which so soone as the Christians had done, the enemie
brake in upon them, and slaughtered the rest with a most
lamentable destruction.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, before the last and finall destruction to come
upon the world by fire,<note place="margin">Before the final destruction the signes are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretold.</note> the Lord hath foretold sundry
signes and tokens which shall come to passe, that none
can plead ignorance, or have any more excuse.</p>
               <p>Thus the Lord hath bin wont to deale with the
wickedest places of all other,<note place="margin">This the Lord hath done to the wickedst places where any of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have bin.</note> especially if any of his
owne deere servants have bin amongst them. As before
the destruction of <hi>Sodome,</hi> because his servant <hi>Lot</hi> was
there, he will doe nothing untill he hath revealed it to
his faithfull servant <hi>Abraham,<note place="margin">Gen: 18. 7.</note> Lots</hi> uncle, that he may
intreat for them.<note place="margin">Gen: 19. 14.</note> Afterwards, he makes it knowne to
<hi>Lot</hi> himselfe, who forewarnes his sonnes in law and
daughters to have gotten them all forth of the burning,
if it had bin possible.</p>
               <p>This he did to <hi>Ninivie</hi> that proud Citie before he
would destroy it;<note place="margin">Yea to the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels themselves in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miseration as to Ninive.</note> for he pittying the great multitude

                  <hi>Yet fortie dayes and Ninive shall be destroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to conclude this point:<note place="margin">And even to Babylon, that his own people may get out from her.</note> as he forewarned Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
and other the cruell enemies of his Church of
their destructions; so he hath as plainely proclaymed
his vengeance to come upon the spirituall Babylon,
(which now holding so great a part of his Church in
captivitie,<note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:7009:46"/>
This may sufficiently manifest his truth to every
conscience,<note place="margin">He will not doe any thing but he will first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale it to his servants.</note> that we may boldly conclude this point
with the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 3. 7.</note> That the Lord will do nothing
in his Church, in bringing in any destruction or terrible
plague, but he will first reveale it to his servants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
He will make his owne faithfull ones to foresee
it by one meanes or other, so far as shall be for his glory
and their good. The reasons of it also are most cleare
why he will doe it.</p>
               <p>1. For his chosen sake among them;<note place="margin">Reasons hereof.</note> that he may
shew his love to his,<note place="margin">1. For his owne peoples sake.</note> and the care that he hath for them
in the greatest confusions:<note place="margin">To shew his care for them.</note> to the end that they may
gather themselves unto him before, and prepare to be
accounted worthy to be hid by him,<note place="margin">That they may prepare to meet him.</note> or else delivered;
or certainely some way finde comfort in the evill day.
That hereby their love and care may better appeare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world,<note place="margin">Seeke to save others.</note> in their seeking by all meanes to save and
pull others from the vengeance to come. More specially,
that their faith and obedience may be seene to all, how
they beleeve and feare the Lord and the tokens of his
wrath. And that they may set themselves to become su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
unto the Lord for the rest, as <hi>Abraham, Moses, Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi>
and others; that so he may either spare all at their
supplications; and that thereby the world may take
notice in what high favour such are with his Majestie,
(even all they who make conscience to walke in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and endevour to be righteous in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
when he spares so sinfull a people at their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
or at least that their prayers may returne into their
owne bosomes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. For the cause of the wicked. Though they willingly blind their own eyes.</note> the Lord doth use to manifest his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
aforehand even unto the wicked, as we heard, and
for their causes also: howsoever they for the most part
use all devises to flatter and harden themselves: yea, to
lull themselves asleepe in their securitie, and to blinde
their owne eyes, left they should see the judgements of
God comming upon them; and so still perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7009:46"/>
that there shall be no such matter. And this he
doth also to declare the riches of his mercy towards
the most wretched sinners,<note place="margin">To declare the riches of his mercy, if they will turne.</note> and how unwilling he is to
take vengeance, so long as there is any other remedie, or
if they will turne unto him in any time. This is most
apparent in the Lords infinite compassion in sparing
<hi>Ninivie</hi> that proud Citie,<note place="margin">Ier: 17. 7, 8. <hi>As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>le?</hi> And hereupon it was that God spared it at
that time, though after, when having forgotten that
great deliverance, they fell into their old sins, he tooke
vengeance for all, as may appeare by the Prophet
<hi>Nahum;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had formerly threatned. He dealeth thus moreover
with the very wickedest, that every mouth may be
stopped,<note place="margin">That all may be inforced to acknowledge him righteous.</note> and all the world compelled to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his judgements to be most righteous, thus to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
him therein, when no admonition at all will
serve.</p>
               <p>So we see,<note place="margin">Conclusion.</note> how he hath set downe this point most
clearely, and also the reasons of it, and that he hath not
bin wont to give any such warnings in vaine, or without

               <p>Now then to apply this point to our selves:<note place="margin">Application to our selves.</note> we are

seriously thought of, how we generally stood then affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with them: whether since the time that the Lord
hath begun in a most speciall manner to threaten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
unto us from Rome, they have not beene
farre more usuall, till of very late yeeres, and much
more dreadfull than formerly. Let us but call to minde,
how fearfull these sights were unto us, when they began
in our remembrance, to be so seene in this our Nation.
Most, who are of any yeeres, must needs remember the
time,<note place="margin">Our Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles have recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them.</note> with the terrour upon mens hearts, that was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
Besides that, our Chronicles have specially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
those first most dreadfull apparitions of them,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7009:48"/>
as of things not knowne before in our Nation,<note place="margin">Ann. Eliz: 17.</note> or at least
very rarely,<note place="margin">Novemb: 14.</note> or that the former were nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison

smoke were seene in the ayre, and the heavens from all
parts seemed to burne over our heads, as the historie
doth mention.<note place="margin">Theprodigious star. <hi>Eliz:</hi> 15.</note> We cannot have forgotten that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
starre, which appeared about two yeeres before
these began,<note place="margin">Novemb: 18.</note> continuing for almost six moneths togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which, as it was found by the learned, was in place
celestiall far above the Moone; otherwise than ever any
Comet hath bin seene, or can naturally appeare. So
wonderfull was it, as the learned did affirme, that the
like was not read of to have bin since the beginning of

the learned, to have bin of signification, not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

of some strange worke. Let us but call these things to
minde, and withall the perpetuall danger that the
Church of God and our Nation have bin in, in a more
speciall manner from Rome, since about that time, or not
much before, togither with all our judgements and great
deliverances since; and then thinke whether they may
not justly seeme to foretell, that the Lord hath yet some
greater worke to worke. Howsoever, this cannot. hurt

may read them. And how we doe iustifie rebellious
<hi>Iudah,</hi> living in these dayes of the shining light of the
glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ, under such a shelter
as the Lords Annoynted, and also under so good lawes
commanding obedience thereunto; whereby our
sinnes must needes be farre more heynous and inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
than theirs, or than ever they were in former
time.</p>
               <p>And this may serve for a first cause, which we have to
watch and pray: because the Lord cryes so loud unto
us all, That our visitation draweth neere, and that
he will come on us suddenly, unlesse
we repent speedily.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The withdrawing of the Lords glorious presence from his
Church, is both an euident signe of his displeasure,
and amanifest threatning of his departure. And
what cause we have thereupon to watch
and to pray to pacifie his Maiestie,
and to hold him still amongst us.</p>
               </argument>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Verse. 3.</bibl>
                  <q>And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up
from the Cherub whereupon he was, to the
threshold of the house.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>A Second principall point which the Lord would
have us all to obserue to this purpose is out of
this third verse.<note place="margin">The glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing from the Cherub to the threshold of the Temple shewes God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to depart unlesse they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</note> In which he revealed to the
Prophet how the visitation of the City or the
executioners of the vengeance determined upon it did
draw neere; this is given as an evident token thereof:
That the glorious presence of the Lord, named <hi>the glory
of God, the God of Israel</hi> was gone from the Cherub that
is from that place in the Temple, where the Lord had
promised to dwell for ever, and from whence he was
wont to shew his presence most sensibly (for from thence
he used to give answers) and now it stood on the thres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
of the Temple, as ready to depart and utterly to
leave that house and his people for their sinnes. In this
therefore God would have all men to take notice.</p>
               <p>That it is a most certaine signe of his purpose to leave
a people,<note place="margin">The withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lively tokens of Gods prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, a signe of his departure and of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance at hand</note> and of his vengeance hard at hand, when he
begins to withdraw the most lively and sensible tokens
of his presence from those places where he was wont to
dwell and shew himselfe most familiarly. As heere for
example, Although the Temple remaine with the Arke
and mercy feate, from whence he was wont to speake
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7009:52"/>
immediatly, from betweene the Cherubims; yet the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is removed: the signes are there still but not the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
presence as had beene in former time, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the true glory.</p>
               <p>For further confirmation of this point:<note place="margin">God well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with his people wont to witnesse his presence by some apparant signe. As in the Iorney to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Canaan.</note> This we may
observe in the booke of God. That when he hath beene
well pleased with his people, and purposed to remaine
with them, he then hath beene wont ordinarily to shew
his presence and that (under the law) by some such vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
or audible signes, as whereby al might behold and
heare him, or at least perceive him some way. As in all
the iourny towards Canaan,<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 3.</note> he went uisibly before them
in the pillar of fire, and the piller of the cloude. But
when they had angred him by the golden calfe, he
threatneth that he would not goe with them, that is, he
would not goe before them in that visible manner, as he
had beene wont, to bring them to the land flowing
with milke and hony, because they were a stiffenecked
people.<note place="margin">Moses urgeth the Lord so to goe before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that it was the cheife toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his favour.</note> He would send his Angell with them, but in
his owne glorious presence he would not goe before
them as in former time, whereupon <hi>Moses</hi> is importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
with him, that he would never carry them thence,
if his presence went not with them. And that it could
not be knowne otherwise, that he and his people had
found favour in his sight, but when he went visibly with
them. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> never leaves him, vntill he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
that he will go with them as he was wont.</p>
               <p>The same we may see in the dayes of <hi>Iosua,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secondly in the daies of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suah</hi> because of <hi>Achans</hi> sinne.</note> where the
Lord having withdrawne his lively pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his people to be overthrowne before the men of <hi>Ai;<note place="margin">Ios. 7. 6.</note>
Iosua</hi> falleth upon his face before the Arke; fasting and
mourning and after a sort expostulating with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,<note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note>
for that he would suffer his great name to be disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored.
Whereupon God telleth him plainely that he
had indeede withdrawne himselfe from them, because
they were execrable for <hi>Achans</hi> sinne, neither would he
be with them any more, unlesse they destroyed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7009:53"/>
from amongst them.</p>
               <p>So likewise when he was angry with <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 When hee will cast of <hi>Saul</hi> he will shew him no signe of his presence, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r answere him any way.</note> that he
would cast him off, he doth not only take his good spirit
of wisdome and government from him, and sends an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
spirit upon him to disquiet, and to vex him, but
moreover when he asked councell of him in his extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
he answeres him not, neither by dreames nor by
<hi>Vrim,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam 16. 14.</note> nor yet by the Prophets. <hi>Saul</hi> had the Priests with
the <hi>Vrim</hi> before the Arke,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 28. 6.</note> from whence the Glory was
wont to appeare from the Cherubims: but the glory
was remooved, the Lord gave him no answere any more
from thence.</p>
               <p>The like might be shewed still in the story further, as
we shall see after in the particulars, but this may suffice
for the present to manifest this point.</p>
               <p>To returne therefore to our selves: we are first to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what are the most evident signes of Gods glorious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
presence in his Church, especially in the daies of the
Gospell,<note place="margin">The signes of the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in the dayes of the Gospell, where by to judge of our estate.</note> and heereby we are to judge of our estate, and
whether in regard heereof we have not just cause to feare
the Lords departure, without speedy repentance, and all
to give our selves to watch and pray.</p>
               <p>Like as the word sincerely preached and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
administred according to our Saviours institution
are the most infallible marks of the true visible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Christ, amongst which he hath promised his
presence, so long as these are duly observed, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and reverenced; so we may marke also thorow the
booke of God, fowre most lively evidences, of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
presence in his Church amongst his people.</p>
               <p>One whereof is more inward, felt chiefly in the soules
and consciences of men,<note place="margin">Foure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally.</note> to wit, the Spirit of the Lord
accompanying the word, and the powerfull operation
thereof in mens hearts,<note place="margin">The first inward viz: the spirit of God.</note> in and by the same word, to cause
all men to acknowledge the Lord to be there.</p>
               <p>The other three are more outward and apparant to
the view of the world,<note place="margin">The other three outward.</note> although they be nothing but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7009:53"/>
the fruits and effects of the same spirit. The first of which
three,<note place="margin">Abundance of sanctyfied knowledge.</note> is, when the Lord gives to his people abundance
of saving and sanctifying knowledge of his heavenly
word. The second when together with this knowledge,
he worketh in them true holinesse of life and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and obedience to the same word: and withall peace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and unitie among his people arising from the same.<note place="margin">Holinesse with peace and unity</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third is in protection, when he declares himselfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to be present amongst his people,<note place="margin">3. Protection.</note> in shielding and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
them and overthrowing all the plots of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or casting a feare upon the enemie, that they dare
not rise up against his Church and chosen flocke.</p>
               <p>For the first of these which is more inward,<note place="margin">The spirit and the word going togither are the tenour of the Lords covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> viz: The
Spirit of the Lord, speaking and working powerfully in
the word. It is not the word alone, nor the Spirit alone,
but the word and Spirit going together. The Spirit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
the word, and speaking to the hearts and
consciences of men, out of the mouthes of his servants.
This is the Tenor and the very substance of Gods cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with his Church, for the infallible demonstration
of his presence in it and with it. And I will make this
my covenant with them (saith the Lord to his Church)
My spirit which is upon thee,<note place="margin">Isay. 59. 11.</note> &amp; my word which I have
put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor
out of the mouth of thy seede, nor out of the mouth of
the seed of thy seede, from henceforth for ever.</p>
               <p>To make this more plaine;</p>
               <p>As in the time of the law,<note place="margin">As the answers from the Arke then.</note> not the Arke alone, nor the
mercie seate covered with the Cherubims, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres
from the Arke given immediatly from God, were
were the undoubted evidences of his most glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
amongst them,<note place="margin">So the spirit speaking to mens soules now For exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when it is Powerfull in converting and drawing men after it.</note> so this must needs be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of all: That not the Gospell alone, nor the bare mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
thereof, but the powerfull working of the spirit
thereby, speaking to every mans soule and conscience
is the most evident demonstration of the same glorious
presence in the dayes of the Gospell. As for example,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7009:54"/>
when the word is lively and mighty in operation, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
in converting mens soules and drawing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God after it.<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost.</note> As it was when the Holy Ghost was sent
downe appearing in forme of cloven tongues like fire, to
shew the heavenly fire, that should accompany the word
and inflame the hearts of the elect: like as it then
wrought wonderfully upon the consciences of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and that very worke was an infallible witnesse of
the presence of the Lord, so is it now according to the
manner of the working and measure thereof. When by
the same spirit some are pricked at their hearts with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
for their sinnes and made to cry out;<note place="margin">luk. 24. 31.</note>

who comming in and hearing the word so Preached,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 24. 25.</note> is
made thereby to fall upon his face, and enforced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
That God is in these men of a truth: when

               <p>And to conclude this point,<note place="margin">When the blinde see, deaf heare, dead raised up by it.</note> This must needs be
confessed of all to be the most cleere and invincible te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of his most gratious and glorious presence and

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7009:54"/>
by the power of the word,<note place="margin">Matth: 16. 17.</note> the blinde eyes are opened,

sinne are raised to a new and holy life:<note place="margin">Acts 16. 14. &amp; 2. 37.</note> for this is not a
a worke of flesh and blood, but of the Spirit of the Lord
onely.<note place="margin">This a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part of the visible presence in the Primitive Church.</note> This was a principall part of that lively pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
whereby he was so wonderfull, and after a sort vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in the primitive Church, when the same day were
added to the Church about three thousand soules by the
preaching of <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apostles;<note place="margin">Acts 2. 16, 17.</note> and after,
when the Church increased so admirably. And by this
he hath promised to be with his faithfull ones,<note place="margin">Matth: 28. 20.</note> teaching
his truth sincerely unto the end of the world.<note place="margin">And of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to be with his to the end of the world.</note> This fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
is the full accomplishment of that promise; To
powre downe his Spirit upon his people in the dayes of
the Gospell, when he would gather his Church in any
place, as we may see thorow all the Historie of the Acts.
And even as it was then, so is it now according to the
measure of grace; whereby he sends downe his holy
Spirit upon any Congregation. And in some Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
under faithfull Ministeries, all these, (blessed be
God) are apparent, thus graciously manifesting his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
thereby. And therefore the more generally that
this operation appeares in Preachers and people, the
more visibly doth the glory of the Lord shew it selfe, and
the more securitie may such a people have for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of the Lords presence continued amongst them.
Every man may discerne and know it hereby.</p>
               <p>But contrarily,<note place="margin">The contrary a token of Gods departure, and of judgements approching.</note> this is as evident a signe of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from a people, and of some heavy judgement
hasting upon them, when either the preaching shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7009:55"/>
Smithes stithie, that the oftner they are smitten, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they are. And further also this is so palpable, that
it may be felt, when men shall come to this height of
prophanenesse, that hearing the most excellent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of God, they shall heare them onely as those who
have pleasant voyces,<note place="margin">Onely hearing not doing.</note> listening to their words, but not

threescore yeeres and more before it came; that by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
they should heare and not understand, and seeing
they should see and not perceive, but have their hearts
made more fat, least they should convert and be healed.
And ever the neerer the vengeance approched,<note place="margin">Ever more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible the neerer the vengeance.</note> the more
apparent this judgement was, as appeareth in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
untill their Land was laid desolate, like as the

that last utter desolation of that Nation of the Iewes:<note place="margin">Marc: 4. 12.</note>
whereupon we may observe this,<note place="margin">Luc: 8. 10.</note> that no one Scripture

and that the fulfilling of it, was a cleare evidence,<note place="margin">Whence this sentence so oft beaten on by our Saviour, &amp; the Prophet.</note> that

shouldering forth the pure word of the Lord sincerely
preached, as being too weake and meane. The more
sensible this judgement groweth in any Church, the
more is the glory of the Lord removed to the very thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold;
the more also is his utter departure to be feared,
and the finall leaving of such a people without unfeyned
and speedie seeking to pacifie him.</p>
               <p>Now to returne to our selves, and hereby also to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
of our estate;<note place="margin">To consider whether the Gospell hath y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same powerfull operation as formerly.</note> Let us all who ever have had any
true feeling of this working of the Spirit of the Lord in
us, and whose consciences are not utterly feared, or who
have used to observe the manner of Gods working in
his Church, enter into a due consideration hereof. Let
us examine this betweene the Lord and our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
whether the preaching of the Gospell have still
that operation amongst us, which sometimes it hath had
to convert mens soules, to draw multitudes after it in the
love of it selfe, unlesse it be happily to heare some man
of fame, or for his rare and singular gifts, or for some like
by-respects. And whether this power of it be not feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
abated,<note place="margin">Except in some few places, and removing.</note> except in some very few places; and those
for most part, where formerly it hath not bin, as in some
rude countryes towards the Northerne parts, whither it
is daily observed to remove, as ready to take the farewel,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7009:56"/>
when it hath gathered forth Gods chosen of them, and
convinced the rest. And whether Satan, Antichrist, and
this evill world, with the pleasures and pompe of it, doe
not draw men wonderfully from Iesus Christ, to follow
after them: whether multitudes rush not violently to all
licentious profanenesse, in steed of the zealous profession
of the Gospell of Christ: others to Poperie and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
againe, which was so far rooted out of our Land,
and by the most abhorred, and this after the time that
God hath more discovered the abomination of that
bloodie religion, than ever heretofore. Let us but call
to minde,<note place="margin">Whether the Lord speake so sensibly to mens soules as heretofore.</note> how it hath bin formerly with us, in those
places where God was wont to speake unto us by his
messengers, and how it is now for most part: whether in
many places, where the Arke of God still remaines, I
meane the Word and Sacraments, whether, I say, the
glorious and lively voyce of the Spirit, that piercing of
our hearts, that burning in our soules, with those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable
comforts which we were wont to finde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
be not decayed exceedingly? whether it be not with
all who are fallen to fashion themselves to the extreme
licentiousnesse and loosenesse of the time;<note place="margin">Whether it be not with all the licentious, as w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Saul,</hi> that God speaks to them no more.</note> even as it was
with <hi>Saul,</hi> That the Lord speaks to them no more, tho
they have happily the same Preachers, and the booke of
the Law, and heare the curses against their sinnes, yet
they neither feele nor feare them any more? whether
that lively presence which did shake their hearts, be not
utterly gone?<note place="margin">That men be not generally more voyde of feeling &amp; feare.</note> yea, whether we do not see this generally,
that men are every where more voyde of all feeling of
sinne, and of the feare of any judgement, whereby that
spirituall judgement doth daily seize upon us most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently?
That by hearing the threatnings against us, we
heare but understand no more;<note place="margin">Nor any more moved as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</note> and seeing the signes
and tokens of his wrath for our sinnes, we see them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but we are moved no longer with them; but as
they,<note place="margin">Hearing heare not, and seeing see not.</note> so we have our hearts more fat, our eares more
deafe, and our eyes still more blinded? And if we shall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7009:56"/>
finde it thus, That these and all other signes mentioned,
are in great measure come upon us, let us answer unfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly,
whether the Lord doth not sensibly threaten and
proclaime to depart and leave us altogither,<note place="margin">Whether God doe not hereby threaten his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and it be not full time to seeke him.</note> unlesse we
repent; having thus far already withdrawne himselfe
from us. And to conclude this point, whether it be not
full time to seeke to pacifie and stay him amongst us, if
we be not weary of his abode with us, and of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereby.</p>
               <p>But of this more in the next Chapter, where we shall
have cause to inquire of the outward tokens of the
Lords glorious presence, and what a removall he hath
made thereof, as likewise we see that he hath of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Thus much therefore shall suffice to have spoken
of this second cause, which we have all to watch &amp; pray,
yea, even to weepe and cry after him, to returne unto
us againe, in shewing amongst us the power of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as ever in former time, and to abide with us for ever,
that he never leave us to our bloodie enemies.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Lord is most unwilling to depart from his Church,
so long as there is any other remedie, which he manifesteth
in his oft threatning to take his leave, before he goe indeed.
And of the outward tokens both of his glorious presence
in his Church, and of his departure from it. And what
cause we have thereupon to watch and pray continually.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ANd the Glory of the God of Israel was removed,<note place="margin">The Lord makes sundry removes before he depart; all which were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of his departure.</note> &amp;c.</hi>
A third point specially to be observed is this:
That the Glory of God removed not once onely,
but five severall times in this vision, before it departed;
and that it removed not all at once, but so oft, going
away by degrees, and that most sensibly. By which he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7009:57"/>
would cause the Prophet most clearely to behold his
holinesse and justice; that he must needs depart from
them for their iniquities, wherewith they grieved him;
and that he was now taking his farewell: and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
also to see his mercy and tender compassion, and
how he was (as we may so speake) most unwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
and leave his people to so many miseries; even Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
his owne Citie to such a desolation, if any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
would have bin found. This he makes knowne unto
them, to see if it would worke to stir them up to seeke to
retaine his presence amongst them.</p>
               <p>For the evident manifestation hereof,<note place="margin">The first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. <hi>Chap. 9. 3.</hi>
                  </note> First, the Glory
removes from the Cherub, and stands upon the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold,
as ready to depart. Secondly, it removes higher,
and stands over the dore of the house. Thirdly, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
from above the dore, and standing againe upon
the Cherubims, the Cherubims mounted upward from
the earth towards heaven, as ready to take their flight,
and leave the Temple altogither. Fourthly, after this,
the Glory removes to the midst of the Citie; thereby
seeming to warne the Citie of the Lords departure.
Lastly, from thence it removes out of the Citie unto the
Mount of Olives, as utterly taking leave of them, and
giving them a last farewell, untill their Captivitie was
accomplished, and his anger appeased. These were the
removes.</p>
               <p>Here we are all againe to inquire yet more carefully,<note place="margin">Whether he hath not made as many sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble removes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</note>
whether he hath not made as many and as sensible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
of his glory amongst us of this our Nation, and
thereby given us as many plaine evidences of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
not now in a vision, but so as all men must needs
see and confesse it: and also whether withall he hath not
as clearely and tenderly manifested (as I may so say) his
unwillingnesse to depart from us, if any thing can serve
to reforme us. This is a point of most serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and such a one, as it were an exceeding mercy of
the Lord, and a token of his gratious purpose toward us,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7009:57"/>
if he would but vouchsafe us hearts generally to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of aright, as in his presence and as we must all know
it one day.</p>
               <p>To the end we may conceive it the better, we are first
to consider wherein the glory of the Lord appeareth
outwardly in his Church so as it may be beholden of all
round about it, even of the very enemies. As for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
evidence it being more inward, is to be perceived
chiefly of the inward man, the soule and conscience,
when God so speaks unto them.</p>
               <p>This outward Glory consists in three things princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,<note place="margin">The outward glory consists in three things.</note>
as was said, whereby not only the Lord himselfe
is magnified amongst his owne people, yea to be seene
&amp; acknowledged of others, but also by which he makes
his people to be glorious in the eies of others, and to be
honoured and feared of their enemies.</p>
               <p>The first is,<note place="margin">First in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> when he bestoweth upon his people such
aboundance of heavenly and sanctified knowledge of his
worde with an hungring after the same, as that the earth
seemeth to be filled with the knowledg of the Lord, like
the waters that cover the Sea,<note place="margin">Esa. 2. 2, 3.</note> as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
This he promiseth to doe in his Church when he
will shew his glory in it, in the dayes of the Gospell. At
what time the Church being exalted as upon the topps
of the mountaines, there shalbe such a hungring and
thirsting after the word of the Lord that men shal incite
and provoke one another, saying, Come, let us goe up to
the house of the Lord, for he will teach us his waies and
we will walke in his pathes. Where he thus puts his
lawes into the mindes of his people, at least in a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
desire of it. That they all seeme to know him from
the least to the greatest of them; this is a visible token of
Gods covenant with such a people and the pardon of
their sinnes,<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 33, 34.</note> that he is their God and this is his glory
upon them.<note place="margin">2 In holinesse of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>A second visible token is this, when this knowledge
is accompanied with obedience and holinesse of life,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7009:58"/>
when he thus writes his law in their hearts,<note place="margin">Ezech: 36. 23. 24. 25. 26.</note> creating in
them new hearts and new spirits. Thus the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
to be sanctified in his owne people before the
eyes of their enemies, when he shall clense them from all
their filthy sinnes, as with pure water; when he puts his
spirit so upon them, as to cause them to walke in his
statutes, to keepe his judgments and to do them: when
he puts his feare so generally into their hearts, as to cause
them not to depart from him.<note place="margin">Chiefly when he gives peace and unitie, one heart and one way.</note> Then he makes this
covenant for himselfe, that he wil not depart from them.
And chiefly when togither heerewith, he gives peace &amp;
unity amongst them, that they have one heart and one
way.<note place="margin">Ier. 32. 39. 40.</note> That the Lambe may lodge with the Wolfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

who have beene by nature as bloudy as Wolues; when
the little child may lead the Lion, even a child bringing
the word of the Lord may perswade and lead them, who
were otherwise as proude and fierce as Lyons. And
when the sucking childe may play upon the hole of the
Aspe; when the poore seruants of the Lord, who are for
harmelesnesse as little children, may be without perill in
the presence of them, who were sometimes as venemous
as the Aspe and the Viper. When they shall feed &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

Lord, and none to hurt in all the mountaine of the Lords
holinesse, within the bounds and limits of his Church.
By this all must needs see,<note place="margin">Ioh: 13. 53.</note> that such are indeede the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Christ, when they love one another. And
when in regard hereof, the feet of them who bring the
glad tidings of peace, to wit, of all the faithfull preachers
of the Gospell, publishing life and salvation and working
this obedience and love,<note place="margin">Holinesse and unity make Gods people glorious in the eyes of their enemies.</note> are beautifull, when their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
among a people is most acceptable, as of the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
of the Lord of hosts.</p>
               <p>Now both these are such evident demonstrations of
the glory of the Lord upon a people, that they make
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7009:58"/>
them amongst whom they are conspicuous, and eminent
to be a glorious people, and cause them to be had in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and to be feared of all nations round about them.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Moses</hi> sheweth plainly in <hi>Deut. 4.</hi>

                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 5. 6. 7. &amp;c.</note> Where he
thus speaks to the people of <hi>Israel:</hi> Behold, I haue taught
you ordinances &amp; lawes, as the Lord my God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
mee, that you should doe even so, in the Land whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you goe to possesse it. Keepe them therefore and do
them; for this is your wisdome and vnderstanding in the
sight of the people, which shal heare al these ordinances,
and shall say, Onely this people is wise &amp; of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and a great nation: for what nation is so great, unto
whom the Gods comes so neere unto them, as our God
is neere to us in all that we call unto him for.</p>
               <p>The Lord himselfe also hath bidden all his people to
glory in this,<note place="margin">The Lords people bidden to glory in these.</note> That they know and feare him, not in

                     </gap>r. 9. 23. 24.</note> and all the
true outward glory of a people to consist in their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and peace among themselves, and in the right
knowledge and sincere profession of his heavenly word.
As the kingdome of heaven, which is inwardly felt, in
every one of Gods Servants,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> is in righteousnesse, peace
and heavenly joy:<note place="margin">The kingdome of heaven in holinesse peace and joy.</note> so when these abound amongst any
people there is the kingdome of heaven truly begun, &amp;
Christ reigning visibly. Such were those worthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
mentioned in the Acts,<note place="margin">Christ visibly raigneth in such congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> and those to which
<hi>Paul</hi> writ his Epistles; and such are all Churches which
are like unto them at this day. And even as these things
also doe more abound and are more apparant among
them; so are they still more glorious, and Christ more
evidently holding up his scepter there. Thus much for
the two first parts of the outward glory.</p>
               <p>The third principall thing,<note place="margin">3. The Third principall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signe is his glorious protection of his people.</note> whereby the Lord is
wont to declare his glory in his Church so brightly, as
that it may be beholden of all about, is in the protection
and defence thereof. And this is more visible also, when
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7009:59"/>
he doth miraculously deliver it, plaguing and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
all the enemies, with all their wicked devises,
which they plot against his people.</p>
               <p>To omit the carefull protection of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi>
and <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">As 1. of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi>
                  </note> with all theirs, in all places wheresoever they
went; the smiting of their enemies, and that herein
stood a chiefe part of their honour:<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 16. 26. 9, 10, 11, 12. &amp; 27. 42. &amp; 28. 29, 31. &amp; 24. 32.</note> was not this that
glory whereby he did so grace his Church in Egypt,
when he sheltered his people, and made them to grow,
notwithstanding the cruel oppressions of their enemies?
when they were as the bush in the midst of the fire that
yet consumed not?<note place="margin">2. Church in Egypt.</note> And secondly, when he plagued the
Egyptians, and still kept his people safe in the midst of
all those miraculous judgements.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and protecting them in all the way towards Canaan.</note> when he went before them out of Egypt and
thorow the wildernesse towards Canaan, in the piller of
fire and of the cloud, so conducting them that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
could not come at them, neither by day nor night.
In regard whereof, he being angry with them for the
golden calfe,<note place="margin">Exod. 33 3, 4.</note> had threatned that he would not goe up
with them, because they were a stiffe-necked people: as
they sorrowed and wept for this, so <hi>Moses</hi> in particular
saith,<note place="margin">vers. 15.</note> If thy presence goe not with us, carry us not

not be when thou goest up with us? So I and thy people
shall have preheminence before all the people of the
earth: for which importunitie of his the Lord conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
thus still to continue his happy presence in that
apparent manner.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. In miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous keeping their land.</note> the Lord declared this his glorious presence
in the miraculous keeping of their land, that no enemie
should invade it, nor so much as once dare to attempt
the same, or thinke of any such matter; no, not then
when all their men went up generally thrice in the yeere
at their solemne feasts to Ierusalem from all the parts of
their land, and none left at home to keepe their frontiers
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7009:59"/>
from invasion, or houses from spoiling, but a few poore
women and children.<note place="margin">This continued so long as they were carefull to know &amp; obey him.</note> As he had promised this unto
them, so he faithfully performed it, so long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to know and feare him. So long as they made
any conscience to retaine those two former parts of his
glory in knowledge and obedience,<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 21, 22.</note> so long also conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
this their gracious preservation: yea, so long as
they would but humble themselves under his hand at
those his threatnings and at the shaking of his rods
against them,<note place="margin">Psalm: 107.</note> promising amendment, and would then
beleeve and obey his Prophets, so long abode this glory
with them.</p>
               <p>This the Lord wrought moreover in such strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
of them from all that did offer to assaile them,<note place="margin">5. In their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes of their enemies.</note>

filthines of his people by his word and Spirit, he would
create upon every place of Mount Sion,<note place="margin">Esai: 4. 4, 5, 6.</note> and upon the
assemblies thereof, a cloud and a smoake by day, and the
shining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory
should be a defence: and a covering should be for a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
in the day from the heat, and a place of refuge, and
a covert from the storme and from the raine. In which
words, all these parts of the Lords glory upon his
Church are comprized, evidently foretelling, that as he
would adorne and glorifie his Church then with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of knowledge and holinesse; so his protection
should shelter it from all danger, as the coverings did the

Yea, every wicked man, whose conscience is not utterly

               <p>To applie all this.<note place="margin">Application.</note> And first to this people of <hi>Iudah:</hi>

for holy knowledge,<note place="margin">1. All holy knowledge decayed.</note> when they daily waxed more blind

for reverence of the Lords messengers, in that they

only to the word and the covenant of the Lord, were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
hated, made as signes and wonders, like as the

for protection,<note place="margin">3 Protection oft almost gone.</note> when as the glory was almost gone in
<hi>Ezechias</hi> dayes, when he himselfe and Ierusalem were in

at what time he was carried away captive into Babylon.

                  </note> which was the next &amp; most manifest forerunner
of the finall departure and of their glory. So they had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, overthrow after overthrow, untill this plague
was utterly come upon them, and their glory also depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without hope of recovery, till Gods anger was fully

at large,<note place="margin">Glory departed till Gods anger accomplished.</note> wherein the outward glory of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
&amp; how all this was fully verified amongst them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the vision: That God had indeed made all
these removals of their glory before his finall departure.</p>
               <p>But now let us in the second place,<note place="margin">Application to our selves.</note> returne home,
from Iudah, unto our selves, and lay it neere unto our

whether he doe not thereby threaten manifestly, that he
is purposed utterly to remove, and to take away all his
glory and his gratious presence from us, and to leave us
to the will of our enemies, to be made a reproch and a
shame when he is departed from us, unlesse we prevent
and retaine him, by our speedie amendment.</p>
               <p>To begin and apply in order,<note place="margin">1. Removing so generally our delight in his word.</note> as in the presence of the
Lord. Where is that delight of ours in most places, that
we were wont to take in his word, our inciting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
one another; <hi>Come, let us goe up to the house of
the Lord:</hi> our talking of it, and our rejoycing in it, as of
our chiefe glory? Do we not in steed hereof waxe weary
of it very generally, hearing it commonly for a fashion,
or for satisfying of the law, or some like respect? Are we
not growne to this passe,<note place="margin">Growing to be ashamed of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it.</note> for the most part, to be ashamed
of talking or reasoning of it? Yea, what is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
than in steed hereof, to discourage one another
from being forward in following after it, and those holy

set rather to flocke to all kinds of vanities,<note place="margin">Flocking to all vanities.</note> and places of
the worse resort, to dishonour and provoke the Lord;
even to those places, where is open profession of all

Let the ordinarie frequenting of so many profane
and lascivious playes fitter for Sodome, than the Church
of God, be witnesse.</p>
               <p>Where is that holy,<note place="margin">2. Our sound knowledge of the word in many places.</note> sound, and powerfull knowledge
of God amongst the people become, which in regard
of the long and quiet time of the Gospell, that thorow
the riches of the Lords mercy we have enjoyed, should
have growne to ripenesse,<note place="margin">Amongst the people.</note> that which was wont so to
abound amongst us in many goodly Congregations,
whereby the Popish sort were ashamed of themselves for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7009:61"/>
their ignorance: specially (as was said) that love which
hath bin so declared in hungring after the word, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in it as our felicitie. Nay, what is become, for
most part, of that singular commendation for readinesse
in the Scriptures, and soundnesse of judgement in the
word of the Lord,<note place="margin">Amongst most of our Gentry, having most meanes,</note> wherein many of our Gentry and

which they were much to be commended; and indeed
it was their dutie far so to excell: for they of all other,
have the most meanes, for all good helps and leysure, to
get the knowledg of the Lord;<note place="margin">&amp; most bound thereto.</note> and also are most bound
thereunto,<note place="margin">Prov: 17. 16.</note> for the abundance of Gods blessings, which

saith?<note place="margin">All formerly to silence the proudest Papist</note> Whereas heretofore many of them were
able to put to silence the proudest Papists amongst us, in
displaying the abominations of Poperie, and in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
the Gospell of Christ, committed unto us in
trust to that end, is it not to be feared, (our swaggering
courses considered, and our generall neglect of religion)
that we are in the greatest part by far, become unable to
maintaine the one,<note place="margin">Now suffering the Popish sort to insult over us.</note> or to confute the other, or so much as
to speake with any lively feeling of the truth of the
Lord, or yet as having any sound love of the one, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slike
of the other. And how should it be otherwise,
when we for most part give over our selves wholly to
our pleasures with all licentiousnesse,<note place="margin">Chiefly thorow living in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note> or to follow after
the honours and riches of the world; and which is yet
far worse, and more to be feared, (as an evident fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
of vengeance) when we are so generally ashamed
to be noted, for being forward or zealous, in the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Gospell of Christ? On the other side, are not
many of the Popish sort growne to be exceeding cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the mysterie of Antichrists iniquitie,<note place="margin">Popish sort growne cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their mysterie.</note> and the

of our blessed God, out of his heavenly word, they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7009:62"/>
are commonly knowne to be far more ignorant,<note place="margin">Though more ignorant than our children in the first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ.</note> than
our litle children, which are but catechized in the faith
of Christ? Are not even ordinarily the simpler sort of
them, waxen generally so perfect in the cheife points of
their religion, by their paines which they take (though
alas to their perdition) for setting up the throne of the
Beast againe, as that they are able therein to goe about
the greatest part of the cheife among us, and put us to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence?
We can many of us be the best companions for
them that may be,<note place="margin">Many of us good compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for them.</note> and can talke with them, of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of vaine pleasure and commoditie, and happily in

word, and more dislike of their abominations, than we
do; and who is so good a fellow, as one of them, though
a deadly enemie to the Gospell, and all that sincerely
professe the same; but hardly a word either for Christ
and his truth, or against Antichrist and his iniquitie.
Though we have as good cause to be armed against him,
with all possible meanes, especially with the armour of
the word of the Lord, as ever Nation had before, having
had so many faire warnings from him. Oh that this may
be well thought of, for sundry parts of our Land?</p>
               <p>But here it may be some will say: That there was
never more knowledge in the Land.<note place="margin">Objection for abundance of knowledge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> To whom I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
Far be it off from me, from obscuring any gift or
blessing of the Lord amongst us. Nay, I magnifie him
for them: but that which I have spoken, hath bin of a
sanctified and powerfull knowledge, wherein the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God and our glory consists,<note place="margin">Rom: 14 17.</note> and that amongst
our people. And secondly, of such I would demand,
as before the Lord, whether in many a Congregation,
there be not a sensible decay, as in all places where the
meanes have failed; and for the rest, what is our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
generally in regard of our meanes, and the long
continuance of them? Have we not very many places,
where within sundry miles, there are not two to be
found in a Towne, which have any sound, substantiall,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7009:62"/>
and saving knowledge, even of matters of salvation, and
the wayes of God? And of those who seeme to have
knowledge, doe not many of them, as it were grope for
the wall, like the blinde stumbling at noone day as in
the twilight, making no conscience at all of their wayes,
no not of monstrous sins wherein they live, not fearing
any judgement towards the Land or themselves? Is not
the very day darke over them (as we may so speake) for
seeing their owne sinnes, or the fearfull sins of the Land?
And may not the Lord therefore as he threatneth, cause
the Sunne to goe downe at noone, and darken the earth
in the cleare day?</p>
               <p>And where is that holinesse become,<note place="margin">2. Holinesse &amp; submission to Christs Gospel much removed.</note> whereby the
Lord should be sanctified of us, and honoured of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

to this passe, to make such a fearefull revolt from all holy
conscience of our wayes, which many began to make, to
open impietie &amp; profanenes; as that certaine who were
of us,<note place="margin">Falling daily to most horrible impieties and profanenesse.</note> have departed from us, although not without their
owne fearefull sinne in that behalfe. The old Serpent
hath undoubtedly used this, as one first and principall
provocation hereunto. Even the very dishonors done
to the Lords Sacred Majestie amongst us, by our hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
sinnes, and lest they should be polluted by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
impieties, whereof they can see no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse;
and also for feare of the vengeance of the Lord
hanging over us for the same: whereby they have made
a most grievous rent in the Church of God,<note place="margin">Hence so many separating.</note> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering

But contrarily, he will forsake her, cast her off, leave her
to be destroyed, untill the remnant left of her, learne to
seeke him, and to be reconciled to him againe. For the
Lords speech is thus much in effect:<note place="margin">Summe of the Lords speech.</note> Goe through the

the Citie which I had chosen to dwell in for ever, and

be as the signet upon my right hand: yet seeing it now
casteth me off, and despiseth to heare my voyce any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or to be reformed, I will not spare it, neither shall
mine eye have pitie on it, save onely of my remnant in it,
but I will leave it to be destroyed and desolate, at least
for seventie yeeres. Whence the Lord would have all
his people to learne,<note place="margin">No priviledges can secure a sinnefull people from Gods wrath.</note> That no priviledges, promises,
mercies, deliverances, no, nor any profession of religion,
can doe a people any good at all to secure them from his

him and his word sent unto them in his mercy, he will
cast them off and leave them.</p>
               <p>This also is a matter to be well thought of by us.
Because as they of Iudah were wont to secure themselves
in their prerogatives, even so doe we ordinarily. First
therefore to begin with them: Were not these and the
like the things whereby they were wont to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

                  </note> of which they so gloried, saying, <hi>The Temple of

to flatter themselves,<note place="margin">The Law should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Priest.</note> depraving Gods word, thus: <hi>The
Law shall not depart from the Priest, nor counsell from the

the things whereby we are commonly waxen so strong
and safe in our owne conceit? And are we not hereupon
become so secure from any dreadfull judgement, as that
no warnings from heaven nor earth, words, corrections,

they rather still approved generally of their former evill

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7009:72"/>
these abominations following, whereby they filled up
the measure of their iniquities, and against which the

for the same untill it came upon them.</p>

us all, both in regard of our former heinous sinnes and
the judgements that have beene upon us both formerly
and of late, with the unplacable rage of our adversaries;
yet we have many things which may seeme to assure us
of Gods favour, and secure us from any such judgement
or the like.</p>
               <p>As first (which was shortly touched) for that we have
so many worthy preachers and good people unfeignedly
fearing the Lord. Secondly, that we have the Lords
true religion so soundly maintained. Thirdly, all open
Idolatrie is banished. Fourthly, such good lawes so reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
established; Fiftly, for that more then all these,
we have the Lords annointed so graciously and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
set over us in peace, with such a happy unity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
withall neighbour nations, and also so blessed an
issue. Sixtly Above all these, The Lord hath so often
testified his fatherly love and care for us, in such tender
and marvellous preservations, both of our Princes and
of our whole nation, and in so bringing his and our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to shame, as he hath heereby made this Iland the
wonder of the world. And lastly for that never nation
did injoy the Gospell so long in that flourishing prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and peace, which we have done; All these and the
like are such evident tokens of the Lords favour &amp; love
towards us, as that we can have no such cause of feare, as
this forewarning &amp; many of our Preachers would beare
us in hand.</p>
               <p>To answer all these and whatsoever else can be said to
secure us;<note place="margin">Answer to our securing upon our preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> Let us but consider, what King reigned in
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and how many yeeres togither before this

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7009:72"/>
and hastned on,<note place="margin">Iudah in the beginning of her miseries no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to us in such prerogatives.</note> and when many of these abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

till within three moneths of these miseries begun, as we
heard before: and it will appeare most like, that this
people could not be then inferiour to us in any of these
signes of Gods favour, except this, that we live in the
dayes of the Gospell; to which we shall answer after.
For first immediately before this vengeance began, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
had that most holy King <hi>Iosiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They had that holy King <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi>

and him they injoyed, reigning in peace over them, for
one and thirtie yeeres togither. And secondly, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of religion,<note place="margin">Puritie of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> we know that never King went beyond
<hi>Iosiah</hi> in his reformation and care, compelling all strictly
to serve the Lord according to his word;<note place="margin">2 King: 23. 3, 4, 5, 6. &amp; 12. 24, 25.</note> and in taking
away, so far as he was able, the very monuments of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
with all things that might either revive it openly
or secretly; or that might be any way a snare unto the
people. And also how he reformed all other abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <note place="margin">All abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reformed.</note>
that could be spied in all the land of Iudah, or in
Ierusalem. So as the Holy Ghost beares this witnesse of
him, that like unto <hi>Iosiah</hi> was no King before him, that
turned unto the Lord with all his heart, nor rose up
after him: That for puritie of religion, and a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
we can make no doubt but they were equall
to us.</p>
               <p>And for worthy Teachers according to that time, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
take it,<note place="margin">Worthy Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers according to that time.</note> that we can make no question, but that they had
many of the Priests and Levites both learned and godly,
when the King himself was so forward to incourage and

stirred up by the Lord extraordinarily, as <hi>Ieremie, Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

after. All these and sundry others they had, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they dealt most unkindly with them, as <hi>Ieremies</hi>

but that where such a worthy head &amp; example was,
with such excellent Teachers, there must needs be also
many of the children which God had given to them;
and those of all sorts, even of the chiefe Magistrates, as
well as others. Such were these which mourned in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
for the abominations,<note place="margin">Isai: 8. 18.</note> who are commanded to be

and sundry Worthies, as those which spake for <hi>Ieremie,</hi>

yea,<note place="margin">Dan: 1. 3, 4, 5.</note> even children of the Kings seede, and of the Princes,

it was surely they, having, as was shewed, as worthy a

they therefore accounted the breath of their nostrils, and
such a goodly tree as under whose shadow they were safe

Besides that they had also then as just cause to
boast hereof, as we have now or much more, both in that
continuall preservation of their Land, through a feare
cast on their enemies, that none durst invade them, so
long as they obeyed the Lord in any good sort, (of
which we spake) and by their great deliverances, as that
in the dayes of <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> and others mentioned.</p>

and therefore having received so many strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances,
it is more like that he intends to punish us
more spiritually; which is indeed the heaviest judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all other. We answer; That true it is; That
we may as yet certainely expect an increase of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
judgement of blindnesse of minde and hardnesse
of heart, to fill up the measure of our iniquities, and to
make the condemnation of all the reprobate and our
plagues the more just thereby; yet these things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thought of and well weighed, with the former, may
cause us to dread some temporall plague, and that heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than all which have gone before.<note place="margin">Witnesse tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Churches and Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

for that as I take it (under submission to better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
we cannot be any more assured, that our Land
is as yet purged more of the abominable Idolatrie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in former times, and of the bloud of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
the faithfull Martyrs of Iesus Christ in the dayes
of Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> with innumerable moe abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>And yet above all these,<note place="margin">God purposing to remaine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> us, must needes deale as a kind father to bring us to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> That if the Lord doe love us,

he will deale with us as kinde and wise fathers are wont

us and makes us stoope to him. He hath already corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

most thicke of late time; whence we must needs expect
a more sharpe scourge to awaken and amend us than any

can that be, we take not upon us to divine. But let every
one bethinke himselfe, and looke into the booke of
God, and he will easily see by the course of Gods former
proceedings, what cause we have to feare: especially, if
the same abominations be found amongst us, or rather
greater than these, for which the Lord threatned, and
brought this wofull judgement: for if he spared not the
naturall branches then,<note place="margin">Rom: 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For other prerogatives;<note place="margin">Other prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives more increaseth the wrath; as the Gospell for our denying the power of it.</note> If any can be found wherein
we doe excell them, they will but rather serve to increase
and hasten our judgement. As the Gospell, for example,
offring more grace and power of obedience, must needs
more kindle the Lords wrath. Because so many of us

must know certainely,<note place="margin">Rom: 2. 24.</note> that it is with the Lord, that his

giving such a charge to his holy Angell thus carefully
to preserve his chosen from this destruction; to goe
thorow the Citie, and set a marke upon every one of
them, to overpasse none: and also the destroying Angels
to follow after the marking Angell, so as they hurt none,
till all the faithfull be marked; he would have all to
know thus much: That he never casts off the care of his
people, no, not then when all things seeme most confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the earth. And secondly, when they are so ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
amongst the wicked, as that they can hardly be
knowne amongst themselves, much lesse to the eyes of
the world, that yet he still tendreth them, and watcheth
over them continually. Thirdly, that he will at length
make his fatherly care and watchfull providence known
unto them, and that by some gracious and wonderfull
deliverance, even in this world, if it be so best for them
and for his glory. And lastly, that they evermore must
be surely marked before the destruction come. The Lord
hath bin very carefull to set downe this point also most
clearely, in every of those great destructions, which are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7009:76"/>
recorded in Scriptures, for examples and warnings to all
posteritie: That hereby his owne faithfull servants may
receiue comfort against the greatest afflictions that can
come upon the world.</p>
               <p>As first in that terrible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">1. At the stood.</note> overflowing in the generall
destruction of the old world. The waters came not untill
<hi>Noah</hi> had first prepared and finished the Arke,<note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n: 11. 16.</note> and also
God himselfe had shut up both him and his in the same;
so locking and sealing up the dores with his owne hand,
as that all the waters, rage they never so horribly, and
hoyse him up above the highest mountaines, yet cannot
hurt him. And why dealeth the Lord thus carefully
with <hi>Noah? Thee</hi> (saith he) <hi>have I seene righteous before
me in this generation:</hi> that is, I have seene they heart sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
and thy purpose and indevour ever to please me;
not following the course of the times, but crying out of
the iniquitie thereof,<note place="margin">Hebr: 11. 7.</note> beleeving my threatnings, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Arke according to my commandement, to
save thy selfe and familie from the vengeance to come.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. At Sodomes destruction.</note> in that dreadfull overthrow of Sodome and
Gomorrha, before the fire and brimstone came upon
those filthy Cities,<note place="margin">Gen: 19. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Lot</hi> must not onely be marked, but
also gotten forth safe from the destruction. The Angels
have such a charge of him,<note place="margin">17. 22.</note> as that they get him by the
hand, pull and hale him for haste, being far more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for him, than he is for himselfe, and they never leave
him, till they have safe conducted him out, and then
bid him hie for his life, get him into Zoar. They tell him
plainely, that the Lords care was so great for him, that
they can doe nothing in this destruction, their hands
were tyed, untill he be there safe out of all the danger.
The reason of it also is carefully set downe by the Lord
himselfe,<note place="margin">2 Pet: 2. 7, 8.</note> why he accounted him worthy to escape; for
that he was a just and righteous man, grieved with the
uncleane conversation of the wicked, his righteous
soule was vexed from day to day with all their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:7009:76"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Before this destruction.</note> before this destruction the Lord foretold to
<hi>Ieremie</hi> particularly, That he would give him his life
for a prey,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ieremie</hi> &amp; sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of those who favoured him.</note> in all places wheresoever he came, because of
his faithfulnesse in sticking to his word and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and for his warning the people. And so indeed it
came to passe,<note place="margin">Ier: 40. 2, 3, 4.</note> that the Lord did not onely preserve him
with sundry others fearing his name; but gave him also
speciall favour, in the eyes of the enemies, who led them
captives. So as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himselfe gives charge to
<hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> his chiefe steward, to look well to <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
to doe him no harme, but to doe for him as himselfe
would; whether to goe home with them into Babylon,
and there to receive kindnesse, or to tarry still in the
land of Iudah with the people, which should be left
there behinde. And this mercy did the Lord shew not
onely unto <hi>Ieremie,</hi> but unto others also that had bin
kinde unto his Prophet:<note place="margin">as <hi>Ebedmelech.</hi>
                  </note> As to <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> the Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian,
who had spoken for <hi>Ieremie</hi> to the King of Iudah,
to get him out of the dungeon:<note place="margin">Ier: 38. 8. to 13.</note> to whom also the Lord
gave his life for a prey, because he put his trust in the
Lord.<note place="margin">Ier: 39. 16, 17, 18. Gedaliah.</note> And <hi>Gedaliah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> whose father <hi>Ahikam</hi> had formerly

                     <hi>Daniel</hi> and his companions.</note>

                     </gap>. 5, 6, 9. 13, 15, 17.</note> the Lord granted that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
favour, both to be brought up by the King of

excellent learning, and so far to surpasse all others, as to
be most meet for their singular knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to stand with high favour in the presence of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7009:77"/>
that mightie Monarch, though otherwise a cruell op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor
of the Church of God, who had caried them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
captive.<note place="margin">Dan: 3 27.</note> He gave unto them moreover divine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of his fatherly care and protection, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of all his enemies, in those miraculous deliverances
out of the fierie furnace,<note place="margin">Dan: 1. 8.</note> and from the Lions den, because
they did cleave so fast unto the Lord, that they would
not suffer themselves to be polluted with the least part
or shew of the Idolatrie of the Heathen.<note place="margin">6. 22.</note> The like favour
for preservation he granted to <hi>Ezechiel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">So to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> &amp; sundry others.</note> and sundry
others.</p>
               <p>And to omit all other examples;<note place="margin">The Christians before the last destruction of Ierusalem.</note> At the last and finall

the Christians had done, and that they were safe there,
the Citie was sacked, and all that desolation fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
as was declared before.</p>
               <p>God thus providing to set them safe before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers
came. Whereby we may see evidently both by
the testimonies and charge of the Lord himselfe, and the
continuall examples, that the faithfull servants of God,
cleaving firmely unto him, in the backsliding of the
rest, have the onely immunitie and priviledge, above all
others, to be preserved at such times, so far as shall be any
way good for them; and shall be withall, for the Lords
owne glory, and the salvation of his people.</p>

how in the most terrible denuntiation of vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this people, that God would not spare them, for
the greatnesse of their iniquitie, no, <hi>though Noah, Iob, and

added and carefully recorded by the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Ezek: 24. 14. 16. 18, 20.</note> That

<hi>Should yet deliver their owne soules by their right eousnesse.</hi>
And againe, <hi>They only shal be delivered themselves, but the
land shall be wast:</hi> So the point is most cleere from the
Lords owne warrant.</p>
               <p>Let us now consider the reasons of it to strengthen us
yet further against the time of temptation. A principall
cause hereof is, The Lords most fatherly and tender love
towards these. That howsoever they are unto the world
men most odious and monstrous,<note place="margin">Isa: 8. 18.</note> for that <hi>they will not run
with the rest to the same excesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 4.</note> as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi>
speakes, and because they by their holy profession and
carriage condemne the world as <hi>Noah</hi> did in his age, by
his preaching and living and making of the Arke, yet
are they unto the Lord as deere as the apple of his owne
eye.<note place="margin">Zach. 2. 8.</note> That he cannot possibly forget them, wheresoever
they be dispersed and howsoever. No, though it were
possible for the mother to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>so unnaturall as to forget
the childe of her wombe,<note place="margin">Isay. 44. 14, 15, 16.</note> yet he cannot forget these.
They are graven on the palmes of his hands and are ever
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7009:78"/>
in his sight. His mercy is about them in the greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,
as a wall of fire to fence them and to consume all

of fire to carry them safe out of all such dangers,<note place="margin">Isa: 43. 1. 3.</note> yea,
to save and deliver them in the midst of the fire and in
the midst of the water. And therefore when the day of
the Lords vengeance commeth, those who formerly
thought on his name, and spake to keep others from the
wickednes of the times, are taught to comfort themselves
herein, because <hi>they are written in the booke of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal: 3. 16, 17, 18.</note>

God, and him that serveth him not,</hi> as we saw in all

why he spares a sinfull nation so long. But if they be

execution of vengeance, for then he bids, <hi>Smite and

               </p>
               <p>But heere It will be said, If this be so; How commeth
it to passe,<note place="margin">Objection.</note> that many of the godly doe so oft feele the
smart of such calamities as well as the rest.<note place="margin">The godly oft feele the smart of such calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aswell as the rest.</note> As it is very
cleare. That many of the deare servants of God, were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away in this and the former captivity as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
even many of those who were marked; as we
heard before. That the Prophet himselfe was carried
away in the former captivitie, as also <hi>Daniel</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
with many other, and so were partakers of the
common miseries of the captivitie with the rest. It is
likewise very probable that sundry of them died by the
sword of the enemie, and some by other calamities. And
on the other side It is certaine, that many of the wicked
escaped amongst the godly. It may be therefore deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
what this marking did then stand the godly insteed
or what they were better for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:7009:78"/>
To this it may be answered,<note place="margin">Answ:</note> First, That this is very
true,<note place="margin">Why the Lord oft lets his, feele the smart with the rest.</note> that many of the godly doe often feele the smart of
such generall judgements. And that most justly for sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
causes, for which God threatneth, his wont to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his deerest seruants. As either for their former secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,<note place="margin">Apoc, 1, 2. 4, 5. 15, 16, 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 3. 19.</note>
or else for seeking their peace carnally, by fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
themselves unto the evill times, as the greatest part
is wont to doe ever, so far as possibly they may, not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
utterly from God. Or for that they have not mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for the abominations of the rest. Or in that they
have not bene so instant with the Lord, for pacifying
his wrath and turning away the judgment as they ought.
Or for neglecting their duties of Magistracie, ministrie,
government in their families; or at least of admonition,
exhortation, or example for saving the rest, and staying
the course of sinne. Or finally for that they have not
beene so faithfull in all things, in their places &amp; callings
as they should: or for some other their scandalous sins,
or sinnes against conscience, whereby they have provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the Lord against them: for he useth to correct such,
and other sinnes like to these in his owne servants, by
heavy and sharpe temporall scourges, and sometimes by
death it selfe. Thus he shewred his displeasure against
good <hi>Iosiah</hi> for thrusting himselfe into battell without
warrant.<note place="margin">2 Chro, 35. 21, 22.</note> And against <hi>Moses</hi> for not sanctifying the Lord
at the waters of strife.<note place="margin">Num: 20. 12. 1 Cor: 11. 30.</note> Among the Corinthians also for
their unreverent receiving the Lords supper. And thus
may he suffer his owne deerest servants, to endure the
common calamities with the rest at such times, either for
a just correction of their former sinnes, as hath beene
shewed; or only for the tryall of their faith and constancy,
or for an exercise of their faith and repentance, and to
make them more fervent in praier, or to further their
sanctification to conforme them more &amp; more to Christ;
or it may be to increase the vengeance against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

in their prosperitie, maketh them to see their carnall and

up for them such meanes as they never knew (as he did

Some, who could never attaine to any grace at all, under

run riot, as the prodigall sonne, being most rebellious
against the Lord and his word: yet when he hath
brought them into the fetters and chaines of afflictions,
then have they set themselves to seeke him; and then the
word which before they despised, hath begun to worke
in them to life.</p>
               <p>A notable president of his mercy herein he hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be registred in his Booke,<note place="margin">2 Chro: 33. 1. 2. 3.</note> for all posteritie, even
in <hi>Manasseh,</hi> who though he had so good a father, as
that worthy <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> and was so vertuously brought up;
yea, and had seene his fathers reformation, yet (as the

Lord, untill he brought upon him <hi>the Captaines of the
hoast of the King of Asshur, who put him in fetters, bound
him in chaines, and caried him to Babel. But when he was in
tribulation, he began to seeke unto the Lord his God, and
humbled himselfe greatly before the God of his fathers, and
so God was intreated of him, heard his prayer, and brought
him againe into Ierusalem into his Kingdome. Then</hi> (saith
the Holy Ghost) <hi>Manasseh knew that the Lord was God:</hi>
and then he destroyed all the Idolatry and abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which he had bin the cause of, and restored that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which he had before defaced. And to shut up all:
By these the Lord doth exceedingly advance his owne
glory in the midst of his enemies; as here he did by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
and his companions, and makes himselfe and his
truth evidently knowne by their constancie, and leaves
the wicked enemies the more without excuse.</p>
               <p>As for those whom he takes away by death in such
times,<note place="margin">The state of the godly, whom God takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at such times.</note> their death is unto them but as the gate of life. It
is a finall deliverance from all their sinnes, and from all
feare of every kinde of enemie and miserie. It is unto
them a more speedie entrance into the full possession of
their fathers joy, and of their glorious inheritance, than
otherwise nature would have afforded them. And thus
much for the godly which goe into Captivitie, or fall by
the sword, or endure any calamitie with the rest; what
the marking avayleth them; how happy their estate is,
whatsoever come to passe.</p>
               <p>But on the other side;<note place="margin">State of the wicked in such calamities.</note> for the wicked, who in such
generall calamities escape the sword, or the like cruell
death, it is cleane contrary with them: For the Lords

                     </gap>s 9. 4.</note> whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they goe, untill they be destroyed from off the

of the powring out of the viols of Gods wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, to the increase of their torment, and their feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expectation of further vengeance. Their calamities
which they endure, are nothing else but preparatives
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7009:80"/>
and fore-runners of the damnation of hell.</p>
               <p>Hereby they also become more senselesse and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent;
they waxe more hardned and enraged to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
and blaspheme against the Lord. And ordinarily
they are alwaies chased in their owne consciences, as
<hi>Cain;</hi> having a sound of feare in their eares; the worme
beginning to gnaw, and their sinne to sting them to the
very hearts; and consequently to become runnegates to
the grave, and to eternall confusion. Or let the best be
supposed, that ever can befall any of them; they are but
in a lethargie or sleepie sicknesse, without sense, untill the
vengeance of God light wholly upon them, to send them
to the place of their destruction, where they shall never
finde any rest after. But for their wretched estate, we
shall see it further in another place. And thus we may
behold the estate of all both good and bad in such gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
calamities.<note place="margin">Conclusion.</note> Now who is there that beleeves the
word of the Lord, whom the due consideration of this
one point alone, must not needs drive to watching and
prayer; and to cause him to seeke to be prepared afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
in these dayes of our peace, that he may be thus
undoubtedly marked, and under this protection: yea,
that he may be thus hid in the evill day, and finde all the
comforts belonging to the godly; and that he may be
sure to escape those certaine and dreadfull miseries of
the wicked, what judgements soever it shall please him
to exercise us withall:<note place="margin">Prov. 22. 3.</note> for <hi>A wise man</hi> (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith)
<hi>foreseeth the plague and hideth himselfe; but a foole goeth on
still, and is punished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This therefore may serve as a first cause to enforce us
all to betake our selves more instantly to watching and
prayer, then ever we have done, if we would be so mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
as to finde the Lord to be a Sanctuarie, and a hiding
place unto us in the evill day; how soone soever he shall
bring it upon us for all our sinnes and provocations; and
in the meane time, to get boldnesse thereby, and peace
of conscience, against all assaults whatsoever. And more
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7009:81"/>
also, unlesse we will strip our selves wilfully of his most
gratious providence and protection, and desperately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our selves and all ours, to all kinde of miserie and
unhappinesse, both in this life present, and that which is
to come.</p>
               <p>If any shall demand further,<note place="margin">What the mark was wherewith the godly were marked.</note> what this marke was:
we must remember; That this Vision was given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the capacitie of man, to shew this unto the
Prophet, that he might make it knowne to all sorts, what
care the Lord hath for his faithfull ones in the greatest
confusions, and when they seeme to be utterly neglected
and forgotten; and to this end he hath caused it to be
written for us. This moreover seemeth evidently to be
an allusion to the custome of men, who use to set a marke
on such things as they have a speciall care to preserve
heedfully. Or rather an alluding to the marking of the
houses of his owne people in Egypt, with the bloud of
the Lambe,<note place="margin">Exo. 12. 22, 23.</note> that the destroying Angell might not touch
any of them, when he destroyed the Egyptians. Or else
at least to the marking of <hi>Rahabs</hi> house in the Citie of
Iericho,<note place="margin">Iosh. 2. 18.</note> before the destruction came, for the saving her
selfe and hers.</p>
               <p>But if it be demanded,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> whether they had not indeed
some speciall marke of difference to be discerned from
the rest: we may answer truly; That there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,<note place="margin">They were marked both inwardly and outwardly.</note>
but they were marked indeed both inwardly and
outwardly: Inwardly, by the bloud of Christ sprinkling
them, and by the Spirit sanctifying them, making them
to cry, Abba oh Father: Outwardly, by a bold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
outward profession of the truth of God in word and
deed; and more specially by mourning and crying out,
for all the abominations, which were practised daily to
anger the Lord, as followeth after. But this is not that
marking here spoken of, much lesse is it any marking
with any outward marke or signe, as some doe vainely
and very fondly conceit; but only to make them sure, that
they might be preserved from the destroyer. The words
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7009:81"/>
signifying nothing else,<note place="margin">What y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> words signifie.</note> but marke them with a marke,
or signe them with a signe. That is, marke them surely
and carefully,<note place="margin">Ezech: 9. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> doubling the word, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

ages, to shew the condition of all his true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
servants, living amongst wicked and ungodly men.
To him we may adjoyne that faithfull Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ieremie.</note> who though he lived in a far better time and place, both
in the bosome of the Church, and in the dayes of that
holy King <hi>Iosiah;</hi> yea, &amp; in that worthy reformation for
many yeeres togither, (for he began to preach unto
them in the thirteenth yeere of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and so continued
untill this Captivitie was brought upon them) yet he
likewise is vexed continually, even from the beginning
of his prophesying. This was a daily corosive to his
soule, to see the people so backward in embracing the
truth, so senselesse and impenitent in their sinnes, in such
evident tokens of Gods vengeance rushing upon them,
so prone to the former Idolatrie, wherein they had lived,
and to all other abominations, to anger the Lord, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the example of their most worthy Prince,
and all the meanes used to reclaime them. This made
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7009:82"/>
his very soule to faint within him, and his heart to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that no admonitions of his, nor of other the holy
Prophets, could doe them any good, although they
daily discovered their iniquities, and so proclaimed this
desolation. That beholding this and seeing that now,
there was no more hope, but that their plagues must
needs breake in violently upon them, he wisheth his
head full of water,<note place="margin">Ier: 9. 1, 2, 3.</note> and his eyes a fountaine of teares,
that he might weepe for them day and night, and for all
the miseries that were to come upon them. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
desireth that he had (if it were) but a poore cottage
of a wayfaring man in the desolate wildernesse, to live
all alone, and never to heare of their sinnes, nor to see
their wicked conversations any more.</p>
               <p>More than this, we may also observe, how carefully
this is recorded in the Booke of God. That divers of
his most faithfull servants, hearing of some haynous sins
committed, to his dishonour and provocation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the judgements due thereunto, or foreseeing by
evident signes some present calamitie hasting upon
them for the same, have bin strangely humbled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon:
yea, how they have wept, prayed, fasted, lyen
downe on the ground, and could not be comforted. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Moses.</note> who was ever thus humbled upon the new
provocations of the people, and with him <hi>Samuel, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
and others; see <hi>Ezra</hi>

his clothes,<note place="margin">Ezra 9. 1 &amp; 10. 6.</note> pluckt off the haire of his head and of his
beard, sate astonied, got privately into his chamber, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
neither eating bread nor drinking water, mourning,
because of the transgressions of them of the Captivitie,
and fearing some new wrath to come upon them. This
caused him to be cast downe in himselfe,<note place="margin">&amp; 9. 2.</note> when he heard
of the strange women, which Gods people had maried
in the Captivitie,<note place="margin">&amp; 10. 9.</note> contrary to his law; how they had
mingled themselves with the prophane Heathen, which
were given to all abominations, whereby their children
began to prove heathenish also; and because the Princes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7009:83"/>
and Rulers had bin chiefe in this trespasse. And not
onely he himselfe, but the people likewise, sat trembling
for those and other sins, and for a grievous raine, which
God had sent upon them at that time, as an evident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of his displeasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> So holy King <hi>Iosiah,</hi> when he heard the words of the

could have any answer, even of <hi>Huldah,</hi> because he knew

               <p>Finally, the two Prophets in the Revelation, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>

of God, by the abominations of Antichrist, in so cleare
a light of the Gospell of Christ, shining againe so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously.</p>
               <p>And thus have we seene plainly, this propertie of Gods
people, how they use to sigh and mourne for all the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of the times wherein they live.</p>
               <p>Now to ascend to the next degree of the griefe of the
godly for the wickednesse of the times, the Prophet saith,
That they sigh and cry; not only that they sigh, but sigh
and cry for all the abominations.</p>
               <p>Wherein the Holy Ghost would have all to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,<note place="margin">The godly wont not only to sigh, but to cry out for the abominations of the wicked according to their calling.</note>
that the godly at such times, have beene so farre off
from bearing with the wicked, or flattering them in their
sinnes; as that from mourning, they have come, in a zeale
of Gods glory, and in an holy indignation against sinne, to
cry out openly against the grievous corruptions and
transgressions; and have shewed thereby their detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so farre as their calling would any way suffer them;
especially, when the provocations have beene hainous to
anger the Lord. To omit the boldnesse of the young
Prophet sent to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and of <hi>Eliah</hi> to <hi>Ahab</hi> in the
case of open Idolatrie: this was the continuall course
of these three worthy Prophets,<note place="margin">as Esay.</note> 
                  <hi>Esay, Ieremie, Ezechiel,</hi>
and so of the rest that lived before the Captivitie. Thus
God bids <hi>Esay</hi> to lift up his voice as a trumpet,<note place="margin">Ieremie.</note> to tell
his people of their transgressions.<note place="margin">Ezekiel.</note> And this was <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>

               <p>For crying also unto the Lord at such times,<note place="margin">The godly have bin wont also to cry to God in such times.</note> it hath
beene a most usuall thing with all the faithfull Prophets

alwaies the neerer they have seene the wrath, the more

               <p>So that this point is likewise most cleare.<note place="margin">Reasons why the godly so sigh and cry for all the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</note> Yet to cause
it to worke more effectually upon our consciences, it
shall not be unnecessarie, a little to ponder some of the
reasons, why the godly doe so sigh, and cry. As</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, for that they, who are the Lords indeed, doe spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
resemble their heavenly Father,<note place="margin">Hating that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God hateth.</note> in hating those
things, which he hateth, with a vehement indignation;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7009:84"/>
and what sinnes they cannot reforme, nor restraine, those
they sigh and grieve for.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they can no more endure the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
done unto his heavenly Majestie,<note place="margin">That they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure the dishonours done to him.</note> according to that
measure of grace given unto them, than the Angels
which are in heaven, doe according unto theirs; and
therefore they being subject unto these passions of griefe
and sorrow, must needs in seeing and hearing vex their
righteous soules continually.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because they have of the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame spirit of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
zeale that was in our Saviour,<note place="margin">The spirit of zeale in them.</note> which was so fervent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his fathers house,<note place="margin">Ioh: 2. 17.</note> that to see it defiled, it did after
a sort eat and consume him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, how can it be, but that they who are the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
children of God,<note place="margin">Because of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than set up in Christs throne.</note> must needs be troubled to see Sathan
set up and worshipped in the throne of their heavenly
Father; for so he is in all places where iniquitie hath
the upper hand. Or what childe is there, except he be
extremely unnaturall, that is not cast downe in himselfe,
when he seeth his father angry.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, because not taking to heart such sinnes, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
guilty of them:<note place="margin">For that they are otherwise guiltie of the same sins.</note> for so <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
for the incestuous person, that they were therfore
guiltie of his sinne, because they had not sorrowed for it:
and saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor: 5. 2.</note> that they afterward by their sorrow and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">2 Cor: 7. 11.</note>
testified so many wayes, upon his letter sent unto
them, did shew themselves free from his wickednes.</p>
               <p>Sixtly and lastly, which is the principall; because for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
the sinne of one notorious offender unpunished,<note place="margin">For that for one notorious sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> place is in danger of Gods wrath.</note> Gods

and that therefore all of them are in danger of this
vengeance with the rest; even every one that doth not
what he can within the compasse of his calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it; at least by mourning for it, and crying unto
the Lord for pardon &amp; redresse. This he shewes plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in sundry places of his holy word; although the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
practise of the world, declares evidently that very
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7009:85"/>
few beleeve this point. Let us but observe two or three
places, the more to convince us and rouze our soules out
of this our deepe securitie.<note place="margin">Evident in the law of inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> As first that, of the case of
inquisition for murder, when one is found murdered, if
there be not the utmost endevour, both in Ministers,
Magistrates and people,<note place="margin">Dew: 21 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp;c.</note> to finde out the murtherer, and
to punish him by death (according to the law against
murther) the land is defiled, as is evident both by the
strict manner of the inquisition, that was to be made, by
all the people of Israel, and by the protestation of the
Rulers in the behalfe of all the people, clearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from it; and also by the prayer, that they were
taught to make in this forme;<note place="margin">vers. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, be mercifull unto
us thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
bloud to the charge of thy people Israel, and the bloud
shall be forgiven them.<note place="margin">vers. 9.</note> So</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou shalt take away
the cry of innocent bloud from thee; wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n thou shalt doe that
which is right in the sight of the Lord.</hi> Whereby we may
plainely see, that the bloud of one man thus murthered,
defileth the bordering land, and provoketh the Lords
displeasure against the people; if it be not carefully
sought out, and all holy meanes used for the avenging
of it, and taking away the cry thereof. Secondly, the
Lord declares there evidently,<note place="margin">Num: 35. 33, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> that the Land cannot be
clensed, and the sinne pardoned unto it, but by the
bloud of him that shed it; or at least, when no meanes is
neglected, to finde it out and to punish it. Thirdly, that
innocent bloud cryes for vengeance from the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
as <hi>Abels</hi> did, untill all the meanes be used for
purging it.</p>
               <p>A last reason of Gods severitie is;<note place="margin">God is more severe with his Church than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other.</note> because it is not
with the Church of God, as with the prophane Heathen;
for he dwels in the midst of his Church, and therefore if
any defile the Land,<note place="margin">Numb: 35. 34.</note> where his Church is, he will either
punish them severely,<note place="margin">Exod: 32 33.</note> or utterly depart from them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
evidently in his threatning after the making of

He is very terrible in the assembly of his Saints.
Now, as it is in this case of bloud, so every notorious sin
defileth the land,<note place="margin">Every notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sin defileth the Land to make it spue out the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as <hi>Canaa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

much more for such notorious abominations as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

               <p>This was the cheife reason of the solemne inquisition,<note place="margin">The cause of the inquisition at fasts for hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible offences.</note>

the people their sinnes, with the plagues &amp; judgements
due unto them, that they might returne from their evill
wayes, and so pacifie his wrath by crying unto him and
reforming all the abominations. Thus we see this point
also cleere. That the sinnes of a people, even of a few of
them not punished do anger the Lord and provoke him
against the whole land, making the land uncleane, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can he be fully pacified any way, but by the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and taking away of those sinnes. Whereby it is
most evident to the consciences of all men, what just
cause the godly have to sigh and to tremble for all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations
that are committed amongst them, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
which being notoriously knowne do still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

               <p>Now to apply this unto our selues;<note place="margin">Application.</note> And first for the

of those few, that are such true mourners indeed.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">For humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</note> this may strike the hearts of all sorts, who imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Atheisme, Poperie, and all outragious and profane licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse
daily increasing in the rest, are yet never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
therwith. And much more may it astonish all such,
who are so far off from the condition of these mourners,
as that they can solace themselues as freely, when they
heare of all excesse in iniquity, and whatsoever can bee
devised by Iewd men, to anger the Lord and to grieve
his Spirit, as ever they were wont at other times. Most
of all may it affright and awaken those, who use all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices

               <p>But of all other is their estate most fearfull who can

Or what have ye done to turne it from us? Know,
know for certaine, that this sinne of yours will one day
undoubtedly bring you weeping enough; you cannot
tell whether even in this life, as it did to them in the
Captivity; nay, even whether this same uery day; when
you shall do nothing but weep day and night in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

from the highest to the lowest, who find their hearts thus
affected in hearing of and beholding the abominations,
committed dayly to anger the Lord, howsoever it shall

bidding these destroying Angels to goe and smite, to

the enemies by which his Church is afflicted, as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian

They come not, nor fight of themselves alone, but at his

in the plots and conspiracies of wicked enemies, and in

thing for any man to looke at the Lord, and how he
sends and orders all; but every man almost useth still to
looke onely at the hand of the enemie. Neither is any
truth more cleerely set forth in the booke of God. We
will content our selves with two or three places, which
are past all exception, in which he hath of purpose
taught this point most fully.</p>
               <p>First, we may begin with the former great Captivitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of Israel,<note place="margin">In the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Israel the Lord sent on them the King of Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by <hi>Salmanazar;</hi> which was a good space before this

destroy them.<note place="margin">Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

because he had in his wrath prepared the Assyrian as his
rod, to whip both Israel and Iudah for their rebellion.
He termes also their staffe, meaning the weapons in their
hands, his indignation: because all their weapons were
cheifly prepared to execute his most fierce indignation.
He calls them moreover the Lords axe, whereby he cut
downe the Nations. All were the Lords instruments:
He sent these Assyrians,<note place="margin">The Lord gave them y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> charge, tho the enemie thought not so.</note> and gave them the charge to
spoile and trample under foote the rebellious Israelites,
as the mire in the streets. But did the proud Assyrian
know thus much, how God used him as his soldier? or
did he purpose in it to execute Gods wrath, and his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
judgement? No, saith the Lord, he thinketh not
so, neither doth his heart esteeme it so, as to avenge my
quarrell, but he imagineth to destroy not a few nations:
that is, All that he doth, he doth in pride and malice of
his owne wicked heart; and by his owne strength, as he
foolishly thinketh. Therefore the Lord saith plainely,
That when he had used him, as his rod to correct his
people,<note place="margin">Atter God hath corrected his Church, he wil burne his rods in the fire.</note> first Samaria and then Ierusalem, first Israel and
after Iudah, that he would surely burne the rod in the

to build up: and finally, when he caused his people
to doe worse than the Heathen,<note place="margin">vers. 9. 10. 17.</note> whom the Lord had
plagued, the Holy Ghost saith, <hi>That first the Lord spake
unto him, and to his people, but they would not regard.</hi> And
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7009:92"/>
when that would not serve,<note place="margin">The Lord brought on him the Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</note> he saith expresly, <hi>That the

<hi>that then when he was in tribulatior, he prayed to the Lord
his God, and humbled himselfe greatly before the God of his

and brought him againe into his kingdome in Ierusalem:

and fettred him, and caried him into Babylon,
and there heard his prayer, and brought him backe,
and set him againe in his kingdome: it was God that
did it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for this Captivitie, as the Prophet here fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
it,<note place="margin">So in this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie the Lord likewise did all.</note> and the Lord said, he would doe it; and like as he
bids the enemies, which are represented by these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
to <hi>goe and smite;</hi> so the Holy Ghost saith plainely,
(using the very same phrase of speech,<note place="margin">2 Chro: 36. 17.</note> that is used con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Manasseh) That God brought upon them the King
of the Caldeans, who slew their young men with the sword,
and spared neither young nor old, but made this havocke of
them all.</hi> They came not meerely of themselves, but
God sent them as his executioners. This <hi>Ieremie</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth

                  <hi>Thou hast called as in a solemne day, my terrours round

enemies on every fide to compasse them in, that none
might escape his wrath: wherein he shewes, how the

And thus hath it ever bin, when enemies have
come against the Church, (as we may see cleane thorow
the booke of God, and especially in the booke of the
Iudges) it was principally, because the Lord had stirred
them up, he had mustered and brought them. For if he

And amongst others; Did not the Lord specially pluck

not thus caried up these, into the Arke, not made with

And we may further say by the infinite mercy of God;<note place="margin">And the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>
That the Lords annointed is still preserved, for our shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

what then could we looke for? Or if he should any way
suffer the mouthes of all his faithfull messengers to be
shut that there might be none to reprove, &amp; much more
if he once take from amongst us, those that sigh and cry
out for all the abominations, and restrayn utterly that

And is not this the thing which the Atheist and belly-God,<note place="margin">Though the ungodly long for it, &amp; why.</note>
with all the company of the wicked and ungodly
do desire so much, and which the I do latrous murthering

               <p>And to be briefe, for that these are they, who have
stood principally in the way of the bloudie enemie, that
they could neither bewitch nor invade the Church and

flight (howsoever some may conceit, that then it would
be well with us, and we should have merry times, yet)
then undoubtedly we may justly looke for the coldest
and wofullest winter, that ever the Church amongst us
felt and endured: for after that these are once marked
and made sure, what can be expected, but the destroyers
to follow after their heeles? what, but this terrible
