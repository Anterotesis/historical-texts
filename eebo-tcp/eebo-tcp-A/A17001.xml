         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of both former Talmudes, the Ieruſalemy and
Babylonian, which from hard languages vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
to his nation he made familiar Ebrew, ſo
that they ſay from Moyſes to Moyſes the like to
Moyſes was not, his works are exceeding profitable
to cleare the New Teſtament. For as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, he differed not
from the Iewes common graunt, but that they knew not God to be in
Christ reconciling the world vnto himſelf: So Maymonides hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
much that cleareth the Apostles trueth more fitly then Greek
and Latin Fathers doe. And where the Apostles confute Phariſees: he
recordeth their doctrine, that all may ſee the holy Apostles had iust
occaſion. In this ſort he hath two ſorts which the New Teſtament bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth.
Both he recordeth in his treatiſe of repentance. One is this,
That Moyſes law ſhall ſtand for euer vnchanged, and Meſsias ſhall
come to Canaan to conquer all nations. The other is this, That all his
learned taught, all the good things ſpoken by the Prophets for Iſrael
in the dayes of Meſsias, are but for the commodities of the body. This
is the common Iewes religion, whoſe God is their belly. They which
worſhipped ſtarres, thinking they had ſoules and would enrich their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6133:3"/>
worſhippers equally made their belly their God: they who brought the
flood: and confuſion of tongues, vnto the prophane Caeſars that made
themſelues Gods, and the King of Locuſts which ſay they bee Iewes
(<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28. 29.) but by a Synagogue of Satan: &amp; both are the great
dragon, <hi>Apo.</hi> 12. The new Teſt. telleth that the old ſpeaketh of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
bleſsing in Chriſt his death ending Moyſes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. And the
Iewes ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt. For Aben Ezra could not deny this
vpon <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. that the ſeaueny ſeauents are from Daniels prayer vnto
ſealing Meſsias the holy of all holines. He endeth ſacrifice and offring:
and left bread and wine, for the fleſh and blood of beaſts: and wee all
ſweare in the Lords Supper, that ſacrifices bee ended by our Lords
death: and by that Supper, his fleſh and blood is the food of our ſoules,
and hee would deſtroy Ieruſalem, that no place of ſacrifice ſhould bee.
That S. <hi>Stephen</hi> taught (<hi>Act. 6. and</hi> 7.) faithfull vnto death, and
found the crowne of life. When Ieruſalem is deſtroyed, as the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que-faced
<hi>Stephen</hi> taught from the Angel Gabriel, Chriſt ſendeth
his Angel to teach Iohn of an heauenly Ieruſalem: againſt which,
Rome ſhall fight to the end of the world: firſt by open tyranny, againſt
martyrs: &amp; when the Empire is destroyed for that, Satan will turne
himſelfe into an Angel of light: and ſet a Vicar of Chriſt with two
hornes of a Lambe, but with the lawes or mouth of the Dracon, to ſet
vp the former Empire and to be the King of Locusts: all bent to the
wealth and eaſe of this world. This Iohn teacheth: whom Chapter by
Chapter I expound, firſt briefly, by arguments vpon euery Chapter

Mine hoſt of <hi>Baſil,</hi> a D. of Law, <hi>D. Iacobus Henric-petri,</hi>
had occaſion to goe to <hi>Friburge</hi> to D. <hi>Piſtorius:</hi> and on a

ſayd: <hi>The ſcholers of England be learned in the tongues:
but it were better they knew the Fathers better.</hi> On Fryday my
Doctor telleth me what he ſayd: On Saterday I gaue a Greek
reply to the Poſt: as <hi>Pistorius</hi> triumphed in Greek: to this
ſumme.</p>
            <p>The Greek Fathers were in eloquence vnmatchable: and in han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
of the Trinity, and Incarnation of Chriſt, and Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by faith, and of holy ſoules paſſage hence to heauen, and of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to <hi>Gehenna,</hi> they all agreed: and none euer of 1400. yeares
thought of Purgatory: as their oration in the Synode of <hi>Baſil</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
160. yeares ago: which <hi>D. Iacobus Zwinger</hi> yet hath.
And ſo much learning as their age could vſe againſt eloquent
heathen, God gaue them. But they had no occaſion to deale much
for text of ſcripture with ſuch: and therefore leſſe ſtudied it: But
for the Lords Supper, This was their common opinion: that the
Bread and Wine were <hi>Icones and Symbola,</hi> Images and Tokens
of the body and blood of Chriſt: As <hi>Origen</hi> ſpake the conſent of his
age: and <hi>Euſebius</hi> from his great Librarie, the recorder of common
graunts: And eloquent <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and others by <hi>Typi</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typa,</hi>
and as the moſt ſage <hi>Theodorite</hi> in ſad diſputation to clear
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6133:5"/>
other matters, bringeth the ſame as a graunted common matter, to
proue douted: ſo <hi>Macarius Monachus</hi> ſheweth his dayes opinion,
calling the bread <hi>Symbolon</hi> of the body. And none wiſe could
doubt: marking vpon what prophecy the Lordes Supper ſtood. The
Angell Gabriel told holy Daniel that after 490. yeeres, Chriſt the
King by his death would end ſacrifice and offrings. And the
Iewes dated all dayes in common Epistles and conueyances, the
yeares ſince the returne from <hi>Babel:</hi> as wee the yeres of our Lord:
in whoſe last yeare, they, By Daniel, looked, the Kingdome of
heauen ſhould appeare, <hi>Luc.</hi> 19. though they knewe not in what
manner. Nowe when ſacrifice was to end at the Supper of the
Lambe: our Lord, to ſeale the end of ſacrificing, gaue, for beasts
fleſh and blood, which figured his body and blood, bread and wine,
to bee in couenant ſpeach his Body and Blood. All Graecians
knewe proper ſpeach and civill: that hee ſhould bee bad, that knew
not the place of both. In proper ſpeach a Father begetteth his Son:
in ciuill ſpeach <hi>Romulus</hi> was anceſter to Iulian Apoſtata, Baaſa to
<hi>Achab, Iechonias Salomontiades</hi> to <hi>Salathiel Nathanides.</hi>
So the token of a Kings ſeale, is called his ſeale. This all the Greeke
Fathers knewe: and tottering <hi>Theophylact,</hi> your onely, turneth

hee died in due tyme, to bury Moſes by his buriall: and that
by grace his ſpirit is with vs to ſure ſaluation: as mighty as by
his word it made the world. More is needleſſe and cannot bee, but
is wickedly forged. So farr the Fathers were rare: not alwayes in
commenting vpon the Byble: But extremely deceiued almoſt all
in honouring the Apocrypha: which Iewes kept to play for Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus
againſt Appiones that denyed all the Iewes ſtory. Therefore
not to plead with them from the Law full of paradoxes, they object
failes and humane workes to buſy them for all: And they meant
litle further great matter in them. The Greeke Fathers ſawe

bookes. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> agreeth for the number: but miſſeth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
one Apocryphon, for holy: <hi>Iudith,</hi> as I remember: and
<hi>Athanaſius,</hi> caſteth out holy <hi>Heſter.</hi> So we like of the fathers for
learning controverted in their age: not aey for comment. And
theſe groundes ye ſhall graunt me or combat: The Hebrew text
is kept by the <hi>Maſſorites,</hi> ſo that nothing can be corrupted to
alter one wordes ſignification. The Iewes knew their owne tongue:
and teach vs the native of it. In honour of the two tables of
613. letters, they bring all ſpeches of lawes bidding or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
into 613. And hold that all which faith or life may think
of is in them: And the New Testament never goeth further:
And no one ſyllable helpeth Rome: but Italy is expreſly curſed by
your owne tranſlation as by all Iewes expoſition, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.
vpon which all the Apocalyps maketh a reuelation. This En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
holdeth: and will not give place to Rome, but will diſpute
with <hi>D. Piſtorius</hi> Protonotary of the Pope at <hi>Baſil,</hi> one day in
Hebrew, an other in Greek: with penners of every ſyllable of our
ſpeach. Protonotarius is ſtout in theſe tongues: as he hath written
<hi>de arte Cabaliſtica:</hi> though he hath miſsed altogether: and ſayth
all Rabbins ſay Melchiſedek ſacrificed bread &amp; wine: where none
ever thought ſo: but all hold it offred to Abrahams ſouldiers to
eat and drink, as he was a King: and bleſſed Abraham as a ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.
And for Greek Protonotarius and Pope are yet to learne how
to defend the purity of the New Teſtament, and to ſee Antique,
Septuagint Thalmudique and Apostolique dialects. And no Papist
ever could ſpeak or write Ebrew &amp; Greek as cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey ſpeach. Thou
knowest if thou dare diſpute I may overthrow the Pope: Therefore
tell thine own hart, and write to him: that an Engliſh man wrote
to thee, that the chalenger will give over his chalenge: or hee bee
counted a ſhameleſſe lier.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:6133:6"/>
To this effect I wrote to him a Greek oration: and ſent
<hi>R. Rubens Chananean</hi> epiſtle, which honoured England a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all nations: that he might ſee he had not to deale with
a Thraſo. Three dayes after he wrote to <hi>Zurick</hi> great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations
of my poor ſtudies, ſpecially of Greek eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
as native <hi>Attique:</hi> And at three monethes end, after much
combat in all Greek he writeth thus: <hi>I will not diſpute
nor have our old Religion to be called into question.</hi> Then both
ſides <hi>Cantones</hi> ſhowted, that the feare of war was gone,
ſeing the Popes chalenger putteth vp this: <hi>that the Pope hath
not one ſyllable in the Bible for his defence: But is vnvinciblie
accuſed: and hath none that dare diſpute in the holy tongues for
his defence. Now he dareth not for ſtark ſhame require ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
being ſo broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this what <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpake to Engliſh of me, how for
one all England ſhould heare better while <hi>Baſil</hi> ſtood, one
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Brand</hi> of <hi>Londen</hi> and <hi>M. Ward</hi> of <hi>Cornewall</hi> they told me,
and belike at home: How they told <hi>Netherlanders</hi> that this
combat ended warres, and ſware ſo: they will never deny it,
&amp; noble <hi>Danes</hi> know, and doubtleſſe told their K. how they
ſtaying for me at a ferry neare <hi>Leopoldus</hi> buriall, which they
had ſeen, and I would ſee, a <hi>Zurick</hi> hearing my name, ſayd:
<hi>wee were in great feare of war, till the Englander brake Piſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius:
I would gladly ſee his countenance: which argueth the mind:
that in quiet words calmed boysterous preparation of warres: But
my hast cannot ſuffer ſtay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo ſayd many ſtrangers at <hi>Baſil:</hi> and <hi>French</hi> were
earneſt to bring me to their King. And what will to my rare
honour, the ſtate of <hi>Baſil, Zurick,</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> meant, I will let
them write.</p>
            <p>Now for Ieſuites humanity. <hi>D. Pistorius</hi> himſelf four
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6133:6"/>
yeares agoe asked <hi>M. Hakewill</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> at <hi>Friburge</hi> of me,
whether I was alive. He ſaid, he left me at <hi>Francfurt:</hi> then
ſaid he, I am hartily glad, and gave high good words. Now
he is dead, and I am ſory, for I hoped to turn him. Now two
Cardinalls of Rome, <hi>Caeſar Baronius,</hi> as the Ieſuites of <hi>Mentz</hi>
told me, and an other whoſe letters were intercepted at <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberge</hi>
(of him I heard no more) obteyned of Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
a principall Cardinalſhip for me: and dealt with <hi>Mentz</hi>
Ieſuites to perſwade me: who when they could not, Archb.
<hi>Ioh. Adami</hi> would have had me of his court, and obteyned
that in Chapter: ſaying that he reioyced more for my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of him with dedication of my Greeke tranſlation
of the Prophetes, then for his late election to be Prince of
the Empire. And he ſhould by order have part of his court
Proteſtantes: and he ſpake of me, as not miſliking my reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
But then Q. E. died, and I returned, and he died ſoone
after. None but ſhameleſſe will denie this. Now this is paſt
all deniall, that <hi>Mentz</hi> gaue me leave to print in Greeke
my owne Religion. That brake the neck of Purgatorie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
other Papiſtique great poincts. Of this the beſt of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
wrote to <hi>Franckfurt</hi> to the Kings agent: that of nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres ſo much was never obteyned of the Pope, as
that booke obteyned: Rome muſt allow what Mentz al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
And if <hi>Haides</hi> have but two places, as they graunt,
Heaven and hell, Purgatory muſt give back all the land that
it wan.</p>
            <p>Furthermore when my book of Concent came in
Latin, Pater <hi>Baltaſar Ezelius</hi> in the hearing of his felowes
in their college at <hi>Mentz,</hi> ſpake as by common conſent:
<hi>We allow all that that book hath:</hi> This I have printed in
Latin, and I am ſure he will not deny it: and when we are

both dead, none may: ſeing in my life time it is not denyed.
So this much is graunted me of Rome: to aſſure the ſimpleſt
ſo far, how far the city is ſunk: And badnes or madnes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<hi>Nabal</hi> for name, &amp; <hi>Nabala</hi> for fame to him that will not

            <p>I have turned the Apocalyps into Hebrew: and ſo I
would expound it: if the Turky merchants would pay the
charges. If they refuſe, I will leaue them to try, whether

Chriſt reviveth the Goſpell, when men eate the little booke,

               <p>And this may be noted that <hi>Q. Eliſabets</hi> agent did that
in <hi>Constantinople</hi> that none of other nations could: That the
Turkes Princes and Iewes there deſired to have from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
the Goſpell preached there in Greek and Hebrew, and
the Kings royall mynd is to be commended for his bent to
allowance that way. L. Barton wrote that if N. could be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

Chriſtendome. So God offered our nation againe glory in
the ſtatelieſt ſoyle: But Satan hindreth, by his ſervants that
can turne themſelves into Angels of light. God will look
to it.</p>
               <p>One libeller would perſwade, that the Iewes letter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

a ſtrange impudency. None learned would think that
all Chriſtendome, ſetting their wittes together could forge
ſuch a letter. The ſlaunderer could not read one line of it.
And what a barbarous vnthankfull wight is the Libeller of
theſe words: <hi>Becauſe your armes are the owles, you think you
must bring owles to Athens: and becauſe the Iew ſaluteth you as
you feigne: you think you are the onely Rabbin of the world.</hi> If
the baſe borne wight had bene of <hi>Constantinus</hi> kindred: he
had bene of an other ſpirit, but now, he could not conſider
the height of that cauſe.</p>
               <p>The like vnto him is he that ſayd theſe words, <hi>The knight

               <p>There is no other way to make Chriſtians readie in the

whoſe tenour of ſtudie all the new Teſtaments ſtile is bent.
The beſt learned Ieſuits at <hi>Francfurt</hi> in the hearing of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of England hartily requeſted this done, ſaying that
by me, they ready to cleare the new Teſtament, could ſoone

By 300. moe, Byſhops pride and ſloth made but a gaine and

               <p>But foure Angels held the foure windes. God favoured

That men ſhould not therefore be high minded, but
feare: in the ende Hagarenes take it. Cuſh or Abuſhini in
Keturahs houſe, had Abrahams familie, and long held well:
but in the end, held but the Goſpel and few Epiſtles, and the
Pſalmes, for all the Bible: That which Colen &amp; Rome hath
printed. Moſcovia from Conſtantinople, held litle ſound.
Rome was the cauſe of falling to all: ſtill weakening the Eaſt
Empire, that ſhould have holp the reſt.</p>
               <p>So God telleth that a generall fall ſhall come, that not
the open be the true, but the hid bee the ſervantes of God:
ſuch as God ſealed. As in Ieremies dayes in Ieruſalem the ill

vnawares we call him ſo, GOD ruling our tongues: that is
ſpecially worthy noting. When Iulian the Apoſtata was
kild, and <hi>Libanius</hi> commended him, that he now was with
the <hi>Daemones,</hi> the Greek Doctors took him vpon his word:
and what an aſſe he was to ſpeak that which the enemy
would wiſh. <hi>D. Iohannes Pistorius</hi> the Popes chalenger, wrote
to me that IOHN CALVIN was <hi>Dactylodeictes</hi> of Antichriſt:
Who ſhewed by the finger who was Antichriſt. I took his
graunt: that ſo the Pope was. For <hi>Calvins</hi> finger aymed at
him. So the Popes chalenger overthrew the Pope. The ſame
wrote to me the Anathema. But God dealt with him as with
Balaam the ſon of Beor, in <hi>Italy</hi> pronuntiation, of Boſor, in
Chaldean, where S. Peter kept: where the Galilaean his
voice told he wrote not from Rome. The Doctours Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema
was this, to me, I Anathematize thee, as Paul did
Barnabas. I take it, ſayd I. And ſo thou makeſt me better
then any Pope that ever was at Rome. Paul thought him of
the ſame faith, and happines: But I anathematize <hi>D. Iohn
Pistorius,</hi> as S. Paul did Anathematize <hi>Elymas Magus.</hi> Vpon
this he yeelded, as <hi>Helvetia</hi> knoweth. And to his dying day
ſpake moſt reverently, as ſome Engliſh heard, of his checker.</p>
                  <p>So here we muſt mark not what men call the Pope, <hi>Holy
father, and vicar of Christ, and head of the Church, and King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords:</hi> but what GOD doth call him: and
God taught Adam to give fit names. Here the Popes names
be many. One is, <hi>the Angel of the pit:</hi> as the ſtar falling had the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6133:16"/>
keyes of the Pit, to bring forth his Locuſts. And, <hi>the King of
Locuſts</hi> is the fitteſt name for him. In Ebrew, he is called
<hi>Abaddon, Num.</hi> 24. and <hi>Abdan</hi> in the Thalmud is the worſt
name. Aruch will teach<note n="†" place="margin">Beracoth Perek, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, fol. 28.</note> the place. Alſo he is called <hi>Abaddon</hi>
chiefly for remembrance of <hi>Num.</hi> 24. where Balaam endeth
his prophecy, in <hi>Italy</hi> going on to deſtruction: &amp; Iohn <hi>Chap.</hi>
17. 8. 11. tranſlateth Balaam moſt properly: as D. Kimchi, in
hard Grammer: <hi>Adey obed goeth on to deſtruction.</hi> In Greek
he is another <hi>Apollo:</hi> a Divel of Delphos, deſtroying ſuch as
ſeek to him: as <hi>Apollo</hi> deſtroyed rich Craeſus: deceiving him
to war againſt Cyrus. He knew well enough that Cyrus
ſhould have the victory: Eſay had told him ſo: and though
Craeſus gave to Apollos temple, very great gifts: yet when
he asked him, whether he ſhould fight with Cyrus, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
<hi>Craeſus paſsing over Halys, ſhall overthrow a great King.</hi>
So he did in hope of good: But overthrew his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
and rich Craeſus became poore Irus. So the Pope
maketh but a mock of Kings. Thus one who of the ſixt ſeale,
is fully deſcribed: what the Pope is, and what he meaneth
to do, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. ſhall tell.</p>
                  <p>And this firſt of the three woes thus ſet forth, reacheth
from the Popes ſupremacy, after the yeare of our Lord, 600.
vnto Ieruſalems war ended at 1200. For which 600. yeares,
the Pope ſtill made haile and fyre to be mixed with blood.
Now the ſecond woe is in his puniſhments, by the Turk:
and by the Goſpell and Martyrs, teaching Princes to caſt
him off.</p>

is a garment of the ſun: their contempt of all things vnder

from the twelve Apoſtles, is a crowne of twelve ſtars.
Their deſire to teach Chriſt to other ſoules, is a travelling of

Apoſtles doctrine: who were all of equall truth: though S.
Paul laboured more then they all: and from Rome wrote e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to have warned that city not to fight againſt Chriſt:
and ſo much as might teach the world that Peter was never

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6133:20"/>
as the 12. moſt laboured to call the Iewes, to teach the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
This travelling of child teacheth vs what a care wee

               </p>
               <p>Of men, the King ſhould be beſt learned: as King Moſes

that every ſermon ſhould either abridge the whole
Bible, as S. Paul doth to the revoulting Ebrewes: or tell the

               <p>And our Vniverſities might be ſo ruled: but that the

ſome knots be knit: that the wiſe may vnderſtand: and no

calleth Rome an harlot, ſitting vpon manie waters,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6133:24"/>
that is, people and troupes and nations and tongues (as
<hi>Daniel</hi> 3. ſpeaketh:) with which the Kings of the earth

               <p>And he carieth Iohn into a wildernes in viſion: as men
are beſt to judge when the noyſe of city troubleth not.
Now he hath another viſion for the Empire revived: a
beaſt with heades and hornes, as the former the old Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
and purple colour, as more in perſecution: and full
of names of blaſphemie, as accepting the Popes Canons,
and Maſſe, and Ceremonies: and a woman ſitteth vpon

blood of the Saincts: and golden in Gold, as old Babylon,
<hi>Eſa.</hi> 14. and brave in pearles and precious ſtones, as be the
Popes in their Copes: and their Arch-Biſhops and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
in cloth of Gold, and Aharons ſtones: mocking

that God gave his Apoſtles: which Saint Paul had as the

authour of Goſpell, and Epiſtles, and Apocalyps:
That Ruben might as well be chief Patriark, as Peter chief

though Rome ſet ſoorth in gold and ſilver their crucifix

Babylon the great: the mother of the fornications and

Rome is Babylon in a myſterie and trope: S. Peter was to

But viſions are in borrowed ſpeaches. Now this is ſure and

Kinges of the earth.</p>
               <p>Now of the beaſt his body this is told: that the beaſt,

the vileneſſe of that booke. Iewes would tell him that it was
Hagada; a fable made vpon phraſes: as where they ſacrifice,
Ezr. 2. and no mention is of fire: he feigneth a moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
fable, of fire hid by the ſacrificers, when they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to Perſia forſooth; not Babilon; and found by their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie,
turned into a thicke water; which when wood and
ſacrifice was brought: <hi>Nehemias</hi> bade them annoint both
with this water: and the Sunne ſhone, and kindled a great
fire. Who would not iudge this to be a moſt ridiculous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
By what witt could the ſacrificers dreame of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that fire could be turned into water, or by ſhun-ſhining
kindled, pleaſe God. <hi>It must be kept vnquenched.</hi> The whole
conſent of Iewes in the chaine of their <hi>Cabala</hi> ſaith, <hi>fire from
heauen kindled the ſacrifice.</hi> A man would thinke the whole
Nation in a ſenſible matter, ſhould be of more credite then

Moreouer <hi>Zorobabel</hi> of <hi>Salathiel;</hi> not <hi>Nehemias</hi> of <hi>Chilkia,</hi> was
gouernor at the returne. But ieſters vpon phraſes, in <hi>Iarchi,</hi>
make <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Artax</hi> all one; becauſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> end is not recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
So in <hi>Iarchi</hi> they make <hi>Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Nehemias</hi> to be all
one: for memorie of phraſe: that Zorobabels remoning is
not recorded. They that cannot iudge betwixt a ridiculous
fable, and a ſad ſtorie, are in great darkneſſe. So the fable,

not to regard Iewes fables, heere taketh place: and they bee

Nor tymes after Chriſt, for ſtories teaching when he would
come. The termes of the Bible be pearles; &amp; ſtill beate vpon

ſpeaking of the Maccabees martyrs, famous in the Talmudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,

were the laſt mentioned in Daniel. The Romans hindred
not the Iewes holy religion, till by the Phariſees they vexed
our Lord himſelfe: when he opened the kingdom of heauen,
dayes 1260. They who without knowledge of Daniel, would

                  <p>The Iewes, as I haue written; in Ieruſalemi, vpon Dan. 8.
ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Fathers brought with them Angells names from
Babilon, <hi>Michael,</hi> and <hi>Gabriel.</hi> Then if Angells had no names
before: <hi>Tobie,</hi> that bringeth <hi>Aſmodaeus</hi> for a ſpirite, muſt bee
a late fable. Neither Thalmud Ieruſalemy, nor Babilonian
hath that name: Only late Rabbines. Yet the fable of Tobie,
cited by Clemens of Alexandria is elder, then the compiled
Talmudes. But they are made from Writers, all, Elder then
Tobies fable. Thargum, Eccl. is a late worke: and eldeſt
Iew for record of Aſmodai, the Prince of Diuells: The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
had, Beelzebub Prince of Diuells: And later Iewes
made Prince of Diuells, Ben Tzirgha, ſonne of Leproſie.
To diſgrace our faith of the SON; Prince, among the holy
Angells. The wicked Rabbines, feigne a Prince among wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſpirites. But wee make no created, Angell, Prince: <hi>the
Eternall Sonne Creator of all, is the only Angell, Prince:</hi> And
hee is the Arch-angell, that could not ſuffer Satan, to ſpeake
bad ſpeach of Moſes, the firſt King in Iſrael. <hi>But Iehouah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Iehouah: ſaid, The Eternall rebuke thee, Satan.</hi> The Iewes
in <hi>Midras Rabba.</hi> Deut. chap. 33. feigne, pleading from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
before God, for Moſes: and in <hi>Abboth Rabbi Nathan.</hi>
S. Iude telling Rabbins that they would deſtroy the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by reſiſting rule: bringeth their owne commentary, how
Michael the Archangel checked Satan, for contempt of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
King of Iſrael: and giueth him the high checke from
Zach. chap. 3. <hi>The Eternall rebuke thee Satan So the Eternall
Sonne before the Father,</hi> ſpake in Zacharie: what in Iudes
Rabbins in a like cauſe Michael the Arch-angell ſpeaketh:
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:6133:77"/>
and Zohar, Gen. col. 46. ſaith, Where <hi>Michael</hi> is head of the
holy Angells, there Gods maieſtie is meant. This hath Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har.
And we ſhould not fauor Arias more, then our enemies
would. Tobies fable diſturbing Scriptures glory, where euen
Rabbins ſpeake for it, ſhould no more come among holy
workes: then a worke of <hi>Beelzebub, Aſmodaus,</hi> or <hi>Ben Tzirgha:</hi>

fire firſt (in recorde) from heauen: and in Moſes &amp; Salomon,
that is expreſly told, and thence gathered to the former: ſo
when the Iewes came home from Babylon, they ſacrificed:
no mention is made of their fire. Their priuate ſtorie,
<hi>Salſeleth, Hakabala</hi> ſaith, they had fire form heauen. The
abridgement of the ſenſeleſſe writer <hi>Iaſon</hi> of <hi>Cyren,</hi> called
the ſecond of Maccabees: telleth an old wiues tale, of fire,
turned as vnto ſalt, and ſet againſt the ſunne, and ſo brought
to inflame the ſacrifice.<note place="margin">Theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles God hated, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Tit. 1. 14. 1. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth. 1. 4. and 4. 7. and ſo his people will.</note> 
                     <hi>Archimedes</hi> fire that ſet Roman
ſhips on flame, <hi>at Syracuſa,</hi> with a Chriſtall Glaſſe of narrow
paſſage for the ſunne beames, ſhould haue beene as holy a
fire, as that of Iaſons fable: yet the Pope maketh great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of this inuention: as being ſo true as his miracles:
whereby he would prooue new ſacrifice. Before the flood,
Adam liuing longe to teach the truth, and the creation being
all miraculous, we haue no properly told miracle, but our
father <hi>Henochs</hi> aſſumption. <hi>Abraham</hi> reuiuing the world, did
miracles: ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> beginning a new ſtate: and IESVS in his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:6133:96"/>
noble conqueſt, in ſtaying Sunne and Moone: and <hi>Samuel</hi> at
<hi>Sauls</hi> inſtallation. <hi>Ezekias</hi> in great fall of tenne Tribes cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued,
had the ſunne turned backe tenne degrees. To Babell
the fire was quenched, Dan. 3. and the King made as a beaſt,
chap. 4. Daniel ſtoppeth Lions mouths: and an handwriting
damning the ſtate, chap. 5. Thus to nations firſt motion, or fall
miracles are giuen: but to confirme no other religion, then
agreeth with <hi>Adams.</hi> But the <hi>Pope</hi> will dayly <hi>tranſubſtantiate,</hi>
and make a <hi>Lynceus</hi> belieue he cannot tell whether he ſee
Bread and Wine: and ſo make a ſacrifice, as calling fire from
heauen: which muſt kindle euery ſacrifice. And whereas
<hi>eye-ſight</hi> is Gods Teſtimony by Creation, law, and allowed
euer, euen in the ſeale of the Couenant, which may conteine
no matter litigious; He breedeth warres, to make haile &amp; fire

to heare that all Papiſts and Proteſtants who granted
not, that the Creede ſpeaketh of the holy ſoules paſſage to
the holy: be Atheiſts. The Ieſuites gaue me leaue to print
all my religion, &amp; allowed my <hi>Latin Concent:</hi> ſpecially vpon
Daniel chapter 9. So for ADONICAM, they grant all,
or in reply muſt combat: which to doe, <hi>D. Iahannes Piſtorius</hi>
refuſed beeing a chalenger. So as none is the ROCK but
Chriſt: and ADONICAM but Chriſt. The Pope cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
to bee the Rock, and to ſtand vp Lord of all; is in
wiſedome giltie of chalenging, the name with the attribute
666. clayming the hornes of the LAMBE: which is all one
as to bee ADONICAM. Thus Iohn ſpeaketh plainely,
to the Iewes nation: which in their names conteined the
ſumme of their ſtorie.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Chapters well read, had made the Pope well
knowen, to be <hi>Pilates</hi> ſucceſſor, not <hi>Pauls: Peters</hi> he could not
bee; that neuer came neere any part of Greeke land. How
God hated Rome, it may appeare: that S. Paul being willing
of a long tyme, to confirme the Chriſtians there, hauing no
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:6133:103"/>
Chriſtian Synagogue, and yet famous ouer the world. God
would not, till the Iewes came to all extreamitie of ſhame,
ſuffer Paul to goe to Rome: &amp; Pauls warning that he ſhould
bring Chriſts name before Caeſar, and his deſire to builde
where none laid foundation, &amp; to confirme them of Rome,
and writing an Epiſtle to teach the firſt Principles: and his
mention of bringing Chriſts name into the Palace, as not
knowen there before: and the ignorance of the Synagogue,
Acts. 28. that knew not what the Goſpell meant, but that it
was in euery place gaineſaid. This ſheweth that Peter was
neuer at Rome. And Saint Pauls iourney telleth Rome that
God hated them. If he had not beene ſought to bee killed,
<hi>Lyſias</hi> had not ſent him to <hi>Caeſarea:</hi> and if the Iewes had not
againe there ſought to haue killed him, hee had not appealed
to Caeſar. God would not that hee ſhould come to Rome,
but vpon extreamities. So the iourney thither (ſhewed that
Chriſt hated the Citie that crucified him) was ſtrange in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities:
and Paul was brought thither as a priſoner, and kept
in priſon, though ſomewhat free.</p>

               <p>The heauen, commonly in this booke, is the Church; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

ſhew thee the Iudgement of the great Whoore: which

that they cannot ſee whither they tend: becauſe they
know not the ground. Beſides, commorations ſeeme vnto
them new matter, and not a commentarie vpon former. So
to them that be out of the Church, all things are in parables.
But they that know the grounds ſhall ſee all eaſie. <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
taught <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the playneſt propriety of wordes that might
bee. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſweetneth the ſame with allegories: when both

not marke the perſecuted: But the Iewes knew: And if at
the firſt they had bene told of great affliction, they would
haue gone before captiuitie into Countries of Grecia.

But when they were in Babel, and neere returne: their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

reuenged, as the image was by ſtrok from a ſtone; ſo they by

In a new viſion they are expreſly named, what the Ram and

ſheweth that the former beaſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of the ſea ſhould

               <p>As the Church was driuen into the wilderneſſe: to haue a

policie vnmixed with Rome: ſo Iohn ſheweth, that they
muſt not be of Romes part, that will condemne her: but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
free from her. In Aegypt God could not giue lawes
for Iſrael: but they muſt be ſeparated from other policies: ſo
God brought them into the wilderneſſe. And when God
would teach Iuda, that Moyſes Ceremonies were but poore
elements, and to praepare them for the reſt of Chriſt, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
them into the wilderneſſe of the heathen: And when
<hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> praepared a way for the reſt of Chriſt, and calling

               <q>And I ſaw a woman ſitting vpon a ſcarlat beast full of names of
blaſphemy, hauing 7. heades and 10. hornes.</q>
               <p>So Satan, being incarnate in the Empire of Rome, had
ſeauen heades and tenne hornes: and vpon his head ſeauen
Crownes: becauſe ſo many ſtates of Rome afflicted Gods
people. In chap. 13. Tenne hornes, had tenne Crownes: to
ſhew that ſo many kingdoms, not ſeuerall kings, as in Daniel
for Aegypt and Syria belonged to the Empire.</p>
               <q>And the woman was clothed in Purple and Scarlat, and golden
in Gold, and pretious ſtones, &amp; pearles: hauing a golden Cup
in her hand: full of abominations, and vncleanneſſe of her
fornication, and vpon her forehead, a name written, A

with chaines of gold, and pretious ſtones: and their Copes
wickedly following <hi>Aharon,</hi> bee of cloth of gold. So the 3.

               <p>A golden Cup had <hi>Babel,</hi> to make nations drunke with

Babel, but ſtill it would keepe the old Gods; till <hi>Cyrus</hi> tooke

               <q>And I ſaw the woman dronk with the blood of the ſaincts: and
with the blood of the martyrs of IESVS. And when I ſaw
her, I marueiled; with great marueile.</q>
               <p>Heere the blinde may ſee, that ſince the Empire was reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

               <p>The naturall man obſerueth not that when countreyes

Weſt in the end ſhould afflict, firſt by ſtrength; and next by
ſubtiltie in religion: that Chriſt his ſeruants ſhould be tried,
both for body and minde: and he pay the City that crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him: both with horſe, as chap. 6. and by the ſpirit of his
mouth: and diligent ſearching of the Prophets. So for eaſier
memory of ſtory, Chriſt would haue Rome, that crucified
the king of glory, once to bee plagued through their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and the Empire to be taken away, and the Citie to bee
deſtroyed: as by <hi>Gothes:</hi> and by <hi>Lybians,</hi> by <hi>Giezerichus,</hi> a new

not, and yet is:</hi> God ſpeaketh in the praeſent tempus for things
to come, becauſe all things with him are praeſent. <hi>This is a
meaning that hath wiſedome;</hi> as Iobs caſe, and Daniels Image.
Therefore wee ſhould flee to God to be the expounder:

Angels and men. This long warning of the Popes ariſing
was a warning to all ages: that they ſhould not ſuffer the ſtarr
falling to make bitter the waters of the Law; nor darken the

The terme witchcraft, beſtowed vpon the Popes doctrine, is
to be noted: They who ſay, bread after wordes ſpoken, is no

will not the tokens to bee worſhipped: that muſt be kept for
God onely. Where Rome killed men for the Prophets do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and holy Apoſtles: they are as gilty, as if they had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them: and all holy in the ſame faith. All the holy ſpake of
Chriſt, and Rome by Pilate killing him, was worthy to haue
for Popes, <hi>neither forgiueneſſe in this world, nor in the world to
come:</hi> but heere, to be openly curſed as Iſcariot, and in the
world to come, eternall flames. This kind of ſpeach troubled
great Doctors: I wil therefore digreſſe a litle; to this phraſe:
<hi>Maymoni,</hi> in treatiſe of repentance, ſaith: there is a ſin,
whereof ſentence paſſeth; that he ſhall be puniſhed in the

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:6133:134"/>
and there is a ſin: which is puniſhed in this world, and in the
world to come: as be the Iewes that betrayed Chriſt, &amp; the
Romans that crucified him. The Iewes are plagued with
blindeneſſe and ſlauery, and Rome with horrible Idolatries,
and tyrannies, and warres, and blood.</p>

Paſſeouer could not bee kill'd in the Temple: where not to
kill it on the due day, it was death: and their tranſlation
taught theſe lies, Act. chap. 7. <hi>Iacob died in Egypt and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes,
and they were caried to Sychem. And they were put in the

And <hi>Abraham</hi> bought nothing in <hi>Sychem:</hi> neither was

he hath an end for them: that although they ſinned of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
pride and vnthankfulneſſe, and euery whit from their

who told the day of their fall,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 89.</note> and <hi>Adams</hi> fall, that in huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
he would bee a litle inferior to Angells,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 27.</note> by ſuffring of

them, that their ſinne ſhall not haue the rayne to open miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,

that they doe his decree: they did not that which hee

And in their ſtubburneſſe, after long patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he ſheweth his

                  <q>And there came to mee one of the ſeauen Angells, which had
the ſeauen Cuppes full of the ſeauen last plagues: and hee

and had taken Chambers, in the large building of our ſquare
<hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> 1500. miles high: and ſo ſquare. When Chriſt

his Babell, for the holy Temple, was deſtroyed. The carnall
Iewes, vrged Moyſes Law, againſt Chriſt, as to death: <hi>That he
ſaid, deſtroy this Temple: and I will build it againe in three dayes.</hi>
He ſpake of his owne Temple. For which, the Law of Moſes
was made: and the Tabernacle, and the frame of the world:
and becauſe they ſtood not in reuerence of his Temple, hee
deſtroyed them. By the former Law, as they martyred S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen:
for ſaying, <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth would deſtroy the Temple.</hi>
And they meant as much, for <hi>S. Paul,</hi> for ſpeaking &amp; teaching
againſt the Temple: and they thought he had brought <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimus</hi>
a grecian of <hi>Epheſus</hi> into the Temple: and ſo polluted
it. But the true Temple they ſaw not: till theirs was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And here Iohn expoundeth Moſes: That God, the Lord
of hoſtes, (the Angels, and goodly frame of the world) <hi>That
CHRIST in whom all fullneſſe it ſelfe dwelleth, is the Temple.</hi>
And they that crucifie a picture, as his, making him vile:

and ſtand vp from the dead, and Christ ſhall ſhine to thee.</hi>
Many Rabbines, as S. Paul, draw Eſaies words to Chriſt: and
when Iohn wrote, 144000. Iewes faithfull would ſo take it.
<hi>Iſai. 60. The Sun ſhalbe no more thy light on the day, and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Moone, ſhall not giue light vnto thee: But the ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL
ſhalbe thy continuall light: and thy GOD ſhall bee thy honor.
Thy Sun ſhall no more ſett: and thy moone ſhall not be hid: for the
Eternall will be thy continuall light: and the dayes of thy mourning
ſhall be gone:</hi> worldly ioy ſhall not bee thy comfort, but the
ioy of God. As Iohn, baniſhed into Patmos, hath in one day,
the Lordes day, more ioy then all the world is worth: when
darkeneſſe couered Caeſares, and obſcuritie, nations: But
God ſhined ouer him, and the glory of Chriſt was ſeene to
him, to ſhew him in wilderneſſe the ſtate of the Church. If
he had not beene baniſhed from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he ſhould not haue
had theſe viſiones. But now his comfort is the greater. As
one, farre from his Countrey, may ſtudy more in ſix yeeres,
then in 12. among much acquaintance at home, and be leſſe
grieued from quarrelling of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Now Iohn applying Eſai vnto the LAMBE, ſheweth that

                  <q>And the nations, the ſaued ſhall walke in her light: and Kings

                  <p>Iſai 60. And nations ſhall walke in thy light: and Kings in thy

day and night: they ſhall not be ſhut, that men may bring vnto thee

comforteth the xij. Tribes, from their knowen prophecies, to
goe forward to winne at the laſt ſo many as would furniſh a

the Carbuncle walles of Ieruſalem: as the Apocrypha lies
are with the Bible: a meere leprous ſorte, whereby Papiſtes
terme all the Bible lies: yet they that can not read one word

wicked bookes with the holy: and fight to hinder expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

will marre thoſe waters. It is marueile, that any dare chirpe,
to hinder the light of Gods worde: ſeeing God is able and
readie to reuenge. The Pope putteth the wicked fable of
Tobie, in the heart of the holy Bible. But it had beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a milſtone had beene hanged about his necke: and that

               <q>And he ſhewed me a pure Riuer of water of life: ſo cleere as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall:
iſſuing from the throne of God and of the LAMBE.</q>
               <p>IN the ſong of ſongs, liuely waters of CHRIST flow
from Libanus: they be waters of life, Ioh. 7. to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
life: and the true MESSIAS commeth by waters,
blood, and ſpirite. 1 Iohn 4. Water of cleere doctrine: blood
of ſuffring: and miracles of ſpirite. And if a man bee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
of this Water and Spirite: he ſhall not ſee life. And
thus ſpeaketh Ezekiel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he brought mee vnto the brim of a riuer:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>and at the brim of
the Riuer, was much ſtore of trees, on both ſides: and hee ſaid vnto
mee: theſe waters goe forth into Galile, the firſt: and deſcend to the
plaine: (to ſea of Tiberias) then vnto another ſea: (Lacus Aſphalti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes)
to the Ocean: and thoſe waters are made holeſome:</hi> And ſurely,
euery liuing ſoule, which can creepe into any place, where
theſe Riuers come, ſhall be liuely: and the fiſh ſhall be great.
Thus Ezekiel telleth whence Chriſt ſhall begin to teach, in
Galilee. And the Zohar vpon Geneſes, doth note that. And
Iohn ſaw the euent of this: for at the ſea of Galilee, was hee,
and Iames, and Peter, and Andrew, called to bee fiſhers of
men. And after the reſurrection, Ioh. chap. 21. at the ſea of
<hi>Tiberias</hi> Chriſt appeared to many of his Diſciples, fiſhing;
and all night they had taken nothing. And in the morning
the Lord commeth to the water ſide, vnknowen, and asketh
whether they had any thing to eate: they ſaid, No. Becauſe
they had taken nothing all night. Then hee made them caſt
into the right partes: and they make a draught of 153. great
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:6133:168"/>
fiſhes,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 2. 17.</note> whoſe ſpaume, might match the 353000. Proſelites in
Chanaan. Olde and late, Prophecie and ſtorie, are thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued,
to make eaſie and ſure the doctrine of life. And God
muſt needes hate the Pope, that bent not all his wealth, to
haue ſo many as he could, ready in the Law: as were the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers
of Galilee. The Diſciple whom IESVS loued, hath
now, Apoc. 21. a third ſight of Ezekiels prophecie. In Iohn,
from the throne of God and the Lambe, cometh the water:
In Ezekiel, from the Temple: ſo, the Lord of Hoſtes, and
the Lambe, bee the Temple.</p>
               <q>In the middle of the ſtreete of it, and of the Riuer, was a Tree
of life, bearing twelue fruites, bearing his fruite euery
moneth, and the leaues of the tree, did heale the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>
               <p>Ezekiel chap. 47. And by the Riuer came forth, at his
brim, on either ſide, all kinde of trees for meate: the leafe
of none faded: nor the fruite failed: euery moneth they
brought forth newe. For the waters came forth from the
Temple: and the fruite was for meate: and the leafe to heale.
The firſt pſalme, expoundeth this: that the ſtudie of the Law
findeth Chriſt: the tree of life: and maketh others fruitfull
trees to feede and heale.</p>
               <div type="section">
