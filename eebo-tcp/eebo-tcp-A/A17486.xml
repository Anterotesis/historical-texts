            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no man (right reuerend Father) but he may imagine at the first sighte, that this pretie Booke written Dialogwise, easie to be borne for the smalenes of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, soone to be ouerhandled for the fewnesse of the leaues, and very good cheape for the ouerlittlenes of the price, is vvorthy of no prayse, or else of very little. But if he searche and ransacke the bowels of it, so as he reade it not in post, or as one halfe asleepe, ne lightly giue as it vvere a glaunce at it, but consider vvell the excellencie of the matter, the orderly teaching therof, and the fitte knitting of all things together: he shall vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confesse (and that of very good

            <p>I graunt that many Books do dayly come foorth (the more pittie) vvherof some, yea an infinite sum, in the parts beyond the seas, &amp; other some on this side the seas haue ben hatched out of mens teeming &amp; childbearing heads, by the midwifeship of the diuell. By the force of which Bookes, bewtified with glorious foretitles, these trim &amp; cunning discoursers, allure, or rather infect, yea &amp; vtterly kill mens soules through the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t poiso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions &amp; doctrins. Much like vnto co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> harlots, vvhose dayly custome &amp; ordinarie trade it is, to besmere them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues outwardly vvith oyntments &amp; sweet powders, to the end they might the more tickle and stir vp, as it vvere vvith certayne prickes, their mates
<pb facs="tcp:10140:4"/>
set all vpon loue, to the cooling of the heate of their lust, hauing no regarde in the meane vvhile, to vvash away the filth grovvne together vvithin them euen in a heape.</p>
            <p>Of this stampe are all the bookes of the Romish route, glittering vvith glorious titles, prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ding the doctrins of greatest mysterie, yea and of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test importaunce also, and (to saye briefly vvhat I thinke) chalenging and behighting any thing, vvhereas besides their stately vvords, their Thrasolike speeches, their scornefull scoffes, and their other childish tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, and olde vviues tales, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine not any thing that is vvorthie to be vveied or considered, but rather to be laughed at and hissed out. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche that this saying of the Poet may vvell be applied vnto them, The mountaines labour of childe, and out there creepes a sillie mouse.</p>
            <p>To these, you among the rest of
<pb facs="tcp:10140:4"/>
the Bishops of this renowned Realm, vvhich are in manie respectes to be reuerenced, haue bin a verie sore eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: and though not at hande, yet a farre of you haue so vvounded that misshapen Monster of the vvorld, vvhich leaueth nothing vnattempted to bring all Princes in subiection to him, partlie by vexing of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers diuers vvayes, hovvbeit not vvith anie kinde of torment, as their vvilful stubbornes requireth, but by vrging them vvith vvholsome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and vveightie exhortation, to turne avvaie from their crooked pathes vvhich leade to destruction, partly in burning their bookes vvhich vvere stuffed vvith all kinde of filthie railings and reproches, and finallie in attempting all meanes to pinche in his kingdome, and to disperse and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie abolish that pestilent Seminarie of his, vvherby he goeth about to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvitch all the coastes of the vvorlde.
<pb facs="tcp:10140:5"/>
That these things are so, all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> confes with one mouth, &amp; euen the Papists themselues (vnlesse they will lie most shamefully) will not deny the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. For as much therfore, right reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d Father, as you are greatly busied about these thinges, and (besides the time vvhich you spend in the studie of Diuinitie) the matters of greatest waight lie dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> your back, how fitly may this saying of S. Paules be applied vnto you, vvherwith he closeth vp his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, after a long reckoning vp of his labours, saying. <hi>Besides all the other things that dayly distresse me, the care of all congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations lieth vpon me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, were there the like mind and indeuoure in the Pope, the gazing stock of the vvorld, and in the residue of the Papists, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> shuld not so many hundred thousand soules be thrust downe into Hell, neither should so great darknesse be cast vppon the true vvorship of God, nor Christs, church
<pb facs="tcp:10140:5"/>
be so miserably and vvofully assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor Christ himselfe the liuely Image of his Father, be mangled vvith so many dartes of reproch, nor the light of the Gospell be dimmed vvith so many mists of mens ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, nor so many firebrands of dissention tost among Christian Princes, nor Common vveales be torne in peeces vvith so many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes of insurrections, nor Gods glorie be abated vvith so greate carelesnesse and negligence, nor finally, the Deuill so triumphe and reioice.</p>
            <p>But I vvill call my self back againe, and vvith as much shortnes of speech as I can, I vvill touch the things that are nerer to the matter vvich we haue in hand. I haue declared already what an old hart grudge and deadly hatred you beare to the Pope of Rome and all Papistes: Also I haue shewed, though not cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ningly, yet truly, what
<pb facs="tcp:10140:6"/>
meanes you haue vsed to call them back from their pernicious opinion, vvith how great zeale you haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to further the pure religion, and to put avvay heresies, and the sovvers abroade of heresies, by anye kinde of meane, that Christs church being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led avvay from all blinde seruing and colourable misvvorshipping of God, may loue her Christ from her heart, vvith open armes embrace him, and vnseparably stick to him alone.</p>
            <p>And yet by the vvay, I vvill let passe that cheefe and intire care of yours, vvherewith you bee often touched, namelye of preferring the bookes of learned men to light, by the reading and considering vvhereof, your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhoode knovveth, that so many as studie them, as becommeth them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stayed vp and inlightned vvith right reason and founde iudgement, doe gather most plentifull fruite.

faith without obedience is deade, and obedience without faith is liuelesse: bestow both of them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs most gracious father.

            <p>Let Abraham the father of the faythfull teache vs what manner of beleefe wee ought to imbrace, namely that which leadeth to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,

all counterfeit and ydle fayth beeing, put to slight. A sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall and sounde iudgement power into vs, O euerlasting God, that hauing taken our laste leaue of worldly beleefe, we may cherishe in vs that true fayth sent downe from heauen, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we take holde of Christ Iesus, through whose power and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king we may be able to performe the things which maye beste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeme the faythfull: and that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moystened in our minds with the deawe of thy heauenly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, we may labour to attayne to the heauenly things.</p>
            <p>Graunt O most merciful father, that we may be faythfull and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, first vnto thee, and then to all others vnder whose gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou haste put vs, that by this meanes our consciences may be eased of most heauy burthens,
<pb facs="tcp:10140:50"/>
and we at length haue whereof to reioyce and be glad. We know O euerlasting God, that our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>meth of thy free bestowed mercy, wherof there is none other way for vs to take holde, then by true &amp; vndoubting faith, through whiche faith our forefathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came most highly renowmed, and by furtheraunce thereof wrought things to be wondered at. Uouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe O louing father, of thine infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodnesse to enriche vs with this faith, that being throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed therewith, wee maye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the workes of Charitie, without the which all fayth or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe whatsoeuer it bee, as filthye and vnworthy of so muche as the bare name of faith. But vnto vs whiche striue to please thy deuine maiestie, graunt O mercifull God that we maye foster, cherishe, and shew forth that iustifying &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:10140:50"/>
faith, wherewith Paule bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furnished and armed at all poynts, became a most patient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durer of very many perils, euen which were deadly: insomuch that he did set more store by the loue of thy Gospell, then by his owne life, then the which there is not any thing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world more deare. Not without cause do we complayne, most mercyfull father, that this fayth is nowhere to be founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: for all kind of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse is crepte into the whole world, and there is not any corner so secret, which is not most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully disgraced and filthily defiled with the vncleannes thereof. O lamentable age. Among the other impediments of fayth (which are many, as thou knowest O thou inhabiter of the highest heauens) there steppeth foorth self loue, who calleth vs backe from the true
<pb facs="tcp:10140:51"/>
worshipping of thee, and by tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs in the eare with I wot not what, is wholly occupied in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading vs to set our minds vpon the things that are here beneath, and to leaue the care of the things that are aboue, to them that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue. Good God cast out this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that we maye no more serue the flesh, but that the spirite maye at length ouerrule vs. Without whose staye, forasmuch as mans minde being slippery and turning to euery opinion, is oftentimes snarled in such snares of errours, as he can neuer get out of: we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeche thee bereeue vs not vtterly of the light of thy heauenly grace, least as some haue boldly denyed the rising agayne of thy sonne, so wee also doo fall into the same dungeon neuer to get out agayne: but rather graunt that by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing we may become partners of
<pb facs="tcp:10140:51"/>
the vnspeakable glory, which thou wilt shew foorth in the last day.</p>
            <p>Sort vs out O almightie God, from the company of those which beleeue not Christes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whosoeuer they be, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs not to become like the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing people of Israell, who beeing ouercouered with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and hugenesse of thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, wallowed themselues in the puddle of their owne wickednes, not euen then departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> their shameful lewdnes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued thy loue turned into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, thy patience into fury, and thy long sufferance into reuenge.</p>
            <p>Finally O most merciful father, to the intent we may hartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, driue all selfe loue farre from vs, make vs deafe at the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of false prophets: let vs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hate then loue our selues: let
<pb facs="tcp:10140:52"/>
vs acknowledge that all things lye open to thy power. Let vs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne how deadly a poyson selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue is, let vs despise the pleasures of this world, let vs beware of the whorish deceires of our owne fleshe, let vs shunne the spitefull delightes of this worlde, let vs be afrayde to stande in lesse awe of thy wrath and vengeaunce, then of mens threatnings and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, let vs abhorre the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the diuell, let vs bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to forsake our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countrie, that is to say, sinne, let vs learne to hate our selues by the hatred of others.</p>
            <p>Let vs haue skill howe to deny our selues, let vs beate downe the diuelish lustes of the flesh, beeing fenced with the sheelde of fayth as with a banke, let vs set our selues agaynst all daungers, let
<pb facs="tcp:10140:52"/>
vs reape thence a most plentifull croppe and store of fruites, and beeing garded therewith, let vs incounter with out enimies both at hande and aloofe, marche on the right and ready waye to the attaynement of saluation, and haue the best opinion that maye bee concerning thy heauenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious goodnes, acknowledging that it is able to performe more then we can eyther craue or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise.</p>
            <p>Let vs consecrate our selues wholly vnto thee, leading a holy and vncorrupt lyfe, that by that meanes, after the breathing out of our Ghost, and the buryall of our body, we may rest at length moste happily in thy lappe. All these thinges, and whatsoeuer else both this flightfull life of ours craueth, and also the endlesse

worlde to come requireth, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe most bountifull and mercifull father, to bestowe vpon vs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntly, through Iesus Christe our Lorde. So be it.</p>
