            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>the latter Age. Philosophers, Poets, Historiographers, and learned Diuines, how they haue peregrinated to know the life of States, and the fashions of farre Countries would be an endlesse taske for me to relate. Many (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) long to see the remotest regions of the earth, but dare not vndertake the dangers of sight, the chargeable expences of tributarie iourney, the hard indurance of flint-stones for a soft feather-bed, the extremities of thirst, nor the parching heate of the Sunne, hunger in the belly, nor the moist distilling dew to bee a humide couerlet to their tender skin, with innumerable other insuing miseries. But <hi>Ixion</hi>-like, mistaking <hi>Iuno,</hi> would by a meere imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, run out the sleeping course of an endlesse peregrinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For my part, what I haue reaped, is by a deere-bought knowledge, as it were, a small contentment, in a neuer contenting subiect, a bitter pleasant taste of a sweet-seasoned sowre, and all in all, what I found was more then ordinaray reioycing, in an extraordinary sorrow of delights. The contemplation of this delightfull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pilgrimage, did incite my minde to aduenture vpon my meditated attempts; not onely for my owne content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but also to animate other forward spirits to the like resolute designes. The commodity of which being by mee duly pondered and weighed (as it were) in the ballance of my owne contemplating thoughts, from <hi>Paris, Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> 1610. I attempted my voyage, bequeathing my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedings to the protection of God, my body to turmoiling paines, my hands to the <hi>Burdon,</hi> and my féete to the hard bruising way: And as vnwilling to make relation of my passing through <hi>France, Sauoy,</hi> the <hi>Ligurian Alpes,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all <hi>Italy,</hi> fith it is manifested vnto many in this Iland both by sight and report, I would shunne, so farre as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I can, all prolixitie of knowne, and therefore vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary discourse.

To be briefe, I saw the decaied house of worthy <hi>Cicero,</hi> the high Capitoll, the Palace of cruell <hi>Nero,</hi>

               <p>I saw also the Academies of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> wherein he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the Soule, Health, Life, Nature, and Qualities of Men, with the Medicaments of <hi>Galen</hi> for the diseases and infirmities of man: the familiar Epistles of <hi>Cicero,</hi> the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neidos</hi> of <hi>Virgill,</hi> the <hi>Saphick</hi> verses of that <hi>Lesbian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho,</hi> the workes of <hi>Ouid,</hi>

               <p>Bidding adiew to my Company, and this Librarie, I longed to view the gorgeous, Mosaicall worke of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church: The matter was no sooner conceiued, but I went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doore, yet afraid to enter, because I was not accustomed with the carriage and ceremonies of such a <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi> But at the last, abandoning all scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polositie, I came in boldly, and on my right hand as I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred within the doore,<note place="margin">

many crosses his sencelesse body, kisse his feet, and euery one of his seuerall toes: next, they lay their heads vnder the soale of his right foot; and arising, rubbe their Beades on his hard costed belly: thus adoring that breathlesse masse of mettall, more then though it were a liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. O wonderfull and strange spectacle! that these one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly titular Christians, should become worse of knowledge then Ethnicke Pagans, to worship and reuerence the workmanship of mens hands.

Yet they licentiate the neighbouring Infidels to traffique with them; but when they enter the gates, they must deliuer their Weapons to the Corporall of the squadron company.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9033:13"/>
the middle there was two liuing soules, each one se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from another with seuerall members. Their heads were both of one bignesse, but different in Phisnomy: the belly of the one ioyned with the posterior part of the other, and their faces looked both on one way, as if the one had carried the other on his back, and often before our eyes, he that was behinde, would lay his hands about the necke of the formost. Their eyes were excéeding bigge, and their hands greater then an infants of three times their age: the excrements of both creatures issued forth at one place, and their thighes and legges of a great growth, not semblable to their age, being but sixe and thirty dayes old; and their féet were proportionably made like the foote of a Cammell, round, and slouen in the middest. They receiued their food with an insatiable desire, and continually mourned with a pittifull noyse; that sorrowfull man told vs, that when the one slept, the other awaked, which was a strange disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement in nature.</p>
               <p>The Mother of them bought déerely that birth, with the losse of her owne life; and as her husband reported, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable was the torment she endured, in that woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full-wrestling paine. I was also informed afterwardes, that this one, or rather two-fold wretch, liued but a short while.</p>
               <p>Leauing this monstrous shapen Monster to the owne strange and almost incredible natiuity, we returned to <hi>Lesina.</hi> But by the way of our backe-comming, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that worthy Gentleman shewed mee the ruines of an old house, where the noble King <hi>Demetrius</hi> was borne; and after I had yéelded my bounden and dutifull thankes vnto his generous minde, I hired a Fisher-boat to go ouer to <hi>Clyssa,</hi> being 12 miles distant.

               <p>From thence, I embarked in a <hi>Greekish Carmoesalo,</hi> with a great number of passengers, <hi>Greekes, Slauonians, Italians, Armenians,</hi> and <hi>Iewes,</hi> that were all mindfull to <hi>Zante,</hi> and I also of the like intent; being in all forty eight persons: hauing roome, winds, and a fresh gale, in foure and twenty houres, wee discouered the Ile <hi>Cephalonia:</hi> In this meane while the Captaine of the Uessell, espied a Saile comming from the Sea, hee presently being moued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, sent a Mariner to the top, who certified him she was

a Turkish Gally of <hi>Biserta,</hi> prosecuting a straight course to inuade our Barke. Which sudden affrighting newes, ouerwhelmed vs almost in dispaire.

But I, the wandring Pilgrime, pondring in my pensiue breast, my solitary estate, the distance of my Country and Friends, could conceiue no hope of deliuerance. Upon the which troublesome and fearefull appearance of slauery, I abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely arose, and spoke to the Maister, saying: <hi>The halfe of the Carmoesalo is your owne, and the most part also of the loading</hi> (all which hée had told mee before) <hi>Wherefore my counsell is, that you prepare your selfe to fight, and goe encourage your passengers, promise to your Mariners dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wages, make ready your two peeces of Ordinance, your Muskets, Powder, Lead, and halfe-pikes: For who knoweth, but the Lord may deliuer vs from the thraldome of these Infidels.</hi> My exhortation ended, hee was greatly animated therewith,<note place="margin">

After a long and doubtfull fight, both with great and small shot (night parting vs) the Turkes retired till morning, and then were mindefull to giue vs the new rancounter of a second Alarme. But, as it pleased him, who neuer faileth his, to send downe an vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable tempest; about the breake of day we escaped their furious designes, and were enforced to seeke into the bay of <hi>Largostolo</hi> in <hi>Cephalonia</hi>; both because of the violent weather, and also for that a great leake was stricken into our ship.

Heere I had the ground to be a pillow, and the world-wide-fields to bee a Chamber, the whirling-windy-skies, to bee a roofe to my Winter-blasted lodging, and the humide vapours of cold <hi>Nocturna,</hi> to accompany the vnwished-for-bed of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>In all this Country I could find nothing, to answere the famous relations, giuen by ancient Authors, of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that Land, but the name onely; the barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Turkes and Time, hauing defaced all the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antiquity: No shew of honour, no habitation of men in an honest fashion, nor possessours of the Country in a Principalitie. But rather prisoners shut vp in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or addicted slaues to cruell and tyrannicall Maisters: So deformed is the state of that once worthy Realme, and so miserable is the burthen of that afflicted people: Which, and the apparance of that permanency, grieued my heart to behold the sinister working of blind Fortune, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies plungeth the most renowmed Champions and their memory, in the profoundest pit of all extremities and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuion.</p>
               <p>Departing from <hi>Argo,</hi> vpon the seuenth day we arriued at <hi>Athens: Athens</hi> is still inhabited, standing in the East part of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> neere to the Frontiers of <hi>Macedon:</hi> It was first called <hi>Cecropia,</hi> and lastly <hi>Athens</hi> of <hi>Minerua.</hi> This Citie was the mother and wel-spring of all liberall Artes and Sciences,<note place="margin">

               <p>After my redounded thankes, they hauing returned, the contemplation on their curtesies brought me in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, how curious the old <hi>Athenians</hi> were to heare of forraigne newes, and with what great regard and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they honored trauellers. <hi>Serigo</hi> is an Iland in the sea <hi>Cretico:</hi> it was anciently called <hi>Cytherea</hi> of <hi>Cythero</hi> the sonne of <hi>Phaenise</hi>: and of <hi>Aristotle Porphyris,</hi> or <hi>Schotera,</hi> in respect of the fine marble that is got there. It is of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit 60 miles, hauing but one Castle called <hi>Capsallo,</hi> which is kept by a <hi>Venetian</hi> Captaine. Here it is said, that <hi>Venus</hi> did first inhabit, and I saw the ruines of her demolished Temple on the side of a mountaine yet extant. A little more downward below this Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of that Palace, wherein <hi>Menelaus</hi> did dwell, who was King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and Lord of this Ile. The <hi>Greekes</hi> of the Ile told mee, there were wilde Asses there, who had a stone in their heads, which was a soueraigne remedy for the falling sicknesse, and good to make a woman be quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered of her birth.</p>
               <p>In the time of my abode, at the village of <hi>Capsalo</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hauen for small barkes, and situate below the Castle) the Captaine of that same fortresse kild a Seminary Priest whom he had found in the night with his whoore in a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel-house:<note place="margin">

From thence departing,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9033:20"/>
scarcely was I aduanced twelue miles in my way, when I was beset on the skirt of a rockie mountaine, with three <hi>Greeke Renegadoes,</hi> and an <hi>Italian Bandido:</hi> who laying hands pn me, beat mee most cruelly, robbed me of all my clothes, and stripped me naked, vsing many inuectiue spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. At last the <hi>Italian</hi> perceiuing I was a stranger, and could not speake the <hi>Cretan</hi> tongue, began to aske mee in his owne language, where was my money? To whom I soberly answered, I had no more then he saw, which was foure score bagantines: but he not giuing credit to these words, searched all my cloathes and <hi>Budgeto,</hi> yet found nothing except my linnen, and letters of recommendation, I had from diuers Princes of Christendome: which when he saw, did moue him to compassion, and earnestly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the other thrée theeues to grant me mercy, and saue my life. A long deliberation being ended, they restored backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine my Pilgrimes cloathes, and letters, but my blew Gowne and Bagantines they kept. Such also was their théeuish curtesie towards me, that for my better safe-guard in the way, they gaue me a stamped péece of clay, as a token to shew any of their companions, if I encountred with them; for they were about twenty rascals of a confederate band,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that lay in this desart passage. Leauing them, with many counterfet thankes, I trauelled that day seuen and thirty miles, and at night attained to the vnhappy village of <hi>Pickehorno,</hi> where I could haue neither meate, drinke, lodging, nor any refreshing to my wearied body. These des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate <hi>Candiots</hi> thronged about me gazing (as though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished) to sée mee both want company, and their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and by their cruell lookes they séemed to be a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and vnciuill people: For all these High-landers of <hi>Candy</hi> are tyrannicall, blood-thirsty and deceitfull. The consideration of which made me to shun their villany, and priuatly sought for a secure place of repose in a darke caue by the sea side; in which I lay till morning with a crazed body, and a hungry belly.</p>
               <p>Upon the appearing of the next <hi>Aurora,</hi> I embraced my

vnknowne way, and about mid-day came to <hi>Canea: Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> is the second Citie of <hi>Creet,</hi> excéeding populous, well-walled, and fortified with Bulwarkes: It hath a large ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, containing ninty seuen Palaces, in which the Rector and other <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentlemen dwell. There lie continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in it seuen Companies of Souldiers, who keep Cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall on the walles, guard the gates, and market-places of the Citie: Neither in this towne nor <hi>Candia,</hi> may any Countrey Peasant enter with weapons (especially Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuses) for that conceited feare they haue of treason. Truely this City may equall in strength, either <hi>Zara</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> or <hi>Luka,</hi> or <hi>Ligorne,</hi> both in <hi>Tuscana:</hi> for these foure Cities are so strong,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that in all my trauels I neuer saw them matched. They are all well prouided with Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and all necessary things for their defence, especially <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka,</hi> which continually reserues in store prouision of victuals for 12 yeares siege. Being here disappointed of transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Archipelago,</hi> I aduised to visit <hi>Candy</hi>; and in my way I saw the large hauen of <hi>Suda,</hi> which hath no town or village, saue onely a castle situated on a rocke in the sea, at the entry of the Bay: the bounds of that harbour may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue at one time aboue 2000 ships and gallies, and is the onely key of the Iland: for which place the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath oft offered an infinite deale of mony to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whereby his nauy which sometimes resort in the <hi>Leuante,</hi> might haue accesse and reliefe; but they would neuer grant him his request.</p>
               <p>Upon the third dayes iourney from <hi>Canea,</hi> I came to <hi>Rethimos</hi>; This Citie is somwhat ruinous and vnwalled, but the Citizens haue newly builded a strong Fortresse, which defendeth them from the inuasion of Pirates. It standeth by the Sea side, and in the yeare 1597, it was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably sacked and burned with Turkes. Continuing my voyage, I passed along the skirt of mount <hi>Ida,</hi> accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Greekes</hi> who could speake the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue, on which first they shewed me y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caue of king <hi>Minos,</hi> but some hold it to be the sepulcher of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> This <hi>groto</hi> is of length

                  </note>Thirdly, they shewed me the Temple of <hi>Saturne,</hi> which is a worke to be admired, of such Antiquity, and as yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decayed; who, (say they) was the first King that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there. And néere to it, is the demolished Temple of <hi>Matelia,</hi> hauing this superscription aboue the doore yet to be séene: <hi>Make cleane your feet, wash your head, and enter.</hi> Fourthly, I saw the entry to the Laborinth of <hi>Dedalus,</hi> which I would gladly haue better viewed, but because we had no candle-light we durst not enter: for there are many hollow places within it, so that if a man stumble or fall, hee can hardly be rescued. It is cut forth with many intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating wayes, on the face of a little Hill, ioyning with Mount <hi>Ida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mount <hi>Ida</hi> is the highest mountaine in <hi>Creta,</hi> and by the computation of Shéepheards féete, amounteth to six miles of height. It is ouer-clad euen to the toppe with Cypre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trées, and good store of medicinable hearbes: insomuch that the beasts which féede thereupon, haue their téeth guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded like to the colour of gold. It is said by some Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians that no venemous animall can liue in this Ile; but I saw the contrary: for I kild vpon one day, two Serpents and a Uiper: Wherefore many build vpon false reports, but experience teacheth men the truth. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from this mountaine, I entred in a faire plaine, beautified with many villages; in one of which I found a <hi>Grecian</hi> Bishop, who kindly presented with grapes of <hi>Maluasie,</hi> and other things, for it was in the time of Uin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. To carry these things he had giuen me, he caused to make ready an Asse, and a seruant, who went with mee to <hi>Candy,</hi> which was more then 15 miles from his house.

In all my trauels through this Realme, I neuer could sée a <hi>Greek</hi> come forth of his house vnarmed: and after such a martiall manner, that one his head he weareth a bare stéele Cap, a Bow in his hand, a long sword by his side, a broad ponyard ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart his belly, and a round target hanging at his girdle. They are not costly in apparrell, for they were but linnen cloathes, and vse no shooes, but Bootes of white leather: by nature they are crafty and subtill, as <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth, <hi>Titus.</hi> 1.12. Their haruest is our Spring: for they manure the ground, and sow the séed in October, which is reaped in March and Aprill. Being frustrate of my intention at <hi>Candy,</hi> I was forced to returne to <hi>Canea,</hi> where I staied 25 dayes before I could get passage, for I purposed to view <hi>Constantinople.</hi> I trauelled on foot in this Ile more then 400 miles; and vpon the 50 day after my first comming to <hi>Carabusa,</hi> I embarked in a fisher-boat that belonged to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> being a hundred miles distant, which had beene violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driuen thither with stormy weather.</p>

Thence I embarked to <hi>Nicaria,</hi> and sailed by the Ile <hi>Scyro</hi>; which of old was the Signory of <hi>Licomedes,</hi> and in the habit of a woman, was <hi>Achilles</hi> brought vp heere: who in that time, begot <hi>Pyrhus</hi> vpon <hi>Deidamia,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Licomedes,</hi> and where the crafty <hi>Vlysses</hi> did discouer this fatall Prince to <hi>Troy.</hi>

                  </note> As we fetched vp the sight of <hi>Nicaria,</hi> wee espied two Turkish Galleots, who gaue vs the Chace, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued vs, straight vnto a bay, betwixt two Mountaines, where we left the loaded Boat, and fled to the Rockes: But in our flying,<note place="margin">

                  </note> the Maister was taken, and other two old men; whom they made captiues, and slaues: and also seized vpon the Boat, and all their goods: The number that escaped, were nine persons. This Ile <hi>Nicaria,</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called <hi>Doliche,</hi> and <hi>Ithiosa,</hi> and is somewhat bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; hauing no Sea-port at all: It was heere, the Poets feigned,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that <hi>Icarus</hi> the son of <hi>Dedalus</hi> fell, when as hee took flight from <hi>Creta,</hi> with his borrowed wings, of whom it hath the name. Expecting certaine daies heere, in a vilage called <hi>Lephantos,</hi> for passage to <hi>Sio,</hi> at last I found a <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandino</hi> bound thither, that was come from the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ile of <hi>Stalimene,</hi> of old <hi>Lemnos,</hi> wherein I embarked, and sailed by the Ile <hi>Samos,</hi> which is opposite to <hi>Caria,</hi> in <hi>Asia Minor:</hi> It is of circuit one hundred and sixty, and of length forty miles: It was of old named <hi>Dri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Lycaon</hi> the excellent Musitien borne.</p>
               <p>As wee left the Ile <hi>Veneco</hi> on our left hand, and entred in the Gulfe betweene <hi>Sio,</hi> and <hi>Eolida,</hi> there fell downe a deadly storme, at the <hi>Greco è Leuante,</hi> which split our Mast, carrying Sailes and all ouer-board: Whereupon euery man looked (as it were) with the stampe of death in his pale visage. The Tempest continuing (our Boat not being able to keepe the Seas) we were constrained to seeke into a creeke, betwixt two Rockes, for safety of our liues; where, when wee entred, there was no likely-hood of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: for wee had a shelfie shore, and giuing ground to the Ankors they came both home. The sorrowfull Maister seeing nothing but shipwracke, tooke the Helme in hand, directing his course to rush vpon the face of a low Rocke, whereupon the Sea most fearefully broke. As wée touched, the Marriners contending who should first leape out, some fell ouer-boord, and those that got Land, were pulled backe by the reciprocating waues: Neither in all this time durst I once moue; for they had formerly sworne, if I pressed to escape, before the rest were first forth, they would throw me head-long into the Sea: So, being two waies in danger of death, I patiently offered vp my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God.</p>
               <p>At our first incounter with the Rockes (our fore-deckes, and boates Gallery being broke, and a great leake made) the recoiling waues brought vs backe from the Shelfes a great way; which the poore Maister perceiuing, and that there were seuen men drowned, and eleuen persons aliue, cryed with a lowd voyce: <hi>Bee of good cheere, take vp Oares and row hastily; it may bee, before the Barke sinke, wee attaine to yonder Caue.</hi>

                  </note> Euery man working for his owne deliuerance (as it pleased God) we got the same with good fortune: for no sooner were wee dis-barked, but the Boat immediate sunke. There was nothing saued but my <hi>Coffino,</hi> which I kept alwaies in my Armes; for the which of my things, the <hi>Greekes</hi> were in admiration. In this Caue, which was thirty paces long, within the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9033:23"/>
wee abode three daies, without both meate and drink: vpon the fourth day at Morne, the Tempest ceasing, there came Fisher-boates to relieue vs, who found the ten <hi>Greekes</hi> almost famished for lacke of food; but I in that hunger-staruing feare, fed vpon the expectation of my doubtfull reliefe. True it is, a miserable thing it is for a man, to grow an example to others, in matters of affliction, yet it is necessary that some men should be so: For it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, hauing showne a sensible disposition of fauor vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee, in humbling mee to the very pit of extremities, taught me also by such an expected deliuerance, both to put my confidence in his eternall goodnesse, and to know the frailty of my owne selfe, and my ambition, which draue me often to such disasters.</p>
               <p>The dead men being found on shore, wee buried them; and I learned at that instant time, there were seuentéene boats cast away, on the Coast of this Iland, and neuer a man saued: in this place the <hi>Greekes</hi> set vp a stone Crosse in the memoriall of such a wofull mischance, and mourned heauily, fasting and praying. I reioycing, and thanking God for my safety (leauing them sorrowing for their friends and good) tooke iourney through the Iland to <hi>Sio,</hi> for so is the Citie called. In my way I past by an old Castle standing on a little Hill, named <hi>Gasbos,</hi> or <hi>Helias;</hi> where (as I was informed, by two <hi>Greekes</hi> in my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) the Sepulchre of <hi>Homer</hi> was yet extant: For this is one of the seuen Iles that contended for his birth:<note place="margin">

                  </note> And I willing to see it, entreated them to accompany me thither; where we came, wee descended by sixteene degrées into a darke Cell, and passing that, wee entred in another foure-squared roome, in which I saw an ancient Toomb, whereon were ingrauen <hi>Greeke</hi> letters, which wee could not vnderstand for their antiquity; but whether it was his Toombe or not, I do not know, but this they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>

After some certaine attendance, I embarked in a <hi>Carmoesalo,</hi> bound for <hi>Nigroponti,</hi> which was forth of my way to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> but because I would gladly haue seene <hi>Macedonia,</hi> I followed that determination: In our way wee sayled by <hi>Mytelene,</hi> an Iland of old called <hi>Isa:</hi> next <hi>Lesbos:</hi> and lastly <hi>Mytelene,</hi> of <hi>Milet</hi> the sonne of <hi>Phoebus, Pythacus,</hi> one of the seuen Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi> the most valiant <hi>Antimenides,</hi> and his brother <hi>Alceus</hi> the Poet, <hi>Theophrastus</hi> the Peripatetike Phylosopher, <hi>Arion</hi> the learned Harper, and the shee Poet <hi>Sapho,</hi> were borne in it.</p>

But these North-westerne Ilands, in Sommer, are neither hot nor cold, hauing most wholesome and temperate aire; and doe yeeld aboundance of Corne, euen more then to suffice the Inhabitants; which is yeerely transported to the firme Land, and sold: They haue also good store of cattell, and good cheape; and the best fishing that the whole Ocean yeeldeth, is vpon the coasts of <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Zetland.</hi>

                  <hi>Nigroponti</hi> was formerly called <hi>Euboea,</hi> next <hi>Albantes,</hi> and now is surnamed the Quéene of <hi>Archipelago:</hi> It is separated from the firme Land of <hi>Thessaly</hi> with a narrow channell, ouer the which in one part there is a bridge, that passeth betwéene the Ile, and the maine continent, and vnder it runneth a marueilous swift current, or tyde; Within halfe a mile of the bridge, I saw a Marble columne, standing on the top of a little rocke, whence (as

                  </note> and razed the walles, giuing it in possession to the neighbouring <hi>Perinthians.</hi> This Citie thus remained in calamitie till <hi>Constantine</hi> (resigning the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Italy</hi> to the Popish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Roman Bishops) reedified the same, and translated his Imperiall seate in the East, and reduced all the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi> to an vnite tranquility, with immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall reputation, which the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> had so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably disquieted.</p>
               <p>But these disorders at length reformed by the seuere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of iustice, for the which, and other worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, the said <hi>Constantine,</hi> sonne of S. <hi>Helen,</hi> and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which after the Popes vsurped) was surnamed the <hi>Great.</hi> He first in his plantation called this Citie <hi>New Rome;</hi> but when hee beheld the flourishing and multiplying of all things in it, and because of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious situation thereof, he called it <hi>Constantinopolis,</hi> after his owne name. This Emperour liued there many pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous yeares, in a most happy estate: Likewise many of his successors did, vntill such time that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of that name, and Emherour of the Turkes, liuing in a discontented humor, to behold the great and glorious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of Christians, especially this famous Citie, that so flourished in his eyes, by moment all circumstances, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his cruell intentions to the full height of ambition;

whereby hee might abolish the very name of Christianity, and also puft vp with a presumptuous desire to enlarge his Empire, went with a maruellous power both by Sea and Land, vnto this magnificent mansion. The issue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was such, that after diuers batteries and assaults, the irreligious Infidels broke downe the walles, and entred the Citle, where they made a wonderfull massacre of poore afflicted Christians, without sparing any of the Romane kinde, either male or female. In the mercilesse fury of these infernall Impes, the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> was killed, whose head being cut off,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The death of Constantine the Emperour.</hi>
                  </note> was carried vpon the poynt of a Launce, through all the Citie and Campe of the Turkes, to the great disgrace and ignominy of Christianitie. His Empresse, Daughters, and other Ladies were put to death after a strange forme of new deuised torments. By this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> this <hi>Mahomet</hi> tooke twelue kingdomes, and two hundred Cities from the Christians, which is a lamentable losse, of such an illustrious Empire. Thus was that Imperiall Citie lost, in the yeare 1453. <hi>May</hi> 29. when it had remained vnder the gouernment of Christians 1198 yeares. It is now the chiefe abode of the great Turke <hi>Sultan Acomet,</hi> the 15 Grand <hi>Can,</hi> of the line of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> liuing at this day, who is about 23 yeares of age; a man more giuen to venery then martiality, which giueth presently a greater aduantage to the Persians in their instant warres.</p>
               <p>The forme or situation of this Citie, is like vnto a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, the South part whereof, and the East part, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with <hi>Hellespontus,</hi> and <hi>Bosphorus Thraicus;</hi> and the North part adioyning to the firme land. It is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe about the Walles, estéemed to be 18 miles: in one of these triangled points standeth the Palace of the great Turke, called <hi>Seralia,</hi> and the Forrest wherein he hunteth, which is two miles in length. The speciall obiect of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity I saw within this Citie, was the incomparable Church of S. <hi>Sophia,</hi> whose ornaments and hallowed ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels were innumerable, in the time of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9033:28"/>
who first builded it; but now conuerted to a Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, and consecrate to <hi>Mahomet</hi> after a Diabolicall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I saw also the famous <hi>Hypprodome,</hi> and the Theater whereon the people stood when the Emperours vsed to run their horses, and make their Princely shewes, on so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne dayes, which is now altogether decayed. There is a great Columne in that same place, in the which all those things memorable that haue béene done in this <hi>Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drome,</hi> are superficially carued.</p>
               <p>Upon the West corner of the Citie, there is a strong Fortresse, fortified with seuen great Towers, and well furnished with munition, called by Turkes, <hi>Iadileke:</hi> In this <hi>Presoun</hi> are Bashaws and Subbashaws imprisoned,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Presoun.</hi>
                  </note> and also great men of Christians, if any offence be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Their place of exchange is called <hi>Bezastan,</hi> wherein all sorts of commodities are to bee sold; as Sattins, Silkes, Ueluets, Cloth of Siluer and Gold, and the most exquisit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought handkerchiffes, that can be found in the world; with other infinite commodities, the relation of which would be tedious.</p>
               <p>I haue séene men and women as vsually sold here in markets, as horses, and other beasts are with vs. The most part of which are <hi>Hungarians, Transiluanians,</hi> and <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> captiues, and of other places besides, which they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Whom, if no compassionable Christian will buy, or or relieue; then must they either turne Turke, or bee addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to perpetuall slauery. In <hi>Constantinople</hi> there haue happened many fearefull fires, which often haue consumed to ashes the most part of the rarest monuments there, and the beauty of infinite palaces, as <hi>Zonoras</hi> the Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Historiographer in his Histories mentioneth. And now lately in the yeare 1607. October 14. there were burned aboue 3000 houses, of which I saw a number of ruines (as yet) vnrepaired. It is subiect also to diuers earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, which haue often subuerted the Towers, Houses, Churches, and walles of the Citie to the ground. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the yeare 1509. in the reigne of <hi>Baiazeth</hi> the

ninth Emperour of the Turkes, in which time more then 13000 persons were all smothered and dead, and laid vp in heapes vnburied. And commonly euery third yeare, the pestilence is excéeding great in that Citie, and after such an odious manner, that those who are infected (before they dy) haue the halfe of their one side rot, and fall away: so that you may easily discerne the whole intrailes of their bodies. It is not licentiated that any Christian should enter in a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Moskée, without the conduct of a Ianisary, the tryall whereof I had when I viewed S. <hi>Sophia.</hi>

From thence I went to the blacke sea: but commonly called, <hi>Mare Euxinum,</hi> where I saw <hi>Pompeis</hi> pillar of marble, standing néere to the shore, vpon a rocky Iland;<note place="margin">

The blacke sea is not farre from <hi>Galata,</hi> for I both went and returned in one day.</p>
               <p>The Turkes haue no bels in their Churches, neither the vse of a clocke, nor numbring of houres; but they haue high round Stéeples, for they contrafact and contradict all the formes of Christians; when they goe to pray, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together by the voyce of crying men, who go vp on the bartizings of their Stéeples, shouting and crying with a shrill voyce: <hi>La illa, Eillala, Mahomet Rezul alla,</hi> that is, <hi>God is a great God, and Mahomet is his Prophet, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there is but one God.</hi>

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:9033:29"/>In <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and many other places of <hi>Turky,</hi> I haue séene thrée Sabboth dayes together in one wéeke: the Friday for the <hi>Turkes,</hi> the Saturday for <hi>Iewes,</hi> and the Sunday for the <hi>Christians;</hi> but the Turkes Sabboth is worst kept of all: for they will not spare to doe any labour vpon their holy day. They haue méetings at their publicke prayers euery day fiue seuerall times: the first is, before the rising of the Sunne: the second is, a little before mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: the third is, at three of the clock afternoone: the fourth is at Sun-setting, Summer and Winter: Fifthly, the last houre of praier is alwaies two or thrée houres within night.

And at their deuotion, they will not tolerate any women in their company, lest they should withdraw their mindes and affection from their present zeale. The Church-men are called <hi>Hadach Casseis,</hi> or <hi>Daruises,</hi> who weare on their heads gréene Shashes, to make distinction betwéene them and others: for they are accounted to bee of <hi>Mahomets</hi> kindred.</p>
               <p>They hold all madde men in great reuerence, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or Saints, and if they intend any farre iourney, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate

And whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer answere these Bedleem Prophets giue, it is holden to be so credible, as if an Oracle had spoken it.

               <p>The subtilty of this dissembler was admirable; who knowing that he was distitute of heauenly gifts, to worke miracles, feigned that God sent him with the Sword. He also promised, at the end of a thousand yeares to returne, and bring them to Paradise; but hee hath falsified his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, for the time is expired twenty three yeares ago. And they imagining, that hee is either diseased, or become lame in his iourney, haue ascribed to him another thousand yeares to come. But long may their wicked and faithlesse generation gape, before he come, till such time, that in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall conuocation, they be partakers of his endlesse dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in hell; vnlesse it please the Lord in his mercy, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert them, before that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet,</hi> chiefly prohibiteth in his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> the eating of Swines flesh, and drinking of wine, which indeed the best sort do, but their baser kind are daily drunkards: Their common drinke is <hi>Sherpet,</hi> composed of water, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and sugar, which is exceeding delectable in the tast: And the vsuall courtesie they bestow on their friends, who visite them, is a Cup of <hi>Coffa,</hi> made of a kind of seede called <hi>Coaua,</hi> and of a blackish colour, which they drinke so hote as possible they can, and is good to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9033:32"/>
the crudity of raw meates, and hearbes, so much by them frequented. And those that cannot attaine to this liquor, must bee contented with the cooling streames of water.</p>
               <p>It is incident to Turkes, which haue not that generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of minde, to temper felicitie, to bee glutted with the superfluous fruits of doubtfull prosperity: Neither haue they a patient resolution to withstand aduersity, nor hope to expect the better alteration of time. But by an infused malice in their wicked spirits, when they are any way cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, will with importunate compulsion, cause the poore slauish subiected Christians, surrender all they haue, the halfe, or so forth, sometimes with strokes, menacings, and sometimes death it selfe; which plainely doth demonstrate their excessiue cruelty, and the poore Christians ineuitable misery.</p>
               <p>I haue often heard Turkes brawle one with another, most vilely, but I neuer saw, or heard, that they either in priuate or publique quarrels, durst strike one another; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dare they, for feare of seuere punishment imposed to such quarrellers: But they will iniure and strike Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who dare not say it is amisse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cruelty of Turkes toward their seruants. They also pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors three manner of wayes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the hainousnesse of the offence most seuerely, which I haue heere omitted to relate.</hi>
                  </note> nor strike againe. It is a common thing with them, to kill their seruants for a very small offence, and when they haue done throw them like dogs in a ditch. And oftentimes (if not so) will lay them downe on their backes, hoysing vp their heeles, bind their feete together, and fasten them to a post, and with a cudgell giue them thrée or foure hundred blowes on the soales of their féete; whereupon, peraduenture, some euer go lame after.</p>
               <p>Their seruants are bought, and sold, like bruite beasts in markets; neither can these miserable drudges euer reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer liberty, except they buy themselues free, either by one meane or other.</p>
               <p>Their wiues are not farre from the like seruitude, for the men by the Alcoran are admitted to marry as many women as they will, or their ability can keep. And if it shal
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9033:32"/>
happen, that any one of these women (I meane either wife or concubine) prostituteth her selfe to another besides her husband; then may he by authority, bind her hands and feet, hang a stone about her neeke, and cast her into a riuer, which by them is vsually done in the night.</p>
               <p>But when those Infidels please to abuse poore Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an women against their husbands will, they little regard the transgression of the Christian Law, who as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floure their daughters as their wiues, yet the deuoute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans neuer meddle with them, accompting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues damned to copulate (as they think) with the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of dogs: The Turkes generally, when they commit any copulation with Christians, or their owne Sex, they wash themselus in a South-running fountaine, before the Sun-rising, thinking thereby to wash away their sins.</p>
               <p>But now to returne to the Turkes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The marriage of Turkes.</hi>
                  </note> Their custome and manner of mariage is this: If a man affecteth a yong maid, he buyeth her of her parents, and giueth a good summe of mony for her, and after she is bought, he enrolles her name in the <hi>Cadies</hi> booke, witnessing she is his bound wife, bought of her father.

alwaies couering their faces, very modestly with white or black maskes, which are neuer vncouered, till they returne to their houses.</p>
               <p>Many other ceremonies they haue, which would be too prolixe for me to recite. And notwithstanding of all this exernall grauity, amongst these hirelings, yet there are in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> aboue 40000 brothel-houses, <hi>Turqueski,</hi> ts <hi>Libertines</hi>; in any of which, if a Christian, (especially <hi>Franckes</hi>) be apprehended, he must either turne Turke, or laue, all his life: But the women by a policy apply a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyson to this seuerity, for they accustomably come to the Chambers of their Benefactors and Well-willers, or other places appointed secretly, where so they learne either a <hi>French Syncopa,</hi> or an <hi>Italian Bergemasko.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lent of the Turks is called <hi>Byrham,</hi> which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth the space of a month once in the yeare: in all which time, from the Sunne rising to his setting, they neither eate nor drinke: And at their prayers (especially in this fasting) they vse often to reiterate these words, <hi>Hue, hue, hue,</hi> that is; <hi>He he he, alone is God;</hi> or <hi>There is but one onely supreme Power</hi>; which they do in deriston of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who (as they say) adore three Gods. They haue also this sinister opinion, that at the day of iudgement, when <hi>Mahomet</hi> shall appeare, there shall be three displayed Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, vnder the which all good people shall be conducted in Paradise.

               <p>They hold also this, as a confident Article of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, that there are seuen Paradises in heauen, the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                  </note> they hold it to be deepe Gulfe, betwixt two Mountaines: from the mouth whereof are Dragons, that continually throw fire, being large eight leagues, and hath a darke entry, where the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fiends meete the perplexed sinners, conuoying them till they come to a Bridge that is so narrow as the edge of a rasour: whereupon those who haue not committed hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offences, may passe ouer to hell, but those who haue done buggery (as the most part of them do) and homicide, shall fall headlong from it, to the profoundest pit in Hell, where they shall sometimes burne in fire, and sometimes be cast into hote boyling water to be refreshed. And for the greater punishment of the wicked (say they) God hath planted a trie in Hell, named <hi>Saiaratash</hi> or <hi>Roozo Sayta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> that is, the head of the Deuill, vpon the fruit of which, the damned continually feed: <hi>Mahomet</hi> in one of the chapters of his Alcoran calleth this trie, <hi>The trie of Malediction.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Sarazens</hi> are descended of <hi>Esau,</hi> who after he had lost the blessing, went and inhabited in <hi>Arabia Petrea</hi>; and his posterity, striuing to make a cléere distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, the <hi>Ismalites,</hi> and <hi>Iewes,</hi> called themselues (as come of <hi>Sara</hi>) <hi>Sarazens</hi>; and not of <hi>Hagar,</hi> the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom came the <hi>Ismaelites,</hi> neither of the race of <hi>Iacob,</hi> of whom came the <hi>Iewes.</hi> But now the <hi>Sarazens</hi> being ioyned with the <hi>Turkes,</hi> their Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, haue both lost their name, and the right of their descent.</p>
               <p>The puissance of the great <hi>Turke</hi> is admirable, yet the most part of his Kingdomes in <hi>Asia,</hi> are not well inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither populous, but these parts which border with Christians, are strongly fortified with Castles, People, and Munition: If Christian Princes could concord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult together, it were a easie thing in one yeare, to subdue the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and roote out their very names from the earth; yea, moreouer, I am certified, that there are more Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, euen slaues and subiects to the great <hi>Turke,</hi> which doe inhabite his Dominions, then might ouerthrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer these Infidels, if they had worthy Captaines, Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and furniture of Armes; without the helpe of any Christian of Christendome.</p>

               <p>After I had contented the Master for my fraught and victuals (who, as he was an Infidell, vsed me with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary exaction) I found a Barke of the Arches pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to <hi>Cyprus,</hi>

               <p>Twelue dayes was I betwéene <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Limisso</hi> in <hi>Cyprus</hi>; where arriued, I receiued more gracious demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations from the Ilanders, then I could hope for, or wish, being farre beyond my merit or expectation; onely conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my curiosity with a quiet minde, I redounded thankes for my embraced curtesies. The second day after my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall, I tooke with me an Interpreter, and went to sée <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosia,</hi> which is placed in the midst of the kingdome.

And although I had with me sufficiency of wine, yet durst I drinke none thereof, being so strong, and withall hath a taste of pitch; and that is, because they haue no barrels, but great Iarres made of earth, wherein their wine is put. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosia</hi> is the principall Citie of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> &amp; is inuironed with mountaines, like vnto <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Aetruria</hi>; wherein the Uizier Bashaw remaineth.

Oh great pitty! that the vsurpers of Gods word, and the worlds great enemy, should maintaine (without feare) that famous kingdome, being but 1500 Turkes in all, who are the keepers of it: vnspeakeable is the calamity of that poore afflicted Christian people, vnder the terrour of these Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels: who would, if they had Armes or assistance of any Christian Potentate, easily subuert and abolish the Turks without any disturbance; yea and would render the whole Signiory thereof to such a noble Actor.

               <p>The daily interrogation I had here for a Carauans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> was not to me a little fastidious, being mindfull to visite <hi>Babylon.</hi> In this my expectation I tooke purpose with thrée <hi>Venetian</hi> Marchants, to go sée the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of <hi>Libanon,</hi> which was but a dayes iourney thither. As we ascended vpon the mountaine, our ignorant guide mistaking the way, brought vs in a labyrinth of dangers; insomuch that wrestling amongst intricate paths of rocks, two of our Asses fell ouer a banke and brake their neckes: And if it had not beene for a Christian <hi>Amaronite,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally encountred with vs, in our wilsum wandring, we had béen miserably lost, both in regard of rockes, and heapes of snow we passed, and also of great torrents which fell downe with force from the steepy toppes, wherein one of these Marchants was twice almost drowned. When we arriued to the place where the Cedars grew, we saw but 24 of all, growing after the manner of Oke trées, but a great deale taller, straighter, and greater, and the branches grow so straight out, as though they were kept by Art.</p>

The roots of some of these Cedars are almost destroyed by shepheards, who haue made fires thereat, and holes wherein they sléepe; yet neuerthelesse they flourish gréene aboue in the toppes, and branches. The length of this mountaine is about fortie miles, reaching from the West to the East; and continually, Summer and Winter reserueth snow on the toppes.

best wine that is bred on the earth. The Signior thereof is a free-holder, by birth a Turk, and will not acknowledge any superior, but the most part of the inhabited Uillages are <hi>Christians,</hi> called <hi>Amaronites,</hi> or <hi>Nostranes, quasi Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaritans,</hi> and are gouerned by their owne Patriarke. There are none at this day, do speake the <hi>Syriack</hi> tongue, saue onely these people of Mount <hi>Libanus</hi>; &amp; in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is written.

               <p>The <hi>Mahometans</hi> esteeme this to bee a holy place, and many resort to it in pilgrimage, to offer vp their Satani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call prayers to <hi>Mahomet.</hi> I saw vpon this Mountaine a sort of fruit, called <hi>Amazza franchi</hi>: that is, <hi>the death of Christians</hi>; because when <hi>Italians,</hi> or others of <hi>Europe,</hi> eate any quantity thereof, they presently fall into the bloudy fluxes, or else ingender some other pestilentious feuer, whereof they die. The Patriarke did most kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vs at his house; so did also all the <hi>Amaronites</hi> of the other Uillages, who met vs in our way before we came to their Townes, and brought presents with them of Bread, Wine, Figges, Oliues, Sallats, Capons, Egges, and such like, as they could on a suddaine prouide. About the Uillage of <hi>Eden,</hi> is the most fruitfull part of all <hi>Libanus,</hi> abounding in all sorts of delitious fruites. True it is, the variety of these things, maketh the silly people thinke, the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> was there: By which allegeance, they approue the apprehension of such a sinistrous opinion, with these arguments; that Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> is sequestrate from the circum-iacent Regions, and is inuincible for the height, and strengths they haue in rockes; &amp; that <hi>Eden</hi> was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9033:39"/>
still re-edified by the fugitiue inhabitants, when their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had ransacked it: Also they affirme, before the deluge it was so nominate, and after the floud it was repaired againe by <hi>Iaphet,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Noah,</hi> who builded <hi>Ioppa,</hi> or <hi>Iaphta,</hi> in <hi>Palestina.</hi> Loe these are the reasons they show strangers for such like informations.</p>
               <p>There are with this one, other two supposed places of this earthly Paradise: the one is by the Turkes, and some ignorant <hi>Georgians,</hi> holden to bee at <hi>Damascus,</hi> for the beauty of faire fields, gardens, and excellent fruites there, especially for the trée called <hi>Mouslee,</hi> which they beléeue hath growne there since the beginning of the world. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed it is a rare and singular Tree, for I saw it at <hi>Damascus,</hi> and others also of the same kind, vpon <hi>Nylus</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>: The growth whereof is strauge; for euery yeare in September it is cut downe hard by the roote, and in fiue moneths the Tree buddeth vp a pace againe, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging forth leaues,<note place="margin">

               <p>The third place by the <hi>Chelfaines,</hi> is thought to be in the East part of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> neere to the ioyning of <hi>Tygris,</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi>; where, so they inhabite. I haue oft requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of these <hi>Chelfaines,</hi> what reason they had for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued opinion: who answered me they receiued it from time to time, by the Tradition of their Ancestors; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and others riuers mentioned in the Scriptures, which to this day, detaine their names in that Country. Some hold that Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ouer all the earth. But contrarywise it manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the second chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> verse twenty, that this Garden which wee call Paradise, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was put to dresse it, was a certaine place on earth, containing a particular portion of a Country, called <hi>Eden,</hi> which boundeth on the riuer <hi>Euphrates.</hi> To this, and all the rest, I answere, no certainety can bee had of the place where
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9033:39"/>
                  <hi>Eden</hi> was, either by reading or trauelling, because this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath beene oft diuided in sundry streames: And it is said, that <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when hee wonne <hi>Babylon,</hi> did turne the maine channell of <hi>Euphrates</hi> to another course. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, or wheresoeuer it be, I resolue my selfe, no man can demonstrate the place, which God for the sinnes and fall of man, did not onely accurse, but also the whole face of the earth.</p>
               <p>Many ancient Authors haue agreed with the opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diuisions.</hi>

               <p>But to be briefe, after my returne to <hi>Tripoly,</hi> I departed thence Eastward, with a Carauan of <hi>Turkes</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten daies iourney distant.

And for my better safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard (being alwaies alone, which by all was euer much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired) the Uize Consull tooke surety of the Captaine, that hee should protect mee safely from théeues, cut-throates, and the exactions of tributes by the way, deliuering mee fréely into the hands of the <hi>Padre Guardiano</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> which being done, I hired two Mulets from a <hi>Turk</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one to ride vpon, and another to carry my victuals; and so set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with them. The number of our company were about 900 <hi>Armenians, Christian</hi> pilgrimes, men and women, 600 <hi>Turkes,</hi> trafficking for their owne businesse, and 100 Souldiers, thrée <hi>Schowsses,</hi> and sixe <hi>Ianisaries</hi> to keep them from inuasions.</p>
               <p>Betweene <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Damascus,</hi> wee had nine daies iourney, in fiue of which, we had pleasant trauelling, and good <hi>Canes</hi> to lodge in, that had béene builded for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Trauellors, and are well maintained: But when we passed <hi>Hamsek,</hi> which is a little more then mid-way, wee had dangerous trauelling, being oft assailed with <hi>Arabs,</hi> fatigated with rocky Mountaines, and sometimes in point of choaking for lacke of water. The confusion of this multitude was not onely grieuous in regard of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme heate, prouiding of victuals at poore Uillages, and scarcity of water to fill our bottles, made of boare skinnes,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9033:41"/>
but also amongst narrow and stony passages, thronging, we oft fell one ouer another, in great heapes, in danger to be smothered: yea, and oftentimes, we that were Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, had our bodies well beaten, by our conducting <hi>Turkes.</hi> At our accustomed dismounting, to recreate our selues, and refresh the beasts, I would often fetch a walke, to stretch my legs, that were stifled with a scumbling beast; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Turkes</hi> were mightily discontented,<note place="margin">

So do also their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans, and all <hi>Turkes</hi> in the world sit alwaies crosse-legged, wrongfully abusing the commendable consuetudo of the industrious Taylors. In their houses they haue no bed to lie on, nor chaires to sit on, nor Tables to eate on, but a bench made of Boords, along the house side, of a foote height from the floore, spread ouer with a Carpet, whereon they vsually sit, eating, drinking, slée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, resting, and doing of manuall exercises, all in one place.</p>
               <p>They neuer vncloth themselues, when they go to rest, neither haue they any bed-cloathes, saue onely a couerlet aboue them: I haue seene hundreds of them, after this manner, lie ranked like durty swine, in a beastly stie; or loathsome Iades, in a filthy stable. Upon the ninth day (leauing <hi>Cotafa</hi> behind vs on the Mountaines) wee entred in a pleasant plaine of thrée leagues in length, adorned with many Uillages, Gardens, and Riuers; and arriuing at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus,</hi> we were all lodged (some in Chambers wanting beds, and others without, on hard stones) in a great <hi>Cane</hi> called <hi>Heramnen,</hi> where we stayed one day.</p>

               <p>After we had trauelled a great way along the lake of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesareth,</hi> which is of length 8 leagues, and large 4. where I saw the decaied Townes of <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> and <hi>Tiberias,</hi> lying on the North side of the same Sea, we left the Marine, and came to <hi>Cana,</hi> to stay all night; in which we had no Caues to saue vs from the <hi>Arabs,</hi> nor couerture aboue our heads, but the hard ground to lie on, which was alwayes my bed, in the most part of <hi>Asia:</hi> In the night when wee slept, the Souldiers kept centenall, and in the day when we reposed, they slept, and we watched. This <hi>Cana</hi> was the Towne wherein our Sauiour wrought the first Miracle, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, at the Marriage, Water into Wine. The day follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, embracing our way, we passed ouer a little pleasant mountaine, where the <hi>Armenian</hi> Patriarke (for so was there one with them) went into an old Chappell, and all the rest of the Pilgrimes thronged about him, vsing many strange Ceremonies, for it was in that place (as it is sayd) <hi>That Christ fed fiue thousand people with fiue Barley loaues and two fishes.</hi> Continuing our iourney we saw Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> on our left hand, which is a pretty round Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, beset about with comely trées: I would gladly haue séene the monument of that place, where the trans-sigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ was, but the <hi>Carauan</hi> mindfull to visit <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> left the great way of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and would by no perswasion go thither. That night we lodged in a poore vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Heerschek,</hi> where we could get neither meat for our selues, nor prouender for the beasts; but some of our company had for their suppers, a hundred strokes from the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> in that place, because the Christian Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes had troden vpon the graues of their dead friends, which by no meanes they can tolerate: They made no

               <p>Aprill the tenth day, about ten of the clocke (passing the riuer <hi>Kyson</hi>) we arriued at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and there reposed till the euening, prouiding our selues of victuals and water: In this Towne dwelt <hi>Ioseph</hi> and the virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; and in which also our Sauiour was brought vp.</p>
               <p>After we had dined, the <hi>Armenians</hi> arose, and went to a heape of stones, the ruines of an old house, before the which they fell downe vpon their knées, praising God: and that ruinons lumpe (say they) was the house where <hi>Mary</hi> dwelt when <hi>Gabriel</hi> saluted her, bringing the Annuntiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of saluation to the world: I am fully perswaded they carried away aboue fiue thousand pound weight to kéepe in a memoriall thereof. Then did I remember mee of the Chappell of <hi>Loretta,</hi> and told the <hi>Carauan</hi> that I saw that house standing in <hi>Italy,</hi> which (as the <hi>Romanists</hi> say) was transported by the Angels: O, sayd he, we <hi>Armenians</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beléeue that, neither many other assertions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Church; for we certainly know by Christians, that haue from time to time dwelt here euer since, that this is both the place, and stones of the house: Let Papists coyne a new law to themselues, we care not: for as they erre in this, so do they in all, following meerly the traditions of men, they run gallopping post to hell.

Now thou bottomlesse gulfe of Papistry, here I forsake thee, no winter blasting Furies of Satans subtill stormes can make ship-wracke of my faith, on the stony shelues of thy deceitfull déepes.</p>
               <p>In the time of our staying here, the <hi>Emeere</hi> or Lord of

This being done, and vnknowne to vs, we marched riding faster then an ordinary pace; which our guide suspecting, that by our celerity we should goe beyond the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his treacherous plot, began to crosse vs grieuously, leading vs vp and downe amongst pooles and holes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee listed; where many of our Cammels and Asses were lost and could not bee recouered, because wee all beganne to suspect and feare; which was the cause that the

               <p>In the end the Captaine and Ianisaries en treated him earnestly to bring vs in the right way; but the more they requested, the more obdurate was his heart, replying, hee was mistaken, and could not finde it till day light: vpon the which wordes the company was stayed, and in the meane while there came a Turke, one of our Souldiers, vnto the Captaine, saying; Hee saw the guide, before our departure from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> send a <hi>Moore</hi> before him, for what respect he knew not, being long at priuate conference. Wherupon they straight bound him with ropes on a horse backe, threatning him with death, to cause him confesse the truth.</p>
               <p>In the midst of this tumult, I hauing got sight of the Northstarre, considered thereby, that the villaine had led vs more to the Southward then to the Westward, which was our way to Ierusalem: <hi>Whereupon I entreated the Carauan to turne our faces Northward, otherwise we should bee cut off, and that suddenly: for although (said I) it may peraduenture be, that we are 3 or 4 miles short of the place intended for our massacre; yet they missing vs, wil like raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Wolues hunt here and there; wherefore if wee incline to the North (God willing) wee shall preuent their bloudy designes.</hi> To which aduice (being duly pondered) they yeelded; and so I became their guide in the darks night, till morning: for none of them knew that starre, neither the nature of it. At last this desperate wretch, considering that either by our vanquishing, or the enemies victory, he could not escape, sith his treason was reuealed, began to beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the <hi>Carauan</hi> saying, that if he could haue any surety of his life, hee would sufficiently informe vs how to escape these imminent dangers. The Captaine being distracted with feare, replied hee would; and thereupon swore a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oath, so did the <hi>Ianisaries</hi> sweare by the head of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> for the like effect: which being done, he was vntied, and confessed, that if we had continued in our way he led vs, we had beene all put to the edge of the sword, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

The Captaine (sending backe that false <hi>Iudas,</hi> for so was hee sworne to doe) sent a Post to <hi>Tyrus</hi> for a new Guide, who came forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and brought vs in our way to Mount <hi>Carmell,</hi> for by it we behoued to go.</p>
               <p>Great are the mercies of God! for as he hath made man an excellent creature, so hath he also indued him with two great powers in his minde: the one a wise power of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, by which hee penetrateth into the knowledge of things; the other a strong power of dexterous resoluing, whereby he executeth things wel vnderstood, for we hauing iudged the worst, resolued the best; and by his Almightie prouidence were fréed from that apparant danger, although the former dayes whoredome, &amp; vnnaturall vices deserued a iust punishment.

               <p>About two of the clocke in the after-noone wee arriued at <hi>Berah,</hi> called of old <hi>Beersheba,</hi> being eleuen miles distant from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Hauing a little reposed, we embraced our mountainous way as cheerefully as we could, for we were excéeding faint, and trauelled that day aboue three and forty miles, whereby we might arriue at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> before the gates were shut, sustaining drouth, heate, hunger, and not a few other inconueniences. At last we beheld the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; which was not onely a contentment to my wearied body, but also being rauished with a kind of vnwonted reioycing, the teares gushed from mine eies for too much ioy. In this time the <hi>Armenians</hi> began to sing in their owne fashion, Psalmes to praise the Lord; and I also sung the 103 Psalme all the way, till we arriued neere the

               <p>The Sunne being passed to his nightly repose, before our arriuall, wee found the gates locked, and the Keyes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed vp to the <hi>Bashaw</hi> in the Castle; which bred a common sorrow in the company, being all both hungry, and weary; yet the Carauan entreated earnestly the Turkes within, to giue vs ouer the walles, some victuals for our money, shewing heauily the necessity wee had thereof, but they would not, neither durst attempt such a thing: In this time the Guardian of the Monastery of <hi>Cordeleirs,</hi>

Then the Guardiano called mee, and asked mee of what Nation I was? and when I told him, he seemed to bee exceeding glad: yet sorrowfull for our misfortune. He hauing knowing my distresse, returned, and sent two Friers to mee with bread, wine and fishes, which they let ouer the wall (as they thought, in a secret place) but they were espied, and on the morrow the Guardiano payed to the Bashaw a great fine, otherwise he had béene beheaded; for the Turkes alledged, he had taken in munition from the Christians, to betray the Citie: This they do oft, for a lesser fault then that was, onely to get bribes, and money from the Grey Friers.</p>
               <p>Aprill the foureteenth day, vpon Palme-sunday in the morning, we entred into <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and at the gate wee were particularly searched, to the effect wee carried in no furniture of Armes, nor poulder with vs, and the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (notwithstanding they are slaues to Turkes) behoued to render their weapons, to the Keepers, such is the feare they haue of Christians: The gates of the Citie are of yron outwardly, and aboue each gate are brasen Ordinance planted, for their owne defence.</p>

               <p>Aprill 14. on Palm-sunday after dinner, the <hi>Guardiano</hi> departed from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Bethphage,</hi> accompanied with twelue Friers, and many other Orientall Christians, which were come thither to that festiuall time, but I by no meanes would go, reposing my selfe till their returne. The ridiculous ceremony which that day they vse, is thus. In an Apish imitation of Christ, at the foresaid <hi>Bethphage,</hi> there was an Asse brought to the <hi>Guardiano,</hi> whereupon he mounted (being as it were, the greater Asse riding vpon the lesser) and came riding to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the people cutting downe boughs of trées, and also dispoyling themselues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to the skin, bestrewed the way as he rode along, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Hosanna, Hosanna, the sonne of Dauid, blessed is he, that commeth in the name of the Lord,</hi> vntill they came to the South gate of <hi>Sion,</hi> where he dismounted. At night after supper, the <hi>Guardiano</hi> knowing that I was a Protestant, and also some other <hi>Frankes,</hi> made an Oration, saying, <hi>You Pilgrimes, who refuse to bee participant with vs in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or will not adhere to the processions &amp; ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which we follow of the Roman Church, I would ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intreate you (your liberty beeing here as much as mine, whereby you may doe whatsoeuer seeme good in our owne eyes) onely to abstaine from scandalizing and mocking our rites &amp; ordinary customes, which at this great feast we must performe.</hi> To the which we condescended, and promised to giue no occasion of offence. In the conclusion of his long exhortation, he disclosed this admonition, saying, All you Trauellers must in general be indued with these thrée wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gifts, <hi>Faith, Patience,</hi> and <hi>Money; Faith,</hi> to beléeue these things you shall sée and heare at <hi>Ierusalem; Patience,</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:9033:50"/>
to endure the apparant iniuries of Infidels; and <hi>Money,</hi> to discharge all tributes and costs, which here (meaning in his owne Monasterie) and about this Citie, must bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed. His Sermon hee concluded like a grey Frier, as indéed he was; for I am fully perswaded hee little cared for our Faith and Patience, prouiding that our Purses could answere his expectation, as truely we found the triall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Munday early, wee Pilgrimes went forth to view the Monuments within the Citie, being accompanied with the <hi>Padre Viccario,</hi> and a <hi>French Predicatore:</hi> the places of any note we saw, were these; First they shewed vs the place where Christ appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who said, <hi>Touch me not, for I am not as yet ascended to my Father, Ioh.</hi> 20, 15. and in this place by them is supposed to be the center, or middle part of the world. Next, where S. <hi>Iames</hi> the first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the primitiue Church was beheaded; then the house of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> but that is doubtfull (say they) because it is not yet confirmed by the Papall Authority; from thence they brought vs to the place where <hi>Annas</hi> one of the high Priests dwelt, and also the trée to which our Sauiour was bound, whiles <hi>Annas</hi> was making himselfe ready to leade him to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> but that I will not beléeue, for that trée groweth yet, being an Oliue trée. They shewed vs also the house where S. <hi>Peter</hi> was imprisoned, and where <hi>Zebedeus</hi> the father of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> dwelt, which are nothing but a lumpe of ruines.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Abisines are borne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally blacke, and these silly religious men of them that stay at Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, weare on their heads flot round caps of a blackish co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, &amp; on their bodies linnen clothes.</hi>
                  </note> Thence we came to the decaied lodging of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> without the Citie, vpon the mount <hi>Sion,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon there is Chappell builded, and at the entry of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>domo,</hi> we saw the stone on which the Cocke crew, when <hi>Peter</hi> denied Christ. Within the same place is the Stone that was rolled to the Sepulchre doore of our Sauiour; being now made an Altar to the <hi>Abasenes,</hi> a kinde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which came from <hi>Prester Iehans</hi> dominions. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Chappell they shewed vs a narrow pit, wherein (say they) Christ was incarcerate the night before hee was brought to the Iudgement Hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:9033:51"/>Upon the same side of <hi>Sion</hi> we saw the place where Christ Christ did institute the Sacraments; and not farre hence, a decayed house, where (say they) the Holy Ghost des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vpon the Apostles, and also the Sepulchre of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> and his sonne <hi>Salomon:</hi> ouer the which there is a Moskée, wherein no Christian may enter to sée these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.</p>
               <p>From thence we returned, and entred <hi>in via dolorosa,</hi> the dolorous way, by which our Lord and Sauiour passed, when hee went to bee crucified; and at the end of the same stréet, here (say they) the Souldiers met <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and compelled him to helpe Christ to beare his Crosse when he fainted. <hi>Pilats</hi> iudgement Hall is altogether ruinated, hauing but onely betwéene the two sides of the Lane, an old Arch of stone, vnder the which I passed, standing full in the high way. Here they shewed vs the place where Christ first tooke vp his Crosse, and on the toppe of that Arch wee saw that place called <hi>Gabbatha,</hi> where Iesus stood, when <hi>Pilate</hi> said to the Iewes, <hi>Ecce homo.</hi> A little below this, they brought vs to the Church of S. <hi>Anna,</hi> where (say they) the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was borne. And going downe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther narrow lane, they pointed vnto a house, and said, here <hi>Diues</hi> the rich Glutton dwelt, who would not giue to <hi>Lazarus</hi> the crummes of bread that fell from his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; this I suspend, amongst many other things, for all hold it to be a Parable, and not a History: and although it were a Historie, who can demonstrate the particular place, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> hauing béen so often transformed by alterations. This I must néeds say, with such lying wonders these flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Friers bring strangers into a wonderfull admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and although I rehearse all I saw there, yet I will not beléeue all, onely publishing them as things indifferent, some whereof are friuolous, and other somewhat more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible: but as I said before, I will make no (or very small) distinction in the relation.</p>
               <p>From thence we came without the Easterne gate, vnto an immoueable stone, vpon the which they said <hi>S. Stephen</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:9033:51"/>
was stoned to death; and néere to that we saw <hi>Porta aurea,</hi> that is, the golden port, called in former times, <hi>the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Gate of the Temple:</hi> which the Turkes haue filled vp with stones, because of a Prophesie, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Citie was once wonne there, and shall bee wonne againe at the same place.</p>
               <p>As we returned to the Couent, they brought vs to mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> and shewed vs the place where <hi>Abraham</hi> offered vp <hi>Isaac,</hi> which is in the custody of <hi>Nigroes,</hi> or <hi>Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Next, the place where Iesus said, <hi>Daughters of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, mourne not for me, &amp;c.</hi> And néere vnto this, where the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> fell into an agony, when Iesus passed by carrying his Crosse. Also not facre hence, we beheld the place, where (as they say) Iesus said, <hi>Mother, behold thy Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ascending more vpward, they shewed vs the house of <hi>Veronica Sancta,</hi> and said, that our Sauiour going by her doore, all in a sweate, to mount <hi>Caluary,</hi> she brought him a napkin to wipe his face; which he receiued, and gaue it her againe: in which (say they) the print of his face remaineth to this day, and is to be séene at Rome. It is also said to be in a Towne in Spaine, wherefore I beléeue the one as well as the other. As touching the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> which was destroyed, there is another great Temple buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the same place, reserued by Turkes, for that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they carry to <hi>Salomon</hi>; néere the which no Christian may come, vnder the paine of loosing his head. These are all the monuments which in one day I saw within <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; but as for Mount <hi>Caluary,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Graue,</hi> I saw them afterward, which in their owne place shall be orderly touched. As we were spending that day in these sights, the <hi>Guardian</hi> had prepared an hundred Souldiers, sixty Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and forty foot-men to take with him the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for his conduction to <hi>Iordan,</hi> and the Mountaine in the Wildernesse whore Christ fasted; which is his vsuall custome once euery yeare, betwéene Palme-sunday and Easter, returning againe before Good-Friday. These pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9033:52"/>
cannot be viewed, saue onely at that time; neither may a Pilgrime goe along with the Souldiers vnlesse hee giue the value of seuen French Crownes (as a propyne) vnto the Lieuetenant: that same night after supper the <hi>Guardian</hi> demanded of vs Trauellers, if we would go with him to sée these memorable and singular things, vpon the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: To whom we answered in a generall consent, Wée would.</p>
               <p>Early vpon Tuesday morning (being all of vs, both Friers and Pilgrimes, well mounted, and Mulets laden for our prouision) wee departed from the Citie with our Souldiers; and trauelled all that day through a barren and desart Countrey, till sun-setting, where wee reposed by a standing well, till an houre within night. After that the Captaine had cried <hi>Catethlanga,</hi> that is, march away; wee set forward, being well guarded round about with our kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, because we entred into a dangerous way. In all this deformed Countrey we saw neither house nor village, for it is altogether desartous, and inhabited onely by wilde beasts, and naked <hi>Arabians.</hi> Before we came néere to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>Gomorha</hi> by seuen miles (for so we behoued to passe by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> East end of it, before we could ariue at that place of <hi>Iordan</hi> which we intended) wee I say encountred with such deepe sandy ground, that the Mulets were not able to carry vs through: whereupon wee all dismounted, wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and wading aboue the middle part of our bodies, and sometimes falling in ouer our heads, we were in great danger of perishing. Euen in the middest of this turmoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling paine (the night being darke) the vnwelcomed <hi>Arabs</hi> inuironed and inuaded vs with a storme of arrowes which they sent from the tops of little hard hils, whereupon they stood,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inuasions of Arabs.</hi>
                  </note> for knowing the aduantage of the ground, they tooke opportunity to giue the more fearfull assaults; yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed nothing (although they wounded some of our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) such was the resolute courage of our valorous defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. True it is, that in all my trauels, I was neuer so sore fatigated, or fearfully indangered, as I was that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:9033:52"/>A little after midgnight,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A true descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sodom and Gomorha.</hi>
                  </note> we left this troublesome way, and marched along the Lake of <hi>Sodome:</hi> This Lake is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mare Mortuum,</hi> the dead sea: for of it selfe it is vnmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neable, such is the stability of the water: It is also called so, because if a bird flie ouer it, she presently falleth downe therein dead: and, as <hi>Salomon</hi> reporteth of it, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 10.7. it smoaketh continually; from whence proceed filthy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours; which deforme the fields lying about for certaine mils, as it were blasted, scorched, and made vtterly barren: This smoake I take onely to be but the exhalation of <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi> for this riuer falling into it, and there ending his course, the two contrary natures cannot agree: the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a filthy puddle, and the other a pure water, as I shall more approbably record. This Lake is eighty miles in length, and sixe in bredth, being compassed with the rocks of <hi>Arabia Petrea</hi> on the South: on the North, with the sandy hils of the wildernesse of <hi>Iudea:</hi> on the West, with the steepy Mountaines of <hi>Arabia deserta:</hi> and on the East, with the plaine of <hi>Iericho.</hi> How commeth it to passe therefore, that the fresh running flood of <hi>Iordan,</hi> falling euermore into this bounded sea; that the Lake it selfe, neuer diminisheth, nor increaseth, but alwaies standeth at one fulnesse: neither hath it any issuing forth, nor reboundeth backwards on the plaine of <hi>Iericho,</hi> which is one of the greatest wonders in the world. Wherefore, as I haue said, it must néeds either exhale to the clouds, or otherwise runne downe to <hi>Hell;</hi> for if it ranne vnder the rockes, and so burst forth in the desarts, it would soone be knowne; but in all the bounds of <hi>Arabia deserta,</hi> which betwixt this Lake and the red Sea, extend to three hundred miles; there is no such matter, as brooke, or strand, much lesse a riuer.</p>
               <p>It bréedeth nor reserueth no kind of fishes; and if by the swelling of <hi>Iordan,</hi> any fishes be carryed to it, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly die. Although <hi>Iosephus</hi> witnesseth, that in his time there was an Apple grew vpon the bankes thereof, like to the colour of gold; and within was rotten, and would
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9033:53"/>
consume to powder; yet I affirme now the contrary: for there is not such a thing (whatsoeuer hath béene in his daies) as either trees, or bushes, grow néere to <hi>Sodome</hi> by many miles: such is the consummation of that pestiferous gulfe: Diuers Authors haue reported, that nothing will sinke into it, of any reasonable weight, as dead men, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasses of beasts; but by experience I approue the contrary: for it beareth nothing aboue at all; yea, not the weight of a feather. The water it selfe, is of a blackish colour, and at sometimes in the yeare, there are terrible shapes, and showes of terror in it, as I was informed at <hi>Iericho,</hi> which is the néerest Towne that bordereth thereupon.</p>
               <p>This contagious, and pestilentious lake of <hi>Sodome,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth much (as may be supposed) that infernall gulfe of Hell; but in my opinion, I hold it to be the purgatory of Papists: for they say <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> is neere, or in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond roome to hell, which I thinke must néedes be <hi>Sodome</hi> for although it bee not Hell it selfe, yet I am perswaded, it is a second Hell, hauing (as some report) no botome. Wherefore I conclude thus, that since Papists will haue a Purgatory, I absolutely affirme, it must be such a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, as the purging of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorha;</hi> which was with fire and brimestone.</p>
               <p>About the breach of day on Tuesday morning, we past by the ruines of an old house; where (as they say) Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist remained, when hee baptized those that came from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and other Regions about, which is but the flight of an arrow from <hi>Iordan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iordans water is of a whitish colour.</hi>
                  </note> Approaching to the banke-side, we dismounted, and vncloathed ourselues, going in naked to the riuer, we washed, vs to refresh our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: In this place, as the <hi>Guardiano</hi> said, was <hi>Christ</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> when the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> came downe in a bodily shape, like a <hi>Doue</hi> vpon him, and there was a voice from heauen,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 3.22.</note> saying: <hi>Thou art my beloued Sonne, in thee I am well pleased.</hi> I saw also an apparant like testimony, of a quadrangled stone, lying on the banke side, whereupon are ingrauen letters, of <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:9033:53"/>
the same thing; and may also bee so coniectured, in regard of the ancient Habitacle, of that precursor, which is not farre from thence.</p>
               <p>This Riuer <hi>Iordan</hi> beginneth in Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> two Fountaines, <hi>Iore,</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> which run separated, till they come to the lake <hi>Maronah;</hi> and hence it maketh one body, keeping his course through the Lake <hi>Genesereth,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in <hi>Sodome.</hi> The riuer <hi>Tibris</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Iordan,</hi> are not much different in quantity and colour; and not vnlike in their courses:<note place="margin">

The water of <hi>Iordan</hi> hath beene transported to <hi>Venice</hi> in barrels, for that purity it hath; which will reserue vnspoyled, both monthes, and yeares, and the longer it is kept, it is the more fresher; and to drinke, it is an excellent remedy for the feuer Quartan, and Quotidian.</p>
               <p>Considering the ancient reputation of this famous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and the rare fight of such an vnfrequented place, I climed vp to the toppe of a <hi>Turpentine</hi> Trée, which grew within the limited floud, euen naked as I came from swimming, and cut downe a faire hunting rod, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with great paines, I brought to <hi>England,</hi> and did present it (as the rarest gemme of a Pilgrimes treasure) to his <hi>Maiesty.</hi> But I remember in the choosing thereof, an vnexpected accident fell out: for I being sequestrate from the sight of the company, vpon his solitary tree, with broad obscuring leaues, the Friers and Souldiers remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, kéeping their course towards <hi>Iericho;</hi> but within two furlongs from <hi>Iordan,</hi> they were baset with the formed <hi>Nocturnall</hi> enemies, who assailed them with a hard conflict: For I heartng the Harquebuse goe off, was straight in admiration, and looking downe to the place where I left my associates, they were gone; so bending my

eyes a little further in the plaine, I saw them at a martiall combat: which sight, gaue mee suddenly, the threatning of despaire, not knowing whether to stay intrenched, within the circumdating leaues, to approue the euents of my auspicious fortunes: or in prosecuting a reliefe, to bée participant of their doubtfull deliuerance. In the end pondering, I could hardly, or neuer escape their hands, leapt downe from the Tree, leauing my Turkish cloathes lying vpon the ground, tooke onely in my hand the rod, and <hi>Shasse</hi> which I wore on my head,<note place="margin">

Approaching on the safe side of my company, one of our souldiers broke forth on horse-backe, being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to kill mee for my staying behind; yea, and thrée times he stroke at me with his halfe pike, but his horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his spéed, I preuented his cruelty, first by falling downe, next by running in amongst the thickest of the Pilgrimes, recouering my beast: Which when the <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diano</hi> espied, and saw my naked body, he presently pulled of his Gowne, and threw it to me, whereby I might hide the secrets of nature: By which meanes (in the space of an houre) I was cloathed thrée manner of waies: first, like a Turke: secondly, like a wilde Arabian: and thirdly, like a Grey Frier; which was a barbarous, a sauage, and a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious habite.</p>
               <p>The Captaine mitigating the fury of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> by some contributing promises, we marched toward <hi>Iericho:</hi> where we reposed, and dined, on the prouision carryed with vs. After dinner wee arose, and went to the house of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> (this was hee who sate vpon a Trée to sée our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour as hee passed by) the wals whereof stand to this day. <hi>Iericho</hi> is now a poore Village onely of nine dwelling hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, inhabited by a kind of <hi>Arabs</hi> (which are in subiection vnder the Gouernour of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) but I saw many rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous lumpes of the walles, and demolishings of the old Towne. Here I saw two most dainty kind of fruits, the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9033:54"/>
one was a little lesser then an Apple,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A rate kind of Apples.</hi>
                  </note> but more round; whose coulour was like to gold without, and within it was white as snow, and swéet like sugar. I would gladly haue eaten of them, but the Friers forbad me, saying; they were the onely pest and death vnto a stanger. The other Apple was like to a gréene Lemmon, long, and full of knots, of a reddish colour, like to a Mellone, being both delicate and wholesome; of which we did eate to satisfie the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral appetite. From <hi>Iericho</hi> we set forward in the way of the Wildernesse, our determination being such, as to view the Mountaine whereon Christ fasted fortie dayes: where ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, being late, we durst not go vp till morning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pitched that night by the fountaine of <hi>Elizeus</hi>; the water of which was of old naturally bitter, but by the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that diuine Prophet, was restored to a sweet taste: It is also excellent in digestion, and wil do a man no harme: for I estéeme it to be the lightest water the earth yéeldeth. Hauing on the morrow filled a Boares skinne of it, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with mee to the mountaine, I found it so light, that I had no weight nor paine in the bearing it on my shoulders, notwithstanding the way it selfe was fastidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>

In all our company there were onely thrée Friers, foure Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes, and I, that durst attempt to climbe the mountaine. After diuers dangers, and narrow passages, hauing come to the top, we entred into a caue ioyning to the Chappell, where (say they) in this place did Christ fast, and here it was that he rebuked Sathan. In our returne againe, wee

               <p>Hauing saluted our <hi>Padre Guardiano,</hi> and the rest of our expecters, in our way as wee returned to Ierusalem, wée rode by a ruinous Abby, where (say they) S. <hi>Ierome</hi> dwelt, and was sed there by wild Lyons. Upon Thursday at night before Good-Friday, wee went to the Holy Graue, where we staied Friday, Saturday, &amp; on Sunday, which was Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster day, we came forth: first, before we entred the Church, we gaue euery one of vs Pilgrimes, nine Chickens of gold to the Turkes, who are kéepers of the doore: next, two Chickens for our first entring the Citie: Thirdly, vnto the <hi>Padre Guardiano</hi> thrée péeces of gold, for the candles; and other things he spent in their owne ceremonies, which we behoued to pay. Both mount <hi>Caluary</hi> and the holy Graue are comprehended within one Church.</p>
               <p>After we entred, the first place of any note we saw, was the place of Unction, which is a foure squared stone, inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed about within an Iron Reuele, on which (say they) the dead body of our Sauiour lay, and was embalmed, after hee was taken from the Crosse, whiles <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> was preparing that new Sepulchre for him, wherein neuer man lay. From thence we came to the holy Graue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Holy Graue.</hi>
                  </note>The holy Graue is couered with a little Chappell, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within a round Quire, in the west end of the Church: It hath two low and narrow entries. As wee entred the first doore, the <hi>Guardiano</hi> fell downe, <hi>ingenochiato,</hi> and kissed a stone, whereupon (hee said) the Angell stood when <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> came to the Sepulchre, to know if Christ was risen on the third day, as he promised. And within the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:9033:55"/>
entry of the second doore, wee saw the place where Christ our Messias was buried, and prostrating our selues in great humility, euery man according to his religion, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp his prayers to God. The sepulchre it selfe is eight foote and a halfe in length, and aduanced about thrée foot in height from the ground, and three foot fiue inches broad, being couered with a faire Marble stone of white colour. In this Chappell are alwayes burning aboue fifty Lampes, maintained by Christian Princes, and they stand within a band of pure gold, which is excéeding sumptuous; hauing the names of those, who sent or gaue them, ingrauen vpon the vpper edges of the round circles. I demanded of the <hi>Guardiano</hi> if any part of the Tombe were yet extant, who replied, there was; but because (said he) Christians resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thither, being deuoutly moued with affection to the place, carryed away part thereof, which caused S. <hi>Helen</hi> to inclose it vnder this stoue; whereby some reliques of it should alwayes remaine. I make no doubt but that same place is <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where the holy Graue was, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the distance betweene Mount <hi>Caluary</hi> and this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Monument; which extendeth to forty of my paces. This Chappell is outwardly decored with fifteene couple of Marble Pillars, and of 22 foot high; and aboue the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Couerture of the same Chappell, there is a little sixe-angled Turret made of Cedar Wood, couered with lead, and beautified with sixe small Columnes of the same trée.</p>
               <p>The forme of the Quiere wherein it standeth, is like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ancient <hi>Rotundo</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> but a great deale higher and larger, hauing two gorgeous Galleries one aboue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and adorned with magnificent Columnes, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at the toppe, with a large round, which yéeldeth to the heauens the prospect of that most sacred place. From thence we marched to Mount <hi>Caluary,</hi> where we ascended by one and twenty steps, made partly of Wood, and partly of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labaster stone: and there I saw a hole in a rocke of a cubite deepe, beautified with thicke boords of siluer, and ingrafted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9033:56"/>
letters; in which (say they) the Crosse stood whereon our Sauiour was crucified. Leauing Mount <hi>Caluary</hi> on our left hand, we came to the Tomb of <hi>Godfrey de Bullion,</hi> who was the first proclaimed Christian King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and refused to be crowned there, saying, it was not decent, the seruants head should be crowned with gold, where the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters head had béene crowned with thornes; hauing this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription engrauen on the one side:</p>

               </p>
               <p>And ouer-gainst it, is the Tombe of King <hi>Baldwine</hi> his brother, which hath these Uerses in golden Letters curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously indented.</p>

               <p>The other things within the Church they shewed vs, were these, a marble pillar, whereunto (say they) our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour was bound, when he was whipped and scourged for sakes: the place in a low Cellar, about 14 degrées vnder the ground where the Crosse was hid by the Iewes, and found againe by S. <hi>Helen:</hi> the place where Christ was crowned with Thornes, which is reserued by the <hi>Abasines,</hi> and where the Souldiers cast lots for his Garments; the place where he was imprisoned, whiles they were making of his Crosse, and where the Crosse being laid along vpon the ground, our Sauiour was nailed fast to it; the Rocke, which (as they say) rent at his crucifying, which is more likely to be done with hammers, and set one péece a foote from another, for the slit lookes, as if it had béen cleft with wedges and béetles.</p>
               <p>And lastly they take vpon them below <hi>Caluary</hi> to shew
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9033:56"/>
where the head of <hi>Adam</hi> was buried. These and many other things are so doubtfull, that I doe not register them for truth (I meane in demonstrating the particular places) but onely relate them as I was informed.</p>

The number of those, who are tied to this austere life, are about 350 persons being <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Greekes, Armenians, Aethiopians, Iacobines,</hi> a sort of circumcised Christians, Nestorians and Chelfaines of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopotamia.</hi> The day before the resurrection, about the houre of Mid-night, the whole Sects and sorts of Christians O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientall (that were come thither in Pilgrimage, and dwelt at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) conuened together, which were about the number of 6000 men, women and children: for being sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Patriarkes in two companies, they compassed the Chappell of the holy Graue nine times; holding in their hands, burning Candles, made in the beginning pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and lamentable regréetings, but in the ending, there were touking of Kettle-drummes, sounding of horne-trumpets, and other instruments, dauncing, leaping, and running about the sepulchre, with an intolerable tumult, as if they were all mad, or distracted of their wits. Thus is the prograce of their procession performed in meere sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, wanting ciuilitie and gouernment. But the <hi>Turks</hi> haue a care of that; for in the midst of all this hurly-burly, they run amongst them with long roddes, correcting their mis-behauiour with cruell strokes. Thus are the slauish

                     <hi>An order of Knight-hood.</hi>
                  </note>Here the <hi>Guardiano</hi> offered for ten péeces of gold, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my duébe 30 Chickens said he) to make me knight of the holy Graue, or of the Order of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which I refused, knowing the condition of that detestable Oath I behooued to haue sworne; but I saw two other Pilgrimes receiue that Order of Knight-hood. The manner whereof is thus; First they binde themselues with a solemne vow, to pray (enduring life) for the <hi>Pope,</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> from whom the Friers receiue their maintenance; and also in speciall for the <hi>French</hi> King, by whose meanes they obtaine liberty of the great <hi>Turke</hi> to frequent these monumentall places. Secondly, they are sworne enemies to all Protestants, and others, who will not acknowledge the superiority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Thirdly, they must pay yearely some stipend to the order of the <hi>Franciscans.</hi> These attestations ended, the Frier putteth a gilded spurre on his right héele, causing the yong made knight to stoop down on his knées, and lay his hands on the holy Graue: after this he taketh a broad sword from vnder his gowne (being priuately carried for feare of the <hi>Turks</hi>) which is (as he said) the sword wherwith victorious <hi>Godfrey</hi> conquered <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp; giueth this new vpstart <hi>Caualiero,</hi> nine blowes vpon his right shoulder. Loe here the fashion of this Papisticall Knight-hood, which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke. After our <hi>Guardiano</hi> had ended his superstitious rites and ceremonies, vpon Easter day wee returned to the Monasterie, hauing stayed thrée dayes within that Church.</p>
               <p>Aprill the two and twentie, on Munday morning, the <hi>Padre viccario,</hi> and the aforesaid <hi>Iohn Baptista</hi> accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs, we rode abrode in the hilly Countrey of <hi>Iudea.</hi> In this dayes iourney, the places of any note wee saw were these; First, where the Daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> came forth to méete <hi>Saul,</hi> crying <hi>Saul hath slaine his thousand, and Dauid his his ten thousand.</hi> Next, the valley of <hi>Trebin,</hi>

where <hi>Dauid</hi> slew the great <hi>Goliah.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Bezura,</hi> where <hi>Absalom</hi> kild his brother <hi>Ammon</hi> for <hi>Thamars</hi> sake, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of nothing but the name is onely reserued.

Fifthly, the valley of <hi>Gibeon,</hi> where the Sun stood at the voyce of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> from his naturall course, <hi>Ioshua</hi> 10 12. Sixthly, the Toombe of <hi>Samuel,</hi> ouer the which <hi>Moores</hi> haue a <hi>Moskee</hi> erected.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Turkish Church.</hi>
                  </note> Seuenthly, the Toombes of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Captaine <hi>Iudas Macchabeus,</hi> and his children, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon are now onely the ruines of an old Chappell. And last of all, the buriall place of the Noble Family of the Kings and Quéenes of <hi>Israel,</hi> or <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> The entry whereof was so straight, that on our backes we behoued to slide downe, aboue ten paces vnder the ground, with light Candles in our hands. In that spacious place wee saw 24 Chambers hewen out of a marble rocke. Each roome hath a hanging stone doore of a great thicknesse, so artificially done by the skilfull Art of Masons, that the rarest spirit of 10000 cannot know how these doores haue béene made, so to moue as they do, being afirme rocke both below and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue; and the doores haue neither yron nor timber worke about them: but by cunning are made so to turne, and in that same place where they grew they are squared; yea, and so exquisitely done, that the most curious Carpenter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ioyne a péece of boord so neatly, as these stone doores ioyne with the Rocke. In each of these roomes are two Sepulchres, wherein I saw the bones of some of these dead Princes.</p>
               <p>Tuesday the tenth day of my being at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> we issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth of the Citie early, with our aforesaid Guides, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Westward: The first remarkeable thing wee saw, was the place (as they say) where the Crosse grew, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ suffered; being reserued by <hi>Greekes,</hi> who haue a <hi>Couent</hi> builded ouer it. That Crosse is said to haue béene of foure sundry kindes of wood, and not of one Trée, for they shewed vs but one hole wherein it grew, and so they hold it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9033:58"/>
to haue béene all of one péece of Oliue trée; but this I sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, leauing it to be searched by the pregnancy of riper iudgements then mine. About fiue miles further, we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at a village on the mountaine of <hi>Iudea</hi>; where wee saw a dis-inhabited house, in which <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the mother of S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> dwelt when <hi>Mary</hi> came vp from <hi>Galile</hi> to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute her; and néere to this we beheld (as they say) the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary wherein <hi>Zacharias</hi> was stricken dumbe till <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> was deliuered. Two miles further, on a rocky moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, we arriued at a caue, wherein (say they) S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did his penance till he was 19 yeares of age, after which time he went downe to dwell at <hi>Iordan:</hi> It is a pretty fine place hewen out of a rock, to the which we mounted by 12 steps, hauing a window cut through of a great thicknesse of firme stone, whence we had the faire prospect of a fruitfull valley: and from the mouth of this delectable <hi>Grotto</hi> gushed forth a most delicious fountaine.</p>
               <p>Returning thence, wee passed ouer an excéeding high Mountaine, from whence we saw the most part of <hi>Iudea</hi>; and to the Westward in the way of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Castle of the <hi>Prophet Elisha.</hi> Descending on the South side of the same Hill, we arriued at <hi>Philips</hi> fountaine, in which he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the Eunuch of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> standing full in the way of <hi>Gaza.</hi> Here we paid some certaine <hi>Madins</hi> vnto the <hi>Moores</hi> of the village, so did wee also for the sight of euery speciall Monument in <hi>Iudea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At night we lodged in <hi>Bethleem</hi> in a Monastery of the same <hi>Franciscans</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> after supper we went all of vs (hauing Candles) to the place where our Sauiour was borne; ouer the which there is a magnificent Church buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: But before wee came where the Crubbe had béene, wee passed certaine difficile wayes; where (being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) we saw no Monument thereof, saue onely they did demonstrate the place, which is adorned with Marble, Saphyre, and Alabaster Stones. Not farre from that they shewed vs the place ouer the which the starre stayed, that conducted the thrée Wisemen from the East. From thence
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9033:58"/>
they brought vs to a Caue without the Towne, wherein (say they) the Uirgine <hi>Mary</hi> was hid, when <hi>Herod</hi> perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Babes life (from which also being warned by the Angell) Shee, and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> fled downe into <hi>Egypt</hi> with the Childe.</p>
               <p>The earth of this Caue is white as snow, and hath this miraculous operation, that a little of it drunke in any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, to a woman that after her childe-birth is barren of milke, shall foorthwith giue aboundance: which is not onely aualieable to Christians, but also Turkish, Moorish, and Arabianish women, who will come from far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to fetch of this earth. I haue séene the nature of this dust practised, wherefore I may boldly affirme it, to haue the force of a strange vertue.</p>
               <p>Wednesday following, wee hired foure and twenty <hi>Moores,</hi> to conduct vs vnto <hi>Salomons</hi> fish ponds, which are onely thrée, being neuer a whit decayed; And to <hi>Fons Segnatus,</hi> whence commeth the water in a stone Conduit, along the Mountaines that serueth <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which worke was done by <hi>Salomon.</hi> Returning thence, and kéeping our way Southward, we passed through the Ualley of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi> where <hi>Iacob</hi> dwelt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob were interred at Hebron.</hi>
                  </note> and entred into the fields of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi>; where <hi>Iacobs</hi> sonnes kept their fathers sheepe: and not farre hence, they shewed vs a dry pit, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iosephs</hi> pit, that was at <hi>Dothan,</hi> wherein hee was put by his brethren, before they sold him to the <hi>Ismaelites.</hi> In our backe comming to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> we saw a Caue in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart of <hi>Ziph,</hi> wherein <hi>Dauid</hi> hid himselfe, when hee was persecuted by King <hi>Saul,</hi> and the field <hi>Adra,</hi> where the Angels brought the glad tydings of saluation vnto the Shepeheards.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Bethleem.</hi>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9033:59"/>
backe to the Citie, the <hi>Viccario</hi> shewed vs a little <hi>Moskee,</hi> kept by <hi>Turkes,</hi> in which (said he) was the Toombe of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell, Iacobs</hi> wife, who dyed in that place, as she was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling from <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> with her husband <hi>Iacob.</hi> The foundation also of a house, where <hi>Habacuck</hi> the Prophet dwelt; a Trée growing yet by the way side, vnder the which (say they) the Uirgin <hi>Mary</hi> was wont to repose her her selfe in trauelling. Wee saw also a naturall rocke in the high way, whereon (say they) <hi>Elias</hi> oft slept, and is not ashamed to say, that the hollow dimples of the stone, was onely made by the impression of his body: as though the tender flesh of man could leaue the print of his portraiture on a hard stone. And not farre from this, they shewed vs the place, where the Starre appeared to the Wise-men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had left <hi>Herod,</hi> to seeke for the Sauiour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Approaching Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> wee saw a quadrangled dry pond, wherein (say they) <hi>Beershaba</hi> the wife of <hi>Vrias,</hi> was washing, when <hi>Dauid</hi> looked forth at his window, and was bewitched by her beauty. Ouer against this place, on the North side of <hi>Gehinnon,</hi> we saw the ruines of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace wherein <hi>Dauid</hi> dwelt, which hath béene one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the ancient Citie, and standeth at the diuision of the valley <hi>Ennon,</hi> which compassed (as a ditch) the North part of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> euen to the valley of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> being now filled vp with fragments of old walles, and the valley of <hi>Gehinnon</hi> lying West, and East, bordering along the south side of <hi>Sion,</hi> til it ioyne also with the valley of <hi>Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> which inuironeth the East, and deualling parts of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> Néere to this demolished Tower, wee sawe the habitation of <hi>Simeon,</hi> who hauing seene the blessed <hi>Messias,</hi> said: <hi>Now Lord let thy seruant depart in peace, for mine eyes haue seene thy saluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aprill 25. and the twelfth day of my abode there, early on Thursday morning, the <hi>Guardiano,</hi> twelue Friers, and <hi>Iohn Baptista</hi> (because that was the last day of seeing any more Monuments, or was to bee seene there) accompanied vs: as wee issued at the South gate of the Citie, we came
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9033:59"/>
to a place, on the skirt of <hi>Sion,</hi> where (say they) <hi>Peter</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his denyall of Christ, wept bitterly.</p>
               <p>Descending by the side of that same Hill, we crossed the valley <hi>Gehinnon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acaldema.</hi>
                  </note> and came to <hi>Acaldema,</hi> the Potters field, or field of bloud, which is a little foure-squared roome, three parts whereof are inuironed with a naturall rocke, and the fourth square bordering with the valley, is made vp of stone worke: The top is couered, and hath thrée holes, where-through they let the dead Christians fall downe; for it is a buriall place of Pilgrimes to this day. As I looked downe, I beheld a great number of dead corpes, some whereof had white winding sheetes, &amp; newly dead, lying one aboue another in a lumpe, yeelded a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent smell, by reason they were not couered with earth, saue onely the architecture of a high vault, which maketh, that in a long time the corpes cannot putrifie and rot.</p>
               <p>Neere vnto this <hi>Campo,</hi> wee entred into a darke Caue, where (say they) the Apostles hid themselues, when Christ was taken.

Hence wee came to the <hi>Poole</hi> of <hi>Siloam;</hi> in which we washed our selues, the water whereof falleth downe through a Rocke, from the Citie aboue, running strait to the valley of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> and there we saw also the remnants of that sacked Tower of <hi>Siloam.</hi> Neere to this we saw a Fountaine, where (say they) the Uirgin <hi>Mary</hi> vsed often to wash the Babes cloathes and linnen clowts.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:9033:60"/>
From thence we crossed the Brooke <hi>Cedron</hi> (which of old ran through the valley of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> but now is dry) and came to the Toombes of <hi>Absolom</hi> and <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and the Caue wherein S. <hi>Iames</hi> was wont to hide himselfe from the persecuting <hi>Iewes.</hi> Ascending more vpward on the hill, in the way of <hi>Bythania,</hi> we saw these places; where <hi>Iudas</hi> hanged himselfe, the withered fig-trée grew, and the house of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper.</p>
               <p>Arriuing at <hi>Bythania,</hi> we saw a Castle and Toombe of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> on whom Christ shewed a miracle, in raising him from the graue, after hee had béene foure daies dead: Not farre thence in the same Uillage, we saw the decaied house where <hi>Martha,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> inhabited, and the stone whereon Christ sate (say they) when hee said to <hi>Martha, Mary hath chosen the better part.</hi> Returning thence, wée left <hi>Bethphage</hi> on our left hand, and about mid-day, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on the top of Mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mount Oliuet.</hi>
                  </note> where we dined, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded in our sights. From this place we had the full pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> For the Citie standing vpon the edge of a hill, cannot bee seene all at one sight, saue on this Mountaine which is thrée times higher then Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> These are the Monuments shewen vs vpon the Mount of <hi>Oliues:</hi> First, the print of the left foote of our Sauiour, in an immoueable stone, which he made, when hee ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to heauen; The <hi>Guardiano</hi> told vs further, that the right footes print was taken away by <hi>Turkes,</hi> and detained by them in the Temple of <hi>Salomon;</hi> But who can thinke our Sauiour trode so hard at his Ascension, as to haue left the impression of his feet behind him. Next the place where hee foretold the iudgement to come, and the signes, and the wonders, should bee séene in the heauens before that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day. Thirdly, the place where the <hi>Symbolum Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum</hi> was made, which is a fine chamber vnder the ground, like a Church, hauing twelue pillars to support it. Fourthly, where Christ taught his Disciples the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> and where hee fell in an agony, when hee sweate bloud and water. Fiftly, where <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:9033:60"/>
slept, whiles our Sauiour prayed, and returned so oft to awake them, and also below that, where the other Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were left. Sixthly, the Garden of <hi>Gethsemane,</hi> where Christ vsed commonly to pray, in the which place he was apprehended by the officers of the high Priests, and was also where <hi>Iudas</hi> kissed him, and the Sergants fell back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the ground. Seuenthly, they shewed vs a stone marked with the head, feete, asd elbowes of Iesus, in their throwing of him downe, when as they bound him, after he was taken, aad euer since (say they) haue these prints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there. And lastly, at the foote of Mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> in the valley of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> we descended by a paire of staires of 43 steps, and 6 paces large, in a faire Church builded vnder the ground, where (say they) the monument of the assumption of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is, whom they thinke was borne in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> dwelt at <hi>Bethleem</hi> and <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and died vpon Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> I saw also there, the Sepulchres of <hi>Ioseph</hi> her husband, <hi>Ioachim</hi> her father, and of <hi>Anna</hi> her mother. The valley of <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> is two miles of length, lying South and North.</p>
               <p>Lo, I haue plainely described, the whole Monuments I saw within, and about <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> by the order of these 12 seuerall daies: the like heretofore, was neuer by any Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime, so liuely manifested. But as I said in the beginning of my description, so say I now also at the conclusion; some of these things are ridiculous, some of manifest vntruths, some also doubtfull, and others somewhat more credible, and of apparant truth. The recapitulation whereof, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by me vsed, as I was informed by <hi>Gaudentius Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantus</hi> the <hi>Padre Guardiano, Laurenzo Antonio il Vicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> and the Trouchman <hi>Iohn Baptista.</hi>

               <p>After this wandring vp and downe <hi>Iudea,</hi> I stayed in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> thrée daies, both reposing my selfe, and also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring my necessaries for a new voyage; being determined to go downe to <hi>Egypt,</hi> with a Carauan of <hi>Grand Cayro.</hi> In the last night of my staying at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was at the holy Graue, I remembring that bounden duty, and louing

zeale, which I owe vnto my natiue Prince, whom I in all humility (next and immediate to Christ Iesus) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to be the supreme Head, and Gouernour, of the true Christian and Catholique Church; by the remembrance of this obligation I say, I caused one <hi>Elias Bethleete,</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian inhabitour of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> to ingraue on the flesh of my right arme, <hi>The Neuer-conquered Crowne of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Aprill 29. and the 16. day of my staying there, I, and other ten <hi>Frankes,</hi> made couenant with the Carauan of 900 persons, bound for <hi>Egypt,</hi> for ninetéene <hi>Piasters,</hi> the man to furnish vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Camels, or Dromidories to ride on, &amp; to exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

vs of all <hi>Caffars</hi> and tributes, in our voyage to <hi>Cayro:</hi> By which condition we had the aduantage of two commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities: first, it freed vs from the wrongs and extortions of sauage Rascals by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way: Next, we preuented all cosening and deceitfull dealing that might from the Captaine haue procéeded, whose fidelity in him, or such like, is seldom suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to strangers approued.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this iourney greatly was I anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the company of these <hi>Franke</hi> Pilgrimes, which I found in <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but alas! no sooner was their society déere and acceptable to me, but as soone by death, was I robd of all the ten, such was the will of the Almighty: some whereof dyed in the Desarts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The death of ten Pilgrimes.</hi>
                  </note> and the rest in <hi>Grand Cayro,</hi> leauing mee, euen as I was before, a solitary wanderer amongst rauenous Wolues, the particular rehearsing of which, would but aggrauate my sorrow, and renew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my by-past melancholy. Not that I stood in néed of any help, to stir vp the alacrity of my mind, which of it selfe was innated by nature, and fortified in maturity, by propagating diuers aspiring, and alacrious conceits; but my excessiue griefe was, because they daily pretended my good, whereby I was infinitely obliged to their kind, and vndeserued courtesies. For where such proffer of loue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the disponers, it bréedeth alwaies in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers a kind of dutifull obligation; and as it was in some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable fashion extended towards me, so the remembring of it, shall adde a greater grace, and reputation to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the memory of their vntimely death. Neither will I relie so much vpon my owne worthinesse, as to thinke that benefite of the procrastination of my life, was by any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of mine deserued; but that God so much the more might shew his incomprehensible greatnesse, by that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in my naturall imbecility. For all the beginnings of man are deriued from God, whose ends are either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or disanulled by his determination: and nothing we possesse is properly our owne, or gotten by our owne power, but giuen vs onely through his munificence. And
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9033:62"/>
all the spaces of earth, which our feete tread ouer, the light we enioy, and the excellent faculties we are indued withall; or what we can do, say, or thinke, is onely raised, guided, and distributed by Gods impenetrable counsell, will, and prouidence; which although the pride of our wicked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth not yeeld the true attribution thereunto, yet the powerfull working of the counsell of God is such, that in it selfe, it proueth an eternall wisedome, and confoundeth the foolishnesse of the world.</p>
               <p>Betwéene <hi>Gaza</hi> in <hi>Palestina,</hi> and <hi>Saleak</hi> on the frontiers of <hi>Gozan,</hi> I had no sight of any remarkeable obiect: for in all that six daies iourney, we trauelled still in the night, to shun the intollerable heat of the Sun by day; wherefore it with-held from our eyes, the visible shew of sandy and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren desarts, whiles our bodies felt the painefull fruite of that mountainous ground, in the silent night: yet not so silent, but we saw often a concurrance of naked <hi>Arabs,</hi> partly liuing in haire-cloth tents,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arabs.</hi>
                  </note> and partly in holes and Caues, who gaue vs diuers assaults, and sometimes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted our forward going, notwithstanding of that refuge we had of the Castles in that waste wildernesse, which are maintained by the Soldan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for the succour of Trauellours.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Saleak</hi> we encountred with a great company, and 1200 Camels and Dromidores, which were laden with the wares of <hi>Damascus,</hi> and going to <hi>Cayro.</hi> A Dromidore, and Camell, differ much in quality, but not in quantity, being of one height, bredth, and length; saue onely their heads, and feet, which are proportionated alike, and the difference of quality is such, that the Dromidorie hath a hard-reaching trot, and will ride aboue sixty miles in the day, if that his Rider can endure the paine. But the Camell is of the contrary disposition: for he hath a most slow and lazy pace, remouing the one foote from the other, as though he were weighing his feete in a ballance; neyther can he go faster, although he would: But he is a great deale more tractable then the other; for when
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9033:62"/>
his maister loadeth him, hee falleth downe on his knées to the ground, and then riseth againe with his burthen, which will be a maruellous great weight.</p>
               <p>The red sea, which we left to the Westward of vs, is not red, as many suppose, but is the very colour of other seas: The reason for which it hath béene called <hi>Mare rubrum,</hi> is onely because of the bankes, rushes, sands, and bushes that grow by the shore side, which are naturally red. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue called it so, in respect of the brookes which <hi>Moses</hi> turned to red bloud, who mis-construing the true sense, took seas for riuers.</p>
               <p>Arriuing at <hi>Cayro,</hi> I lodged in the house of a <hi>French</hi> Consull, and on the second day, I went with two <hi>French</hi> Merchants, to view the thrée <hi>Pyramides,</hi> surnamed, <hi>The Worlds Wonders</hi>; which are distant from <hi>Grand Cayro,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout foure leagues, standing néere to the bankes of <hi>Nylus.</hi> In proportion they are quadrangled, growing smaller and smaller towards the top, and builded with great and large stones, the most part whereof are fiue foot broad, and nine foot long. All the Historians that euer wrot of these won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, haue not so amply recited their admirable greatnesse, as the experience of the beholder may testifie their excessiue hugenesse and height. The first we approched vnto, is big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, whose height amounteth to (according to the compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our Dragoman) 1092 foote. And at the bottome euery square of the foure faces is of bredth 450 foote. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing outwardly mounted by degrées, with great paine to the top, I was maruellously rauished to sée such a square plat-forme, all of one péece of stone, which couereth the head; each side wherof extendeth to 17 foot of my measure. It is yet a great maruell to me, by what engine they could bring it vp so safe to such a height. Truely, the more I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held this strange worke, the more I was stricken in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: for before we ascended, the top of this <hi>Pyramide</hi> did séeme so sharpe as a pointed Diamond; but when we were mounted thereon, we found it so large, that in my opinion, it would haue contained a hundred men. The middle <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:9033:63"/>
did looke a farre off somewhat higher then the other two: but when we came to the roote thereof, we found it not so: for the stone-worke is a great deale lower, but the aduancement of the height is only because of a high ground wheron it standeth. It is of the same fashion of the first, but hath no degrées to ascend vpon: neither hath the third <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramide</hi> any at all; being by antiquity of time, all worne and demolished, yet an admirable worke, to behold such great masses, and (as it were) erected mountaines all of fine marble. The reason why they were first founded, is by many ancient Authors so diuersly coniectured, that I will not meddle therewith.</p>
               <p>Betwéene the biggest <hi>Pyramide</hi> and <hi>Nylus,</hi> I saw a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losse,</hi> or head of an Idoll, of a wonderfull greatnesse; being all of one marble stone, erected on a round rocke: It is of height (not reckoning the Columns) aboue 815 foote, and of circuit 68. <hi>Pliny</hi> gaue it the name <hi>Sphingo,</hi> and repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much more of the bignesse, largenesse, and length of it. But howsoeuer he erred in his description, yet I resolue my selfe it is of so great a quantity, that the like thereof (being one intire péece) the world affoordeth not; and may be reckoned amongst the rarest wonders. Some say, that anciently it was an Oracle, the which so soone as the Sun arose, would giue an answere to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> of any thing by them demanded.</p>
               <p>In our way as we returned, our Dragoman shewed vs (on the banke of <hi>Nylus</hi>) where a <hi>Crocodile</hi> was killed by the ingenious policie of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Marchant, being licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated by the <hi>Soldan.</hi> The match whereof for bignesse and length, was neuer seene in that riuer, whose body was 22 foote, and in compasse of the shoulders 8 foot. This cruell beast had deuoured aboue 46 men and women, besides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures: and in his belly were found more then 60 rings of gold and siluer, which the miserable bodies had worne in their noses, through their cheeks and vnder lips: for such is the custome of the people to weare their iewels. And if the baser sort cannot attaine to such like, then they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:9033:63"/>
counterfeit their betters with rings of brasse and lead, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring also on their armes and ankles, broade bands of Iron continually.</p>
               <p>The garden wherein the onely and true <hi>Balsamo</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is inclosed with a high wall, and daily guarded by <hi>Turkes,</hi> who hardly will suffer any Christian to enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, much lesse the <hi>Iewes:</hi> for not long agoe they were the cause, that almost this Balme was brought to confusion. The tree it selfe is but of three foot height, which keepeth euermore the coloor greene, hauing a broad thrée poynted leafe, and twice in the yeare it being incised, yeeldeth a red water, which is the naturall <hi>Balsamo.</hi> Not farre hence, there is a place caled <hi>Mommeis,</hi> lying in a sandy desart, where are innumerable Caues cut forth of a rock, wherunto the corps of the most men in <hi>Cayro,</hi> are carried and interred, which dead bodies remaine alwayes vnputrified, neither yeeld they any stinking smell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grand Cayro</hi> is an admirable great Citie, and larger of bounds then <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but not so populous, neither so wel builded: It was of old caled <hi>Memphis,</hi> &amp; was the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest place that <hi>Vlysses</hi> in his trauels visited, so well memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by <hi>Homer;</hi> yet a voyage now of no such estimation, as that Princely Poet accounted it: for his trauels are not comparable to some of these dayes wherein we liue: It is situate in a pleasant plaine, and in the heart of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distant from <hi>Nylus</hi> about an <hi>English</hi> mile.

The principal gates are these, <hi>Babeh Mamstek,</hi> which is toward the Wildernesse of the red sea: <hi>Bebzavillah,</hi> toward <hi>Nylus,</hi> and <hi>Babell Eutuch,</hi> toward the fields. The stréetes are narrow, being all of them almost couered, and the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:9033:64"/>
foundation of their buildings is raised vpon two Stages height, to kéepe the people from the parching heate. The <hi>Bazar,</hi> or exchange beginneth at the gate of <hi>Mamstek,</hi> and endeth at a place called <hi>Babesh.</hi> At the corners of chiefe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there are horses to be hired, that for a small matter, a man may ride where so he will, to view this spacious spred Citie, and change as many horses as he listeth, hauing the maisters which owe them, to conuoy them.</p>
               <p>There is a great commerce here with all Nations vnder the heauens: For by their concurring thither, it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully peopled with infinite numbers. Such a multitude, and the extreme heate, is the cause why the pest is euermore in it; insomuch, that at some certaine times 10000 persons haue dyed thereof in one day.</p>

                  <hi>Alexandria</hi> is the second Port in all Turkie: It was of old a most renowned Citie, and was built by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, but now is greatly decayed, as may appeare by the huge ruines therein: It hath two Hauens, the one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is strongly fortified with two Castles, which defend both it selfe, and also <hi>Porto vechio</hi>: The fieldes about the Towne are sandy, which ingender an infectious aire, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the moneth of August, and is the reason why stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers fall into bloudy fluxes, and other heauy sicknesses. In my staying here, I was aduised by a Christian Consull, to keepe my stomacke hot, to abstaine from eating of fruit, and

to liue soberly with a temperate diet. The rule of which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement I stroue diligently to obserue: so did I also in all my trauels, prosecute the like course of a small dyet, and was often too small against my will; by the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (praised be God) I fell neuer sicke till my returne into <hi>France.</hi>
