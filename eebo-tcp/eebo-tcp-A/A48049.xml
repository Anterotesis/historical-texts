         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON Thurſday laſt arrived here the Heer <hi>Schravanmore</hi> Maiſtre de Camp General, who, next day, laid out the Ground for the Camp, which is cloſe by the Town on the South-ſide.</p>
            <p>On Saturday laſt arrived here the Count <hi>de Solmes,</hi> about Two in the Afternoon, and preſently after there followed a Battalion of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot Guards, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Encamped.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> arrived here on Saturday about Ten a Clock at Night, and was received by the Mayor and Aldermen in their Scarlet, and all their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, attended by the ſeveral Companies with their Flags carried before them. The Train'd Bands of this City met his Excellency at the Bars, and conducted him to his Lodgings at Alderman <hi>Mannerings,</hi> who came along with him from <hi>London.</hi> This day his Excellency, attended by the Count <hi>de Solmes,</hi> Lord <hi>Brandon Gerrard,</hi> the Governor of the City, and a great many others are gone to view the Ships which lie at <hi>Liverpool, High-Lake,</hi> and <hi>Neſſen,</hi> for the Tranſportation of the Forces for <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Thurſday laſt arrived here, with much hazard and difficulty, ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers in a ſmall Wherry , which left <hi>Dublin</hi> the Monday before. I can add but little to what you may have known already; only that at <hi>Dublin,</hi> they ſay that very conſiderable Numbers of Proteſtants, with their Families, having ſetled themſelves there, in hopes of being more ſafe, and leſs Expoſed to the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Soldiers, than in the Countrey where the Danger threatens them on all hands : They have had the Misfortune to be obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and go home to their Houſes and Habitations in the Countrey, by Vertue of a Proclamation from the Late King, Commanding them, on ſevere Penalties, to repair to them; which is look'd upon by them, as an Expoſing of them to the mercy of the Rabble. They ſay that the Late King is ſo Exaſperatcd at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment His Forces met with at <hi>London-Derry,</hi> That He is now reſolved to have the laſt Puſh for't; And, to that Effect, has ſent down a great quantity of Ladders, with Orders to ſcale the Walls, and take the Town that way if poſſible.</p>
            <p>This day, and to morrow, 8000 Men are to Encamp here, which, with the 3 or 4000 at <hi>Whitehaven,</hi> are to be commanded by the Count <hi>de Solmes,</hi> and, with all Expedition, to be immediately ſhipt off for <hi>Loughfoyle,</hi> to join the Forces there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Major General <hi>Kirk.</hi> When theſe are gone, they ſay that 18 or 20000 Men more come in their room, who are to Encamp alſo; theſe are to be commanded by General <hi>Schomberg</hi> himſelf, but whither and when they are to go, is not yet certainly known.</p>
