            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Soveraine Lord of thoſe Brittiſh hils, as is your Majeſtie, he would not doubt but to make them a ſecond <hi>Indies,</hi> and affirming with deepe proteſtations, that the greateſt riches in thoſe Mountaines lay in their loweſt levels, which I finde to be true by laborious experiment, in thoſe five mountaines. For by this way of working, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving through the depth of Rocks, we are not only freed from the danger and deluge of waters, but alſo have diſcovered an increaſe of rich veines in quantity and qualitie, ſome containing twentie pound, ſome fifteene, ſome tenne, and ſome ſix in Silver, in the Tunne of Lead upon the great <hi>Teſt,</hi> which are anſwerable to moſt of the Mines, of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>; moreover we find that by mixing and ſmelting theſe ſeverall veines together, the one proves a good additament to the other, and becomes thereby a meanes to advance the <hi>Mines</hi> Royall, and in them the good of your kingdome and Subjects.</p>
            <p>We have many gracious teſtimonies how much the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is pleaſed with theſe our innocent labours; by his continuall preſervation, of the workemen amidſt their hourely dangers, eſpecially in one accident, which lately befell, upon occaſion of driving an Addit into one of thoſe mountaines called <hi>Tallybont,</hi> but becauſe I was no eye-witneſſe of it, I humbly deſire your majeſties peruſall of the narration thereof (as I received it) being then in London, from a miniſter reſident Preacher to the <hi>Minerall</hi> men, hereunto annexed.</p>

day and night for the Drayning of the water, which formerly in the time of Cuſtomer <hi>Smith,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Hugh Middleton</hi> in their working of the <hi>Mines-royal</hi> was never uſed, they only working upon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Earth, the workes being drowned with water before they could ſinke to the beſt of the veyne, both for quantity and quality, and ſo the charge made to exceed the benefit, which danger is pevented by the aforeſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Addits,</hi> and the <hi>Royall Mines</hi> become more hopefull, eſpecially by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his Majeſties mint, for the ſpeedy pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all thoſe that are imployed in the ſaid works, and <hi>Mr. Buſhels</hi> own invention to ſave Wood, by reducing the Ore into Lead, and Silver, with Turffe and Sea-cole Charked, which happy inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had it not been found out, the works muſt needs have been left unwrought, the Country not able to have ſupplyed neceſſary Fewell.

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vffer my congratulations of your late ſucceſſe at <hi>Tallibont,</hi> to be admitted amongſt the reſt who have repreſented the ſame to your imagination: not ſo much for the hiſtoricall report of it, as for ſpeculation on it; So it becomes my quality, for the reſt are intereſſed, I a looker on Your <hi>Addit</hi> or great drift of <hi>Talybont,</hi> after above <hi>200</hi> fathome in foure yeers driving to come at the chiefe ſhaft of the old drown'd worke of <hi>38</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome deep, being pearced by the water of the old worke, <hi>Iune 27.</hi> at midnight there befell two memorable accidents. The foure workmen about one in the night (as their manner was) withdrew to take Tobaco within ten fathome of the <hi>Addits</hi> mouth, leſt in the forefield it ſhould damp the ayre, which was conveyed to them by your leaden pipes with bellows. Their ſmoakie banquet was not yet at an end, when they heard a mighty and fearefull noiſe, which ſome of them ſaid was thunder. But old <hi>Bartholmew Clocker</hi> (a well experienced <hi>Miner)</hi> although he left the worke without any ſuſpition of ſo neere an approach, reſolved ſuddenly, the worke is holed, come let us away. No ſooner had they gotten the free ayre, but out guſheth the torrent of water with an incredible fury, ſuch a breach it made in the ſolid Rocke, that it aroſe a full yards height at the <hi>Addits</hi> mouth and drove away above <hi>100</hi> Tun
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48096:17"/>
of the rockie deads, affrighting the people of <hi>Talybont,</hi> who heard the noiſe and felt the water in their houſes. I doe not remember that I was ever more aſtoniſh'd at the prodigiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of any ſpectacle, to ſee what perdition was threatned to the poore men, and they ſo to eſcape it. About foure houres after, the violence of water being paſt, <hi>Fiſher</hi> one other of the <hi>Miners</hi> went in with more curioſity than wit, to ſee what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it had wrought there: and being ſome ſixty fathome in creeping very low, his candle enkindled a vapour, which came on him with three or foure flaſhes, and he ſuddenly returning had his haire burnt off, and his cloathes ſcorched, in which concluſion it gave a crack like the report of a peece, and in a fierce guſt of wind blew out the Candles of three more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming after him. To omit the Philoſophicall inquiſition of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cauſes, I account his preſervation in as high a degree of wonder as the firſt. Thus happy are you here when leaſt you think of it, for I finde the ſubterranean ſpirits, the ſuppoſed guardians of concealed treaſure, as officious for you as if they were in pay with you. But in a ſtile more proper to my pen, Behold Sir, how deare you are to providence, which for your ſake hath vouchſafed to digreſſe into a miracle, and ſuch a one as is able to convert the moſt Sophiſticall <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> whence your piety will inferre, that the gracious Authour of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable bounty, expects from you ſome gratefull ſervice, as high above ordinary (according to mortall capacity) as this favour hath been extraordinary We are all deepely in the ſame engagement, and have learned by this experiment, that theſe <hi>Addits</hi> or approaches (for thats the ſence of the name of old deluge works) are attempts of deſperate hazzard. Me thinks theſe Mountaines are as ſo many pregnant wombs, and now in labour call for your fortunate hands to deliver them, to the honour of your Royall Maſter, and perpetuated glory of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48096:17"/>What ſhould you doubt in an imployment ſo ſerenely ſmil'd upon, by the higheſt both of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>? You uſe no enchantment or magneticall Rod to diſcover the veines; your only magicke, is an ingenuous conjecture of probabilities, with a cheerfull and indefatigable induſtry, which hath hitherto ſucceeded beyond expectation of moſt, and (peradventure) the deſires of ſome. But who (as <hi>Agricola</hi> makes the queſtion) that is not of a nature impoyſon'd with envy, and malitiouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. do R.M.</note> can beare unfriendly thoughts to him, whoſe ſubſtance is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner preſented by the hand of God.</p>
            <p>I know it would be a motive of very feeble operation to tell you how Princes and States have raiſed their Crownes, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into ſuch abyſſeſſes as theſe; with ſome of whom wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton antiquity hath been pleaſed to ſport her ſelfe, and to play upon the ſimplicity of many, as <hi>Midas, Gyges</hi> the <hi>Argonauts, Croeſus,</hi> with the States of <hi>Athens,</hi> over whoſe Minerals was that renowned <hi>Thucydides</hi> a <hi>Praefect,</hi> as you are here. Of which <hi>Pliny</hi> delivers what may be worthy your attention, when he ſaies of them, that they were in a fruitleſſe ſoyle, and on the hils, (as theſe with us.) And whereſoever one veine was found, it was not far from another; among which was one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bebelo,</hi> that afforded him <hi>300.</hi> pound weight of Silver a day.</p>
            <p>Theſe were then the veines which conveyed the blood and ſpirit of life through all the limmes of his victorious Hoſt. And have you not here our Britaines <hi>Aſturia</hi> before you? Who knowes whether it may not yeeld a <hi>Bebelo?</hi> at leaſt a <hi>Sne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> or <hi>Anneberg,</hi> who hath heretofore dream't of a Mine at <hi>Comſomloch,</hi> or of the happy lot you lately drew from the Mountaines of <hi>Keginian, Talybont,</hi> the <hi>Darren, Broom-Floyd</hi> and <hi>Cum-mervin?</hi> What did the outſide of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you mere then the countenances of their neighbours? But
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48096:18"/>
the complaint of learned <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Jurdan</hi> may here take place, that much ſilver was loſt, for want of taking it out of Lead-Oares. For whereas thoſe Oares which are rich in ſilver are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hard of fuſion our minerall men neglect thoſe Oares. No doubt many are concealed by reaſon they are Mines Royall.</p>
            <p>Where had been the Woods and Forreſts yet undeſtroyed on theſe bald-headed Promontories that might ſuffice had you not taught the earth to afford you all, and the worthleſſe valley, to meete the barren hill, by ſending in fewell, to give forme to the matter: ſo that here is a rich bequeſt you leave to poſterity, I meane your Eternizing the works, by preventing the exceſſe of water, and defect of fire.
