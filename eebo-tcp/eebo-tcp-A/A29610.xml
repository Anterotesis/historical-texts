            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Tranſlator to the READER.</head>
            <p>THE Author of this Diſcourſe was <hi>Francis Broccard;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Secretary to <hi>Pope CLEMENT</hi> the Eighth. Who, by reaſon of that Employment, was well acquainted with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of the Pope and the Popiſh Party, and thereby enabled to Acquaint the World with what Counſels they had then on Foot, for the Ruin of all Proteſtants, and Eſtabliſhing their own Tyranny, and Bloudy Intereſt.</p>
            <p>The Villanous Wickedneſs of theſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian Deſigns, we may well preſume, was one great Inducement to make him forſake that Bloudy Religion, and turn Proteſtant, For though the Deſigns were, as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, palliated under Specious Pretences, yet to him who ſaw the bottom of thoſe Curſed Contrivances; and by what ways, and for what ends they were to be brought about; they did appear in their true Shape. Which, (notwithstanding the prejudice of his Education and Intereſt) made him deteſt and abhor ſuch Principles. For according to our Saviours own Direction, (<hi>By their Works you ſhall know them</hi>) he might be well aſſured that theſe Counſels were not the Dictates of <hi>the Prince of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time when this Diſcourſe was Written is manifeſt from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it to be in the Year <hi>1603.</hi> Being later than the Year <hi>1602.</hi> (which he mentions <hi>Num. 21.</hi> As a time paſt) and while <hi>CLEMENT</hi> the Eighth was yet Living, as is ſaid in the Preamble, (who died <hi>Feb.</hi> the <hi>21. 1604.</hi> Engliſh Stile,) and was the ſame Year in which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that Attempt on <hi>Geneva</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as is ſaid at <hi>Num. 37.</hi> (which began with an intended Surpriſe early on Sunday Morning <hi>Dec. 22. 1602.</hi> and ended with a Treaty <hi>July 21.</hi> New Stile, <hi>1603.</hi> as <hi>Thuanus</hi> tells us. <hi>Lib. 29.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though he do not particularly deſcribe the <hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> (which was then contriving though not perfectly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and was to be executed on our <hi>Nov. 5. 1605.</hi>) Becauſe his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Intent was to ſet forth the Particular Deſigns on <hi>Germany:</hi> Omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the particulars on <hi>France, England,</hi> and other Countries, as he tells at <hi>Num. 24,</hi> yet he there tells us at <hi>Num. 23, 24.</hi> that out of the Engliſh Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries were then ſent forth into <hi>England</hi> Emiſſaries in great Numbers to do Miſchief and work Diſturbance here: And at <hi>Num. 40.</hi> that a great
<pb facs="tcp:56514:3"/>
Navy was then preparing either againſt <hi>Holland or England</hi> (as there ſhould be occaſion) and that there were in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> (as well as the Netherlands) great Multitudes addicted to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, who did but wait the opportunity of ſuch an Invaſion, being ready on all occaſions to ſpend thier Bloud for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal the Deſign was which (under the Name of the Holy League) was intended againſt the whole Proteſtant Party (and <hi>England,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt;) and how Subtily, Sedulouſly, and Maliciouſly it was carried on with all the Artifice, Falſhood and Treachery imaginable, is evident by the Diſcovery made by this Convert who had been an Actor in it, and Secretary to the Pope.</p>
            <p>And 'tis from ſuch only that we can hope to have a particular Account of ſuch dark Deſigns: When God by his Providence convincing them of the wickedneſs of theſe Helliſh Plots, make thoſe who had been Actors in them to betray their own Counſels.</p>
            <p>And that the Deſigns here Diſcovered were not Forgeries of his own Invention, but really intended, is but too manifest from the Hiſtory of thoſe Times; where we find many of them actually attempted, and more (in likelyhood) would have been, if that Pope (who died the Year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) had lived a little longer.</p>
            <p>And that the ſame Deſigns have been ever ſince purſued as to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, (but varied in Particulars as Occaſions and Opportunities have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired) and are ſo at this day; is very evident by the Bloudy Warrs and Maſſacres ever ſince, in <hi>Germany</hi> and many other Protestant Countries in purſuant of thoſe Deſigns. And particularly in our late Civil-Warrs in <hi>England</hi> fomented by Jeſuitical Counſels, though executed by Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, the Bloudy Maſſacres in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the preſent Popiſh Deſign, for killing our King, ſubverting our Government, murdering his People, deſtroying the Proteſtant Religion, and introducing Popery amongſt us. Which God hath in like manner Diſcovered by perſons ingaged in it, as he did then by the Author of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord grant that our eyes may at length be opened to diſcern theſe Depths of Satan, and Antichriſtian Policy; and our Hearts inlarged to Praiſe him who hath hitherto watched over us and Preſerved us: and to wait on him by a Faithful Dependance, Sincere Repentance, and diligent Endeavours to Prevent the Miſchiefs which they Deſigne.</hi>

            <head>FRANCIS BROCCARD (Sometime Secretary to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth) HIS ALARM (After his Converſion to the True Faith of Chriſt) To all Chriſtian Princes (Favourers of the Proteſtant Religion) againſt the Pope and Popiſh Plots and Conſpiracies, by him diſcovered.</head>
            <p>THE moſt gracious God having marvelouſly brought me forth from the diſmal Darkneſs of Popery, to the clear Light of the Goſpel, and the pure acknowledgment of his Word; I might deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be accounted the moſt ungrateful of all men living, if I ſhould not devote and ſet apart the reſt of my life to the glory of his holy Name, and the advantage of his Goſpel. For moſt unworthy I were and impious, if him from whom I enjoy life and ſalvation, I ſhould not vouchſafe to ſerve and obey in the beſt manner I can.</p>
            <p>And ſince for the preſent I am able to do no more, I ſee no better way and opportunity of bringing glory to God, doing good to his Church, and teſtifying my true affection to the Proteſtant Religion, than by detecting and making known the counſels which the Papiſts, the ſworn enemies of Chriſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56514:4"/>
and his Goſpel, are contriving and endeavouring to bring to paſs againſt all that have a kindneſs for the Proteſtant Cauſe; which in my opinion are ſuch as ought not to be diſſembled or concealed, nor can be without great offence to his Divine Majeſty, and great miſchief to the true Religion: For the whole Popiſh Party have entred into a moſt grievous and pernicious Conſpiracy againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and have unanimouſly united and bound themſelves by oath in a moſt ſtrict and wicked League againſt all the Profeſſors of it; inſomuch that without doubt they will be able to do much miſchief to the Proteſtant Cauſe, if thoſe againſt whom theſe counſels are firſt intended to be put in practice do not take timely warning for their own defence. I know very well that the Proteſtant Cauſe is a good Cauſe; and that God will be aſſiſtant to them, to defeat the aſſaults which Satan and Antichriſt make upon them: yet ought not theſe things to be deſpiſed, nor they to ſleep ſecurely on ſuch perſwaſions, but ought to believe that it is a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God that ſtirs up any to make diſcovery thereof to thoſe whoſe life and ſafety is in hazard, that they may the better ſecure themſelves from thoſe enemies who thus aſſault them.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore that all Proteſtant Princes, and all Profeſſors of the true Religion, may have warning to avoid theſe Conſpiracies of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all Popiſh Princes; I will through the help of God clearly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly declare and make known the moſt wicked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies, and deviliſh Arts and Machinations of the Popiſh Confederates againſt the Proteſtant Religion. And what I ſhall relate, are not ſlight and trivial ſtories picked up from the diſcourſe of ordinary perſons, or idle Monkiſh dreams; but what I have heard my ſelf from the Pope's own mouth, and from the Cardinals themſelves, and which have come to my knowledge from the authentick Writings
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56514:4"/>
of Popiſh Princes under their own hands and ſeals.</p>
            <p>Nor am I frighted with the wrath and indignation which I am like to ſuſtain from Kings and Potent Princes incenſed by this diſcovery: For I ought to be more afraid of God, who is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul, than of thoſe who have power only to kill or torment a frail and mortal body. Be they inraged and full of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and (if God ſo permit) fall fierce upon me, I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I do acknowledge that it is from God that I am here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto moved and incited; and ſhall, notwithſtanding their rage, undauntedly make known their treacherous Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies.</p>
            <p>Hear therefore all ye that bear a good will to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Cauſe, and take good heed to what you hear.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>CLEMENT</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> (who is at this time Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>) having by ſtrange Artifice obliged to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well-nigh all the Princes in Europe, not willing to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo fair an opportunity to eſtabliſh his tyrannical Power, doth endeavour with might and main to carry on and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the <hi>holy League</hi> (as they call it) of all Popiſh Kings and Princes, againſt the Proteſtant Intereſt; and which as to the greateſt part is already concluded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Emperour, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Archdukes of <hi>Auſtria, Albert</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi>; the Dukes of <hi>Bavaria, Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi>; and almoſt all the reſt of the Popiſh Princes, except the <hi>French</hi> King, and the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>) have already conſented and ſubſcribed the League; and the Pope moves every ſtone to engage the reſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with them, and is in hope to effect it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This League conſiſts of divers heads: The way of proceeding, the Time, the Preparation, the Proportion which each of them is to contribute to this holy War, they are plotting and contriving againſt the Proteſtants. And on this they are in all points agreed, that all theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56514:5"/>
Confederates ſhall with joynt force endeavour the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Proteſtant Religion by all the means they can.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Emperour about a year ago was earneſt with the Pope for money and Aid againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> whereby he might be able either to repreſs his inſolence, or at laſt bring him to honourable terms of Peace, or ſome laſting Truce; promiſing that ſo ſoon as he ſhall have diſpatched his buſineſs with the <hi>Turk,</hi> he will employ all his ſtrength and forces for the Pope againſt the Proteſtants, or (as they call them) the Hereticks.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Pope is very much inclined to a Peace with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and for this reaſon would not laſt year give ear to the Embaſſadors of the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, who preſſed him to a general Confederacy againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi> For the Pope reckons that the Proteſtants are a greater hinderance to his affected Tyranny, than is the <hi>Turk.</hi> And doth oft complain that a long War hath now been managed for forty years together againſt the <hi>Turk</hi> to no advantage; whereas in the ſame time with far leſs expence the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might have recovered her Authority in <hi>Europe.</hi> And he doth therefore endeavour to perſwade the <hi>Turk</hi> to ſeek a Peace, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the Emperour to let him have it on reaſonable terms.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the year 1601. Cardinal <hi>Dietrichſtein,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Clomute</hi> came in great haſte from <hi>Prague</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and brought Letters to the Pope from the Emperour, promiſing the Pope to put in execution by force of Arms the ſentence which the Emperour had given in behalf of the Pope againſt the Proteſtants in the Cauſe concerning goods Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick, which he commanded to be in all places reſtored to the uſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And from thence the Pope conceived hopes of ſome occaſion to be offered of beginning ſome broils and commotions in <hi>Germany</hi>; and it was agreed between them that the greateſt part of thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56514:5"/>
goods ſhould be diſtributed amongſt thoſe who ſhould be moſt active in that War.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſame Cardinal did at the ſame time promiſe (as he ſaid) in the Emperours name, that in the mean time (while things were getting in readineſs for an open War) the Emperour and the Princes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> would wholly turn out all Proteſtants within their hereditary Dominions, as in <hi>Auſtria, Tyrole, Croatia, Carinthia, Stiria,</hi> and the like places; and that they would in like manner fall upon them in <hi>Moravia, Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi>; firſt without noiſe if it may be, and then by force of Arms, eſpecially of thoſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which come back from the War of <hi>Hungary</hi>; (For in ſuch caſes they do not think fit to truſt the <hi>German</hi> ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) and that he had already granted to them the ſpoiling and pillaging thoſe people in caſe they return not to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The Popes Legate now reſident at <hi>Prague</hi> did write ſome months ago, that all theſe things are in great part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſpatched; that the Proteſtants were caſt out of thoſe Provinces, and the Jeſuites by the Emperors permiſſion poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of moſt of the Proteſtant Churches and places, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Carinthia,</hi> but likewiſe in <hi>Sileſia</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia:</hi> And that the <hi>French</hi> ſouldiers under the command of one Count <hi>Benegrave</hi> had already burnt ſome Villages in the borders of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and that they intended this year to make more progreſs therein, eſpecially by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Italians,</hi> which the Pope ſends into <hi>Hungary,</hi> chiefly for this end, to ſpoil and deſtroy the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Emperour hath alſo promiſed that he will not henceforth confer any chief Offices, whether in Civil or Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Affairs, on any that are Hereticks, or do in any wiſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them: And moreover, that all leſſer Offices now enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Proteſtants, ſhall be taken from them, unleſs within a time limited they return to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56514:6"/>
this means the Popes Legate informed, that daily many of the Nobility in <hi>Germany</hi> do renounce the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and turn to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; and that on ſuch are frequently beſtowed good places and Offices, that others may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by incouraged to make the like revolt. For they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from the experience of all times, that by ambition, and covetouſneſs of riches and honours, many have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, who 'tis thought would otherwiſe have been very conſtant.</p>
            <p n="9">9. By this promiſe the Pope having conceived great hopes, hath taken the confidence to preſs the Emperour to depoſe and put out ſome of the Proteſtant Nobility by him named, from publick Offices and places, Civil and Military, which then they enjoyed. And among theſe by name Count <hi>Coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, Henry Matthew, a Turre, a Bohemian,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Offer-Kirchen,</hi> the Barons of <hi>Pothan,</hi> of <hi>Ogliſto,</hi> of <hi>Dermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorf,</hi> and the like; and deſir'd that he would put in their places ſome of the Popiſh Nobility, and ſuch as had revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; affirming that things would never ſucced well againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> if the War were managed by Proteſtants: And that he would never endure, nor was it for the dignity of a Catholick Emperour, that in a Chriſtian Army againſt Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels they ſhould be ſuffered to have <hi>Lutheran</hi> Sermons; which he therefore requir'd to be wholly ſuppreſt; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that otherwiſe he would never endure that they ſhould henceforth have any leavies of ſouldiers in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> to be ſent thither; leſt theſe Provinces which are yet free ſhould become infected with Hereſie.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Duke of <hi>Mercury</hi> gives this advice, that divers of thoſe who are his adherents, may be promoted to Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary employments: And himſelf hath written to Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandine,</hi> to perſwade the Pope, that this the Emperor may do very eaſily. The Pope believing this to be a good means for the removing Sermons out of the Army, and for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56514:6"/>
preparing a way to many other things for the ruine of the Proteſtants, hath very earneſtly deſir'd the ſame thing of the Emperour; from whom yet he hath received no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, than that he muſt wait a convenient time for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and ſome better opportunity; and in the mean time he will take care to do it by little and little.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The ſame Duke of <hi>Mercury</hi> about two years ſince, having conference with the Confederates to this purpoſe, had reſolved that in winter time (when the War in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> could not be carried on) he would carefully take a view of all <hi>Germany,</hi> and (as if he were minding ſomewhat elſe) obſerve and take notice of the places, Situations, Rivers, Straights, Borders, Paſſes, Avenues, Forts and Strengths of the Proteſtant Princes and Proteſtant Cities, that he might the better contrive waies to ſurprize and circumvent them, in the War deſign'd. And I my ſelf have ſeen at <hi>Rome</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Sueſſe</hi> the delineations of ſome places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Proteſtants drawn by <hi>Petrine</hi> a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician to the ſaid Duke. And while he was yet living, I heard the ſame was to be done by the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> who ſeeks for the place of the Duke of <hi>Mercury</hi> in the War of <hi>Hungary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. When the Pope perceived that he could not preſently obtain from the Emperor to put out the aforeſaid Proteſtant Nobility; he did by a new device deſire of the Emperour that he would at leaſt employ a ſmaller number of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant forces, leaſt by this means they might be trained up in military skill to the prejudice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and come to have the better of the Catholicks. That it were much better that the Emperour ſhould raiſe none but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, Souldiers, and require pay and contributions for them from the Proteſtants: For by this means the Proteſtants in a ſhort time would be at once diſarm'd and impoveriſh'd. That many of the things deſign'd might then be begun and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56514:7"/>
attempted for the diſtruction of the Proteſtants, which, as things now ſtand, could not be thought off: And the better to perſwade the Emperour hereunto, he accuſed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of holding correſpondence with the <hi>Turk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. The Pope hath ſome Councelours in the Emperours Court who ſtick very cloſe to him, who for large penſions and great hopes, wherewith he feeds them, do incline the Emperour to comply with the Popes directions; and by their means he is made acquainted not only with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours actions, but with his very propenſions and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The Pope preſſeth for an election of a King of the <hi>Romans</hi>; fearing leaſt if the Emperour ſhould die before a Succeſſor were appointed, ſome might be choſen in his place, who either is not a Papiſt, or at leaſt more moderate toward the Proteſtants. And for this reaſon he doth preſs the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to it; and both to him and to the Eccleſiaſtick Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors he doth earneſtly recommend <hi>Albertus</hi>; whom in many reſpects he deſires to have preferr'd before the reſt; for this conſideration eſpecially, becauſe he thinks that by this means the Popiſh Religion will come to be reſtored in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> and moreover becauſe the King of <hi>Spain</hi> doth make offer and promiſe to imploy all his ſtrength and forces againſt the <hi>Turk</hi> and the Hereticks, in caſe they choſe <hi>Albertus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. The King of <hi>Spains</hi> Embaſſadour reſident at <hi>Rome</hi> produced letters from that Kings Embaſſadour at <hi>Prague,</hi> informing him that one of the Proteſtant Electors was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to <hi>Albertus</hi>; and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great things of him, both as to the buſineſs of the election, and the affairs of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. The Emperour ſeems more inclined to <hi>Matthias,</hi> whom yet the Pope ſeems to reject by reaſon of ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions raiſed of him in matter of religion; which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56514:7"/>
to remove by the perſecutions in <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> in which places he is very ſevere againſt the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants: hoping thereby to reconcile himſelf to the Pope and to the Eccleſiaſtick Electors, but in vain. For the Pope and Eccleſiaſticks do not ſo much look at matter of Religion, as Politick Intereſts; and would have <hi>Albertus,</hi> not becauſe he is more religious, but becauſe they think he will be the more potent, and will leſs regard the Proteſtant Princes.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Becauſe of this Election it is, that many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants are at preſent deferr'd, which they would forthwith put in execution if they could, without them obtain an Election for the houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> For the Emperour is afraid if he ſhould uſe open hoſtility againſt the Proteſtants, the Proteſtant Princes would be averſe to him and his family; and for this cauſe he doth ſooth and make much of many of them at preſent, whom (if he had obtained his end) he would certainly deſpiſe.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> hath alſo writ letters to Cardinal St. <hi>George</hi> wherein he intercedes for his houſe of <hi>Bavaria</hi>; affirming that he hath the votes of ſome of the Electors inclinable to his Family. And makes offers to the Pope both in his own and in his Fathers name, of all their forces and aſſiſtance for the exaltations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="19">19. At the ſame time came privately to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s name, an Embaſſadour called <hi>Somburg,</hi> one of the four Knights of the Empire, who on the behalf of the ſaid Duke treated of divers things with the Pope and Cardinals concerning the manner of proceeding and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an opportunity for beginning of that holy War. He preſſed alſo the buſineſs of the Election; and to obtain the Popes favour toward him, he gave great hopes that by the Colloque at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which was then under conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome of the Proteſtant Princes might be brough over to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56514:8"/>
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. Which notwithſtanding, the Pope could not be induced to grant that it ſhould be held with his conſent, but had given command to <hi>Claudius Aquaviva,</hi> that things being hazardous it ſhould be broken off.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The Citizens of <hi>Ausburg</hi> (among whom were <hi>Mark Velſarus,</hi> and <hi>George Fucherus</hi>) were inſtant with the Pope to obtain from the Emperour that the Proteſtant Miniſters might be expelled and caſt out of the City of <hi>Ausburg</hi>; which at that time (they ſaid) might eaſily be done, for that the chief inhabitants and the Magiſtrates of the place were Popiſh, and the Neighbouring Princes very zealous for the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. The cauſe was managed in their name by Cardinal <hi>Palavicini,</hi> and by the ſaid <hi>Fucherus,</hi> who the laſt year came to <hi>Rome</hi> on purpoſe. And with him was one Dr. <hi>Brandanus</hi> who ſuggeſted to them by what means it might moſt eaſily be brought to paſs. And it was thus far brought about that the Emperour at the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, conſented to the ejection of thoſe Paſtors in caſe it could be done without commotion and ſedition; and did openly declare that he deſir'd nothing more than that it might ſo be done in all the Cities of the Empire.</p>
            <p n="21">21. In a Congregation held at <hi>Rome</hi> beginning in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1602. It was there decreed, with the Emperours concurrence thereunto, that there ſhould be <hi>Jeſuits</hi> plac'd and maintain'd in all Cities of the Empire, by whoſe means the way might be prepar'd for the deſigned perſecution. For they hoped that by the Artifices of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> they might ſo far prevail as to get many to favour them in thoſe Cities who were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Proteſtants: by whoſe aſſiſtance they hoped with more eaſe to ſuppreſs the Proteſtants. The Queſtion then was only concerning their maintenance. For the <hi>Germane</hi> Biſhops complained of the ſmalneſs of their Revenue. And the Pope at length concluded to maintain them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the charge of the treaſury of the Church till ſome other courſe ſhould be found out.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56514:8"/>22. Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Prince of <hi>Stiria,</hi> and <hi>Carin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> did lately make complaint to the Pope, that whereas he had expelled of his Provinces all the Proteſtants; many of them notwithſtanding continued yet to live there by the indulgence of the Eccleſiaſtick Princes who held ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his Provinces; as for inſtance, the Biſhop of <hi>Bomberg</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who received and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them: wherefore he prayed the Pope ſtraitly to charge and to compel them utterly to caſt thoſe out, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he threatned to uſe his Soveraign Authority, which he pretends to have in thoſe places, and to caſt them out by an armed force, even whether thoſe Biſhops would or not; with which the Pope was well pleaſed.</p>
            <p n="23">23. While things are in preparation for an open War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants, the Popiſh Party are contriving how to make attempts on the Proteſtant Intereſt; and have this year ſent into the Countries of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> a great number of Spies and Seducers, by whoſe means ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all ſorts are ſeduced, and wrought over to their party; who are then maintained in Proteſtant Cities at the Popes charge, to be ſerviceable unto him in what he is deſigning. Some of theſe Emiſſaries about a month ago, went through <hi>Lipſia</hi> in a diſguiſe, in their paſſage into <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> where they hope to neſtle, as ſhall afterward be ſhew'd. If the actions of theſe Emiſſaries were well obſerved, it would not be hard to take ſome of them, and by their notes and memorials theſe and many other things might be diſcovered.</p>
            <p n="24">24. A few years ſince the Pope erected here in <hi>Rome</hi> two Congregations or Senates; whereof one is called <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ad propagationem Fidei,</hi> (The Congregation for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of the Faith) the other, <hi>Congregatio ſacri Foederis,</hi> (The Congregation of the holy League.) In each of which are nine Cardinals, and as many Councellers, who meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether once every week; and there they act, meditate and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56514:9"/>
ſtudy nothing but how to contrive, propoſe, and conſider all means of propagating the Popiſh Tyranny, and how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for the perſecution, and the butchering of the Proteſtants; and how to lay hold of all advantages of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning that curſed War deſigned againſt them. From this Congregation are ſent forth thoſe Spies and Emiſſaries who every year in great numbers are imployed to make broils in Proteſtant Countries, and ſeduce the Profeſſors of the true Religion. And theſe two Congregations are the ſhops where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they form all their inſtruments, and contrive all their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations, Treacheries, Plots, Villanies, and all miſchiefs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants. Theſe Congregations hold particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar correſpondence with the Jeſuites, and thoſe bred up in the Colledges or Seminaries of the <hi>German<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Moravians</hi>; from whence as out of a <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe come forth thoſe Traiters and Seducers, whom (as we ſaid) they ſend out into all Proteſtant Countries. For thoſe of all others are judged the fitteſt for ſubtle frauds and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. For by reaſon of the languages they underſtand, their faſhions, kindred and relations which they have in all Proteſtant Countries, they can eaſily inſinuate and get into the Courts and acquaintance of Princes and perſons of quality: and if they find any pliable and eaſie to be wrought upon, they make it their buſineſs by little and little, with hopes and promiſes, as in the name of the Emperour or Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> of honours, dignities, and great things, to allure, ſeduce and work upon them, and many times with great ſucceſs; as we may ſee in thoſe Lords and Nobles whom they have lately perverted, as Baron <hi>Terriſle</hi> the younger, <hi>Cicendorff,</hi> the Knight <hi>Audechan</hi> the younger, Baron <hi>Dermenſdorff,</hi> Baron <hi>Thona,</hi> and many others in <hi>Germany,</hi> I omit what they have done in <hi>France, England,</hi> and other Countries.</p>
            <p n="25">25. There is a great number of them every day flocking to <hi>Rome,</hi> to renounce the true Faith of Chriſt; but much
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56514:9"/>
greater of thoſe who do privately at home abjure it, and are by theſe Emiſſaries inſtructed in the Popiſh Idolatry, and are maintained in the Country and Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> that live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covertly and under diſguiſe amongſt Proteſtants, they may have the better opportunity of promoting the Popiſh Intereſt; and do it effectually: For by their means it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known to <hi>Rome,</hi> what are the Proteſtant deſigns, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and inclinations.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Part of theſe Apoſtates who flock to <hi>Rome,</hi> and are of the moſt part of mean condition, are entertained in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Court it ſelf, and there maintained to be ſerviceable againſt the Proteſtants who reſort to <hi>Rome</hi>; and for many other purpoſes, of which we ſhall ſpeak by and by. Others of them are diſperſed in ſeveral parts and Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> to make diſcovery and obſervation, whether any of the Proteſtant Princes or Nobility come into <hi>Italy</hi>; which whenſoever they can diſcover (which is very eaſy to do by the Jeſuites education wherein they are exactly inſtructed) they preſently accuſe and give notice of them either to the Pope, or to the Inquiſitors according to the quality of the perſons.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Divers of theſe Spies at <hi>Rome</hi> I have known my ſelf, when about two years ſince I was converſant there: and to the end that thoſe Proteſtants who ſhall thither reſort, may beware of them, I will mention them by name. The firſt I ſhall name is <hi>John Hierom Fendri,</hi> who lets lodgings at the Sign of the White Lion; he with two of his Sons who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Germane</hi> tongue very well, receive from the Pope an annual penſion to betray the <hi>Germanes</hi> who come thither. The next is one <hi>John Scherver,</hi> at the Sign of the Black Eagle, near the Bridge of St. <hi>Angelo.</hi> The third is a <hi>Dutch</hi> Taylor in the Street called <hi>Via Julia.</hi> Theſe three by reaſon of the employments they exerciſe, run up and down to ſeveral Inns and Lodgings, as the Bear, the Bull, the Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where <hi>Germanes</hi> uſe to lodge, and by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56514:10"/>
of their Language, and the Trades they uſe, make uſe of that opportunity to inſinuate themſelves into acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Gentlemen themſelves, or with their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and by little and little, by one ſign or other, eaſily diſcover of what Religion, and what Country they are; and do then preſently betray them without diſtinction, whatever their condition be, whether Princes, or of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour quality. For all theſe and many more receive penſions from the Pope to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="28">28. There are beſides theſe ſome other Apoſtates, men of learning, who do the ſame but in a more grave and ſubtle manner; for theſe come not but to great Perſons, whom the meanneſs of thoſe others is not fit to converſe with. Of theſe is one <hi>Gaſper Schoppius</hi> of <hi>Bamberg</hi>; Dr. <hi>Fabor</hi> a Phyſician (at the <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt) of <hi>France<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Juſtus Calvin</hi> of <hi>Heidleburg; John Wouren</hi> of <hi>Amburg</hi>; Dr. <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Wormes; Arnold Martin</hi> of <hi>Swilzerland; Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen della Favergia</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi>; a Son in Law of <hi>Anthony Calvin; Roboll</hi> a Frenchman who heretofore Secretary to the Duke of <hi>Bullione,</hi> and many others of the ſame ſtamp from almoſt all parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> Theſe as ſoon as they underſtand that any <hi>Germane</hi> is come, of ſome name or with a handſom retinue, preſently reſort to him, and (as out of meer officiouſneſs in reſpect to their Country or Nation) proffer their ſervice and aſſiſtance, and offer to ſhew them what things remarkable are to be ſeen, and then by degrees begin to diſcourſe with them of the affairs of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſometimes diſcourſe of the Popiſh Ceremonies and manners, as if themſelves were not in all things ſo well ſatisfied in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; that under this pretence they may make diſcovery where they be halting. And of theſe wicked Apoſtates they muſt have a great care who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to <hi>Rome</hi>; for few there are who can eſcape their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty; and many perſons of mean condition are by their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56514:10"/>
means, and by the informations they give, caſt into priſon, and forc'd to renounce Chriſt. With Princes and Perſons of quality, the Pope for many reaſons thinks fit to deal more mildly; but yet for theſe alſo, he laies ſnares, and uſeth his endeavour either to ſeduce them, or privately to make them away.</p>
            <p n="29">29. By means of theſe Apoſtates and Spies, the Pope hath been made acquainted with the entry and abode of all great perſons who of late years have been in <hi>Italy</hi>; and from the day of their entring into <hi>Italy</hi> they have had ſome on the Popes behalf who have followed them from place to place, obſerved their actions and motions; not preſently to ſeize or commit them (for they have learned by experience, that theſe methods do not advantage the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church) but to make diſcovery of their propenſions and inclinations, that they may the better know how to intice and ſeduce them.</p>
            <p n="30">30. The Pope or the Inquiſitors ſo ſoon as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of any Proteſtant Prince or perſon of quality that is come, they preſently diſpatch ſome perſon of good condition to attend them, and to ſhew them all civilities, and beſtow upon them ſome ſmall preſents, and to entertain them with very civil language, and incourage them not to be afraid. Mean while by his Emiſſaries he neglects not to make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on them as to their Religion, and doth endeavour by all the civil waies, he can, either to ſeduce them from the Proteſtant Religion, or at leaſt to ſend them out of <hi>Italy</hi> with better opinions of the Popes proceedings, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion. Witneſs hereof are the Princes of <hi>Wirten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> of <hi>Anhall,</hi> of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> of <hi>Newburg</hi> and of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony</hi>; who have been tempted by ſuch preſents, flatteries and artifices. And ſome of their Councellours and Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors vigorouſly aſſaulted and tempted with large promiſes of honours and dignities, to bring over and pervert their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56514:11"/>
but thoſe of meaner condition are betray'd to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors, whom by long impriſonments and cruel torments they force to renounce Chriſt; or if they perſiſt conſtant in the truth, then by fire and Sword and cruel torments they kill and deſtroy them.</p>
            <p n="31">31. By the coming and abode of the foreſaid Princes in <hi>Italy,</hi> they came to underſtand much of the Proteſtant Princes differenees among themſelves, and of the State of Religion in <hi>Germany,</hi> and of the peoples affections toward their Princes. The Pope likewiſe by this means was made acquainted with the ſtrength and counſels of divers of them, which aford him opportunity of raiſing and foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcords and jealouſies amongſt the Proteſtant Princes, and contriving many things for the ruine of the Proteſtant Cauſe, which before that time he was not able to do. And he hopes, as he hath often bragg'd, by the Proteſtants own Arms to propagate and eſtabliſh his Tyranny. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Proteſtant Princes take good heed to themſelves: and if they be wiſe, not confide too much in Popiſh Princes; and forbear coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> and eſpecially to <hi>Rome</hi>; and when at any time they come there, let them take heed what perſons they have with them, and whom they put confidence in.</p>
            <p n="32">32. The Pope not long ſince had been informed that a part of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> was to deſcend to a Son of the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and thereupon he ſo far prevailed with the Emperour and the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> that they three are joyntly to endeavour, that it come not to the Houſe of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> but to the King of <hi>Poland</hi>; and they have lately ſent their Agents the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> into thoſe parts, to make way for it. For their deſign is to begin the broils in thoſe parts; and for this end the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Legate is yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at <hi>Rome</hi> in order thereunto.</p>
            <p n="33">33. The aforeſaid Confederates had endeavoured by their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56514:11"/>
Agents and Emiſſaries to ſuborn the Counts of <hi>Friſland,</hi> and draw them into a certain negotiation for delivering up the Town of <hi>Emden</hi> to the Emperour; that it might not come into the hands of the States, and that the Papiſts might on that ſide have a fair paſſage, and a gate open to fall upon the Proteſtants, and create diſturbance to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in thoſe parts; and did pretend to have come to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of certainty therein, and that they had drawn over thoſe Counts to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt, and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and to that end did place and maintain ſome <hi>Jeſuites</hi> about them to inſtruct them and retain them in their duty and devotion to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> But thoſe affairs, through the vigilance of the States, not ſucceeding as they deſired, they are now contriving ſome other expedients.</p>
            <p n="34">34. The Pope is by all means endeavouring to make a breach betwixt the Princes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Wurtenburg</hi> upon occaſion of the alienating and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fee of the Princedom of <hi>Wurtenburg</hi> by the Emperor; which they would not have to be thought valid, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the reſt of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family; thoſe eſpecially who were then under age, whom he ſtirs up and incites to demand a reſtitution; and for that end to take Arms againſt the Duke of <hi>Wurtenburg,</hi> hoping that if once a War be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in <hi>Germany</hi> againſt the Proteſtants, he ſhall be able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his deſign, and reſtore the Popiſh Idolatry amongſt them.</p>
            <p n="35">35. The Popiſh Argitatours, and the Fathers of the two forementioned Congregations in <hi>Rome,</hi> are contriving likewiſe to make a breach between the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the ſaid Duke of <hi>Wurtenburg</hi>; upon occaſion of ſome poſſeſſions which have now for divers years been held by the Duke of <hi>Wurtenburg,</hi> whereof they are endeavouring (by means of ſome of his Councellours whom they have corrupted and other ill diſpoſed perſons) to perſwade the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> to demand Reſtitution. And hope by this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56514:12"/>
means, together with that of their difference in Religion, they may engage them in a War, or at leaſt foment diſcords between them, and ſo alienate and divide them that they may not joyn in a common defence when either of them ſhall be aſſaulted, nor be aſſiſtant one to the other. I would therefore adviſe thoſe Princes to be very circumſpect, and not readily give ear to ſuch ſowers of diſſenſions between Proteſtants. They have endeavoured the like againſt the Marquiſate of <hi>Bade</hi> and <hi>Durlac,</hi> one of whom ſeem'd rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to comply with the Papiſts, and was treating with the Biſhops of <hi>Spire</hi> and <hi>Conſtance</hi> about reſtoring the Popiſh Religion in caſe he obtain that government; which he hopes to do becauſe of the Marquiſs of <hi>Durlac</hi> being ſo ill in health and (they ſay) cannot live long; and in ſuch caſe this Popiſh Succeſſor by the aſſiſtance of the Pope and the foreſaid Confederates promiſes, the reſtoring of Popiſh Idolatry, to which they will in no wiſe be wanting; for they leave nothing unattempted, and loſe no opportunity of raiſing commotions in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="36">36. By the inſtigation of Arch-Duke <hi>Albert,</hi> and by the Popes Authority, they are endeavouring to incite the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and all the States of the Empire againſt the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces of the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> pretending that they have done, and daily do poſſeſs divers places and dominions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Empire. And that they will in a ſhort time become formidable to all Kings and Princes, unleſs ſome ſtop be put to them, before their Empire grow too large. And ſo far hath this craft, and the ſubtle inſinuations of the Papiſts prevailed, that under theſe ſpecious pretences for the Empire, they have wrought upon ſome of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes, who being deceived and ſeduced, and by this their deviliſh ſubtilty ſeem inclinable to the deſtruction &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of theſe Provinces, not diſcerning that this is a moſt ſubtle crafty device and Stratagem of Antichriſt, to ſet Proteſtant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56514:12"/>
againſt Proteſtant, and if poſſible to deſtroy the Proteſtant party by the Proteſtants own weapons. Theſe are (believe me) the venemous counſells and villainous contrivances of that curſed League and Confederacy, and thoſe wicked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of the Pope above mentioned; palliated with this pretence that they are in the behalf of the Empire, and for the good thereof, to which they do in no wiſe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Theſe counſels of ſuppreſſing the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Empire than for it; as any man may eaſily diſcern, if he compare the preſent government with that of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> tyrany. And moreover who is ſo ſtupid and void of all ſenſe, as not to know how little kindneſs the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> ever had, or yet have toward the Empire, of whoſe greatneſs and Majeſty they were ever envious and profeſſed Enemies. And therefore even the Popiſh Princes themſelves ought alwaies to be ſuſpicious of their Councels when the good of the Empire is concerned.</p>
            <p n="37">37. From the ſame fountain (or Abyſs rather) of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Confederacies againſt the Proteſtants, proceed theſe Wars and Invaſions which have this laſt year been attempted againſt thoſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Strasburg,</hi> which are but the praeludes or forerunners of the intended general perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: deſigning by theſe attempts to make an Eſſay of the Proteſtants Councels and Forces; and make obſervation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Proteſtants will conjoin their forces to defend their common cauſe; or each one ſtand ſeverally upon their own guard. I gave notice fifteen months ago by letters and truſty friends both to thoſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> and to thoſe of <hi>Strasburg</hi> of this deſign of the Popiſh Confederates to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and ſurpriſe them unawars, whether or no they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, I cannot tell. But ſure I am that meerly out of Zeal to the Proteſtant Religion I gave them this Warning of what I knew to be certainly true; and they by experience and the event have found it ſo to be. And ſo it will be as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56514:13"/>
to thoſe things now write and ſincerely declare to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes. For God is my witneſs that the things I now diſcover are what I know to be true and already agreed upon. Nor do I this for any other deſign than out of Zeal to the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p n="38">38. It was not without a deep and ſubtle deſign that they did at one and the ſame time fall upon <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Strasburg</hi>; for by aſſalting both theſe at once, they hoped ſo to amuſe and employ the Proteſtants of <hi>Switzerland</hi> by the war againſt <hi>Geneva,</hi> that they ſhould not be at leiſure to give aſſiſtance to thoſe of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> as they did nine years ago. And again by the War begun againſt <hi>Strasburg,</hi> they hoped ſo to keep the Proteſtant Princes in fear and ſuſpence, as not to ſuffer any Souldiers to be raiſed in their Dominions to aſſiſt the States of <hi>Holland</hi> againſt <hi>Albertus.</hi> They had received intelligence that ſome of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> intended to give aſſiſtance to thoſe <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which they hoped to prevent by this War of <hi>Strasburg</hi> Nor had they failed in this conjecture had their deſign ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt <hi>Geneva.</hi> And though they were therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, yet are they not thereby diſmayed, or give it over. For they have determined to attempt all waies of kindling a flame in <hi>Germany.</hi> And herein the forreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are alſo very intent; as hoping to extinguiſh the flames which are yet raging in their own Countries, by kindling a fire elſewhere; and that by this means thoſe of their own Countries who are men of turbulent and ſeditious Spirits might have where to employ their fury, and ſatisfy their bloody minds. This artifice hath at all times given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and fewel to many wars throughout the World. It hath long been made uſe of by the Popes of <hi>Italy</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> who have now for many years ſate quiet at home, and been ſpectatours of the Wars in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> which they for theſe ends
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56514:13"/>
did at firſt ſtir up and kindle, and do at this day foment and cheriſh. The noble <hi>Germans</hi> of former ages were not wont to wait for others to bring War home to them and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault them in their own Country; but to go out and meet it as far as <hi>Italy, France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> That Heroick vertue is not yet extinguiſh'd in the <hi>Germans</hi> breaſt, and that divine Proweſs whereby they have conquered great part of the World. Let them but rouſe it up and exerciſe that valiant courage and undaunted Proweſs againſt theſe effeminate and faint-hearted Prieſtlings; who though at preſent incouraged by our ſloth, they grow ſierce and inſolent, will not dare in <hi>Italy</hi> to look the <hi>Germans</hi> in the face, whom they could not in former daies look upon but with terrour. Let the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> look over the noble acts of their Anceſtours recorded with glory in the writers of all ages; and learn at length to be true <hi>Germans</hi>; that is, ſuppreſſors of tyranny, aſſertors of liberty, and Maſters of the world, and not ſuffer the Popes Cowl with a few faint-hearted and lazy Popelings inſolently to inſult over the valiant and maſculine <hi>Germane</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p n="39">39. There was a conſtant ſame, and it was reported by the <hi>French</hi> themſelves, that the attempt on <hi>Geneva</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was with the privity and conſent of the King of <hi>France.</hi> For by as agreement made two years ſince by Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandine</hi> between the <hi>French</hi> King and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> it was covenanted and agreed, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> might, without offence of the King, or viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Peace, aſſault <hi>Geneva.</hi> But with this condition that when it is taken it ſhall either be demoliſhed, or elſe ſo divided between them, that the King ſhall have that part of it which is on that ſide of the <hi>Roſne</hi> towards <hi>France</hi>; and the Duke that of the other ſide toward <hi>Savoy.</hi> At the ſame time, in that treaty with <hi>Aldobrandine,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> made promiſe of many things, concerning receiving the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> concerning the Confederacy or Holy League above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and reſtoring of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi>; which thought they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56514:14"/>
have hitherto been deferr'd, yet Cardinal <hi>Doſutus</hi> and the Kings Embaſſadour have promiſed the Pope that the King in due time will perform them all, and proteſted that he is very well addicted to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that he hath not been able yet to make good his promiſe, becauſe of the League he was to confirm with the Helvetians, and ſome Proteſtant Princes; who he fears would be highly offended, if he ſhould put thoſe things in preſent execution; but he will do it in a ſhort time. But (to ſpeak what I think) I am of this opinion, as to the King of <hi>France</hi> (which alſo I have of ten heard from the mouth of the preſent Pope) to wit, that the King plays the Politician, and is firm to neither part.</p>
            <p n="40">40. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> under pretence of blocking up <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> hath prepared a great Fleet in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Sea, but means to go forth with it out of the <hi>Streights,</hi> either againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> or againſt the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>; and in expectation of this Navy it is that <hi>Albertus</hi> lies ſo long before <hi>Oſtend.</hi> Of this his intention there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evidences, one of them is very apparent, that this Navy is for the moſt part furniſhed with very great Ships, which are very proper for the Ocean, but not ſo fit for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Africk</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>; for which Gallies are more convenient, and ſuch only <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth made uſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But there are more certain arguments which I have obſerved from their Councels. Let them therefore take heed whom it concerns. Nor will it be long ere they make this expedition, if they can but ſecure themſelves of a ſafe Port on the Coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> which they are endeavouring with all their power. For this, they ſay, is the only obſtacle to their buſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs, that they have not any Ports or Harbours large enough to receive a numerous Fleet; which if they could once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they boaſt that they ſhould have forces innumerable and inſuperable both by Land and Sea. And truly there are in <hi>Holland, Zeland, Friſland, England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> very great numbers who adhere to the Popiſh and Spaniſh Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56514:14"/>
and who daily ſollicit the Popiſh Princes to take arms againſt thoſe Countries, and promiſe them all their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance if once they arive there. And within theſe few weeks the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> who in thoſe Countries live in diſguiſe, and ſay <hi>Maſſes,</hi> have written to their General <hi>Claudius, Aquavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> that the number of Papiſts fit to bear arms within the Provinces of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> only, are thirty thouſand and more; and they are ſo zealous therein, that they are ready on any occaſion to ſpend their blood for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. Their letters were read in the <hi>Congregation</hi> (as they call it) <hi>for the Propagation of the Faith:</hi> and with ſo great applauſe, that they were all of one opinion, that in caſe a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſhould there arrive, it would be eaſie to raiſe a very great party; and they conceive hopes of very great ſucceſs for the Catholicks in thoſe parts, if once <hi>Albertus</hi>'s affairs ſucceed well. And in truth the States ought with greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to reſtrain the petulancy of theſe rebellious Spirits, that they grow not worſe by too much indulgence.</p>
            <p n="41">41. The Eccleſiaſticks in <hi>Germany</hi> (that is to ſay) the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Collogne</hi> have given information to the Pope, that there are up and down in <hi>Germany</hi> divers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federaices amongſt the Proteſtant Princes, and frequent meetings to that purpoſe; partly for maintaining <hi>Calviniſm</hi> againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and partly for maintaining <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraniſm</hi> againſt the <hi>Calviniſts</hi>; and that they are at this time at greater diſcord amongſt themſelves, more incenſed and more inraged againſt one another than ever they were, all of them againſt the Papiſts. And added moreover many particulars concerning their Factions in ſtate affairs, and other emulations and hatreds of each Religion againſt the other, and of differences among themſelves, and how the people ſtand affectd toward their Princes, from whence they might preſage and were in hopes, that in a ſhort time the Proteſtants will fall ſoul upon one another, and by that means the Popiſh Religion be greatly promoted, The afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56514:15"/>
Confederates on this occaſion ſpare neither for pains not coſt to cheriſh and foment theſe diſcords, contentions and animoſities amongſt the Proteſtants; and (which is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and much to be lamented) have ſo prevailed through their ſubtilty and our ſloth, that for promoting and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe diſcords they make advantange of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity (ſhall I ſay) or malignity of Proteſtant Princes and Councellors. And many there are at this time through the Craft of the Papiſts, and Artifices of ſome Courtiers, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, as to think verily that the Popiſh Monarchs and Princes bear no ill will to the Proteſtant Intereſt, and (which is more,) that the Pope himſelf favours this Religion, and is deſirous of Peace with us: And being deluded with this vain perſwaſion, and beſotted (as it were) with this deadly lethargy, they who ſhould be moſt watchful over the Lords ſlock are fallen a ſleep,</p>
            <p>I beſeech therefore, moſt Illuſtrious Princes, all of you, who have renounced the Popiſh Idolatry, and imbraced the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, whether by the name of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> that laying aſide all diſcords and animoſities (if any be) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your ſelves, you would all agree in one ſolemn <hi>League</hi> (and truly ſacred) amongſt your ſelves againſt your profeſſed and ſworn enemies; &amp; would believe that the whole Popiſh party, whoever they be; are your worſt enemies; and if you give not credit to my bare narration; obſerve (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you) their actions and motions; for you will eaſily diſcern that it is all true which I have here written. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have not conſulted my own advantage, but what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the ſafety of your ſelves, and the whole Proteſtant Intereſt. I have omitted many particulars that I might not be over tedious; which yet if I ſhall find you to make a due uſe as you ought of what is now written, I will not fail to add for the common Intereſt of the Proteſtant cauſe. In the mean time be watchful, take heed to your ſelves, and give thanks to God.</p>
