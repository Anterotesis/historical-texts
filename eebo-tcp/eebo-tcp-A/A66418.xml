            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore since what you were entertained with (at the late general meeting of our Country-men) was of that kind, it is the less fit to appear in the World. But since you are pleased to desire

it, it's not easie for me to deny it, and that to you, to whom our Country owes so much for the reviving of a useful Society out of a Charitable design; and the Society owes so much for the prudent managemment of it. To the good order of which, if this Sermon did any way contribute (as you were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to think) or may for the future recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Duties therein insisted upon to others, I shall neither repent, of First Preaching, nor now of Publishing it at your Request.</p>

            <head>A SERMON Preached at the <hi>Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonshire FEAST,</hi> November 8. 1683.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>PSALM LXXXVII. 6.</bibl>
                  <p>The Lord shall count when he writeth up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that this Man was born there.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p n="1">1. THere is in all Mankind so violent an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation toward mutual Society, that were they set loose from one another, and each man might be supposed to stand alone, they would be so far from a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of War, and at the first sight contending for Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and Propriety (as some have vainly conceived) that they would soon strive to associate, and contrive ways to bring them to each others acquaintance and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But how forcible soever this propension in Mankind is, yet it being antecedent to humane choice, and common to bad men as well as good, it hath consequently in it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing truly Glorious and Praise-worthy; nor is any man Wise, Vertuous, or Great, for being thus inclin'd, or for acting as he is thus naturally inclined.</p>
            <p>Natural dispositions are useful and necessary principles of action, by exciting the powers of the Soul, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us forward to act, and to act in such a way, and to such an end as may be for their gratification: but the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to such inclinations, being a following of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62709:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in which all men also are alike; there must be somewhat else that must distinguish one man from another, the Wise from the Foolish, the Vicious from the Vertuous herein, and that is the prescribing such Laws and Measures to such inclinations; the directing them to such Objects and Occasions, as may serve to wise and good purposes, and which we our selves, or others, or both, may be the better for.</p>
            <p>This is the design of our present meeting, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving that Society (which for about Thirty Years hath been discontinued) that we who are of the same Nation, and born in the same Division of it, may be by this means the more united among our selves, and be rendred more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being useful and helpful to others. A Design truly Generous and Honourable, and in a sincere Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which, we shall bring Honour to our selves; to our Society, to our Country, to our Church, and to God: And shall all of us be in a Capacity of having the Text applied in the benefits of it to us; that <hi>the Lord shall count when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Psalm</hi> hath both a literal and mystical sence; In the latter it respected the State of the Church under the Gospel (often Prophetically represented under the name of <hi>Sion</hi>) when all Nations should be brought into the Communion of it; and <hi>Rahab and Babylon shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that know God,</hi> Vers. 4. In the former or mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal sence it respected the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous state it should be restored to after the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity; and notwithstanding the desolation it thereby sustained. According to which Prophetical Scheme, we may suppose the City and Temple destroyed and ruin'd, the Country wasted and depopulated, the people dispersed and Captivated, and the Church of God in a seemingly forlorn condition: And yet as deplorable as it was, better things were not to be despaired of, for the Country should be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62709:4"/>
again Inhabited; the City and Temple rebuilt; Religion and the Church restored; and the Nation flourish to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and conviction of their most obstinate Enemies. This seems to be the subject of this Divine <hi>Psalm,</hi> written on purpose for the support and encouragement of those that did suffer under that sore and intolerable calamity. And it contains,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Confirmation of this, from the relation which the Church had to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Declaration of its Priviledges arising from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is a Duty infer'd from it, that they should therefore praise God for it, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>As well the Singers as the Players of Instruments,</hi> both small and great should joyn and say, <hi>All my Springs are in thee,</hi> that is, this Peace abroad, this Prosperity at home,<note place="margin">Psal. 68.25, 26.</note> doth all proceed from God as the <hi>Fountain</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Confirmation is, first, that <hi>Gods Foundation is in the Holy Mountains,</hi> vers. 1. There was his Temple built, the place of his fixed abode. 2<hi>dly.</hi> it was the place he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all delighted in, verse 2. <hi>The Lord loveth the Gates of Zion, that is Jerusalem, more than all the dwellings of Jacob,</hi> therefore its called <hi>the City of God,</hi> Vers. 3. 3<hi>dly.</hi> There were glorious things Prophesyed concerning it, and yet to be accomplished, vers. 3. <hi>Glorious things are spoken of thee, O City of God.</hi> From all which considerations they might be assured that the Church of God would revive and flourish.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a Declaration of the Priviledges, or a further description of the prosperous state of things amongst them.</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> As to what it should be in the Judgement of their Enemies themselves. Vers. 4. <hi>I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to,</hi> or rather, among (as our former Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very well renders it) <hi>them that know, or acknowledg me; behold Philista, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was Born there</hi>: that is, the greatest Enemies shall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

            <p n="1">1. What are the Priviledges of a Place or Country that render it Honourable, and transfer an Honour upon persons there born.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is the right persons owe, and the Honour they should give to their Country.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How far this may concern us that are met together upon this occasion and solemnity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the first, The things that do render a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or Place honourable and valuable, may be either, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, acquired, or providential.</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> Amongst the natural excellencies of a Place, that which first offers it self to our consideration, is its scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by means of which it becomes delightful, fruitful, and secure. For an instance in this, we need look no further than the subject of this <hi>Psalm, viz.</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was remarkable for the aforesaid advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and is therefore deservedly called the <hi>Pleasant Land,</hi> Dan. 8.7. <hi>Pleasant</hi> it was in regard of its Scituation, being in the middle of the then known World, and in the fourth Climate of the Seven (which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> divided the Earth into, as it that time was) and so was as temperate in its Air, as convenient to serve the ends of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,<note place="margin">Isa. 2.22.</note> which was from thence to disperse the knowledg of himself among all Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pleasant</hi> it was in respect of its fertility, of which we have a full and excellent description, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and an effectual demonstration of the truth of what is there said of it, <hi>a Land wherein thou shalt eat Bread without scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it,</hi> when though it extended not much above Two hundred Miles in length, and Eighty in breadth, could maintain its numerous Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62709:6"/>
of the vastness of which, we may conceive by the computation of Fighting men alone,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.9.</note> made in the time of <hi>David,</hi> which amounted to a Million and three hundred thousand.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Canaan</hi> was thus pleasant, so it was also secure, being compassed with Mountains; to the <hi>North</hi> were <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus,</hi> and <hi>Antilibanus</hi>; to the <hi>East, Gilead</hi> and <hi>Hermon</hi>; (<hi>Psalm</hi> 89.13.) and the Mountains of <hi>Moab</hi>; to the <hi>South,</hi> the Mountains of <hi>Judah</hi>; to the <hi>West,</hi> those of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Carmel</hi>; and where it was without, it had the great Sea.</p>
            <p>And what <hi>Canaan</hi> was to the then known world, that was <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> being planted near the middle of the Land; therefore its said to be in the midst of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Countries round about her, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.5. And to be beautiful for scituation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 48.3. It was also secure, as consisting of several Hills within, and compassed with them round about, as we are told, <hi>Psal.</hi> 125.2. only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>North,</hi> from whence its said to be on the sides of the <hi>North, Psal.</hi> 48.3, and <hi>Isa.</hi> 14.1. as it had a freer prospect to that Quarter, and not because <hi>Sion</hi> was on the North side of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as some Learned men have thought.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are things acquired and accidental, which render a Countrey or place valuable; that belong not to it as such a particular place, but are owing either to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry and providence, the valour and conduct of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, or to some unseen and indisernible causes. Of this kind are Dominion, Wealth, and Populousness; for all which the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> was famous in the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who <hi>Reigned over all Kingdoms from the River</hi> Euphrates <hi>unto the Border of Egypt</hi>;<note place="margin">1. Kings 4.20, 21. Cap. 10.21.</note> and had so many Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that they were innumerable, and in that respect <hi>as the Sand which by the Sea in Multitude</hi>; and these Subjects so enriched, that <hi>Silver in those days was nothing accounted of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62709:6"/>Of this sort is Learning and Knowledge,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod.</hi> lib. 2. c. 21. Act. 7.21.</note> for which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyt</hi> first (said to be the antient Nursery and Mother of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) and <hi>Greece</hi> afterwards were highly honoured and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
            <p>But that which above all makes a Country truly honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is the Vertue and Piety of the people, and the care taken for the encouragement and preservation of it by good Laws, and a vigorous Execution of them. The natural advantages of a Country are common to the foolish as well as the wise, the slothful as the industrious: and of these that are acquired, some (as Dominion and Wealth) are obtained by Boldness and Power, Fraud and Injustice, or stumbled upon by chance and casualty. But the Vertues of a Nation are truly their own, and make it Great and Noble wherever it is, and prosperous and successful, for the most part, in whatever it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes. It was an Honour to be a <hi>Roman,</hi> when that people were (as the Historians report) vertuous,<note place="margin">Salust. Bel. Cat. V. Max. l. c. 1. n. 9.</note> not more by Laws than Inclination: when in the first place they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in their Religion, just unto their Enemies, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all; when whatever Wars and Cententions they had abroad, there was no other amongst themselves, than who should exceed in things great and generous. Nay, it was more an honour to be then a Denizon of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of that Country, than when in future times it was made an honour by a Law, and by reason of its Priviledges was a Freedom worth the <hi>obtaining with a great Sum.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 22.27,</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Franchises and Immunities may be purchased, or descend upon a person (as it was with St. <hi>Paul</hi>) by Birth: but Vertue grows upon another Stock, and is the proper Fruit of their own care, and hath so great an influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and doth so discernibly conduce to the welfare of Mankind, and the good of Societies, that it makes a way for it self, and is more victorious than the Arms of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and whom these do leave unvanquished, that doth often overcome. So true is that of the Wise man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34.</note> 
               <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62709:7"/>
exalteth a Nation,</hi> and doth beget reverence, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and I may add, safety, wherever it is. But on the other side, be a <hi>Nation</hi> never so much exalted by Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Power, Opulency and Wealth, and all other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, whether natural or acquired, and wanting in that moral accomplishment, that it be faithless and perfidious, insolent and proud, luxurious and effeminate, these Vices prove like Weeds in a fertile Soyl, that overtop the useful Plants that are therein,<note place="margin">V. <hi>Bochart. Geog.</hi> part 1. l. 4. c. 2.</note> which make it rather a Wilderness than an <hi>Eden,</hi> and the people to be like the <hi>Cushites,</hi> who, in Scripture, are said to be strong and numerous, but withal very Base and Contemptible. For as <hi>Righteousness exalteth a Nation, so Sin is a reproach to any People</hi>; and as they degenerate in their manners, so they do decline in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, and consequently in their Power and Dominion. For Reputation is the strength of a Nation; and the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it depending upon its Vertue; the one must conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently decline with the other, and make Them in time as little feared as they are reverenc'd by their Neighbors; and then all the Policy and Power of the World cannot secure them, who having cast away their best defence, by their Vices, make themselves first the Triumph of their Enemies scorn, and then of their Arms. So that every Nation is secure according to its Reputation, and is in Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to its Vertue: Let it be lost to Vertue, its lost to its Reputation; let it be lost to its Reputation, it is lost to its peace and security also, and hath laid its self o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to its Enemies; or in want of such, doth by degrees dissolve of it self, and run into confusion. But then much more is this true, if we consider the World with respect to Divine Providence, which doth Crown the Vertues and Piety of a People with success and honour (for which reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others,<note place="margin">De civ. dei<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> l. 5. c. 12.15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There are things providential that do ennoble a Place or Country, of this we have an instance before us in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> which God did choose out of the World to be the place of his special residence, and in the people whom he chose, (exercising over them a Theocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Divine Government) to be his Inheritance; from whence that was called an <hi>Holy Land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zech. 2.12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deut. 7.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> they a <hi>Holy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and their Cities, <hi>Holy Cities</hi>: By which means they were invested with several Priviledges.<note place="margin">Isai. 64.10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>As first they had his special Assistance and Protection, by which, they drove out the old Inhabitants (as long as they continued stedfast in their Religion) without any considerable opposition; and were secured in the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, notwithstanding the ill-will, and power, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle practices and attempts of their Enemies; who were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over-ruled, or defeated by the special interposal of Divine Providence. Hence God is said to do all for them,<note place="margin">Psalm 147.14.</note>
               <hi>to strengthen the Bars of their Gates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm 76.1.</note> 
               <hi>and make peace in their Borders, to break the Arrows of the Bow, the Shield, the Sword,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm 50.2.3.</note> 
               <hi>and the Battel</hi>: And all is said to be issued from the place of his Habitation.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> They had thereby a greater priviledge,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.4.</note> which was the Knowledge of the true God, and what was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him. To them <hi>pertained the Adoption, and the Glory</hi> (the Shechina, or Divine presence) <hi>The Covenants, the giving of the Law, and the Service of God and the Promises.</hi> And when such was the City, such the Country, such the people, such their Relation to God, and such their Priviledges by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it; others must needs say,<note place="margin">Ps. 144.5.</note> 
               <hi>Happy is that people whose God is the Lord,</hi> and think it no little honour to be one of that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62709:8"/>
number; and him him happy of whom it could be said, <hi>This Man was Born there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this priviledge did not die with that State of things: for what <hi>Israel</hi> was then to the rest of the World, that is now the Church of God, to those that are out of it; that is Christianity to Judaism, Turcisme, Heathenisme: And all the favours and priviledges belonging to that people heretofore are transfer'd upon Christians, who are as the Apostle saith, (applying their Phrases to this purpose) <hi>A chosen Generation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> 
               <hi>a Royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People.</hi> So that it is now as much a priviledge to say with respect to the Church of God, or a Nation in which that is placed, and the Gospel received, <hi>This man was Born there,</hi> as it was in those times, with respect to that Nation or City, where God was more especially resident. And truly what a Church is to no Church, that, in proportion, is a true and found Church to a false Church, and a Church dangerously Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; and so much is it the honour and the priviledge of a person <hi>Born there,</hi> where the Word of God is truly taught, the Sacraments rightly and purely Administred, and the Worship solemnly performed, above what it is to be born and Educated in a Church, where Idolatry and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Embodied into the Worship, and false Principles are received into the Doctrine of it. From whence we may easily observe what an advantage we do enjoy that are born in the Church of God, beyond those that know not the Truth; and what it is that we do enjoy, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of our Church, which they do want that are born and bred up in the Bosom and Communion of the corrupted and degenerate Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is our honour and priviledge; and this doth lay no small obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon us: And what that is, I come in the next place to enquire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is the right persons owe, and what honour they should give to the Land or place of their Nativity.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62709:8"/>
When some of the wisest and best amongst the Heathen, such as <hi>Socrates,</hi> used to call themselves <hi>Citizens of the World,</hi> as if they own'd no relation to a particular place, it was only to blame that selfishness too common amongst men, by which they did not care what wrong they did to others, provided they and theirs were secured; but it was not to condemn that affection which mankind generally hath to the particular place of their Nativity and abode.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> lib. 6. n. 44.</note> This I think is well represented by that great Philosopher as well as Emperor, who saith, <hi>My City and Country, as</hi> Antoninus, <hi>is</hi> Rome; <hi>as a Man, its the World.</hi> For their Relation to the World did no more lessen a due affection and care to their own particular Country or Birth-place, than he could be supposed to cast of all regard to <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> because he considered himself as a Man. Or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever natural inclinations do not stand or fall by the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and Reasonings of Philosophers; but as long as men be men, and that there is such a thing as a Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt men and men, or men and places, there will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently be affections in them sutable to those Relations in which they are. From hence it is, that Parents and Children are naturally prone interchangeably to love each other; and, to go no further, that mankind hath a respect and affection for the place in which they were born; and for the people, more or less, amongst whom they received their Life and Education. From whence this proceeds, whether from propriety, or the possession it took of their first thoughts, and earliest affections; or from use which renders things connatural to us, is not so easie to resolve, as it is to observe the potency of this affection: When, whatever the Country may be, subject never so much to the extreams of heat and cold (if there be in it things necessary for subsistence) men generally rather chuse the quiet enjoyment of their own, than to have their portion in another that is in it self far more excellent and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: So the Poet observed of old.</p>

               <hi>What more delightful than</hi> Rome? <hi>What less than</hi> Scythia? <hi>And yet the Barbarous Native forsakes that for this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it be the Country of the <hi>Samoiedes,</hi> where for Six Months of the year they have one continued Night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are shut up in their pitiful Huts half under ground, yet the Inhabitants prefer their manner of life before the delight of a better Climate, as a modern Traveller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. <note n="*" place="margin">Olearius.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So that there is no Country so bad, which those that are there born do not generally chuse: And there is no Country so bad, but has a right and duty owing to it from such as were born there; Therein verifying that of <hi>Seneca, Nemo patriam, quia magna est, amat, sed quia sua. No man loves his Country because its great or noble, but because it is his</hi>: A Duty so necessary and obliging, that it hath been thought nothing could be too dear to part with, nothing too difficult to be undertaken for its wellfare and security; that Parents and Children, Life and Estate were to be sacrificed in so noble a cause. <hi>O fortunata mors, quae naturae debita, pro patria est potissimum reddita. O happy is that death, which when due to Nature, is laid down for the Country</hi>; before the other calls for it, said the Orator.</p>
            <p>But it is not my intent, as well as it is not so much to my purpose, to consider in general what is due to one Nation in opposition to another; to the Land of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in opposition to what is not, (since we are here assembled only as a small part of the whole) as what is due to any place which we have a relation to by birth and education, whether it be a Nation; or Country, or City, or whatever bounds greater or less it may be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed in. To all of which there is an Honour due, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62709:9"/>
which every man doth give, that discharges the duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his place and station with faithfulness and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and like a good man and a Christian, <hi>denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and worldly lusts, doth live soberly, righteously, and godlily in this present world.</hi> For as I have before shewed, that Virtue and Piety are the Honour of a Nation, so he that would do honour to his Country must live vertuously and piously. Other things we may receive from That, as Birth, a temperament of Body, some dispositions of mind, priviledges and immunities, respect derived from Ancestors. These are advantages we receive from That, and so cannot honour that by them; but piety and vertue are our own; and when we are eminent in these, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it redounds to our Country and all that we are related to. For the former we are beholding to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but for the latter our Country is beholding to us. And this is it that we should most of all aspire after, that we may rather chuse to do Honour to our Country, than depend upon any Honour or Advantage from it; being like <hi>Themistocles,</hi> that when told by a Native of the Island <hi>Seriphus</hi> (a place so craggy and desolate, that Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors were Banished thither) that he had his glory from his Country, and not from himself, replied, <hi>If I had been a</hi> Seriphian, <hi>I had been Noble and Great; but if thou hadst been an</hi> Athenian, <hi>thou wouldst have been base and dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> It is not in our power to chuse where we will be born, or from what stock to derive our selves, this we owe to other Causes; but it is, under God, in our power to chuse whether we will be good and vertuous, and do things worthy of a Man and a Christian; and by being so we do truly honour our selves and our Country.

Men may be honourable by what they receive from their Country, but they are more honourable for things that are honourable all the world over, and will make them honourable where-ever they are: And its by the same that they do honour their Country, by the things, I say, they receive not, more than by what they do receive from it. And therefore he that would study so to do (as every one should) let him begin here, and first of all to learn to be pious and virtuous as to himself, good and useful to others,<note place="margin">Acts 24.16.</note> and in all, <hi>to have a conscience void of offence toward God and toward men,</hi> and he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve well of his Country, and in the highest sence be an honour to it. But on the other side, if these be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Virtue and Piety be the last things taken into consideration, the more honourable their Country is, the more blame-worthy are they that do thus detract from the honour of it, and as much as in them lies, rob it of that it hath before acquired. <hi>Greece</hi> was famous for a Country, <hi>Crete</hi> for an Island, <hi>Athens</hi> for a City and a place of Learning: But what a disparagement was it to have it said of the people of the first, that they were false and perfidious? of the second,<note place="margin">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62709:10"/>
the Laws of God and Men, by a vicious life, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous acts, do disgrace their Nature and their Country, themselves and their relations, do disparage the stock and the place they came from: And let them speak never so much in behalf of it, do in effect with <hi>Coriolanus</hi> turn their Arms upon their Country; And instead of being Friends to it, are the worst of Enemies, since they joyn ingratitude to their other faults, and take life from that (for such is honour to a Country) which gave it to them. What is it then, for a person to plead the benefit of his Country, and launch out in commendations of that, or himself from his Relation to it, if in the mean time, he doth take from himself that honour which it doth give; and doth more disgrace that by his ill qualities and bad actions, than that can honour him by all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages it may otherwise justly claim, or he may claim from it. Since of the two, it's far more honourable and glorious to be a <hi>Scythian</hi> and <hi>Barbarian</hi> by Country, and a wise Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher as <hi>Anacharsis,</hi> than to be born in <hi>Athens</hi> and be a stupid <hi>Meltides</hi>; better be a <hi>Galilean,</hi> and a Disciple of the Holy Jesus, than to be born in an Imperial City with <hi>Julian</hi> and be an Apostate from Christianity; better be found in the roll of those, that from an obscure place and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from a Town that was <hi>little among the thousands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and from the Sheepfold, with <hi>David,</hi> have advanced themselves by their prudence and diligence, their vertue and piety, than of those that amidst the advantages of Birth, Country and Education, have degenerated from all, and become like the Sons of the great <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Fabius,</hi> the one of which was not suffered to wear in a Ring the Effigies, nor the other to inherit the goods of his Father. The latter are a disgrace to their Country, and such as their Friends, their Family, their Birth-place are ashamed to own: But the former do ennoble their Country and condition; and what is wanting in those to a person, he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62709:11"/>
makes up in himself to them, and like the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though <hi>raised out of the Stones,</hi> are far to be prefer'd before those that proceeded from his Loins. Such a man is in truth, what a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Roman</hi> once was by priviledge, Free and Great, wherever he is; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Country is, how despicable and base soever, though it be like <hi>Istria,</hi> which the <hi>Venetians</hi> were formerly forced to hire persons to live in, he will bring an honour to it, and it shall be said, with reputation to that as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>This man was born there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, as whatever our Country is, it should be as our Parents, a-like dear to us, so we should be as Children to their Parents, a-like dutiful to that; that so if that be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable, we may be an honour to that; if that be honourable and valuable we may not be a dishonour to that. And if there be an obligation upon persons to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety, whatever their Country is; for the Reasons abovesaid, then surely its a right and duty we owe to our Nation, and the Land of our Nativity, as we are English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: A Land that is great in every thing but extent, and what it wants in that,<note place="margin">Nahum 3.8.</note> has in its fertility and security (<hi>the Sea being a Rampart to it</hi>; as the Scripture saith of <hi>No.</hi>) A Land that is greater in its Constitution and Government, which, by its excellent Laws and Administration, so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually provides for the security, quiet and comfort of the people, that of no Nation under Heaven may it be better said, that <hi>every Man may sit under his Vine and under his figtree.</hi> A Land that is still greater for the Church of God that is in it; a Church, that for purity of Doctrine, solemnity of Worship, and all advantages for Piety, may compare with, if it doth not exceed any Church upon the face of the Earth. So that if Plenty and Security, wholesom Laws and a wise Constitution, and the blessed effects of good Government in the State: If helps to knowledge, and means and encouragements to Piety in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62709:11"/>
the Church, can render a Country valuable, or <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Nation happy; Ours is the Country, and we are the Nation. If the being born in such a Country, Educated in such a Church, Dwelling in such a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can lay an Obligation upon people and persons, we are the people and persons that are so obliged. What may not then God Almighty, the giver of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good gift, expect from us by way of thankfulness and acknowledgment for such Temporal and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Mercies? What may not the World expect from us by way of Improvement? What may not the Church of God expect from us in a way of Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Piety and Holiness? What may not our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours expect from us in our Peaceableness and Loyalty? What may we not expect from one another in Justice, Friendship, and Charity? What may we not expect from our selves, and what will not our own Consciences require of us in Duty to God and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? And what an account for all must we expect to give another day, when <hi>God shall Judge the World in Righteousness</hi>? If God <hi>hath not dealt so with any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> how inexcusable are we, if we are, after all, a <hi>Nation void of Counsel, and a People of no Vnderstanding</hi>? And how may we expect to find that verified in the conclusion, <hi>therefore he that made,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa 27.11.</note> and thus dignifyed <hi>them, will not have Mercy on them; and he that formed them will shew them no favour.</hi> So much is priviledge and duty interwoven, and so much the more are we obliged to the latter, as we do receive of the former. But though these are the Blessings we enjoy in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the rest of our Nation, yet there are some things in that part of it, which we owe our Birth and much of our Education to, that all of the same Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enjoy not in common with us. A County that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62709:12"/>
hath in it things so remarkable, as would alone be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have entertained you, and spent the time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But it is not fit for this place, nor will it answer the honest and good end for which we are now as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, to make the place of our Birth, the Subject of a Panegyrick. And therefore I shall only select from the rest, what the <hi>Psalm</hi> may put us in mind of, and may serve to enforce our Duty upon us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may consider the Situation of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Shire,</hi> which is to the rest of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> to the rest of the then known World,<note place="margin">Cumbden Brit. Bale cent. 5. num. 65.</note> placed in the middle and heart of it; and to such an advantage, that from one Hill in it there spring three Rivers, <hi>viz. Cherwel, Leam, Avon,</hi> that discharge themselves into three several Seas, as the Historians do observe. From which situation it hath the fittest opportunity of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the other parts of the Nation, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence what may be for its use and benefit. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. However, this is hath the less need of from the fertility of the Soyl, and the plenty of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for Life that it is stored with. So that as it is with the Rivers of it that arise all within its own Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els (in which also it resembles <hi>Canaan,</hi> properly so called) communicating their streams to many Countrys but receiving from none; so it is with the Country itself, that from its store doth send forth to others, but hath no dependence upon any, nor doth ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stand in need to crave help from them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may add to this the variety that is in it (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in like to <hi>Canaan</hi>) which doth not a little contribute to the delightsomness of it, being partly for profit, partly for pleasure; and yet that variety so intermixed,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62709:12"/>
that the places made more especially for delight have their profit, and those that yield the greatest profit, are not without their delights also: the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all which will justify the Character given of it by a Modern Historian (who else from his relation to it,<note place="margin">Fuller's Worthies</note> might be thought too favourable) that <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Shire</hi> is as <hi>an Apple without a Core to be cut, or Rind to pare away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Its no little Commendation to it, if we consider that its not only very populous, but the people ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are very industrious, and whose employment being for the most part in Tillage and Pasturage,<note place="margin">Politic.</note> bring them within the estimate of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who saith with respect to those two ways of living, that <hi>they are the happiest people that have from their Labour as much as is sufficient for Life, and yet they cannot be Idle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then there is not only, in the first sence of the Phrase, <hi>this and that Man</hi> for Multitude; but also, in the latter sence of it, <hi>this and that Man</hi> for eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Quality and Condition. If we view the Country within, it abounds so in Gentry and Nobility, that the great Geographer of our Nation doth give it this Character, <hi>Nobilium villis Excultissima</hi>; or as the Historian fore-recited doth express it, <hi>No Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath more Noblemen, no Noblemen fairer Habitations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider we it again, abroad we shall find it, not only to send forth its Colonies (of which this Assembly is an instance) but also there have been many amongst them (as might easily be shewed) that have proved eminent in their Station and Employment, both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>Let me lastly observe to you the Genius of the people in the numerous Foundations, for Piety and Charity.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62709:13"/>
In the former of which, there is no County in <hi>England,</hi> that in my observation by Reading or otherwise, doth exceed, or so much as equal it; and that in the circumference of One hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Miles (which is the compass of the Shire) can shew Three hundred twenty six Parish Churches; or that at one stand can present Thirty to the Eye of the Spectator, from the Villages planted round about, as ours is observed to do.</p>
            <p>From all which considerations that thus do trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an Honour to the place of our Birth, there is (as far as such a Relation can do it) an Honour transfer'd to those that are there Born; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there is an obligation upon such (as in the process of this Discourse has been shewed) to do somewhat that may tend to the honour of that; and to forbear whatever may be to the disparagement of it, and render them unworthy of that Character, and of the Relation they have to it.</p>
            <p>And that you of this Society may be the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to do what becomes you (who by your appearance here upon this occasion do intend an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to your Country) I shall add somewhat to what has been already said in General upon the Argument; and that I may do so with the greater freedom and assurance, shall take my rise from the Tickets sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad for our Invitation to this place and solemnity, in which it was declared that this Society was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>for the promoting of Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A design truly worthy and great, and so much the more fit to be revived, as there is so little of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ingredient in such meetings, that (however they may be called) for the want of it, can hardly deserve the name of Societies. And that I may the more
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62709:13"/>
clearly and effectually enlarge upon this Subject, I shall reduce what I have to say, to Union among your selves, Charity towards those that want, and Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in your Entertainments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which ought in the first place to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by you is Union amongst your selves, without which, Societies must dissolve, and the ends of them cannot be promoted or attained.</p>
            <p>There is no sadder object to a Christian and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind, to one that knows how much love and Good-will, Meekness and Patience are the Duties and the Ornament, the Priviledge and Blessing of our Religion, than the divisions that are at present amongst us in this Nation, not only <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasseth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Judah,</hi> but <hi>Judah</hi> against <hi>Judah,</hi> there being scarcely (as its said) a County, Town, or Village, but what is divided against its self, and suffers under the Malignant influence of these Exasperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>A sad prognostick or fore-runner at present, and if not timely prevented, a necessary cause of Ruin and Destruction, according to that observation of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>Every Kingdom divided against it self, is brought to desolation; and every City or House divided against its self, shall not stand. Matth.</hi> 12.25.</p>
            <p>There needs then no Enemy to combine against us, no great Skill or force to destroy us, for by mutual conspiracies against each other, and endeavours to weaken and destroy our selves, we shall like <hi>Cato</hi> prevent the Arms of our Adversaries, and dye by our own. And They may with more safety to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and with more advantage to their Cause observe our mutual animosities, than interrupt them, and take us off from the violent prosecution of them by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62709:14"/>
displaying their own Banners, and boldly challenging us to dispute it with themselves. And yet though there is nothing that should be more industriously kept out of, nor sooner banished from Societies, because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more the bane of them, than this temper, yet; it too much entertained is and cherished amongst them; and no sooner can persons come together upon any good and worthy design, than they become clans and Parties amongst themselves, and what were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and should have been the means of a happy Union, have become the woful Nurseries of discord and Dissension.</p>
            <p>But, Beloved, whatever may have been the sad fate of others, I hope better things of you, and that you that are of the same Country by Birth, the same City by Habitation, and meet by joynt consent upon so generous and Christian a design of Charity, will take all due care to prevent and banish from amongst you all such evil principles of Faction and Turbulency, and avoid all such provocations as may obstruct it, and take you off from the just prosecution of it: That you that in the first place profess to honour God, by your appointed Assembly here for Divine Worship, and in the next, to do good to others, will do both by an happy Union amongst your selves.</p>
            <p>And therefore since there is nothing, perhaps, that doth more cherish and keep up our differences than new invented names (which I shall not so far honour as to mention in this Holy Place and Service) by which those that were really no otherwise distinguished are too often distinguished, and that men may and do, too much apply to the wrong as to the right; let it be your resolution and practice to lay them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and leave them in the Streets, without giving
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62709:14"/>
them admission into your Society. That there may be no others than what will in conversation distinguish an Honest man from a Knave, in the State a Loyal person from a Rebel: And I wish there were no need of any more in the Church than what would distinguish a Protestant from a Papist, or rather that there were no such distinction at all, but that we all might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the primitive state and temper, when all of the same Religion were known by the one name of Christians; and the Church of God all the World over being purged from bad principles, Superstition, and Idolatry, truly so called, (which at present distinguish and divide the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and from other Reformed Churches) and from all Schism, and Faction that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide us amongst our selves, we may come to be <hi>one Fold</hi> and Flock, under the one <hi>Shepherd and Bishop of our Souls,</hi> the Blessed Jesus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. But though this is a State of things that we may rather desire than expect, and is not to be brought about without the wonderful Providence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; yet let us next to our Prayers, that <hi>this Kingdom of God may come,</hi> use our endeavour to make up the differences that are amongst us an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffectual obstruction thereunto.</p>
            <p>This is a work may become the wisest of men, and will indeed try the Skill of those that are most acquainted with the passions of humane Nature, and the State of Affairs in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to prosecute, and Accomplish; when notwithstanding all the attempts made toward it, it has yet remained for the most part as it was. And therefore, when all the Arguments taken from Divine, Moral, or Political reasons have not succeeded, why should we not try
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62709:15"/>
that which is Artificial; which may serve as Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ways do in some Operations, where Rational and Methodical Applications fail.</p>
            <p>When a Prince of the Family of <hi>Orange</hi> was stab'd by the Murtherous hand of a flagitious Assasin, and all the Art and Medicines the Chyrurgions could use, stop'd not the Flux of Blood that Issued from the Orifice of the Wound, they took another way, and stop'd it with the pressure of mens Thumbs, till they had turned the course of Blood. And when we see that all the means and prescriptions used by good men amongst us, cannot stop the Flux of that Virulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of strife and contention, let us try the artificial way before proposed, and obstinately resolve to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear such Names as may well be conceived do add no little fuel and flame to our dissensions: Those names I say, that divide between the Honest and the Honest, the Peaceable and the Peaceable, the Loyal and the Loyal, and those that are of the same Communion and Church, from those that are in all points of that Communion.</p>
            <p>This is a course that all may observe, the Simple as well as the Gentle; and he that understands little of the State of Humane affairs as well as he that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands much. And therfore, if it be a means proper thereunto, no Christian should, and no one that wishes well unto our <hi>Sion, and prays for the Peace of Jerusalem,</hi> will omit.</p>
            <p>Now whether this be a means proper or no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not me to be magisterial and positive in (since it is a means rather Prudential than Theological) but I shall leave it to the Judgement of all Pious and Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable persons to consider, and the Experience of Mankind to answer for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62709:15"/>And that I shall produce a most eminent example of from the History of <hi>Italy.</hi> The story of the <hi>Guelfs</hi> and <hi>Gibellines</hi> is well known to the World, and the sad state of things that issued upon it. Some say (though probably it was otherwise) that the dispute began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Brothers of those names, the one contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the right of the Emperour, the other for that of the Pope. But it soon set City against City, Province against Province, and one part of the people so against another, that they had not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ensigns in War, but divers Garments, Colours,<note place="margin">Nauclerus generat. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and Gestures; nay they took a pleasure to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by certain motions of their Fingers and Mouths. And being thus distinguished, the Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties remained, after the first cause was removed; and notwithstanding all attempts made toward a pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they pursued one another with such inveterate Rage, <hi>Vt ferme ad internecionem certatum sit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Platina vit. Bonif. 9.</note> (saith an excellent Historian) that it wanted little of an universal slaughter. Thus it continued for above two Hundred Years, and perhaps had longer continued, if there had not been some other way taken for the extinction of that Flame that for such a long cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of years had been thus pernicious. Which was put in prosecution by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> who ordained,<note place="margin">Spondani supplem. Baron. An. 1342.1.</note> that the names of the <hi>Guelfs</hi> and <hi>Gibellines</hi> should be held accursed, and those be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that should use them by way of of distinction and reproach; And so the names falling, the contention by degrees fell with the names. And why may it not be so again? and that be done by a general consent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all Pious and Peaceable persons, which was done by a decree of the Pope? And I pray God it may be so amongst us; that <hi>no Corrupt Communication
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62709:16"/>
proceed out of our Mouth,</hi> but (that we may conclude this advice with the following words of the Apostle) <hi>Let all bitterness, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and Evil speaking be put away from you with all Malice. And be you kind one to another forgiving one another even as God for Christs sake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you,</hi> Ephes. 4.29.31, 32. If this be done, there is a good foundation laid for you to raise <hi>your Superstructure</hi> upon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let me recommend to your consideration, the Duty of Charity usually so called, in the care of those the World frowns upon, and God in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath bereft of those Comforts and Accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we do enjoy. You cannot reflect upon the state of your Country, and what your Predecessors have done in order to so good an end, by the Foundations raised for the Service of God and relief of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, without observing the Honour that thereby redounds to that, and the President you have to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low according to your Ability.</p>
            <p>This is a debt you owe to God that hath Blessed and prospered you in the World, and which (I perswade my self) you are this day met with thankfulness to acknowledge; and with a resolution to express it by <hi>not appearing before him Empty, Ex.</hi> 23.15.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Vespasian</hi> came to be Emperour, he used fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to visit <hi>Cosa,</hi> where from his Infancy he had been brought up under his Grandmother <hi>Tertulla,</hi> and chose to have the Town continue as it then was, that it might bring his former condition fresh to his remembrance, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Historian relates. And if we would make a right estimate of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the obligations we are under to the Divine Goodness, it would not be amiss to trace our lives back,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62709:16"/>
and to consider the several steps by which we have from our Childhood been brought to the present State in which we are. How God hath made our ways prosperous, <hi>and our latter end to increase</hi> beyond our <hi>beginning,</hi> as <hi>Bildad</hi> said, Job. 8.7.</p>
            <p>This is a duty you owe to your Religion, which as it makes it our Duty, so the honour of it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that we should convince the World, that as much may be done in Charity where the opinion of merit is not, as where it is made a property to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke men to it.</p>
            <p>This is a Duty in which the Protestants of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have outdone those of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as has been proved by others, allowing time for time,) the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> have outdone others: And perhaps there may be a way found out in which you may exceed the rest of the City, though not in the greatness yet in the prudent distribution of your Charity.</p>
            <p>The Forreign Churches amongst us have no such publick provisions made for the Poor, nor are enabled to compel their Members to contribute to their relief: And yet through the prevalency of a good Custom, and forward examples they are of themselves so Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable; and by the diligence, prudence and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of those to whom the care of the publick stock is committed, the Charity is so well bestowed; that none are found to beg in the Streets, nor to supplicate others for their benevolence; (except those whom the present storm of the persecution in <hi>France</hi> hath drove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hither for Refuge) though their Numbers are great, and the Families dispersed from one end of the Town to the other. And it is an answer we have always ready at hand, if any such apply themselves
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62709:17"/>
to us, that they are already provided for, and that they either need it not, or are not worthy of our Charity.</p>
            <p>And this will be a worthy example for you to imitate, and it would be an honour to you and your Country; if there could be such a way found out for collecting, receiving and disposing of your Charity, that all that need, and are able to work may be Employ'd, or by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put out to Apprentiships, may be fitted for it; all that cannot work, may be relieved; and all that will not, may be stigmatized and branded.</p>
            <p>This will be a Charity indeed, and perhaps may be of more use than to found and endow Hospitals, and Alms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Houses; and in which you will be exemplary to others, and benificial as well to posterity as the Age you live in. This will <hi>be better than the name of Sons, and of Daughters,</hi> and when time and other reasons have worn out Families (as its easie to shew it in the place of our Nativity) this will embalm your memories, and (to make use of the Prophets phrase) will <hi>give you an Everlasting name that shall not be cut off,</hi> Isai. 56.5. This will secure your Estates, entail a Blessing upon them and your posterities, as we are assured, Ps. 25.26. <hi>I have not seen the Righteous (or Charitable) forsaken nor his Seed begging Bread. He is ever merciful and lendeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Seed is Blessed.</hi> Nay, if the Apostle be to be regarded, such as <hi>do good, are Rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to Communicate, do lay up for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, and lay hold on Eternal life.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.18, 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let me recomend to you Sobriety in your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This I think my self the rather obliged to take notice of, since if what has been of late the practice in some Societies, should be transfer'd into all,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62709:17"/>
and that Intemperance should hold on the pace, which for some years past it has been observed to take, all Societies would be dissolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or, which is as bad rendred useless and unserviceable and all the wise and good ends propounded in their first Foundation and Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be utterly defeated.</p>
            <p>Then all good and sober men must exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it would be as unfit for such a one to appear there, as it was for a Vertuous <hi>Cato<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to be present at the Floral Games, and the Bestial practices, used in honour (as they pretended) of their gods, and when either they will be Rude to him, or he must be rude to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> was no less generous in the liberty he gave his Guests, <hi>by a Law that none did Compel,</hi> than in the plenty and abundance he entertained them with, <hi>Esther</hi> 1.7, 8. And I think he pays very dear for his Meat and Drink that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoiled of, or denied that Liberty; and can purchase his admission into the Company at no less a price than the loss of his reason and innocence; and to make himself ridiculous to men; and hateful to God.</p>
            <p>Therefore since Charity amongst your selves, and Charity to others, is what you propound to your selves, and declare to others to be your Design in your Society, let it be your Care so to manage it, that this so excellent an end may not be frustrated, and you lose the Company, and that be deprived of the best members of it; I mean such as are truly Sober and Vertuous, and you in the conclusion break up that Society you have begun to Establish.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:62709:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>If these be the measures you observe and keep, and the Society be thus regulated and carried on, it will be truly glorious, good, and useful. And that it may be prosperous, and live as long as there is a County to supply the City, and a City to receive members from the County will be the hearty prayer of all concerned in the welfare of both. Then you will honour both; and it will be the conclusion of all, that God himself <hi>shall count when he writeth up the People, that the man was Born there Selah.</hi>
