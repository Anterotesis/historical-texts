            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Answer to the Introduction.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Introduction</hi> consists of two parts.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A general Complaint of the <hi>Papists</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Misrepresented</hi> among us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. An account of the Method he hath taken to clear them from these <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. As to the <hi>First;</hi> Whether it be just, or not, must be examin'd in the several Particulars. But here we must consider, whether it serves the End it is designed for in this place, which is, to gain the Reader's good Opinion of their Innocency: Not meerly because they complain so much of being injured, but because the best Men in all Times have been <hi>Misrepresented;</hi> as he proves at large in this <hi>Introduction,</hi> from several Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Old and New <hi>Testament, but especially of Christ and his Apostles, and the Primitive Christians.</hi> But it is observable, that when Bp. <hi>Jewel</hi> began his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint much of the same Nature, and produced the very same Examples, his Adversary would by no means allow it to have any Force, being, as he called
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57901:3"/>
it, <hi>Exordium Commune,</hi> which might be used on both sides, and therefore could be proper to neither. And altho it be reasonable only for those to complain of being <hi>Misrepresented,</hi> who having Truth on their side, do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding suffer under the Imputation of Error; yet it is possible for those who are very much <hi>mistaken,</hi> to complain of being <hi>misrepresented;</hi> and while they go about to remove the Misrepresentations of others, to make new Ones of their own. And as the best Men, and the best Things, have been Misrepresented; so other Men have been as apt to complain of it, and the worst things are as much Misrepresented, when they are made to appear not so bad as they are. For <hi>Evil</hi> is as truly Misrepresented under the appearance of <hi>Good,</hi> as <hi>Good</hi> under the appearance of <hi>Evil;</hi> and it is hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether hath done the greater Mischief.</p>
            <p>So that if <hi>the Father of Lies be the Author of Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting,</hi> (as the <hi>Introduction</hi> begins) we must have a care of him both ways. For when <hi>he tried this Black Art in Paradise,</hi> (as our Author speaks) it was both by misrepresenting the Command, and the Danger of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing it. He did not only make the Command appear otherwise than it was, but he did very much lessen the Punishment of Disobedience, and by that means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded our first Parents into that Sin and Misery, under which their Posterity still suffers. Which ought to be a caution to them, how dangerous it is to break the Law of God under the fairest Colour and Pretences; and that they should not be easily imposed upon by false Glosses, and plausible Representations, though made by such as therein pretend to be <hi>Angels of Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although <hi>the Father of Lies be the Author of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representing:</hi> yet we have no reason to think but that if he were to plead his own Cause to Mankind, he would very much complain of being <hi>Misrepresented</hi> by them;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57901:3"/>
and even in this respect, when they make him the <hi>Father</hi> of those <hi>Lies</hi> which are their own Inventions. And can that be a certain Argument of Truth, which may as well be used by <hi>the Father of Lies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the great Instruments he hath made use of in deceiving and corrupting Mankind, have been as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as any to complain of being Misrepresented. The true Reason is, Because no great Evil can prevail in the World, unless it be represented otherwise than it is; and all Men are not competent Judges of the Colours of Good and Evil; therefore when the Designs of those who go about to deceive, begin to be laid open, they then betake themselves to the fairest Representations they can make of themselves, and hope that many will not see through their Pretences.</p>
            <p>If I had a mind to follow our Author's Method, I could make as long a Deduction of Instances of this kind. But I shall content my self with some few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of those who are allowed on both sides to have been guilty of great Errors and Corruptions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arrians</hi> pleaded they were <hi>Misreprented,</hi> when they were taken for Enemies to Christ's Divinity; for all that they contended for, was only such a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Time, as would make good the Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Father and Son.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pelagians,</hi> with great Success for some time (and even at <hi>Rome)</hi> complained, that they were very much <hi>Misrepresented,</hi> as Enemies to God's Grace; whereas they owned and asserted the manifold Grace of God; and were only Enemies to Mens Idelness and Neglect of their Duties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nestorians</hi> gave out, that they never intended to make two Persons in Christ, as their Adversaries charged them; but all their design was to avoid Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, in calling the Blessed Virgin <hi>the Mother of</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57901:4"/>
               <hi>God;</hi> and whatever went beyond this, was their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries <hi>Misrepresentations,</hi> and not their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eutychians</hi> thought themselves very hardly dealt with, for saying there was <hi>but one Nature in Christ,</hi> they did not mean thereby (as they said) to destroy the Properties of the Humane Nature, but only to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert that its Subsistence was swallowed up by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and of all Persons, those have no Reason to blame them, who suppose the Properties of one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may be united to another.</p>
            <p>Even the <hi>Gentile Idolaters,</hi> when they were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Christians, <hi>that they Worshipped Stocks and Stones,</hi> complained, they were <hi>Misrepresented,</hi> for they were not such Ideots to take things for Gods, which had neither Life, nor Sense, nor Motion in them. And when they were charged <hi>with worshipping other Gods as they did the Supream;</hi> they desired their Sense might not be taken from common Prejudices, or vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Practices, but from the Doctrine of their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; and they owned a Soveraign Worship due to him that was Chief; and a subordinate and Relative to some Coelestial Beings, whom they made Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to as Mediators between him and them. Must all these Complaints now be taken for granted? what then becomes of the Reputation of General Councils, or the Primitive Christians? But as, if it were enough to be Accused, none would be Innocent; so none would be Guilty, if it were enough to complain of being Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented.</p>
            <p>Therefore in all Complaints of this Nature it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to come to Particulars; and to examine with Care and Diligence the Matters complained of, and then to give Judgment in the <hi>Case.</hi> I am glad to find our Author professing so much <hi>Sincerity and Truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57901:4"/>
               <hi>Passion;</hi> and I do assure him I shall follow what he Professes: For the Cause of our Church is such, as needs neither Tricks nor Passion to defend it; and therefore I shall endeavour to state the Matters in Difference with all the clearness and calmness that may be, and I shall keep close to his Method and Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, without Digressons, or provoking Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But I must declare my self very much unsatisfied with the Method he hath taken to clear his Party from these <hi>Misrepresentations.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He takes upon him to draw a double Character of a Papist; and in the one he pretends to follow a certain Rule, but not in the other, which is not fair and ingenuous.</p>
            <p>As to the one, he saith, <hi>He follows the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>and their allowed Spiritual Books and Catechisms:</hi> and we find no fault with this. But why must the other Part then be drawn by Fancy, or common Prejudices, or ignorant Mistakes? Have we no Rule, whereby the Judgment of our Church is to be taken? Are not our Articles as easy to be had and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as the Decrees and Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> I will not ask, How the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> comes to be the Rule and Measure of Doctrine to any here, where it was never received? But I hope I may, why our Representations are not to be taken from the Sense of our Church, as their's from the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> If he saith, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his Design was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move common Prejudices, and vulgar Mistakes;</hi> it is easy to answer, if they are contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y to the Doctrine of our Church, we utterly disown them. We know very well there are Persons, who have so false a Notion of <hi>Popery,</hi> that they charge the Rites and Customs of our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57901:5"/>
Church with it: but we pitty their Weakness and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and are far from defending such Misrepresentations. But that which we adhere to, is the Doctrine and Sense of our Church, as it is by Law established; and what Representations are made agreeable thereto, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to defend, and no other. But if a Person take the liberty to lay on what Colours he pleases on one side, it will be no hard matter to take them off in the other, and then to say, <hi>How much fairer is our Church than she is painted!</hi> It is an easy, but not so allowable a way of disputing, for the same Person to make the Objections and Answers too; for he may so model and frame the Arguments by a little Art, that the Answers may appear very full and sufficient; whereas if they had been truly represented, they would be found very lame and defective.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He pretends to give an account why he quotes no Authors for his Misrepresentations, which is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactory, <hi>viz. That he hath described the Papist there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, exactly according to the apprehension he had of him when he was a Protestant.</hi> But how can we tell what sort of Protestant he was; nor how well he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in his Religion? And must the Character now supposed to be common to Protestants, be taken from his ignorant, or childish, or wilful Mistakes? Did ever any Protestant that understands himself, say, <hi>That Papists are never permitted to hear Sermons which they ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> able to understand,</hi> (p. 58.) <hi>or that they held it lawful to commit Idolatry,</hi> (p. 9.) Or, <hi>that a Papist believes th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Pope to be his great God, and to be far above all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> &amp;c? Yet these are some of his Misrepresentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>(p.</hi> 40.) Did he in earnest think so himself? I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he did, he gives no good account of himself: if he did not, he gives a worse; for then how shall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him in other things, when he saith, <hi>He hath draw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57901:5"/>
               <hi>his Misrepresentations exactly according to his own Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions.</hi> It is true, he saith, <hi>he added some few Points, which were violently charged on him by his Friends:</hi> but we dare be bold to say, this was none of them. But let us suppose it true, that he had such Apprehensions himself. Are these fit to be printed as the Character of a Party? What would they say to us, if a Spanish Convert should give a Character of <hi>Protestants,</hi> according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion the People there have of them; and set down in one Column their monstrous Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, and in another, what he found them to be since his coming hither; and that in good Truth he saw they were just like other Men. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he had false Apprehensions before he went among them; why did he not take care to inform himself better before he changed? Had he no Friends, no Books, no Means to rectify his Mistakes? Must he needs leave one Church, and go to another, before he understood either? If this be a true Account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, it is but a bad Account of the Reasons of his Change.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Account he gives of the other Part of his Character, affords as little satisfaction; For although in the general, it be well that he pretends to keep to a Rule, yet</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He shews no Authority he hath to interpret that Rule in his own sense. Now several of his Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations depend upon his own private Sense and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, against the Doctrine of many others as zealous for their Church as himself; and what Reason have we to adhere to his Representation, rather than to theirs? As for instance, he saith, <hi>The Pope's personal Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is no Matter of Faith,</hi> (p. 42.) But there are others fay it is, and is grounded on the same Promises which makes him Head of the Church. Why now must we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57901:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
take his Representation rather than theirs? And so as to the <hi>Deposing Power,</hi> he grants, <hi>it hath been the Opinion of several Popes</hi> (and Councils too) <hi>but that it is no Matter of Faith,</hi> (p. 47.) But whose Judgment are we to take in this Matter, according to the Principles of their Church? A private Man's, of no Name, no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or of those Popes and Councils who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it, and acted by it? And can any Man of their Church justify our relying upon his Word, against the Declaration of Popes and Councils? But suppose the Question be about the Sense of his own Rule, <hi>the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Trent:</hi> what Authority hath he to declare it, when <note place="margin">Bulla <hi>Pli 4ti</hi> super Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">(2.) He leaves out, in the se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eral Particulars, an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part of the Character of a <hi>Papist</hi> since the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent;</hi> which is, that he doth not only believe the Doctrines there defined to be true, but to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation. And there is not a word of this in his Representation of the Points of Doctrine, but the whole is managed as though there were nothing but a difference about some particular Opinions; whereas in Truth, the Necessity of holding those Doctrines, in order to Salvation, is the main Point in difference. If Men have no mind to believe their own Senses, we know not how to help it; but we think it is very hard to be told, we cannot be saved unless we renounce them too. And this now appears to be the true State of the Case, since <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> drew up and published a Confession of Faith, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Decrees and Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein Men are not only required <hi>to believe their Traditions as firmly as the Bible, the seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Transubstantiation, the Sacrifice of the Mass, Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, worshiping of Images,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57901:6"/>
               <hi>Indulgences, Supremacy,</hi> &amp;c. but they must believe, <hi>that without believing these things, there is no Salvation to be had</hi> in the ordinary Way; for after the enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Points, it follows, <hi>Hanc veram Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam Fidem extra quam nemo salvus esse potest,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is the true Catholick Faith, without which no Man can be saved; i. e.</hi> The belief of these things is thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared as necessary to Salvation, as of any other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Creed. But it may be objected, <hi>The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing this Profession of Faith, is not required of all Members of that Church.</hi> To which I answer, That to make a Man a Member of it, he must declare that he holds the same Faith which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds: And this is as much the Faith of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, as the Pope and Council of <hi>Trent</hi> could make it. And it is now printed in the Roman <hi>Ritual</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> set forth by <hi>Paul</hi> V. as the Confession of Faith owned by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore this ought to have been a Part of the true Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to the Doctrinal Points; but when he comes to the <hi>35th</hi> Head, he then owns, <hi>That unless Men do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every Article of the Roman Faith, they cannot be saved,</hi> (p. 96.) <hi>and he that disbelieves one, does in a manner disbelieve all,</hi> (p. 97.) Which may as well reach those who disown the Deposing Power, and the Pope's personal Infallibility, as Us, since those are accounted Articles of Faith by the ruling part of their Church, to whom it chiefly belongs to declare them; and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hath been defined both by Popes and Councils.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) He never sets down what it is which makes any Doctrine to become a Doctrine of their Church. We are often blamed for charging particular Opinions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Church; but we desire to know what it is which makes a Doctrine of their Church; <hi>i. e.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frequent and publick Declaration, by the Heads
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57901:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Guides of their Church, be sufficient or not to that End? Our Author seems to imply the Necessity of some Conditions to be observed; for besides <hi>the Pope's Authority,</hi> he requires <hi>due Circumstances, and proceeding according to Law,</hi> (p. 42.) But who is to be Judg of these Circumstances and legal Proceedings? And he never tells what these <hi>Circumstances</hi> are. And yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, he saith, <hi>The Orders of the Supream Pastor are to be obey'd, whether he be Infallible or not.</hi> And this now brings the Matter home; <hi>The Popes,</hi> he confesses, <hi>have owned the Deposing Doctrine, and acted according to it:</hi> And others are bound to obey their Orders, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infallible or not; and consequently they are bound by the Doctrine of their Church to Act, when the Popes shall require it, according to the Deposing Power. But he seems to say, in this Case, that a Doctrine of their Church is to be judged by the Number; for, saith he, <hi>There are greater Numbers that disown this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ne,</hi> (p. 47.) I will not at present dispute it; but I desire to be informed, Whether the Doctrines of their Church go by majority of Votes, or not? I had thought the Authority of the Guides of the Church ought to have over-ballanced any Number of Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For, what are those who refuse to submit to the Dictates of Popes and Councils, but Dissenters from the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> The Distinction of the <hi>Court &amp; Church of Rome</hi> is wholly impertinent in this Case. For, we here consider not the meer Temporal Power which makes the Court, but the Spiritual Capacity of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church: and if Popes and Councils may err in Teaching this Doctrine, why not in any other? I know there are some that say, <hi>Universal Tradition is necessary to make a Doctrine of their Church.</hi> But then no submission can be required to any Doctrine in that Church, till the Universal Tradition of it, in all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57901:7"/>
Times, and in all Parts of the Christian Church, be proved. And we need to desire no better Terms than these, as to all Points of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV his Creed, which are in dispute between us and them.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) He makes use of the Authority of some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Divines as delivering the Sense of their Church, when there are so many of greater Authority against them. Whereas, if we proceed by his own Rule, the greater Number is to carry it. Therefore we cannot be thought to Misrepresent them, if we charge them with such things as are owned, either by the general and allowed Practices of their Church, or their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices, or the generality of their Divines and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists; or in case of a Contest, with that side which is owned by the Guides of their Church, when the other is censured; or which was approved by their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized Saints, or declared by their Popes and Councils, whose Decrees they are bound to follow. And by these Measures I intend to proceed, having no design to <hi>misrepresent them,</hi> as indeed we need not.</p>

            <head>I. <hi>Of Praying to Images.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN this, and the other Particulars, where it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, I shall observe this Method;</p>
            <p n="1">1. To give a clear and impartial Account of the State of the Controversy in as few Words as I can.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make some Reflections on what he saith, in order to the clearing them from Misrepresentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>As to the State of this Controversy, as it stands, since the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> we are to consider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We must distinguish between what Persons do in their own Opinion, and what they do according to the Sense of the Divine Law. It is possible that Men may intend one thing, and the Law give another Sense of it: as is often seen in the Case of Treason; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Persons plead never so much they had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to commit Treason, yet if the Law makes their Act to be so, their disavowing it, doth not Excuse them. So it is in the present, Case; Men may have real and serious Intentions, to refer their final, ultimate, and Soveraign Worship only to God; but if the Law of God strictly and severely prohibits this particular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worship by Images, in as full, plain, and clear Words as may be, and gives a Denomination to such Acts, taken from the immediate Object of it; no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intention of the Persons can alter that Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or make the Guilt to be less than the Law makes it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There can be no <hi>Misrepresenting</hi> as to the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of many External Acts of Worship, with Respect to Images, which are owned by them. But it doth not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57901:8"/>
look fairly to put the Title, <hi>Of Praying to Images;</hi> for the Question is, <hi>about the Worship of Images:</hi> whereas this Title would insinuate, as though we did directly charge them with <hi>Praying to their Images, without any farther Respect.</hi> Which we are so far from charging them with, that I do not know of any People in the World, who are not like <hi>Stones and Stocks</hi> themselves, who are liable to that Charge. The <hi>PENDETS</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies</hi> are fully cleared from it, by <hi>Thevenot,</hi> as <note place="margin">Thevenot <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age des Indes. p.</hi> 188. Bernier <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs. Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 172.</note> well as <hi>Bernier.</hi> And it would be hard we should not allow the same to our Fellow-Christians. I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grant what our Author saith, <hi>viz. That all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration they express before Images, whether by kneeling, praying, lifting up the Eys, burning Candles, Incense, &amp;c. is not at all done for the Image, but is wholly referr'd to the things represented, which he intends to honour by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>these Actions.</hi> But I hope now, it is no Misrepresenting for us to say, that <hi>they do kneel, pray, lift up their Eyes, burn Candles, Incense, &amp;c. before their Images;</hi> which is all I charge them with at present.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To perform these Acts before Images, without a Design to worship the Images by them, is declared, by great Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be next to Heresy. The Case was this; there were before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> several Persons who lived in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that Church, but by no means approved the Worship of Images, such as <hi>Durandus, Holcot, Picus Mirandula,</hi> and others. Now these Persons thought fit to comply in these External Acts, but declared they intended not to worship the Images, but the Objects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Since the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> decreed Images were to be worshiped, this Case hath been debated by the Divines and Casuists of greatest Reputation among them; And <hi>Suarez</hi> saith, <hi>this Way of Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Suarez <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>part. Qu.</hi> 25. <hi>Disp.</hi> 53.</note> 
               <hi>is dangerous, rash, and savours of Heresy;</hi> and he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57901:9"/>
saith further from <hi>Medina, that it was</hi> Victoria<hi>'s, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>2do. principaliter. &amp; Sect.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>that it was Heretical;</hi> but he adds, that his own Opinion, <hi>that Images were truly and properly to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, was generally received by their Divines;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I need name no more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is granted by their Divines and Casuists, that the People in the Worship of Images may easily fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idolatry.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Worship do not pass from the Image to the thing represented. And so <hi>Aquinas</hi> himself determins, that no irrational Creature is capable of Worship, but as it hath Respect to a Rational Being. But here lies the Difficulty, how an extrinsical Relation to an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Worship, where the thing is confessed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve none, can give any Reason, for its being proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worshipped. But they all grant, if the Worship stop at the Inanimate Part, it can be no other than the Worship of Stocks and Stones.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Worship be given to the Image, which is proper to God alone. This <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is forced to grant, because the Evidence is so clear in Antiquity, that the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellarmin. de Imag. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 24.</note> Gnosticks were condemned for some Worship which they performed to the Image of Christ. Now, we cannot think that these Gnosticks were such Sots, as to take the Image of Christ to be Christ himself; and therefore whatever Worship it was, it must be Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>i. e.</hi> given to the Image for the sake of Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If the People believe any Divinity to be in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or put any Trust or Confidence in them,</hi> then the <note place="margin">

Now, how shall it be known when the People believe Divinity to be in Images, but by some more than ordinary Presence or Operation in or by them? by their having a greater Opinion of one Image
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57901:9"/>
than of another of the same Person? by their going long Pilgrimages to certain Images in hopes of Relief, when they might easily cause Images to represent at home?</p>
            <p>And that such are no extravagant Imaginations, is known to all who have heard of <hi>Loretto,</hi> or <hi>Compostel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> or other Places nearer home. I need not mention the Complaints of <hi>Polydore Virgil, Cassander,</hi> or <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celius</hi> to this purpose, who died all in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for the same is very lately complained of by a considerable Person in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who saith, <hi>The greatest part of the Devotion</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>of the People of</hi> Italy, Spain, <hi>and</hi> Portugal, <hi>consists in prostrating themselves before Images, and going in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to them, and hoping for Remission of their Sins by so doing.</hi> And another very lately yields, <hi>That to avoid the Peril of Idolatry, to which,</hi> he saith, <hi>the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is evidently exposed by the use of Images, it would be necessary to take them away from the Altars, and by no means to have them allowed for the Objects of Religious Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Question now is, Whether the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath taken any effectual Course to prevent these <hi>Abuses?</hi> If not, what <hi>Misrepresenting</hi> is it to charge the Abuses upon the Doctrines and Practices allowed by it?</p>
            <p>The Remedies prescribed by the Council, are these;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Declaring that there is no Divinity or Vertue in them for which they should be worshipped; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be desired of them, nor any Trust or Confidence to be put in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Expressing their earnest desire, that if any Abuses have crept in, they may be removed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:57901:10"/>
But in the mean time the Council decrees, <hi>the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not only to be useful to be set up in Churches, but to have due Honour and Worship given them there, for the sake of those they represent; as not only putting off the Hat, but falling down before them.</hi> And the <hi>Roman Catechism</hi> declares, <hi>That this Worship is very beneficial to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Catechis. Rom. Part.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. S. 14.</note> 
               <hi>the People, and so much is to be told them; and that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages are to be in Churches, not meerly for Instruction, sed ut colantur,</hi> that they may be worshipped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what could the Council do more, than to desire all Abuses may be taken away; and is it not them the fault of others, and not of the Council if they be not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant, the Council doth desire <hi>Abuses may be taken away, if any such be;</hi> but then it enumerates those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses, in <hi>Heterodox Images, in making Gain of Images, in painting them too wantonly;</hi> but besides, it doth say, <hi>that all Superstition be removed in the Sacred Use of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> but it doth not say in <hi>the Worship of them;</hi> and so it may relate to <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Divination.</hi> But that the Council could not prevent, or design to prevent the <hi>Abuses</hi> mention'd in the Worship of Images, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> allows the highest Relative Worship to be given to them; it setting no bounds to it, so it be for the sake of the Prototypes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It allows a Worship to be given to the Images themselves too; for it confirms the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which decreed an inferiour Adoration to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It disapproves no Customs then practised among them in the Worship of Images; which were all known, and by many complained of, both as Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to them, and the carrying of them about in Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the solemn Consecration of them; the Form whereof is not only inserted, but inlarged in the new
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57901:10"/>
Pontifical since the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> And it is to be observed, that in the old Pontifical, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1511. there is no Form for consecrating an Image; in that of <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> it is inserted, but out of <hi>Durandus;</hi> but in that of <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> it is put in more largely, and as authentically as if it had been always there. And is not this the way to reform the Worship of Images?</p>
            <p>To come now to our Author's Reflections on the <hi>Misrepresentation</hi> he saith hath been made as to this Point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A Papist represented, believes it damnable to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Stocks and Stones for Gods; to pray to Pictures or Images of Christ, the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>or any other Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Expressions are capable of a double sense, and therefore this is not fair Representing.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>To worship Stocks or Stones for Gods,</hi> may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy two things. (1.) To believe the very Stocks and Stones to be Gods. And this we do not charge them with. (2.) To give to Images made of Wood and Stone, the Worship due only to God; and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Fact, to make them <hi>Gods,</hi> by giving them <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> And if they will clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of this, they must either prove that <hi>external Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is no part of Divine Worship, (notwithstanding the Scripture makes it so, and all the rest of Mankind look upon it as such, even Jews, Turks, and Infidels) or that their external Adoration hath no respect to the Images (which is contrary to the Council of <hi>Trent)</hi> or that Divine Worship being due to the Being Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, it may be likewise given to the Image. And how then could the Gnosticks be condemned for giving Divine Worship to the Image of Christ, which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> confesses; and is affirmed by <hi>Irenaeus, Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and <hi>Damascen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57901:11"/>
(2.) <hi>To pray to Images of Christ, or the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> may likewise be taken in two senses. (1.) To pray to them, so as to expect to be heard by the meer Images, and so we do not charge them with it. (2.) To pray to them, so as to expect to be rather heard by themselves for praying to them by their Images. And if this be not so, to what end are the Prayers made in the Consecration of Images, for those that shall pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them? To what purpose do so many go in long Pilgrimages to certain Images, if they do not hope to be better heard for praying there?</p>
            <p>But he goes on, 2. <hi>He keeps them by him indeed, to keep in his mind the memory of the things represented by them.</hi> And is this all in good Truth? We will never quarrel with them, if this be true Representing. No, that he dares not say.</p>
            <p>But, 3. <hi>He is taught to use them,</hi> p. 2. But how? <hi>by casting his Eye upon the Pictures or Images, and thence to raise his heart to the Prototypes.</hi> And is this all yet? No.</p>
            <p>But, 4. He finds a double conveniency in the use of them. (1.) <hi>They represent at one glance;</hi> and Men may easily make <hi>good</hi> Reflections, as <hi>upon the sight of a Death's Head, or old</hi> Time <hi>painted with his Forelock, Hour-glass,</hi> and <hi>Syth.</hi> And will he undertake, that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges shall be used in Churches for no other End? Was the Picture of old <hi>Time</hi> ever <hi>Consecrated,</hi> or placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Altar,</hi> or elsewhere, <hi>that it might be worshipped?</hi> as the <hi>Roman Catechism</hi> speaks of their Images. (2.) <hi>They cure Distractions; for they call back his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Thoughts to the right Object.</hi> What is this <hi>Right Object?</hi> the Image, or the Person represented? And that must be either a Creature, or God himself. If it be a Creature, doth not this imply that it is made a <hi>Right Object of Worship?</hi> If God himself, how doth an Image cure our Distraction, in the Worship of an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57901:11"/>
Infinite Invisible Being; when the very Image is most apt to distract our thoughts, by drawing them down from his Divine and Adorable Perfections, to the gross and mean Representations of an Image. But are we yet come to the utmost use of them? No.</p>
            <p>But, 5. <hi>He cannot but love, honour, and respect the Images themselves, for the sake of those they represent.</hi> Will this content them? And will he promise to go no further? It is hard to part upon Terms of meer <hi>Respect and Decent Regard,</hi> where there is no encroachment upon <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> And here we are at a stand.</p>
            <p>But he goes further. 6. And so he is come at last, <hi>to veneration before Images.</hi> And is this all? Dares he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>veneration to Images?</hi> When the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath determined it. <hi>Eis<expan>

Suarez</hi> saith, <hi>It is an Article of Faith, that Worship is to be given to them.</hi> But if the Veneration be only before them, why are they Consecrated, and set up in Places proper for Adoration?</p>
            <p>But, 7. <hi>To satisfy any one that he is far from making Gods of his Images, he is ready to break them into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pieces.</hi> What, a Consecrated Image? Dares he take a Crucifix from the Altar and tear it in pieces? This doth not look like <hi>the Love, Honour, and Respect</hi> he mentioned before, not to name <hi>Veneration.</hi> And I am afraid this is a strain beyond true Representing: Yet at length he hath found some pretty Parallels for the <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Images</hi> themselves; and so we are come at last to the main Point. But this is not directly owned; yet in the way of his Representing, it is fairly insinuated by his Parallels.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57901:12"/>
1. <hi>A Christian loves and honours his Neighbour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he bears the Image of God in his Soul.</hi> But doth he therefore take him and set him before him when he kneels at his Devotion, to raise his Mind, and cure his Distractions? Would he set him upon the Altar, and burn Incense before him, because of the Image of God in him? Is there no difference between the <hi>Object of Christian Love,</hi> and of <hi>Divine Worship?</hi> Nor between a Spiritual Invisible Divine Image in the Souls of Men, and a Material and Corporeal Representation?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We may kiss and esteem the Bible, because it contains and represents to Us God's Word.</hi> But when we kiss and esteem the Bible, we remember the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is in it; and we dare not break his Law, when we pretend to honour his Word. But we think there is some difference between <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Respect</hi> to the <hi>Bible,</hi> and <hi>falling down</hi> before an Image. The Circumstances of the one declare it to be meer <hi>Respect,</hi> and a <hi>Religious Decency;</hi> and if the other be not <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Adoration,</hi> we know not what it is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A good Preacher is loved, because he minds Men of their Duty.</hi> But what should we say to him that should therefore <hi>kneel down and say his Prayers, and burn Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and Incense before him,</hi> out of a respect to his good Doctrine? Did S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or S. <hi>Paul</hi> like this, when Men would have worshipped them? A good Preacher would tell them of their Duty, as they did; and take Men off from the Worship of any Creature, animate or inanimate, and direct them to worship God alone, who made Heaven and Earth.</p>

            <head>II. <hi>Of Worshipping Saints.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FOr the clear stating this Controversy, these things are to be premised.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We do not charge them, <hi>that they make Gods of dead Men, i. e.</hi> that they believe the Saints to be Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Deities. For this our Author confesses <hi>were a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ost damnable Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We do not say, that the State of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with respect to the Worship of dead Men, is as bad as Heathenism. For we acknowledg the true Saints and Martyrs to have been, not only Good and Vertuous, but extraordinary Persons, in great Favour with God, and highly deserving our Esteem and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as well as Imitation; whereas the Heathen Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Men, were vile and wicked Men, and deserved not the common Esteem of Mankind, according to the Accounts themselves give of them. And we own the common Doctrine and Advantages of Christianity to be preserved in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We do not deny, that they do allow some exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts of Worship to be so proper to God alone, that they ought to be given to none else besides him. And this they call <hi>Latria;</hi> and we shall never dispute with them about the proper signification of a Word, when the Sense is agreed, unless they draw Inferences from it, which ought not to be allowed. To this <hi>Latria,</hi> they refer not only Sacrifice, but all that relates to it, as Temples, Altars, and Priests: so that by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to make these immediately and properly to the Honour of any Saint, is to make a God of that Saint, and to commit Idolatry.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57901:13"/>
4. They confess, that to pray to Saints to bestow Spiritual or Temporal Gifts upon us, were to give to them the Worship proper to God, who is the only Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of all good things. For else I do not understand, why they should take so much pains to let us know, that whatever the Forms of their Prayers and Hymns are, yet the Intention and Spirit of the Church, is only to desire them to pray for us, and to obtain things for us by their Intercession with God.</p>
            <p>But two things cannot be denied by them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they do use solemn Invocation of Saints in Places of Divine Worship, at the same time they make their Addresses to God himself withal the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of External Adoration, with bended Knees and Eyes lifted up to Heaven; and that this Practice is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Council <hi>Trent,</hi> which not only decrees a humble Invocation of them, but declares it to be impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety <note place="margin">Sect. 25.</note> to condemn mental and vocal Supplication to the Saints in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they do own making the Saints in Heaven to be their Mediators of Intercession, but not of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; although Christ be our Mediator in both sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>And upon these two Points, this Controversy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
            <p>Let us now see what our Representer saith to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His Church teaches him indeed, and he believes that it is good and profitable to desire the Intercession of the Saints reigning with Christ in Heaven; but that they are either</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Gods, or his Redeemers, he is no where taught, but detests all such Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two Ways of <hi>desiring the Intercession of others for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57901:13"/>
1. By way of <hi>Friendly Request,</hi> as an Act of mutual Charity; and so, no doubt, we may desire others here on Earth to pray for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of <hi>humble Supplication,</hi> with all the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts of Adoration: and we cannot think S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who refused any thing like <hi>Adoration</hi> from Men, would have been pleased to have seen Men fall down upon their Knees before them; and in the same posture of Devotion in which they were praying to Almighty God, to put their Names into the middle of their <hi>Litanies,</hi> and so pray them then to pray for them.</p>
            <p>But how are we sure that their Church teaches no more than this? I have read over and over the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Catechism</hi> about it, and I can find no such limitation of their sense there, where, if if any where, it ought to be found. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> mentions both the Prayers, and the Help and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Saints which they are to fly to. If this Help and Assistance be no more than their Prayers, why is it mentioned as distinct? Why is their reigning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Christ in Heaven spoken of, but to let us understand they have a Power to Help and Assist? For what is their Reigning to their Praying for us? But I have a further Argument to prove the Council meant more, <hi>viz.</hi> the Council knew the common Practices and Forms of Invocation then used and allowed, and the general Opinion, that the Saints had power to Help and Assist those who prayed to them. If the Council did not approve this, why did it insert the very words upon which that Practice was grounded? They likewise very well knew the Complaints which had been made of these things; and some of their own Communion cried shame upon some of their Hymns. <hi>Wiccli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Wicel. <hi>in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencho Abusuum.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57901:14"/>
downright Impiety, and horrible Superstition, and that others are wholly inexcusable. <hi>Lud. Vives</hi> had said, <note place="margin">Vives <hi>in Aug. de Civit. Dti, l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 27.</note> 
               <hi>He found little difference in the Peoples Opinion of their Saints in many things, from what the Heathens had of their Gods.</hi> These things were known, and it was in their Power to have redressed them, by declaring what the sense of the Council was, and that whatever Forms were used, no more was to be understood by them, but <hi>praying to them to pray for them.</hi> Besides, the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the very same Session, took care <hi>about Reforming the Missal and Breviary;</hi> why was no care taken to Reform these <hi>Prayers and Hymns,</hi> which they say are not to be construed by <hi>the Sense of the Words,</hi> but by <hi>the Sense of the Church?</hi> There was time enough taken for doing it; for the <hi>Reformed Missal</hi> was not published till six Years after the <hi>Council,</hi> nor the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary</hi> till four. In all that time, the <hi>Prayers and Hymns</hi> might easily have been altered to the <hi>Sense of the Church,</hi> if that were truly so. But instead of that, a very late French Writer cries out <hi>of the necessity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Breviaries as to these things;</hi> wherein he <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Entritiens de P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ilalethe &amp; Philerene.</hi> Part 2. p. 160, 163, 165.</note> confesses, <hi>Many Hymns are still remaining, wherein those things are asked of Saints, which ought to be asked of God alone; as being delivered from the Chains of our Sins, being preserved from spiritual Maladies and Hell Fire; being inflamed with Charity, and made fit for Heaven. In good Conscience,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not this joining the Saints with God himself, to ask those things of them which God alone can give?</hi> And whatever Men talk of <hi>the Sense of the Church,</hi> he confesses, <hi>the very Forms, and natural Sense of the Words, do raise another Idea in Mens Minds; which ought to be prevented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But doth not the Roman Catechism explain this to be the sense of the Church?</hi> I have examined that too, with all the care I could, about this Matter. And I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57901:14"/>
cannot find any Necessity from thence of putting this Sense upon them. I grant in one place, where it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains <hi>the difference of the Invocation of God and Saints,</hi> it saith, <hi>We are to pray to God as the Giver, and to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Catech. Rom.</hi> Part 4. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Saints that they would obtain things of God for us;</hi> and then it adds, <hi>the Forms differ, that to God</hi> is <hi>Miserere Nobis</hi> and <hi>Audi Nos;</hi> that to Saints is, <hi>Ora pro Nobis.</hi> Very well! And is there then no other Form owned or allowed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to Saints besides this? Hold a little, saith the <hi>Catechism,</hi> for <hi>it is lawful to make use of another Form;</hi> and that is, <hi>we may pray to Saints too, Ut nostri misereantur.</hi> And how doth this now differ from that to God, but only in Number? But it adds, <hi>that the Saints are very pittiful;</hi> then surely we are encouraged to pray to them for <hi>help and pitty. Yes,</hi> saith the <hi>Catechism, we may pray to them, that being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with pity towards us, they would help us with their Favour and Intercession with God.</hi> But yet this doth not clear the Matter; for elsewhere the <hi>Roman Catechism</hi> attributes more to <hi>Saints</hi> than meer <hi>Intercession;</hi> and we may pray to them for what is in their Power: For where it undertakes to give an exact Account of the <note place="margin">

               </hi> of <hi>Saints and Angels;</hi> it there parallels them with <hi>Magistrates under a King;</hi> and saith, <hi>they are God's Ministers in governing the Church; Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi itaque sunt quod &amp; perpetuo Deum intuentur, &amp; Patrocinium Salutis nostrae libentissime suscipiunt.</hi> What is this <hi>Patrocinium falutis nostrae?</hi> Is it only <hi>Praying and Intercession with God?</hi> That cannot be, for it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances presently in <hi>deliverances by Angels, and</hi> Jacob<hi>'s praying to the Angel to bless him,</hi> and not meerly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for him. <hi>But though this is spoken of Angels,</hi> yet from hence it infers the <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> too. But what need we insist more on this, since they do own the <hi>Ministry of Saints</hi> as well as Angels, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57901:15"/>
to the Church; and do <hi>Canonize Saints</hi> for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Countries, as lately <hi>S. Rosa</hi> for <hi>Peru.</hi> And where there is such a particular Protection supposed, what incongruity is it to interpret the Form of their Prayers, according to a Doctrine so received and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? But of this more under the next Head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He confesses that we are all redeemed by the Blood of Christ alone, and that he is our only Mediator of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but as for Mediators of Intercession, he doth not doubt but it is acceptable with God we should have many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would ask concerning this Distinction, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion which <hi>Christ</hi> asked concerning <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptism, Is it from Heaven, or of Man?</hi> No doubt there may be such a Distinction of <hi>Mediators,</hi> if God please to make them. But who hath Authority to appoint <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators</hi> with him besides himself? Is it not usurping his Prerogative, to appoint the great Officers of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for him? Would any Prince upon Earth allow this, <hi>viz.</hi> when he hath absolutely declared his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that his own Son should present Petitions to him, that others shall take upon them to set up Masters of Requests themselves? Can any thing be plainer in the New Testament, than that God hath appointed the <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> to be our <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 14. 13, 14, 16, 23, 24. Heb. 7. 25. &amp; 9. 7, 24. 1 Jo. 2. 1.</note> And that his <hi>Intercession</hi> is founded upon his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi> As the <hi>High Priest</hi>'s going into the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> to intercede for the People, was upon the <hi>Blood of the Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Expiation,</hi> which he carried in with him. If there were no Revelation in this Matter, there might be some reason for it. But since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is so clear in it, this Distinction looks just like the <hi>Socinians</hi> Distinction of a <hi>God by Nature,</hi> and a <hi>God by Office;</hi> which was framed on purpose to avoid the plain Texts of Scripture which called Christ <hi>God.</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57901:15"/>
So doth this look as if it were intended to avoid that clear Text, which saith, <hi>There is but one Mediator between</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus.</hi> Which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ently answered with this Distinction; although there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e not the least ground in that or any other Text for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yes,</hi> saith our Author, Moses <hi>was such a Mediator for the Israelites;</hi> Job <hi>for his three Friends;</hi> Stephen <hi>for his Persecutors: The Romans were desired by S.</hi> Paul <hi>to be his Mediator, and the</hi> Corinthians <hi>and</hi> Ephesians; <hi>so almost every sick Person desires the Congregation to be his Mediator, that is, to be remembred in their Prayers,</hi> p. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>But is there no difference between Men praying for one another, and desiring others to pray for them here on Earth, and an <hi>humble Invocation</hi> of the <hi>Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to be our <hi>Mediators</hi> of <hi>Intercession</hi> with God there? There is a threefold disparity in the Case.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here upon Earth we converse with one another as Fellow-Creatures, and there is no danger of our having an Opinion thereby, that we are able to assist one another any other way than by our Prayers. But the Case is very different as to the Saints in Heaven, who by being addressed to there by such solemn Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, may too easily be conceived to have the Power of bestowing such Blessings upon those who call upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Heaven is looked on by all Mankind who direct their Devotions thither, as the particular Throne of God, where he dwells, and discovers himself after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner than he doth upon the Earth. And we are directed to pray to our <hi>Father in Heaven;</hi> where he is represented as infinitely above all his Creatures; and the great Concernment of Religion is, to keep up the apprehension of this distance between him and them.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57901:16"/>
Now it is hardly possible to keep it up, if in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices of Religion, in the solemnest postures of Devotion, with Eyes lifted up to Heaven, they do make Addresses, both to God and to his Creatures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men are sure, when they pray to others on Earth, to pray for them, that they do no more than they can justify in point of Discretion, when they speak or write to those that can understand what their desire is; but no Man on Earth can be certain that the Saints in Heaven can do it: For it is agreed they cannot do it without Revelation, and no Man can be assured there is a Revelation; and it is not reasonable to expect it; for they pray to Saints to pray to God for them; and they cannot tell what they pray for, unless God to whom they are to prav, reveal to them what it is they must pray to him for. Is it not then the better, the safer, the wiser way, to make our Prayers to him, who we are sure is able to hear and help us; and hath promised to grant what we ask in his Son's Name? But there is no other Name, either under Heaven, or in Heaven, whereby we can be saved, or our Prayers accepted, but His alone.</p>
            <p>But our Author saith, <hi>It is no part of his Faith, how the Saints in Heaven know the Prayers and Necessities of such who address themselves to them,</hi> p. 5.</p>
            <p>But how comes it to be any part of his Faith, that they know them? <hi>However he doth not doubt but God can never want means of letting the Saints know them,</hi> p. 6. And is this a sufficient ground for solemn Invocation of Saints? God doth not want Means to let the Emperor of <hi>Japan</hi> know a Request any one here hath to make to him; but is this a reasonable Ground, for him at this distance to make it to him?

truly Christian-Reformation in the Church; but would this be a Ground sufficient for me at this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to make a Speech to him about it? I knew a Man who understood not a word of Latin, but yet would needs go hear a Latin Sermon: some asked him afterwards, what he meant by it? and the chief Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he gave was much like this, <hi>God did not want Means to let him know what the Preacher meant.</hi>

            <head>III. <hi>Of Addressing more Supplications to the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>than to Christ.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HEre is no need of farther stating the Question; this only relating to the extraordinary Service of the Blessed Virgin. And therefore we are presently to attend his Motions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He believes it damnable to think the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>more powerful in Heaven than Christ, or that she can in any thing command him,</hi> p. 6.</p>
            <p>But in good earnest, Is it not damnable, unless a Man thinks the Blessed Virgin <hi>more powerful than Christ?</hi> Suppose one should think her to have <hi>an equal share of Power with Christ;</hi> Is this damnable, or not? Is it not setting up a Creature equal with God?</p>
            <p>But what thinks he then of those who have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an universal Dominion to her, over Angels, Men, and Devils? What thinks he not only of Psalters, but of a Creed, Litany, and all the Hymns of Scripture being applied to her? All which was done by a Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Bonavent. <hi>Opust. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>ad sin.</hi>

And there we find something more than an <hi>Ora pro nobis</hi> in the <hi>Litany;</hi> for there is <hi>Parce nobis Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> Spare us, Good Lady: and <hi>ab omni malo, libera nos Domina:</hi> From all Evil, Good Lady, deliver us.</p>
            <p>What thinks he of another Canonized Saint, who said, <note place="margin">

which way the Guides of that Church incline by this following passage. About ten years since a Gentleman of that Communion published a Book, called, <hi>Wholsome Advice to the Worshippers of the blessed Virgin;</hi> and the whole design of it, being printed in Latin and French, was to bring the People of that Church to a bare <hi>Ora</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

            <p>Here I have reason to enquire, Whether the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> then, according to the sense of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> be only a <hi>Mediatrix</hi> of <hi>Intercession</hi> or not, since so large Power and Dominion is attributed to her? And why should not her Suppliants go beyond an <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> if this Doctrine be received; as it must be, if the contrary cannot be endured? For that Author allowed her <hi>Intercession, and Prayer to her</hi> on that account; but he found fault with those who said <hi>she had a Kingdom</hi>

            <p>But we have a fresh Instance of this kind at home, in a Book very lately published; <hi>Permissu Superiorum.</hi> There we are told in the Epistle, That not only <hi>the</hi>

               <hi>Blessed Virgin is the Empress of Seraphims—the most exact Original of Practical Perfection which the Omnipotency of God ever drew; but that by innumerable Titles she claims the utmost Duty of every Christian, as a proper Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to her Greatness.</hi> What can be said more of the Son of God in our Nature? In the Book it self she is said <note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:57901:18"/>
to be Queen of Angels, Patroness of the Church, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of Sinners; that the Power of <hi>Mary</hi> in the Kingdom of Jesus, is suitable to her Maternity, and <note place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> other Priviledges of Grace; and therefore by it she just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claims a Servitude from all pure Creatures. But wherein doth this special Devotion to her consist? He names several Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In having an inward, cordial and passionate value of the Maternity of <hi>Mary,</hi> and all other Excellencies proper to, and inseparable from the Mother of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In External Acts of Worship, of eminent Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards her, by reason of the Amplitude of her Power in the Empire of Jesus. And can we imagine these should go no farther, than a poor <hi>Ora pro Nobis?</hi> He instances in these External Acts of her Worship. (1.) <hi>Frequent visiting holy Places dedicated to her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> And are not those her Temples then? which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confesses to be a peculiar part of the Worship <note place="margin">

               </note> due to God. And the Distinction of <hi>Basilicae</hi> cannot hold here: because he believes the Assumption of the B. Virgin; and he will not pretend <hi>to her Honour</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Discrimination. (2.) A special Reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Images representing her Person. (3.) Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming some daily Devotions containing her Praises, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating her Excellency, or imploring her Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by oft calling upon the Sacred Name of holy <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In having a firm and unshaken Confidence in her Patronage amidst the greatest of our inward Conflicts, and outward Tribulations; through a strong Judgment of her eminent Power within the Empire of Jesus, grounded upon the singular Prerogative of her Divine Maternity. I have not Patience to transcribe more, but refer the Reader to the Book it self; only the eighth Particular of special Devotion is so remarkable, that it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57901:19"/>
ought not to be passed over, <hi>viz. Entring a solemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>to be for ever her Servant, Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Devote under some special Rule, Society or</hi>

               <note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note>

            </q>
            <p>I think I need mention no more; only three things I shall observe, (1.) That this is now printed <hi>Permissis Superiorum;</hi> and we thank them for the seasonableness of it, in helping us in <hi>true Representing,</hi> what their allowed Doctrines and Practices are. (2.) That this is published English, that our People as well as theirs; may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced how far we have been from unjust charging them as to such things as these. (3.) That at the same time they plead for keeping the Bible out of the hands of the People, wherein their Discretion is so far to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, since the Scripture, and this new Scheme of Devotion, can never stand together. There being not one word in the Bible towards it, but very much against it; and the Psalms and Hymns must be <hi>burlesqu'd</hi> to found that way.</p>
            <p>But what saith our Author to their <hi>Rosaries,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are <hi>ten Ave Maries to one Pater noster;</hi> which is accounted a special piece Devotion; and great things are said of the Effects of it by <hi>Alanus de Rupe,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> he saith, <hi>there is no more Dishonour to God in reciting the Angelical Salutation, than</hi>

But it may not be altogether so pertinent. But doth he really think they said the whole <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> as it is used among them? Did the Angel and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> say, <hi>Sancta Maria, Mater Dei? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p n="2">2.

            <head>IV. <hi>Of paying Divine Worship to Reliques.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FOR the right understanding this Controversy, we are to consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a due Veneration to the Bodies of Saints and Martyrs, allowed on both sides; and there is an undue Worship of them, which is disowned on both sides. The due Veneration is, a Religious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency to be observed towards them; which lies in avoiding any thing like Contempt or Dishonour to them, and using all such Testimonies of Respect and Decency, which becomes the Remains of Excellent Persons; provided we are satisfied of their Sincerity, without having recourse to Divine Omnipotency to prove them; which <hi>Ferrandus</hi> the Jesuit runs so much to, to prove the Truth of many Reliques, worshipped in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in many places at once. But that it is possible to exeeed in the Worship of true Reliques,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57901:20"/>
even <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confesseth, who says, that God took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Body of <hi>Moses,</hi> lest the People should give Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship to it. And St. <hi>Jerom</hi> as hot as he was against <hi>Vig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>De Imag. Sanct. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> Adoration to the Reliques of Martyrs. It seems then it is very possible to exceed that way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Question then is, Whether those Acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which are allowed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do not go beyond due Veneration? For it is unreasonable to suppose those who give it, to believe those Reliques to be Gods; and therefore it must be such a Worship as is given to them, supposing them to be only Reliques of such Persons. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> decrees Honour and Veneration to be given to them, but never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines what is due, and what not: it forbids all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses in drinking and eating, in the visiting of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; but not a word of Excesses in worshipping of them, unless it be comprehended under the name of Superstition. But <hi>Superstition</hi> lies in something forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, according to their notion of it: therefore, if there be no Prohibition by the Church, there can be no Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition in the Worship of them. And if they had thought there had been any in the known Practices of the Church, they would certainly have mentioned them; and because they did not, we ought in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to look on them as allowed. And yet not only <hi>Cassander</hi> complains of the great Superstition about them; but even the <hi>Walenbergii</hi> lately confess, that the <note place="margin">

            <p>But what saith our <hi>Representer</hi> to them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He believes it damnable to think there's any Divinity in the Reliques of Saints, or to adore them with Divine Honour.</hi> P. 7. But what is this adoring them with Divine Honour? A true Representer ought to have told
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57901:21"/>
us what he meant by it, when the whole Controversy depends upon it. Is it only saying Mass to Reliques, or believing them to be Gods? Is there no giving Divine Honour by Prostration, burning of Incense, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in expecting help from them? Yes, <hi>if it be from any hidden Power of their own.</hi> But here is a very hard Question: If a Man doth not believe it to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick Power in the Reliques, may a Man safely go to them, <hi>Opis impetrandae causà,</hi> as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> saith, in hopes of Relief from them? Is it not possible for the Devil to appear with <hi>Samuel</hi>'s true Body, and make use of the Relique of a Saint to a very bad end? Then, say I, no Reliques can secure Men against the Imposture of Evil Spirits, who, by God's Permission, may do strange things with the very Reliques of Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But God hath visibly worked by them,</hi> saith our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>by making them Instruments of many Miracles; and it is as easie for him to do it now.</hi> P. 8, 9. This is the force of all he saith. To which I answer, (1.) It is a very bold thing to call in God's Omnipotency, where God himself hath never declared he will use his Power; for it is under his own Command, and not ours. But there is no Reason to deduce the Consequence of using it now, because he hath done it formerly. And that they may not think this is cavilling in us, I desire them <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rabat. Joy de Jasenists, A. D.</hi> 1656.</note> to read <hi>Pere Annat</hi>'s Answer to the Jansenists pretended Miracle at <hi>Port Royal,</hi> viz. of the Cure wrought by one of our Saviour's Thorns. There he gives another account of such Miracles than would be taken from us. But where he saith, <hi>It is as much for the Honour of God's Name to work such Miracles now;</hi> their own Authors will tell him the contrary; and that there is no such Reason now, as in former times, when Religion was to be confirmed by them; and when Martyrs suffered upon the sole account of the Truth of it; and therefore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57901:21"/>
their Reputation had a great Influence upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the unbelieving World. (2.) Suppose it be granted, yet it proves not any Religious Worship to be given to them. For I shall seriously ask an important Question: Whether they do really believe, any greater Miracles have ever been done by Reliques, than were done by the Brazen Serpent? And yet, altho that was set up by God's own Appointment, when it began to be worshipped after an undue manner, it was thought fit by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to be broken in pieces. What now was the undue Worship they gave to it? Did they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Serpent, which could neither move nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, was it self a God? <hi>But they did burn Incense to it.</hi> And did that make a God of it? Suppose Men burn Incense to Reliques; What then, are they made Gods presently? Suppose they do not, but place them upon Altars, carry them in Procession, fall down before them, with intention to shew the Honour they do them; are not these as much as burning a little Incense, which could not signifie so much Honour as the other do? and it is hard then to make the one unlawful, and not the other.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. The Question is far enough from being, Whether it be lawful to commit Idolatry? as our <hi>Representer</hi> puts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57901:22"/>
it. For the Misrepresenter saith, <hi>That a Papist believes it lawful to commit Idolatry:</hi> and to clear this, our Author gravely saith, <hi>He believes it unlawful to commit Idolatry. Pag.</hi> 9. As tho any Men ever owned it to be lawful: Which is, as if the Question were, Whether such a Man committed Adultery, and he should think to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by saying, he believed it unlawful to commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Question is not, Whether Christ may be lawfully adored by us in the Celebration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist; which we are so far from denying, that our Church requires our receiving it in the posture of Adoration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The true Question is, Whether the Body of Christ, being supposed to be present in the Host by Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, be a sufficient ground to give the same Adoration to the Host, which they would do to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ?</p>
               <p>And that this is the true state of the Question, will appear by these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> first defined Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and from thence inferred <hi>Adoration of the Host;</hi> as is most evident to any one that will read the fourth and fifth Decrees of the <hi>13th</hi> Session. <hi>Nullus ita<expan>

It's true, the sixth Canon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaks of <hi>Christ being there worshipped;</hi> but that ought to be compared with the first, second, and fourth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, where the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is fully set down, as the Foundation of that <hi>Adoration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Adoration</hi> is not fixed on the <hi>Person of Christ, as separate from the Host,</hi> but as making <hi>one Object</hi> of Worship together with it. And so the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declares in the sixth Decree; when it saith, <hi>The Sacrament is never the less to be adored, because it was</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:57901:22"/>
                  <hi>instituted to be received.</hi> This cannot be otherwise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, than as relating to the Sacrament: and so <hi>that</hi> whatever it be, must be granted to be the Object of Adoration. <q>By the Sacrament, saith Cardinal <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavicini,</hi> is understood the Object made up of the Body of Christ, and the Accidents.</q> The Worship then <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pallavicin. Hist. Concil. Trident.</hi> l. 12. c. 6.</note> being confessed to be Adoration, which is due to God alone, and that Adoration directed to the Sacrament as its proper Object; the Question now is, Whether such a Supposition in the Sacrament, doth justify that Adoration?</p>
               <p>Our Author saith, <hi>He accounteth it most damnable to worship or adore any Breaden God, or to give Divine Honour to any Elements of Bread and Wine,</hi> p. 9.</p>
               <p>Then, I say, by his own confession, if it be only Bread, he commits Idolatry; for the Adoration he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny. But our <hi>Representer</hi> loves ambiguous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, which to the People sound very well, but have no sincere meaning: for what is it he understands by his <hi>Breaden God?</hi> If it be that he worships a God which himself supposes to be nothing but Bread, we do not charge him with it; but if it be what we believe it to be, the Substance of Bread, but himself believes to be turned into the Body of Christ, then he cannot deny his Adoration to be given to it.</p>
               <p>All that can excuse them is, the Supposition; and whether that will or not, is now to be consider'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be not true, themselves grant it to be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. The Testimonies of Bishop <hi>Fisher,</hi> and <hi>Coste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>

this Reason for it; because Christ is not worshipped simply in the Sacrament, but as he is under the Species; and therefore if he be not so present, a Creature hath Divine Worship given it. As those were guilty of Idolatry, who worshipped any Creatures of old, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing God to be there, as that he was the Soul of the World.

Yet here would be a Mistake, and a gross one; yet the Mistake would not excuse the Persons committing it from most damnable Idolatry, as he confesses: Why then should the other Mistake ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them, when they suppose the Substance of the Bread not to be there, but the Body of Christ to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Species? <hi>Yes,</hi> say they, <hi>then no Creature is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be the Object of Worship.</hi> But when the Bread is supposed to be God, it must be supposed not to be a Creature.

               <p>Three Things our Author goes upon, with respect to this.</p>

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:57901:23"/>
2. He shews the possibility of it, from God's Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency. <note place="margin">P. 9, 10, 11, 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He argues against the Testimony or Evidence of Sense or Reason in this Case, from some pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Instances, as he thinks.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He believes Jesus Christ made his words good, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced at his last Supper, really giving his Body and Blood to his Apostles; the Substance of Bread and Wine being, by his powerful words, changed into his own Body and Blood; the Species only, or Accidents of the Bread and Wine, remaining as before. The same he believes of the Eucharist consecrated now by Priests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a very easy way, of taking it for granted that the words are clear for Transubstantiation. And from no better Ground, to fly to God's Omnipotency to make it good, is as if one should suppose Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be turned into a Rock, a Vine, a Door; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the words are every jot as clear, and then call in God's Omnipotency, which is as effectual to make them good. I confess, these words are so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear to me for Transubstantiation, that if I had never heard of it, I should never have thought of it, from these or any other words of Scripture, <hi>i. e.</hi> not barely considering the sound of words, but the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Idioms of speaking; the Circumstances of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's real Body at that time when he spake them; the uncouth way of feeding on Christ's real Body, without any Objection made against it by his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. The Key our Saviour elsewhere gives for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the manner of eating his Flesh; and withal, if these words be literally and strictly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, they must make the Substance of Bread to be Christ's Body; for that is unavoidably the literal sense of the words. For can any Men take <hi>This</hi> to be any
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57901:24"/>
thing but this Bread, who attend to the common sense and meaning of Words, and the strict Rules of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation? Yet this sense will by no means be allow'd; for then all that can be infer'd from these words is, that when Christ spake these words, <hi>The Bread was his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> But either Christ meant the <hi>Bread</hi> by <hi>This,</hi> or he did not; if he did, the former Proposition is unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in the literal Sense: if he did not, then by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of these words, the Bread could never be turned into the Body of Christ. For that only could be made the Body of Christ which was meant, when Christ said, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> This seems to me to be as plain and convincing as any Demonstration in <hi>Euclid.</hi> Which hath often made me wonder at those who talk so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of the plain Letter of Scripture, being for this Doctrine of Transubstantiation. But several Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> understood themselves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and have confessed, That this Doctrine could not be drawn out of the literal sense of these words; as it were easy to shew, if it had not been lately done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It is enough here to observe, that <hi>Vasquez</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <note place="margin">

If that Proposition were literally true, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the change; For how can a thing be changed into that which it is already?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He believes Christ being equal to his Father in Truth and Omnipotency, can make his Words good.</hi> We do not in the least dispute Christ's Omnipotency, but we may their familiar way of making use of it to help them out, when Sense and Reason fail them. And therefore <hi>Cajetan</hi> well said; <q>We ought not to dispute <note place="margin">

about God's Absolute Power in the Doctrine of the Sacraments, being things of such constant use; and that it is a foolish thing to attribute to the Sacrament all that God can do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But we must consider what he saith against <hi>Sense and Reason. For the believing this Mystery, he does not at all think it meet for any Christian to appeal from Christ's Words, to his own Senses or Reason, for the examining the Truth of what he hath said, but rather to submit his Senses and Reason to Christ's Words in the obsequiousness of Faith.</hi> What! whether we know this to be the meaning of Christ's Words, or not? And thus we shall be bound to submit to every absurd Interpretation of Scripture, because we must not use our Senses or Reason for examining the Truth of what is said there. Can any thing be plainer said in Scripture, than that God hath Eyes, and Ears, and Hands? Must now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man yield to this in the obsequiousness of Faith, without examining it by Principles of Common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? And we think we are therefore bound to put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sense upon those Expressions, because they imply a Repugnancy to the Divine Perfections. Why not then where something is implied which is repugnant to the Nature of Christ's Body, as well as to our Senses? But the Question about judging in this Matter by our Senses, is not, as our Author is willing to suppose, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether our Senses are to be believed, against a clear and express Divine Revelation; but whether the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Senses and Reason is not to be made use of for finding out the true sense of this Revelation? And we think there is great reason for it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Because we have no more certain way of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Substance of a Body, than by our Senses. We do not say our Senses go beyond the Accidents; but we say, our Senses, by those Accidents, do assure us of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57901:25"/>
bodily Substance, or else it were impossible for us to know there is any such thing in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Because Christ did himself appeal to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Disciples Senses concerning the Truth of his own Body after the Resurrection; <hi>Behold my Hands and my Feet, that it is I my self: handle and see, for a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">S. Luk. 24. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as ye see me have.</hi> Now we think we have Reason to allow the same <hi>Criterion</hi> which Christ himself did about the very same Body. Unless he had then told his Disciples, that there was to be <hi>another supernatural manner of Existence</hi> of the same Body, concerning which their Senses were not to be Judges.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Some of the most important Articles of the Christian Faith do suppose the Judgment of our Senses to be true. As about the Truth of Christ's Body; whether he had really a Body, or only the outward Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Appearance of a Body: if he had not, he did not really suffer upon the Cross, and so the Sacrifice of Propitiation there offered up to the Father for the Sins of Mankind is lost. There was a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Time, and afterwards, Whether Christ had any real Body? Those who denied it, brought Revelation for it; those who asserted it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it by their Senses, as S. <hi>John</hi> himself, <hi>That which we have seen, and heard, and our hands have handled; &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">S. Joh. 1. 1, 3.</note> He doth not tell Men, they must submit their Sense and Reason to the pretence of Revelation; but they ought to adhere to the Judgment of their Senses concerning the Reality of Christ's Body. Since therefore Christ himself appealed to it, the Apostles made use of it, without any Caution or Limitation, we have great reason to rely still on the Judgment of our Senses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same Object, <hi>viz.</hi> the Body of Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But we must now consider his Instances to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57901:25"/>
the Judgment of our Senses and Reason in this Point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He believes Christ to be God, though to Senses he seemed nothing but Man.</hi> Do we ever pretend to judg of Christ's Divinity by our Senses? How then can this be pertinent, when our only Dispute is about judging his Body, and the Substance of Bread and Wine by them? And yet the Senses were of great use as to the proof of his Divinity by the Miracles which he wrought? which if they had been like the pretended Miracles in Transubstantiation, could have convinced no Man, because they could never see them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He believes the Holy Ghost descended on our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, though Senses or Reason could discover it to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Dove.</hi> If there were no reason to judg otherwise, the Judgment of Sense were to be followed: but since the Scripture declares it was the Holy Ghost descending as a Dove, we have no reason to question that Revelation. For we do not pretend that our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are so far Judges of Divine Appearances, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the possibility of God's assuming the shape and figure of his Creature when he pleases, by moulding the substance of a real Body into such a Representation. Thus we do not deny the possibility of an appearance of the Holy Ghost under Bread and Wine, if God thought fit, any more than under a Dove; and in this Case we do not pretend that our Senses can exclude the presence of a Spirit under the Elements; but that is very different from the present Case, for here the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is supposed to be gone, and nothing but Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents remaining; and no spiritual Presence of Christ is denied, but that of his Body, the very same Body which suffered on the Cross.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He believes the Man who appeared to</hi> Joshua, (ch. 5. 13.); <hi>and the three Men to</hi> Abraham, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 18.)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57901:26"/>
                  <hi>were really and substantially no Men, notwithstanding all the Information and Evidence of Sense to the contrary, from their Colour, Features, Proportion, Talking, Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and many others.</hi> And what follows from hence, but that Spiritual Invisible Substances may be under the appearance of Bodies, and that our Senses cannot be Judges of them? Which is not our Question, but, Whether Bodies can be so present after the manner of Spirits, as to lose all the natural Properties of Bodies? and whether a Material Substance can be lost, under all the Accidents proper to it, so as our Senses cannot be proper Judges of one by the other?</p>
               <p>But our Author seems to grant this, in a natural way of the Existence of a Body: but he saith, <hi>Christ gives to his Body a supernatural manner of Existence, by which being left without extension of Parts, and rendred independent of Place, it may be one and the same in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Places at once, and whole in every part of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, and not obnoxious to any corporeal contingencies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is to me a Mystery beyond all comprehension by Sense or Reason; and there is certainly a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between governing our Understandings, and giving them up, as we must do if this Doctrine hold good; for it overthrows any fixed Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Mankind concerning the Nature and Properties of Bodies.</p>
               <p>For, 1. We must still suppose the Body of Christ to be the very same individual Body which suffered upon the Cross; but if it have no extension of Parts, and be reckoned independent upon Place, it ceaseth to be a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It is granted, that after a natural way of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, a Body cannot be in more Places than one; but let the way of Existence be what it will, if it be a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it must be finite; if finite, it must be limited and circumscribed; if it be circumscribed within one place,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57901:26"/>
it cannot be in more places, for that is to make it cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed, and not circumscribed; undivided from it self, and divided from it self at the same time. Which is a manifest Contradiction, which doth not depend only on Quantity or Extension, but upon the essential Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be possible for a Body to be in several Places by a Supernatural Existence; why may not the same Body be in several Places by a Natural Existence? Is it not because Extension and Circumscription are so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to it, that in a natural Way it can be but in one Place. Then it follows that these are essential Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Bodies; so that no true Body can be conceived without them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Supernatural Existence doth not hinder the Body's being individually present in on Place: My meaning is this; A Priest Consecrates an Host at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and another at <hi>York;</hi> is the Body of Christ at <hi>London,</hi> so present there by virtue of Consecration, as to be present at <hi>York</hi> too, by this Supernatural Existence: What then doth the Consecration at <hi>York</hi> produce? If it be not, then its Presence is limited to the Host, where the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made; and if it be so limited, then this superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Existence cannot take off its Relation to Place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The same Body would be liable to the greatest Contradictions imaginable: For the same Body after this supernatural way of Existence, may not only be above and below, within and without, near and far off from it self: but it may be hot and cold, dead and alive; yea, in Heaven and Hell at once.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What is it that makes it still a Body after this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural way of Existence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it lose extension and dependency on Place? If it be only an aptitude to extension, when that supernatural Existence is taken off, then it must either be without Quantity, or with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57901:27"/>
it. If it be without quantity, how can it be a Body? If with quantity, how is it possible to be without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension?</p>
               <p n="6">6. This confounds all the differencs of Greater and Less, as well as of Distance and Nearness. For upon this Supposition, a thing really greater may be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within a less: for the whole Original Body of Christ, with all its Parts, may be brought within the compass of a Waser; and the whole be in every part without any distance between Head and Feet.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This makes Christ to have but one Body, and yet to have as many Bodies as there are consecrated Hosts. No, saith our Author, <hi>This supernatural manner of Existence is without danger of multiplying his Body, or making as many Christs as Altars.</hi> P. 11. But how this can be, is past all human Understanding: For every Consecration hath its Effect, which is supposed to be the Conversion of the Substance of the Bread into the Body of Christ. Now, when a Priest at <hi>London</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the Bread into the Body of Christ there, he doth it not into the Body of Christ at <hi>York,</hi> but the Priest there doth it; therefore the Body of Christ at <hi>London,</hi> is different from that at <hi>York;</hi> or else the Conversion at <hi>London</hi> would be into the Body, as at <hi>York.</hi> But if not, what is the substantial Term of this substantial Change, where nothing but an accidental Mode doth follow? If there be any such Term, whether that must not be a Production of something which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and if it be so, Christ must have as many new Bodies, as there are Consecrations.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This makes that which hath no particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of its own, to be the Subject of a substantial Change; for this is the condition of Christ's Body, whatever its manner of Existence be, after the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical Union to the Divine Nature. For, when <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi>

From whence I infer, That the Body of Christ, having no proper Subsistence of its own, there can be no substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Change into that which hath no proper Subsistence, but into that which hath; and consequently the Change must be into the Divine Nature principally; from whence it will follow, the Elements losing their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, upon Consecration the Divinity must be united hypostatically to them, as to the Human Nature; and so there will be as many Hypostatical Unions, as there are Consecrations. And so this Doctrine not only confounds Sense and Reason, but the Mysteries of Christ's Incarnation too: Which I think is sufficient for this Head.</p>

            <head>VI. <hi>Of Merits and Good Works.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FOR the true stating this Controversy, we are to observe;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we do not charge those of the Church of <hi>Rome, That they believe Christ's Death and Passion to be ineffectual and insignificant, and that they have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the Merits of his Sufferings, or the Mercy of God for attaining Salvation; but that they are to be saved only by their own Merits and Good Works;</hi> as the Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter saith, <hi>Pag.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We do not charge them with denying the <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Divine Grace in order to Merit; or with asserting that they can merit independently thereupon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We do by no means dispute about the <hi>Necessity of</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57901:28"/>
               <hi>Good Works,</hi> in order to the Reward of another Life; or assert that Christ's Merits will save Men without <hi>working out their own Salvation;</hi> but do firmly believe, that <hi>God will judg Men according to their Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Question then is, <hi>Whether the Good Works of a just Man,</hi> as our Author expresses it, <hi>are truly merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of Eternal Life?</hi> Which he affirms, but qualifies with saying, <hi>That they proceed from Grace, and that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> 
               <hi>through God's Goodness and Promise, they are truly meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</hi> But the Council of <hi>Trent denounces an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema against those who deny the Good Works of justified</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Trident. Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>Can.</hi> 32.</note> 
               <hi>Persons, to be truly meritorious of the increase of Grace, and of Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then lies the Point in difference, (1.) Whether such Good Works can be said to be <hi>truly meritorious?</hi> (2.) Whether those who deny it, deserve an <hi>Anathema</hi> for so doing? As to what relates to <hi>God's Acceptance and Allowance, and his Goodness and Promise,</hi> we freely own all that he saith about it; and if no more be meant, what need an <hi>Anathema</hi> about this matter? There must therefore be something beyond this, when Good Works are not only said to be <hi>truly meritorious,</hi> but we are cursed if we do not say the same.</p>
            <p>To make any thing <hi>truly meritorious,</hi> we must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these Conditions requisite.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That what we pretend to merit by, be our own free Act.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it be not defective.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there be an Equality between it, and the Reward due to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That there be an Obligation in point of Justice, to give that Reward to him that doth it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57901:28"/>
And from these Considerations, we deny that, Good Works, even of justified Persons, can be <hi>truly meritorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is granted by themselves, That what is <hi>truly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious,</hi> must be a free Act of the Person who doth it. Now the Good Works of Justified Persons cannot <note place="margin">

If Men pretended to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit at anothers hands by what God gives, there were some colour for it; but to merit from God himself by what he gives us, seems very incongruous.

He may call it so himself, if he pleases, but that only shews his Kindness and Favour; but it doth not look very modestly or gratefully, for the Debtor to insist upon it as <hi>true legal Payment.</hi> Just so it is in good Works done by the power of God's Grace, which we could never have done without it; and therefore such cannot be <hi>truly Meritorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What is <hi>truly meritorious</hi> must not be defective; because the Proportion is to be equal between the Act, and the Reward due to it; which being perfect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that there be no Defect in the Acts which merit it. But this can never be said of Good Works of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Persons, that they have no Defects in them. We do not say, they are not Good Works, but they are not exact and perfect: for altho the Grace of God, as it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57901:29"/>
comes from him, be a perfect Gift; yet as it acts upon Mens Minds, it doth not raise them to such a degree, but that they have Imperfections in their best Actions. And whatever is defective, is faulty; whatever is faulty, must be forgiven; whatever needs forgiveness, cannot be <hi>truly meritorious.</hi> But not only their Good Works are defective; but if they would merit, they ought to have none but Good Works, whereas the mixture of others renders the good uncapable of being <hi>meritorious,</hi> because there is so much to be pardoned, as takes away all claim of <hi>Merit</hi> in the good they perform. And themselves do not pretend, that Men can merit the Grace of Remission; but it is very strange that those who cannot deserve to be forgiven, should deserve to have an infinite Reward bestowed upon them.</p>

               </note> Act and the Recompence: for to merit, is to pay a Price for a thing; and in such Acts of commutative Justice, there must be an Equality of one thing with another. But what Equality can there be between the imperfect Good Works of the best Men, and the most perfect Happiness of another World? especially when that consists in the fruition of the Beatifical Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For what Proportion can there be between our Acts towards God, and God's Acts towards the Blessed in Heaven? Let the Acts be of what Person soever, or of what Nature soever, or from what Principle soever; as long as they are the Acts of finite imperfect Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is impossible there should be any Equality, or exact Proportion between them and the Eternal Favour of God, which is the Reward promised.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Where Acts are <hi>truly meritorious,</hi> there follows an Obligation of strict Justice, to pay the Recompence due to them. But what strict Justice can there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Creator and his Creatures, to recompence
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57901:29"/>
the Service they are bound to perform; when their very Being, Power to act, Assistance in acting, and Recompence for it, are all from his Bounty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? But our Author would avoid all this, by saying, that though Good Works are <hi>truly meritorious;</hi> yet it is <hi>through the Merits of Christ, and as they proceed from Grace, and through his Goodness and Promise that they are so; i. e.</hi> they are truly meritorious, because it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from all these things they neither are, nor can be meritorious. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) How come the Merits of Christ to make Good Works <hi>truly meritorious?</hi> Are the Merits of Christ imputed to those Good Works? Then those Good Works must be as meritorous as Christ's own Works; which I suppose he will not assert. Or, is it that Christ hath merited the Grace whereby we may merit? But even this will not make our personal Acts truly meritorious; and the nature of Merit relates to the Acts, and not to the Power.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) How comes the Power of Grace to make them <hi>truly meritorious;</hi> when the Power of Grace doth so much increase the Obligation on our side? If it be said, <hi>That the state of Grace puts Men into a Capacity to merit:</hi> we might more reasonably infer the contrary, that it puts them out of a Capacity of meriting; because the Remission of Sins, and the Favour of God, are things for which we can never make him any Recompence.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) How comes a Divine Promise to make Acts truly meritorious? For God's Promise is an Act of meer Kindness, which is very different from strict Justice: and although by the Promise God binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to performance; yet how come those Acts to be more meritorious of Heaven, than the Acts of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are of Remission of Sins? Yet none will now say, that there can be any Acts meritorious of that.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57901:30"/>
Yet certainly there is as clear a Promise of Pardon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Repentance, as there is of Heaven upon Good Works: and if the Promise in the other case, doth not make Repentance meritorious of Pardon; how can it make Good Works truly meritorious of Eternal Life? But notwithstanding, we do not deny God's Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to his Promise may be called <hi>Justice;</hi> and so God, as a <hi>Righteous Judg,</hi> may give <hi>a Crown of Rightcousness</hi>

It is therefore to no purpose to produce out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and others, a great number of Citations, to prove that which we never deny; but if they hold to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> they must prove from the Fathers, that Sins after Baptism cannot be forgiven without Confession to Men: Which those who consider what they do, will never undertake, there being so many Testimonies of undoubted Antiquity against it.

            <p n="1">1. THey must be extreamly ignorant, who take the Power of Indulgences, to be <hi>a Leave from the Pope to commit what Sins they please; and that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof, they shall escape Punishment for their Sins, without repentance in another World.</hi> Yet this is the sense of the Misrepresentation which, he saith, is made of it. And if he saith true in his Preface, <hi>That</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>he hath described the Belief of a Papist, exactly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the apprehension he had when he was a Protestant:</hi> He shews how well he understood the Matters in Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57901:32"/>
when I think no other Person besides himself ever had such an apprehension of it, who pretended to be any thing like a Scholar.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>But now he believes it damnable to hold that the Pope, or any other Power in Heaven or Earth, can give him leave to commit any Sins whatsoever; or that for any Sum of Mony, he can obtain any Indulgence or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for Sins that are to be committed by him, or his Heirs hereafter.</hi> Very well! But what thinks he of obtaining an Indulgence, or Pardon, after they are committed? Is no such thing to be obtained in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for a Sum of Mony? He cannot but have heard of the <hi>Tax</hi> of the <hi>Apostolick Chamber for certain Sins,</hi> and what Sums are there set upon them. Why did he not as freely speak against this? This is published in the vast <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>Tracts</hi> of <hi>Canon Law,</hi> set forth by the <hi>Pope's Authority,</hi> where there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rates for Perjury, Murder, Apostacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now <note place="margin">

If they be small, it is so much the better Bargain, for the Sins are very great. And <hi>Espencaeus</hi> complains, that this Book was so far from being called in, that he saith, the Pope's <note place="margin">Espencae. <hi>in Ep. ad Tit. c.</hi> 1. <hi>degress.</hi> 2.</note> Legats renewed those Faculties, and confirmed them. It seems then a Sum of Mony may be of some conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence towards the obtaining Pardon for a Sin past, though not for a Licence to commit it. But what mighty difference is there, whether a Man procures with Mony a Dispensation, or a Pardon? For the Sin can hurt him no more, than if he had Licence to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He doth believe there is a Power in the Church to grant Indulgences; which,</hi> he saith, <hi>concern not at all the Remission of Sins, either Mortal or Venial, but only of some Temporal Punishments remaining due after the Guilt is remitted.</hi> Here now arises a Material Question,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57901:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the <hi>Popes,</hi> or the <hi>Representer,</hi> be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be believed. If the Popes, who grant the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences to be believed; then not only the bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins is concerned in them, but <hi>the Plenary,</hi> and <hi>most Plenary Remission of Sins</hi> is to be had by them. So <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> in his Bull of <hi>Jubilee</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Non solum plenam &amp; largiorem, imo plenissimam</hi>

D.</hi> 1671. <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> published an Indulgence upon the Canoniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of five new Saints, wherein he not only grants a Plenary Indulgence of Sins, but upon invocation of one of these Saints in the point of Death, a Plenary Indulgence of all his Sins. And what doth this signify in the point of Death, if it do not concern the Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Indulgences,</hi> he saith, <hi>are nothing else but a Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or Relaxation, upon just Causes, of Canonical Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which are or may be enjoyned by the Pastors of the</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57901:33"/>
               <hi>Church on penitent Sinners, according to their several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Demerits.</hi> If by Canonical Penances, they mean those enjoyned by the Penitential Canons, <hi>Greg. de Valentia</hi> saith, <hi>This Opinion differs not from that of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Greg. de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. <hi>de Indulg. c.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>the Hereticks, and makes Indulgences to be useless and dangerous things. Bellarmine</hi> brings several Arguments <note place="margin">Bell. <hi>de Indulg. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> against this Doctrine.  <q>(1.) There would be no need of the Treasure of the Church; which he had proved to be the Foundation of Indulgences. (2.) They would be rather hurtful than profitable, and the <hi>Church</hi>

The form of them doth express, that they do relate to God, and not only to the Church.</q> And this, I think, is sufficient to shew how far he is from true Representing the Nature of Indulgences; for we do not dispute the Churche's Power in relaxing Canonical Penances to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinners upon just Causes.</p>

                  </gap> remain due by God's Justice, after the other are remitted,</hi> he saith, <hi>that Penitent Sinners may in some measure sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy for that by Prayer, Fasting, Alms, &amp;c.</hi> p. 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>These Penitential Works,</hi> he saith, <hi>are no otherwise satisfactory, than as joined and applied to Christ's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, in virtue of which alone our good Works find a grateful acceptance in God's sight.</hi> p. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57901:33"/>
But for right apprehending the State of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, we must consider;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they grant both Eternal and Temporal Pain due to Sin, to be remitted in Baptism; so that all the Satisfaction to be made, is for Sins committed after Baptism.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We distinguish between Satisfaction to the Church before Absolution, and Satisfaction to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God for some part of the punishment to Sin which is unremitted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We do not deny that truly Penitential Works are pleasing to God, so as to avert his Displeasure; but <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Catech. Roman. Part.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 52, 56.</note> we deny that there can be any Compensation in way of equivalency, between what we suffer, and what we deserve.</p>
            <p>The Matter in Controversy therefore on this Head, consists in these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That after the total Remission of Sins in Baptism, they suppose a Temporal Punishment to remain, when the Eternal is forgiven; which the Penitent is to satisfy God's Justice for; and without this being done in this Life, he must go into Purgatory for that End. Of which more under that Head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this Satisfaction may be made to the Justice of God, after Absolution is given by the Priest. So that although the Penitent be admitted into God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by the power of the Keys, according to their own Doctrine; yet the Application of the Merits of Christ, together with the Saints in the Sentence of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution (according to their Form) do not set him so free, but he either wants a new Supply from the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the same Merits of Christ and the Saints; or else he is to satisfie for the Temporal Punishment by his own Penances.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:57901:34"/>
3. That these penitential Works are to be joyned with the Merits of Christ, in the way of proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Divine Justice. And however softly this may be expressed; the meaning is, that Christ hath merited, that we may merit, and by his Satisfaction, we are enabled to satisfie for our selves. And if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by way of Justice be taken away, the other will be a Controversy about Words.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That these penitential Works may not only be <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Catech. Rom. de Paenit. Sacr. n.</hi> 61.</note> sufficient for themselves, but they may be so over-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a great share may be taken from them to make up the Treasure of the Church, for the benefit of others who fall short, when they are duly applied to them in the way of Indulgences. And about these Points, we must desire greater Proof than we have yet ever seen.</p>

And these are known and material Points in Controversy between us and them: therefore let them not say, they hold it in the highest Veneration of all Men living; though those thought themselves through Catholioks, who have compared it to a Nose of

            <p n="2">2. He saith, <hi>It is not out of disrespect to it.</hi> But why then? (1.) <hi>Because private Interpretation is not proper for the Scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ture,</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20.) One would think the Scripture were not kept <hi>only</hi> from the People, by such a Sense being put upon it: for any one that would but consider that place, will find it must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Prophets themselves; and doth he think the Prophets were to be debarred from reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? But this is playing with Scripture, and not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning from it. (2.) <hi>Because in the Epistles of St.</hi> Paul <hi>are certain things hard to be understood, which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and unstable deprave, as also the rest of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to their own Perdition.</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16.) Now in my Opinion, such Men deserve more to be debarred from the medling with the Scripture, who make such perverse Inferences from it, than ordinary Readers. And if they use all other places, as they do this, they cannot be excused from depraving it. It is granted, there were then unlearned and unstable Men, who mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood, or misappled the Writings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Scriptures. And what then? There are Men of all Ages, who abuse the best things in the World, even the Gospel it self, and the Grace of God. Doth it hence follow, that the Gospel must not be preached to them, or the Grace of God made known to them, for fear of Mens making ill use of it? If this had been the just Consequence, would not St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself have thought of this?

to the Scriptures, even to the Prophetical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>as to a Light shining in a dark place,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 19. According to this way of deducing Consequences, S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> should have argued just contrary; <hi>The Prophetical Writings are dark and obscure, therefore meddle not with them, but trust your Guides:</hi> Whereas the Apostle, after he had told them what the Apostles saw and heard, he adds, <hi>That they have a more sure Prophetical Word,</hi> as the Rhemists translate it. How could that be <hi>more sure</hi> to them, unless they were allowed to read, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and make use of it? (3.) <hi>Because God hath given only some to be Apostles, some Prophets, other some Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, and other some Pastors and Doctors,</hi> Ephes. 4. 11. Doth it hence follow that the People are not to read the Scriptures? In the Universities, Tutors are appointed to interpret <hi>Aristotle</hi> to their Pupils; doth it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they are not to read <hi>Aristotle</hi> themselves? It is, no doubt, a mighty Advantage to have such Infallible Interpreters as the <hi>Apostles &amp; Prophets;</hi> and all Christians are bound to follow their Sense, where they have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it. But suppose the Question be about the Sense of these Interpreters; must their Books not be looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, because of the danger of Error? This Reason will still hold against those who go about to deliver their Sense; and so on, till by this Method of Reasoning, all sorts of Books and Interpretations be rejected; unless any such can be found out, which is not liable to be abused or misunderstood. And if there be any such to be had, they are much to blame who do not discover it. But as yet we see no Remedy for two things in Mankind, a proneness to Sin and to Mistake.

            <head>XIII. <hi>Of the Scriptures as a Rule of Faith.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE only thing insisted on here is, <hi>That it is not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> 
               <hi>the Words, but the Sense of Scripture is the Rule; and that this Sense is not to be taken from mens private Fancies, which are various and uncertain; and therefore where there is no security from Errors, there is nothing capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being a Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To clear this, we must consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is not necessary to the making of a Rule, to prevent any possibility of mistake, but that it be such that they cannot mistake without their own fault. For Certainty in it self, and Sufficiency for the use of others, are all the necessary Properties of a Rule; but after all, it's possible for men not to apply the Rule aright, and then they are to be blamed, and not the Rule.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If no men can be certain of the right sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then it is not plain in necessary things; which is contrary to the Design of it, and to the clearest Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Antiquity, and to the common sense of all Christians, who never doubted or disputed the sense of some things revealed therein; as the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the making of the World by him, the Deluge, the History of the Patriarchs, the Captivity of the Jews, the coming of the Messias, his sending his Apostles, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again to Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No man who reads such things in Scripture can have any doubt about the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Words.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where the sense is dubious, we do not allow any Man to put what sense he please upon them; but we say, there are certain means, whereby he may either attain to the true Sense, or not be damned if he do not. And the first thing every man is to regard, is not his security from being deceived, but from being damned.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57901:38"/>
For Truth is made known in order to Salvation; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am sure to attain the chief end, I am not so much concerned, as to the possibility of Errors, as that I be not deceived by my own fault. We do not therefore leave men <hi>either to follow their own fancy, or to Interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by it;</hi> but we say, They are bound upon pain of Damnation to seek the Truth sincerely, and to use the best means in order to it; and if they do this, they either will not err, or their Errors will not be their Crime.</p>

            <head>XIV. <hi>Of the Interpretation of Scripture.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. THE Question is not, Whether Men are not bound to make use of the best means for the Right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture, by Reading, Meditation, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Advice, a humble and teachable temper, <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> all the proper means fit for such an end? but whether after all these, there be a necessity of submitting to some Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge, in order to the attaining the certain sense of Scripture?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Question is not, Whether we ought not to have a mighty regard to the sense of the whole Christian Church in all Ages since the Apostles, which we profess to have; but whether the present <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as it stands divided from other Communions, hath such a Right and Authority to interpret Scripture, that we are bound to believe that to be the Infallible sense of Scripture which she delivers.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take notice how strangely this matter is here Misrepresented; for the Case is put,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As if every one who rejects their pretence of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, had nothing to guide him but his own private <note place="margin">P. 29.</note> Fancy in the Interpretation of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As if we rejected the sense put upon Scripture by the whole Community of Christians in all Ages since the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57901:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Apostles times. Whereas we appeal in the matters in difference between us, to this universal sense of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, and are verily perswaded they cannot make it out in any one point wherein we differ from them. And themselves cannot deny, that in several we have plainly the consent of the first Ages, as far as appears by the Books remaining, on our side; as in the Worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Invocation of Saints, Papal Supremacy, Communion in both kinds, Prayer and Scripture in known Tongues; and I may safely add, the Sufficiency of Scripture, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, Auricular Confession, Publick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Solitary Masses, to name no more.</p>
            <p>But here lies the Artifice; we must not pretend to be capable of Judging either of Scripture or Tradition, but we must trust their Judgment what is the sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and what hath been the Practice of the Church in all Ages, although their own Writers confess the contrary; which is very hard.</p>
            <p>But he seems to argue for such a submission to the <note place="margin">P. 29.</note> Church; 1. <hi>Because we receive the Book of Scripture from her; therefore from her we are to receive the sense of the Book.</hi> An admirable Argument! We receive the <hi>Old Testament</hi> from the <hi>Jews,</hi> therefore from them we are to receive the sense of the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> and so we are to reject the true <hi>Messias.</hi> But this is not all; if by the Church they mean the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in distinction from others, we deny it; if they mean the whole Christian Church, we grant it; but then the force of it is quite lost. But why is it not possible for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to keep these Writings, and deliver them to others, which make against her self? Do not persons in Law-Suits often produce Deeds which make against them? But there is yet a farther Reason; it was not possible for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to make away these Writings, being so universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spread.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:57901:39"/>
2. Because the Church puts the difference between true and false Books, therefore that must be trusted for the true sense of them. Which is just as if one should argue, The Clerks of the Rolls are to give an account to the Court of true Records, therefore they are to sit on the Bench, and to give Judgment in all Causes. The Church is only to declare what it finds as to Canonical Books; but hath no Power to make any Book Canonical which was not before received for such. But I confess <hi>Stapleton</hi> saith, the Church if it please may make <hi>Hermes</hi> his Pastor, and <hi>Clemens</hi> his Constitutions Canonical: but <note place="margin">Controv. 5.

               <hi>the Defects of Scripture,</hi> as he misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it; but whether there be an Unwritten Word, which we are equally bound to receive with the Written Word: Altho these things which pass under that Name, are really but <hi>Humane Traditions;</hi> yet we do not deny that they pretend them to be of Divine Original.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We do not deny, but <hi>the Apostles might deliver such things by Word, as well as by Epistle, which their Disciples were bound to believe and keep:</hi> but we think there is some difference to be made between what we certainly know <note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 13.</note> they delivered in Writing, and what it is now impossible for us to know; <hi>viz.</hi> what they delivered by Word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Writing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We see no ground why any one should believe any <note place="margin">P. 37.</note> Doctrine <hi>with a stedfast and Divine Faith,</hi> which is not bottom'd on the Written Word; for then his Faith must be built on the Testimony of the Church as Divine and Infallibe, or else his Faith cannot be Divine. But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to prove it to be Divine and Infallible, but by the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57901:40"/>
Written Word; and therefore, as it is not reasonable that he should believe the Written Word by such a Divine Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the Church; so if any particular Doctrine may be received on the Authority of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Written Word, then all Articles of Faith may, and so there would be no need of the Written Word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Faith of Christians doth no otherwise stand upon the Foundation of the Churches Tradition, than as <note place="margin">P. 32.</note> it delivers down to us the Books of Scripture; but we acknowledg the general Sense of the Chrstian Church to be a very great help for understanding the true sense of Scripture; and we do not reject any thing so delivered; but what is all this to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> But this is still the way of true Representing.</p>

            <p n="1">1. WE are glad to find so good a Resolution as seems <note place="margin">P. 33.</note> to be expressed in these words, viz. <hi>That he is obliged to believe nothing besides that which Christ taught, and his Apostles; and if any thing contrary to this should be defined, and commanded to be believed, even by Ten Thousand Councils, he believes it damnable in any one to receive it, and by such Decrees to make Additions to his Creed.</hi> This seems to be a very good Saying, and it is pity any thing else should overthrow it. But here lies the Misrepresenting; he will believe what Christ and his Apostles taught, from the Definitions of Councils; and so all this goodly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick falls to nothing; for it is but as if one should say, If <hi>Aristotle</hi> should falsly deliver <hi>Plato</hi>'s sense, I will never believe him, but I am resolved to take <hi>Plato</hi>'s sense only from <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Words. So here, he first declares he will take the Faith of Christ from the Church; and then he saith, if the Church Representative should contradict the Faith of Christ, he would never believe it.</p>

2. We dispute not with them, the Right and Necessity of <hi>General Councils,</hi> (upon great occasions) if they be truly so, rightfully called, lawfully assembled, and fairly managed; which have been, and may be of great use to the Christian World, for setling the Faith, healing the Breaches of Christendom, and reforming abuses. And we farther say, that the Decrees of such Councils ought to be submitted to, where they proceed upon certain Grounds of Faith, and not upon unwritten Traditions; Which was the fatal stumbling at the Threshold in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and was not to be recovered after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for their setting up Traditions equally with the Written Word, made it easie for them to define, and as easie for all others to reject their Definitions, in case there had not been so many other Objections against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of that Council. And so all our Dispute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter is taken off from the general Notion, and runs into the particular Debate concerning the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and Proceedings of some which were called Free, General Councils; but were neither General, nor Free; and therefore could not deliver the sense of the Catholick Church, which our Author requires them to <note place="margin">P. 33.</note> do.</p>

            <p n="1">1. HE doth not pretend this belongs to the Pastors and <note place="margin">P. 36.</note> Prelates of his Church, who may fall, he saith, into Heresie and Schism; but that the whole Church is secured by Divine Promises from all Error and Danger of Prevarication; which he proves from the Promises of the New Testament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18—28. 20. <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 26. But however the former seems to take away Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from the Guides of the Church, yet that this is to be understood of them separately, appears by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:57901:41"/>
2. The like Assistance of the Holy Ghost he believes <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> to be in all General Councils, which is the Church Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative; by which they are specially protected from all error in all definitions and declarations in matters of Faith.</p>
            <p>Now here are two sorts of Infallibility tacked to one another by vertue of these general Promises, which ought more distinctly to be considered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To preserve Christs Church so as it shall never cease to be a Church, is one thing; to preserve it from all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is another: The former answers the End of Christs Promises as to the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not implied in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The promise of <hi>teaching them all Truth,</hi> Joh. 16. 13. is not made to the whole Church, but to the Apostles: And their case was so peculiar and extraordinary, that there can be no just inference from the assistance promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to them, of what the Church should enjoy in all Ages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the diffusive Church have no infallible Assistance promised, then no infallible Assistance can from thence be proved for the Church Representative; so that some particular Promises to the Guides of the Church as assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, are necessary to prove the Infallibility of Councils.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It by no means proves following Councils to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, because the Apostles said, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us.</hi> Our Author <hi>doth not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> 
               <hi>doubt, but the same may be prefixed to all determinations in point of Faith, resolved on by any General Council lawfully assembled since that time, or to be held to the Worlds end.</hi> But what Reason he had for not doubting in this matter, I cannot see; <hi>the Assistance,</hi> he saith, <hi>being to extend as far as the Promise:</hi> But shall Assistance imply Infallibility? Then there must be good store, as long as the Promises of Divine Grace hold good: But this Assistance of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils is very different from the Assistance of Grace; for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57901:41"/>
the Church may subsist without Councils, but cannot without Grace: What General Council was there from the meeting, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. to the Council of <hi>Nice?</hi> Were not Christs Promises fulfilled to his Church all that time, when it encreased in all parts against the most violent Opposition?</p>
            <p n="5">5. No Parity of Reason from the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church can be sufficient Proof for Infallibility in the Christian. But our Author argues thus, <hi>If Gods special Assistance was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanting to the Church of the Jews so as to let it fail in the Truth of its Doctrine, or its Authority; Why should not he believe the same of the Church of Christ, which is built on better Promises?</hi> What special Assistance was it <note place="margin">P. 39.</note> which <hi>Israel</hi> had, when it is said, that <hi>for a long time Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael had been without the true God, and without a teaching Priest, and without Law?</hi> And as to <hi>Judah,</hi> was there no failing in point of Doctrine in our Saviours time? It <note place="margin">2 Chron. 15. 3.</note> is true they had the Law intire, and that was all that was good among them; for their Teachers had corrupted themselves and the People, and made the Law of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect among them: If there were Infallibility any where, it must be in the High Priest and <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> but is it possible for any Christian to think them infallible, when they were so grosly mistaken about the main Article of their Faith as to the Messias, and pronounced him worthy of death? Is not this a fine Argument for the Infallibility of the Guides of the Christian Church? <hi>But the Church of Christ hath better Promises:</hi> No doubt of it, greater Promises of Grace and Mercy in this World, and in that to come: but what is all this to Infallibility in Councils?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Christ's Command of Obedience to those who sat in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair, <hi>(Matt.</hi> 23. 2.) doth not prove the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of those who sat there. Yet this is alledged to that purpose; and that men ought not to doubt of the Reasonableness of the Commands of their Superiors. <note place="margin">P. 39.</note>

We do not deny a due submission to our Superiours in the Church; yea, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them a Power to determine things not forbidden; and think obedience due in such things by vertue of their Authority; but yet this is far enough from Infallibility, or an unlimited implict Obedience, which would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the force of all our Saviours Reasonings against the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> as to their misinterpreting the Law, and the Superstitious Practises they imposed upon the People.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The Question is, Whether Christ hath appointed the Pope or Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Pastor, Governour, and Head of his Church under him?

For these Words, <hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> a late Learned Doctor of the <hi>Sorban</hi> shews, that if they prove any thing Peculiar to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> they must prove him sole Pastor of the Church, which was the thing S. <hi>Gregory</hi> disputed against so warmly. But that there was nothing peculiar to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> above or beyond the rest of the Apostles, he shews at large from S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin</hi> and others, to whom I refer the Reader, and to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Authors. But suppose it were made to appear, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was Head of the Church, How doth the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Succession in that Headship shew it self? To that he saith, 2. That there hath been a visibile Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of above Two hundred and fifty Bishops, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as such in all past Ages by the Christian World. <hi>As such:</hi> What is that? As Bishops of <hi>Rome?</hi> That is not of weight enough to put it upon Trial; as <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Catholick-Church?</hi> That he knows is not only denied by us, but by all the <hi>Greek, Armenian, Nestorian, Abyssin</hi> Churches; so that we dare say, it was never allowed in any one Age of the Christian Church. But we need not insist on the proof of this, since the late mentioned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion have taken so great pains, not only to prove the Popes Supremacy to be an Incroachment and Usurpation in the Church, but that the laying it aside is necessary to the Peace and Unity of it. And until the Divine Institution of the Papal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy be proved, it is to no purpose to debate what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

of Assistance is promised to the Pope in his Decrees. <note place="margin">P. 42.</note> Our Author is willing to decline the debate about his Personal Infallibility, as a matter of Opinion, and not of Faith; and yet he saith he doubts not but God doth grant a special Assistancé to the High Priest, for the good of the whole Flock, under the New Law, as he did under the Old; and produces the Instance of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> Joh. 11. 51. This is a very surprizing way of Reasoning; for if his Arguments be good from Scripture, he must hold the Popes personal Infallibity as a matter of Faith; and yet one would hardly think he should build an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith on the instance of <hi>Caiaphas:</hi> For what consequence can be drawn from Gods over-ruling the mind of a very bad man, when he was carrying on a most wicked design, to utter such words, which in the event proved true in another sense than he meant them; that therefore God will give a special As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to the Pope in determining matters of Faith? Was not <hi>Caiaphas</hi> himself the man who proposed the taking away the Life of Christ at that time? Was he assisted in that Council? Did not he determine after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Christ to he guilty of Blasphemy, and therefore worthy of Death? And is not this a rare Infallibility which is supposed to be consistent with a Decree to cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Christ? And doth he in earnest think such Orders are to be obeyed, whether the supreme Pastor be Infallible or not? For so he concludes, <hi>That his Sentence is to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether he be infallible or no?</hi>

            </head>
            <p>HERE the <hi>Misrepresenter</hi> saith, That a Papist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that the Pope hath Authority to dispense <note place="margin">P. 43.</note> with the Laws of God, and absolve any one from the Obligation of keeping the Commandments. On the other side, the <hi>Representer</hi> affirms, That the Pope has no

Authority to dispense with the Law of God, and that there's no Power upon Earth can absolve any one from the Obligation of keeping the Commandments: This matter is not to be determined by the ones affirming, and the others denying; but by finding out, if possible, the true sense of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about this matter. And there are Three Opinions about it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of those who assert, That the Pope hath a Power of Dispensing in any Divine Law, except the Articles of Faith: The Gloss upon the Canon Law saith, That where <note place="margin">De Concess. Praebend. è proposuit. Abb. c. propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit de Conc. Praebend. <hi>c.</hi> 15. Q. 6. c. Auctoritate</note> the Text seems to imply, that the Pope cannot dispense against the Apostle, it is to be understood of Articles of Faith: And <hi>Panormitan</hi> saith, This Exposition pleases him well; for the Pope may dispense in all other things: <hi>Contra Apostolum dispensat,</hi> saith the Gloss on the Decree: And the <hi>Roman</hi> Editors in the Margin, refer to 34 <hi>Dist. c. Lector</hi> to prove it: And there indeed the Gloss is very plain in the Case, <hi>sic ergo Papa dispensat contra Apostolum:</hi> And the <hi>Roman</hi> Correctors there justifie it, and say it is no absurd Doctrine as to positive Institutions: But the former notable Gloss, as <hi>Panormitan</hi> calls it, sets down the particulars wherein the Pope may dispense. As 1. Against <note place="margin">Sum. Angelic. v. dispensatio.</note> the Apostles and their Canons. 2. Against the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. 3. In Vows. 4. In Oaths. The <hi>Summa An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> saith, the Pope may dispense as to all the Precepts of the Old Testament. And <hi>Clavasi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> founds this Power upon the Plenitude of the Popes Power, according to that Expression in the Decretal mentioned, that he can, <hi>ex plenitudine Potestatis de Jure supra Jus dispensare;</hi> and <note place="margin">Jacobat. de Conciliis l. 5. p. 215.</note> without such a Power, he saith, God would not have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that care of his Church, which was to be expected from his Wisdom. <hi>Jacobatius</hi> brings several Instances of this Power in the Pope, and refers to the Speculator for more. <hi>Jac. Almain</hi> saith, That all the Canonists are of <note place="margin">Almain. de Potest. Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae c. 13.</note> Opinion, that the Pope may dispense against the Apostle, and many of their Divines, but not all: For,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:57901:44"/>
2. Some of their Divines held that the Pope could not dispense with the Law of God, as that implies a proper Relaxation of the Law, but could only Authoritatively declare that the Law did not oblige in such a particular Case; because an Inferior could not take away the force of a Superiors Law; and otherwise there would be no fixed and immutable Rule in the Church; and if the Pope might dispense in one Law of God, he might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense in the rest: And of this Opinion were some of the most eminent School-Divines, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Catharin. c. Cajetan. 6. p. 524.</note> 
               <hi>Bonaventure, Major, Soto,</hi> and <hi>Catbarinus,</hi> who at large debates this Question, and denies that the Pope hath any Power to dispense with Gods Law: But then he adds, that the Pope hath a kind of Prophetical Power to declare in what Cases the Law doth oblige, and in what not; which he parallels with the Power of declaring the Canon of Scripture; and this he doth not by his own Authority, but by Gods; He confesseth the Pope cannot dispense with those Precepts which are of themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable; nor alter the Sacraments; but then, saith he, there are some Divine Laws, which have a general force, but in particular Cases may be dispensed with; and in these cases the Law is to be relaxed, so that the Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion seems to come from God himself: But he confesses this Power is not to be often made use of; so that he makes this Power to be no Act of Jurisdiction, but of Prophetical Interpretation, as he calls it; and he brings the Instance of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to this purpose: And he adds, that the difference between the Divines and <hi>Canonists</hi> was but in Terms; for the <hi>Canonists</hi> were in the right as to the Power, and the Divines in the manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others have thought this too loose a way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the Popes Power, and therefore they say, That the Pope hath not a bare declaratory Power, but a real
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57901:45"/>
Power of dispensing in a proper sense in particular Cases: For say they, the other is no act of Jurisdiction, but of Discretion, and may belong to other men as well as to the Pope; but this they look on as more agreeable to the Popes Authority and Commission; and a bare decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Power would not be sufficient for the Churches Necessity; as <hi>Sanchez</hi> shews at large, and quotes many Authors for this Opinion, and <hi>Sayr.</hi> more; and he saith the Practice of the Church cannot be justified without it: Which <hi>Suarez</hi> much insists upon; and without it, he <note place="margin">Sanchez. de Matrim l. 8. Disp. 6. n. 5. Sayr. Clavis Reg. l. 6. c. 11. <hi>Suarez.</hi> de vot. l. 6. c. 9. n. 7. 8, 9, 17.</note> saith, the Church hath fallen into intolerable Errors; and it is evident he saith, the Church hath granted real Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations, and not meer Declarations. And he founds it upon Christs Promise to <hi>Peter, To thee will I give the Keys,</hi> and the Charge to him, <hi>Feed my sheep.</hi> But then he explains this Opinion, by saying that it is no formal Dispensation with the Law of God, but the matter of the Law is changed or taken away.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briesly laid together the different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about this Power of dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with the Law of God; from which it appears, that they do all consent in the thing, but differ only in the manner of explaining it.</p>
            <p>And I am therefore afraid our <hi>Representer</hi> is a very unstudied Divine, and doth not well understand their own Doctrine, or he would never have talked so boldly and unskilfully in this matter.</p>
            <p>As to what he pretends, that <hi>their Church teaches that every Lye is a Sin,</hi> &amp;c. it doth not reach the Case; For the Question is not, whether their Church teach men to lye, but whether there be not such a Power in the Church, as by altering the Nature of things, may not make that not to be a Lye, which otherwise would be one: As their Church teaches that Men ought not to break their Vows; yet no one among them questions, but the Pope may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57901:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Obligation of a Vow, altho it be made to God himself. Let him shew then, how the Pope comes to have a Power to release a Vow made to God, and not to have a Power to release the Obligation to veracity among men.</p>
            <p>Again, We do not charge them with delivering any such Doctrine, <hi>That men may have Dispensations to lye</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 45.</note> 
               <hi>and forswear themselves at pleasure;</hi> for we know this Dispensing Power is to be kept up as a great Mystery, and not to be made use of, but upon weighty and urgent Causes, of great Consequence and Benefit to the Church, as their Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> declare. But as to all matters of fact, which he alludes to, I have nothing to say to them; for our debate is only, whether there be such a Power of Dispensation allowed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or not?</p>
         </div>
         <div n="20" type="part">
            <head>XX. <hi>Of the Deposing Power.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO bring this matter into as narrow a compass as may be, I shall first take notice of his Concessions, which will save us a labour of Proofs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He yields that the Deposing and King-killing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath been maintained by some Canonists and Divines <note place="margin">P. 46.</note> of his Church, and that it is in their opinion lawful, and annexed to the Papal Chair.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That some Popes have endeavoured to act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Power.</p>
            <p>But then he denies that this Doctrine appertains to the Faith of his Church, and is to be believed by all of that Communion. And more than that, he saith, <hi>The affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is a malicious Calumny, a down-right Falsity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now calmly debate the matter, Whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the received principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this be only a particular opinion of some Popes and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, or be to be received as a matter of Faith. The Question is not,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:57901:46"/>
Whether those who deny it, do account it an Article of Faith; for we know they do not: But whether upon the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they are not bound to do it.</p>
            <p>I shall only, to avoid cavilling, proceed upon the Principles owned by our Author himself, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the sense of Scripture, as understood by the Community of Christians in all Ages since the Apostles, <note place="margin">P. 29.</note> is to be taken from the present Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That by the present Church he understands the Pastors and Prelates assembled in Councils, who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <note place="margin">P. 34.</note> by Christ and his Apostles for the decision of Controversies; and that they have Infallible assistance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Pope as the Head of the Church, hath a <note place="margin">P. 40, 41.</note> particular Assistance promised him, with a special regard to his Office and Function.</p>
            <p>If therefore it appear that Popes and Councils have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared this Deposing Doctrine, and they have received other things as Articles of Faith upon the same Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Why should they then stick at yielding this to be an Article of Faith, as well as the other?</p>
            <p>It is not denied, that I can find, that Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils for several Ages have asserted and exercised the Deposing Power; but it is alledged against these Decrees, and Acts, 1. That they were not grounded upon Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Tradition. 2. That they had not Universal Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now, if these be sufficient to overthrow the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Councils, let us consider the consequences of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then every Man is left to examin the Decrees of Councils, whether they are to be embraced or not; for he is to judge whether they are founded on Universal Tradition; and so he is not to take the sense of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church for his Guide, but the Universal Church from Christs time: which overthrows a Fundamental Principle of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:57901:46"/>
2. Then he must reject the pretended Infallibility in the Guides of the Church, if they could so notoriously err in a matter of so great consequence to the Peace of Christendom, as this was; and consequently their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority could not be sufficient to declare any Articles of Faith. And so all Persons must be left at Liberty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as they see cause, notwithstanding the Definitions made by Popes and Councils.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then he must believe the Guides of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to have been mistaken, not once or twice, but to have persisted in it for Five hundred years, which must take away, not only Infallibility, but any kind of Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Authority of it. For whatever may be said as to those who have depended on Princes, or favour their Parties against the Guides of the Church, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied that for so long time the leading Party in that Church did assert and maintain the Deposing Power. And therefore <hi>Lessius</hi> truely understood this matter, <note place="margin">Discussio De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creti Magni Concil. Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. p. 89.</note> when he said, That there was scarce any Article of the Christian Faith, the denial whereof was more dangerous to the Church, or did precipitate Men more into Heresy and Hatred of the Church, than this of the Deposing Power; for, he says, they could not maintain their Churches Authority without it.</p>
            <p>And he reckons up these ill Consequences of denying it. <note place="margin">P. 90, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath erred for at least Five hundred years, in a matter fundamental as to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of great Moment: Which is worse than an Error about Sacraments, as Penance, Extreme Unction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet those who deny the Church can err in one, hold that it hath erred in a greater matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it hath not only erred, but voluntarily and out of Ambition, perverting out of Design the Doctrine of the Primitive Church and Fathers concerning the Power of the Church, and bringing in another contrary
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57901:47"/>
to it, against the Right and Authority of Princes; which were a grievous sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it made knowingly, unrighteous Decrees, to draw persons from their Allegiance to Princes; and so they became the Causes of many Seditions and Rebellions, and all the ill Consequences of them, under a shew of Piety and Religion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Churches Decrees, Commands, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Censures may be safely contemned as Null, and containing intollerable Errors. And that it may require such things which good Subjects are bound to disobey.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. in the Canon <hi>Nos Sanctorum, &amp;c. Urban</hi> II. <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. the Councils of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Alex.</hi> III. and <hi>Innocent</hi> III. the Councils of <hi>Lyons,</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> X. and of <hi>Trent,</hi> have all grievously and enormously erred about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; For that it was the Doctrine of them all, he shews at large; and so Seven General Councils lose their Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility at one blow.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the Gates of Hell have prevailed against the Church: For the true Church could never teach such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Doctrine as this must be, if it be not true. And if it erred in this, it might as well err in any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and so Men are not bound to believe or obey it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That Princes and all Laymen have just Cause to withdraw from their Church; because it shewed it self to be governed by a spirit of Ambition, and not by the Spirit of God; and not only so, but they may justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute all that maintain a Doctrine so pernicious to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if it be not true.</p>
            <p>Let us now see what our Author saith to clear this from being a Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That for the few Authors that are abettors of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, there are of his Communion Three times the number that publickly disown all such Authority.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:57901:47"/>
If this be true, it is not much for the Reputation of their Church, That there should be such a number of those who are liable to all these dreadful Consequences, which <hi>Lessius</hi> urges upon the deniers of it: But is it possible to believe there should be so few followers of so many Popes, and Seven General Councils, owned for such by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owners of this Doctrine, except the <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi>

            <p n="3">3. If we charge their Church with this Opinion, may not they as well charge ours with the like; since Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions as dangerous were condemned at <hi>Oxford, July</hi> 26. 1683. as held not by <hi>Jesuits,</hi> but by some among our selves? This is the force of his Reasoning: But we must desire the Reader to consider the great disparity of the Case. We cannot deny, that there have been men of ill Minds, and disloyal Principles, Factious and Disobedient, Enemies to the Government, both in Church and State; but have these Men ever had that Countenance from the Doctrines of the Guides of our Church, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Doctrine hath had in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> To make the Case parallel, he must suppose our Houses of Convocation to have several times declared these damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrines, and given Encouragement to Rebels to proceed against their Kings, and the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> to have condemned them; for this is truly the Case in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Popes and Councils have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and approved, and acted by the Deposing Principle; but the Universities of <hi>France,</hi> of late years, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it. How comes the Principles of the Regicides among us to be parallel'd with this Doctrine, when the Principles of our Church are so directly contrary to them; and our Houses of Convocation would as readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any such damnable Doctrines, as the University of <hi>Oxford?</hi> And all the World knows how repugnant such Principles are to those of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and none can be Rebels to their Prince, but they must be false to our Church.</p>

As to the Personal Loyalty of many Persons in that Church, as I have no Reason to question it, so it is not proper for me to debate it, if I did; since our business is not concerning Persons, but Doctrines; and it was of old observed concerning the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> That tho their Principles did overthrow any true Friendship, yet many of them made excellent Friends.</p>

            <head>XXI. <hi>Of Communion in One Kind.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FOR our better proceeding in this Controversie, I shall set down the State of it as clearly as I can.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Question is not, Whether the first Institution of the Sacrament of the Eucharist by Jesus Christ, were in one Kind, or two; for all confess it was under both Kinds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not, Whether both Kinds are not still necessary for the due Celebration of it; for it is granted that both Kinds are necessary to be upon the Altar, or else there could be no compleat Sacrifice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is not, Whether the People may be wholly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from both Kinds, and so the Sacrifice only remain; for they grant that the People are bound to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in one Kind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is not concerning any peculiar and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cases, where no Wine is to be had, or there be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Aversion to it, or any such thing, where positive Institutions may be reasonably presumed to have no force; But concerning the publick and solemn Celebration, and participation of it in the Christian Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is not concerning the meer disuse or neglect of it, But concerning the lawfulness of Excluding the People from both Kinds, by the Churches Prohibition, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Institution of it by Christ in both Kinds, with a Command to keep up the Celebration of it to his Second Coming.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:57901:49"/>
Here now consists the point in Controversie, Whether the Church being obliged to keep up the Institution in both Kinds, be not equally obliged to distribute both as our Saviour did, to as many as partake of it? Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor not denying the Institution, or the continuance of it, saith, Our Saviour left it indifferent to receive it in one Kind, or both. And that is the point to be examined.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He saith, <hi>Christ delivered it to his Apostles, who only were then present, and whom he made Priests just before; yet he gave no command that it should be so received by all the Faithful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But were not the Apostles all the Faithful then present? I pray in what capacity did they then receive it? As Priests? How did they receive the Bread before the <hi>hoc facite?</hi> As Priests or as faithful? It is ridiculous to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the <hi>hoc facite</hi> changed their capaciy; and if it did, it only relates to consecrating, and not to receiving: but if Christ gave it only to the Apostles as Priests, then for all that I can see, the People are not at all concerned in one kind or other; but it was intended only for Priests: If the People be concerned, how came they to be so? Where is there any command but what refers to the first Institution? And it had been more plausible, according to this Answer, to exclude the People wholly, than to admit them to one Kind, and to debar them the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ attributes the obtaining Life Everlasting, the end of the Institution, sometimes to receiving under both Kinds, sometimes under one,</hi> John 6. 51, 57, 58. He could not easily have thought of any thing more against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for our Saviour there makes it as necessary to drink his Blood, as to eat his Flesh, <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:57901:49"/>
3. <hi>Christ himself administred the Sacrament to some of his Disciples under one kind only,</hi> Luke 24. 30. But is he sure Christ did then administer the Sacrament to them? Or that if he did, the Cup was not implied, since breaking of Bread, when taken for an ordinary Meal in Scripture, doth not exclude drinking at it? But <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi> he saith, (l. 49. <hi>de Consensu Evangel.)</hi> understands that place of the Sacrament. If he doth, it cannot be where he saith; for <hi>S. Augustin</hi> wrote but Four Books of that Subject; but l. 3. 25. he doth say something towards it; yet <hi>S. Augustin</hi> in another place supposes that these Disciples did both eat and drink. <hi>The Disciples did not know him, but in the breaking of Bread; and truely he that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tract. 2. in Epist. <hi>S.</hi> Joh.</note> 
               <hi>doth not eat and drink Judgment to himself, doth in the breaking of Bread own Christ.</hi> Where it is plain, that he applies both, to the breaking of Bread here spoken of.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He saith, <hi>it was the Custom of the Primitive Christians to give it under one kind to Children, the Sick, and to Men in a journey.</hi> I would he had produced his Authorities to prove these things; for I can bring several to prove the direct contrary as to Children, and Sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and Travellers, and not only Ancient Writers, but the most Learned of their own Church. And therefore I cannot but wonder to find him saying, <hi>This was attested by all Ancient Writers, and Modern Historians.</hi> But I have ever found those have been most mistaken, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>all Writers and Historians;</hi> when it may be, there is not one that speaks home to the business. At least, we have here none mentioned, and therefore none to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin; and it would be too hard a task to search <hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. He adds to this extravagancy, in saying, <hi>That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in one or both kinds, was indifferent for the first Four hundred years;</hi> when the contrary is so manifest, that the most ingenuous of their own Writers consess it. If any persons did carry home one kind (which is very
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57901:50"/>
questionable; for <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Albasinoeus</hi> say, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried both Kinds) to receive it in times of Persecution, at what season they thought fit afterwards; This ought not to be set up against the general and constant Rule of the Church; which is attested, not only by <hi>Cassander</hi> and such like, but even by <hi>Salmero, Ruardus, Tapperus,</hi> and <hi>Lindanus,</hi> who make no scruple of saying, The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Celebration in the Primitive Church was in both Kinds. But then, how is it possible for us to judge bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what they thought themselves bound to do, than what they constantly observed in all their publick Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations? The Church is not accountable for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Fancies or Superstitions of Men; but what was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in all publick Offices, we have reason to think the Church thought it self obliged so to do, out of regard to the Institution of Christ. And to shew how Universal this Observation was in the Church, those who give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church say, That the <hi>Greeks, Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cotovic. Itiner. Hierosolymit. l. 2. c. 6. Histoir. Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, p. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Armenians, Maronites, Cophtites</hi> and <hi>Abyssins,</hi> do all observe it still, <hi>viz.</hi> That the publick Communicants do partake of both Kinds. And not one of all these Churches but think themselves bound to observe it, out of regard to the Institution of Christ; and why then should any think the Primitive Church thought it indifferent?</p>
            <p n="6">6. The first Precept of receiving under both Kinds, was given to the Faithful by Pope <hi>Leo, A. D.</hi> 443. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Gelasius, A. D.</hi> 490. This is a great mistake, for <hi>Leo</hi> gave no Precept about it; but only told the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple how they might certainly discover the <hi>Manichees,</hi> for they would conform in other things, but they would not taste of the Wine: which argued, that all other Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants did then partake in both Kinds. <hi>Gelasius</hi> not only confirms the Custom then used, but he saith, That it is Sacriledge to divide that Holy Mystery. And surely he did not account Sacriledge an Indifferent thing.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:57901:50"/>
7. Lastly he saith, <hi>That those who receive in one Kind,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 52.</note> 
               <hi>are truely partakers of the whole Sacrament.</hi> This is a new way of Concomitancy; we used to hear of <hi>Whole Christ</hi> under either species, and that <hi>Whole Christ</hi> was therefore received; But how comes it to be <hi>the whole Sacrament,</hi> which consists of two distinct Parts? And if it be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the Blood must be separated from the Body, else the Blood of Christ is not considered as shed, and so the Notion of the Sacrifice will be lost; Which is our next Head.</p>

            <p>UNder this Head, which is thought of so great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I expected a fuller Representation than I here find; as about the <hi>Opus Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, i. e.</hi> how far the meer Act is effectual; About their <hi>Solitary Masses,</hi> when no Person receives but the Priest; About the People having so little to do, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, in all the other parts of the <hi>Mass;</hi> About the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Mass,</hi> how useful and important they are; About reconciling the present Canon of the <hi>Mass,</hi> with the present Practises; About offering up <hi>Masses</hi> for the honour of Saints.

               </note> there offered up for the quick and dead, but denounces Anathema's against those that deny it. So that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not, Whether the Eucharist may not in the sense of Antiquity be allow'd to be a Commemorative Sacrifice, as it takes in the whole Action; but whether in the <hi>Mass</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57901:51"/>
there be such a Representation made to God of Christ's Sacrifice, as to be it self a true and Propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the Quick and the Dead?</p>
            <p>Now, all that our <hi>Representer</hi> saith to the purpose, is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Christ bequeathed his Body and Blood at his last</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 53.</note> 
               <hi>Supper, under the Species of Bread and Wine, not only a Sacrament, but also a Sacrifice.</hi> I had thought it had been more proper to have offered a Sacrifice, than to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed it. And this ought to have been proved, as the Foundation of this Sacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ did at his last Supper offer up his Body and Blood, as a Propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifice to God. And then what need his suffering on the Cross?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He gave this in charge to his Apostles, as the first and chief Priests of the New-Testament, and to their Successors, to offer.</hi> But Where? When? and How? For we read no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of it in Scripture. <hi>Christ indeed did bid them do the same thing he had there done in his last Supper.</hi> But did he then offer up himself, or not? If not, How can the Sacrifice be drawn from his Action? If he did, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to prove the necessity of his dying afterwards.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This Sacrifice was never questioned till of late years.</hi> We say, it was never determined to be a Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, till of late.

            <head>XXIII. <hi>Of PURGATORY.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HEre our Author begins with proving from Scripture and Antiquity, and then undertakes to explain the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> from substantial Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to his Proof from Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is that from 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> c. 12. where he saith, <hi>Money was sent to Jerusalem, that Sacrifices might be offered for the slain; and 'tis recommended as a Holy Cogitation, to pray for the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this, which is the main foundation of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> I answer, 1. It can never prove such a <hi>Purgatory</hi> as our Author asserts; For he supposes <hi>a Sinner reconciled to God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 57.</note> 
               <hi>as to eternal Punishment,</hi> before he be capable of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> but here can be no such supposition; for these Men died in the sin of <hi>Achan,</hi> which was not known till their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were found among the slain. Here was no Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or any sign of Repentance, and therefore if it proves any thing, it is <hi>deliverance from Eternal Punishment,</hi> and for such as dye in their Sins without any shew of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. 2. We must distinguish the Fact of <hi>Judas</hi> from the interpretation of <hi>Jason,</hi> or his Epitomizer. The Fact of <hi>Judas</hi> was according to the strictness of the Law, which required in such Cases <hi>a Sin-Offering;</hi> and that is all which the <hi>Greek</hi> implies, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And so <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> confesses <note place="margin">Leo Allat. de Purgat. p. 889.</note> all the best <hi>Greek</hi> Copies agree; and he reckons Twelve of them. Now what doth this imply, but that <hi>Judas</hi> remembring the severe punishment of this Sin in the Case of <hi>Achan,</hi> upon the People, sent a Sin-offering to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem?</hi> But saith <hi>Leo Allatius, It was the sin of those men that were slain.</hi> I grant it. But the Question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>the Sin-offering</hi> respected the dead or the living? For the Law in such a Case required <hi>a Sin-offering for the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Levit. 4. 13.</note>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:57901:52"/>
               <hi>Congregation.</hi> And why should not we believe so pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual a Man for the Law, as <hi>Judas,</hi> did strictly observe it in this point? <hi>But the Author of the Book of</hi> Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees <hi>understands it of those that were slain.</hi> I do not deny it; but then 3. We have no Reason to rely upon his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in this matter; which I shall make appear by a parallel Instance. He doth undoubtedly commend the fact of <hi>Razias</hi> in <hi>Killing himself</hi> (2. Macc. 14. 42.) when he saith he did it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>like a brave Man;</hi> and if he had thought it a fault in him, he would never have given such a Character of it, but he would have added something of Caution after it. And it is no great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> for him that commends Self-murder to have introduced it. The most probable account I can give of it is, That the <hi>Alexandrian Jews,</hi> of whose num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Jason</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> seems to have been, had taken in several of the Philosophical Opinions, especially the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists,</hi> into their Religion, as appears by <hi>Philo;</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>

So here the Law appointed a Sin-offering with respect to the Living; but <hi>Jason</hi> would needs have this refer to the dead; and then sets down his own remark upon it, That <hi>it was a holy cogitation to pray for the dead;</hi> as our Author renders it. If it were <hi>holy</hi> with respect to the Law, there must be some ground for it in the Law. And that we appeal to: and do not think any particular Fancies sufficient to introduce such a Novelty as this was; which had no Foundation eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>is only to keep men from imitating the Example of Razi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as;</hi> whereas that which they pressed S. <hi>August in</hi> with, was not meerly the Fact, but the <hi>Character</hi> that is given of it. <hi>Sanctarum Scripturarum Auctoritate laudatus est Razias,</hi> are their very Words in S. <hi>Augustin.</hi> And therefore the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion relates to the Books, and not meerly to his Example. And he lessens the Character given by the Author, when he saith, <hi>He chose to dye nobly; It had been better,</hi> saith he, <hi>to have died humbly. But the other is the Elogium given in the Heathen Histories, and better becomes brave Heathens, than true Martyrs.</hi> Can any one now think S. <hi>Augustin</hi> believed this Writer Divinely inspired, or his Doctrine sufficient to ground a point of Faith upon?

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Purgatory is plainly intimated by our Saviour,</hi> Matt. 12. 32. <hi>Whosoever speaketh against the Holy-Ghost, it shall</hi>

               <hi>not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. By which words, Christ evidently supposes, that some sins are forgiven in the world to come.</hi> I am so far from discerning this plain intimation, that I wonder how any came to think of it out of this place. Well! <hi>But doth it not hence follow, that Sins may be forgiven in the World to come?</hi> Not near so plainly, as that Sins will not be forgiven in the World to come. <hi>Not That particular Sin, but others may;</hi> How doth that appear? What intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is there, that any Sins not forgiven here, shall be forgiven there? Or that any Sins here remitted as to the Eternal Punishment, shall be there remitted as to the Temporal? And without such a kind of Remission, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be inferred from hence. <hi>But if there be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission in another World, it can be neither in Heaven nor Hell, therefore it must be in Purgatory.</hi> But those who own a Remission of Sins in another World, say it will be on the Day of Judgment: For the actual Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Just from Punishment, may be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly called the full Remission of their Sins. So S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> whom he quotes, plainly saith, <hi>Si nulla remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terentur in judicio illo novissimo, &amp;c.</hi> c. <hi>Julian,</hi> l. 6. c. 5. where it is evident S. <hi>Augustin</hi> takes this place to relate to the Day of Judgment; and so in the other, <hi>(De Civit. Dei l.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 24.) But as he supposed a Remission, so he did a Purgation as <hi>by Fire</hi> in that day. <hi>In illo judicio poenas quasdam purgatorias futuras. De Civit. Dei l.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 25. And so he is to be understood on <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. to which he applies 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. But our Author was very much out, when he saith S. <hi>Augustin</hi> applied 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. to some
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57901:53"/>
place of temporal Chastisement in another World, when <hi>Bellarmin</hi> sets himself to confute S. <hi>Augustin</hi> about it, as understanding it of this World. And therefore he hath little cause to boast of S. <hi>Augustins</hi> Authority about <note place="margin">Bell. de An. Christi l. 4. c. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Purgatory,</hi> unless he had brought something more to the purpose out of him. His other Testimonies of Antiquity are not worth considering; which he borrows from <hi>Natalis Alexander;</hi> that of <hi>Dionysius Areopag. Eccl. Hierarch.</hi> c. 7. is a known Counterfeit, and impertinent, relating to a Region of Rest and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. And so do <hi>Tertullians</hi> Oblations for the dead, <hi>De Cor. Milit.</hi> c. 3. For they were Eucharistical, as appears by the Ancient Liturgies, being made for the greatest Saints. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Ep. 66. speaks of an Oblation for the dead; and he there mentions the <hi>Natalitia</hi> of the Martyrs; but by comparing that with his <hi>Epist.</hi> 33. it will be found that he speaks of the Anniversary Commemoration of the dead, which signifies nothing to Purgatory; for the best men were put into it; and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> threatens it as a Punishment to be left out of the <hi>Diptychs;</hi> but surely it is none to escape Purgatory; <hi>Arnobius, l.</hi> 4. only speaks of praying for the dead, which we deny not to have been then used in the Church, not with respect to any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary pains in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but to the Day of Judgment: And therein lies the true state of the Controversie, with respect to Antiquity; which is not, Whether any solemn prayers were not then made for the dead; But whether those prayers did relate to their deliverance out of a state of Punishment before the Day of Judgment: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever state Souls were then supposed to be in, before the great Day, if there could be no deliverance till the Day of Judgment, it signisies nothing to the present Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p>As to the Vision of <hi>Perpetua</hi> concerning her Brother <hi>Dinocrates,</hi> who died at Seven Years old, being baptized,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57901:54"/>
it is hardly reconcilable to their own Doctrine, to suppose such a Soul in Purgatory; I will not deny that <hi>Perpetua</hi> did think she saw him in a worse condition; and thought likewise that by her Prayers she brought him into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for she saw him playing like little children; and then she awaked, and concluded that she had given him ease: But is it indeed come to this, that such a Doctrine as Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory must be built on such a Foundation as this? I do not call in question the Acts of <hi>Perpetua,</hi> nor her since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in relating her Dream; but must the Church build her Doctrines upon the Dreams or Visions of Young Ladies, tho very devout? for <hi>Ubia Perpetua</hi> was then but Twenty Two, as she saith her self. But none are to be blamed, who make use of the best supports their Cause will afford.</p>
            <p>It is time now to see what strength of Reason he offers for <hi>Purgatory.</hi> 1. He saith, <hi>When a Sinner is reconciled to God, tho the eternal Punishment due to his sins is always</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 57.</note> 
               <hi>remitted, yet there sometimes remains a temporal Penalty to be undergone; as in the case of the</hi> Israelites, <hi>and</hi> David. But doth it hence follow, that there is a Temporal Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that must be undergone either here or hereafter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there will be no need of <hi>Purgatory?</hi> Who denies, that God in this Life, for example sake, may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish those whose sins he hath promised to remit as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World? This is therefore a very slender Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. <hi>There are some sins of their own nature light and venial.</hi> I will not dispute that; but suppose there be, must men go then into Purgatory for mere Venial Sins? What a strange Doctrine doth this appear to any Mans Reason? That God should forgive the greater sins, and require so severe a punishment for sins in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture venial; <hi>i. e.</hi> so inconsiderable in their Opinion, that no man is bound to confess them; which do not interrupt a State of Grace; which require only an implicite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation

But how doth it appear, that after the Expiation of Sin by Christ, and the remission of eternal Punishment, there still remains a necessity of farther satisfaction for such a temporal penalty in another World? 4. <hi>That ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally speaking, few men depart out of this Life, but either with the guilt of venial sins, or obnoxions to some Temporal punishment;</hi> No doubt all men are obnoxious by their sins to the punishment of another World; but that is not the point, but whether God hath declared, That altho he remits the eternal punishment, he will not the temporal; and altho he will forgive thousands of pounds, he will not the pence and farthings we owe to him: But if Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sins be remitted as to the guilt, and Venial do not hinder a State of Grace, what room is there for Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Justice in <hi>Purgatory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this is the Doctrine which so much weight is laid upon; that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>They must go directly to Hell,</hi>

            <head>XXIV. <hi>Of Praying in an unknown Tongue.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Question in short is, Whether the Church-Service, at which Persons are bound to assist, ought not to be in a Language understood by those who are bound to assist?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:57901:55"/>
For our Author grants, <hi>That a Papist is bound to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist at the Church-Service, and to hear</hi> Mass; but he is <note place="margin">P. 59.</note> not bound to understand the Words there spoken.</p>
            <p>This is a plain state of the case; and one would have thought St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Discourse about Edification in the Church-Service, and a known Tongue, and the Primitive practice, had deserved a little consideration, but not a Word is said to either of them; and the whole is so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, as tho there had been no Rule, or any appearance of practice to the contrary. But I must consider what he doth say.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Mass is a Sacrifice:</hi> And what then? Have they no other Church-Service but the <hi>Mass?</hi> What then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of their Breviaries, Litanies, and all other Offices? But suppose the Priests Office in the <hi>Mass,</hi> be to offer the Sacrifice; are there no Prayers in the Canon of the <hi>Mass,</hi> wherein the people are concerned? Why must not they understand what they are required to assist in <hi>Prayer</hi> for? If they have <hi>English</hi> Books, as he saith, to teach them every part and Ceremony of the <hi>Mass,</hi> why not as well <note place="margin">P. 61.</note> the Prayers in the <hi>Mass,</hi> wherein they are to join? They tell us, <hi>It is unseasonable then for the People to say their Beads, and other Devotions:</hi> And I suppose as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable to talk, or think of other matters. Why then should not they know what it is they are to do, and what Petitions they are then to make to God? Are there no Responses to be made? No Lessons to be read? No Creed: to be professed? Doth not the Priest speak to the people to pray, and they answer him? Is there no Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving after the Communion which the people is concerned in? We are as much for <hi>their Devout Affections,</hi> as they can be; but we think they are not hindred by understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they are about: We cannot but wonder, that <note place="margin">P. 60.</note> any man should say, <hi>That it nothing concerns his Devotion, that the</hi> Mass <hi>is in</hi> Latin, if he understand it not. Is it <note place="margin">P. 61.</note>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57901:55"/>
no part of Devotion to join in the publick prayers, not merely by rote, but from a due apprehension of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in them? He requires, <hi>That they accompany the Priest in Prayer and Spirit:</hi> And why not in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing also? <hi>But the Church hath so ordered it:</hi> And that is the thing we complain of, as done against St. <hi>Paul,</hi> against the Primitive Church, against the natural sense of Mankind, who think it is fit for them to know what they do, especially in the Worship of God: <hi>But it is to preserve Unity:</hi> Methinks however Unity in Spirit and Understanding is better than without it: <hi>There are other good Reasons:</hi> I know not one good one; and if there were more, he would have produced them: <hi>The greatest part is said in a low voice, that it is not possible he should hear it:</hi> And to what purpose should it be spoken louder, if they are not to understand it? But why so low in publick? Yet the people might have Books, and join, if they understood what was said. But why should not the rest be understood, which is spoken as if it were.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to other Offices, he saith, <hi>He is taught, that he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 62.</note> 
               <hi>may perform them in a Language which he understands not, with great benefit to his Soul, and the acceptance of God, if at those occasions he endeavours to raise his thoughts to Heaven, and fix his heart upon his Maker.</hi> But the Question is not, Whether a Man may not have devout Thoughts at that time, but whether he can perform his part in the publick Offices, with true Devotion, without Understanding? For the publick Offices of Devotion were designed for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Hearts and Desires of the people in the same things. It is not, Whether one Man may not pray for Heaven, and another for fair Weather, and another for pardon of his Sins, and a Fourth for Patience, and so on, in the same place, and at the same time; for all this may be done as well in a <hi>silent Meeting,</hi> where not a Word is spoken: But there being one Form of Prayer for all to join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57901:56"/>
in, that with the united force of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, their Petitions may go up to Heaven; The Matter now in dispute is, Whether it be not necessary in order to this united Devotion, that the people all know what they pray for? And one would think nothing need to be said to prove this: But what our Author adds in justification of this, overthrows all publick Devotion; For he saith, <hi>It is not necessary to have attention on the Words, or on the Sense of Prayers, but rather purely on God:</hi> Which is to make all publick Forms unnecessary, and to turn all Devotion into <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Contemplation:</hi> For if this be true, all Forms whatsoever, are not only use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, but burdensom; and by the stinting the Spirit, do hinder the nimbler flights of the Soul, in pure silence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God: And this Principle must lead men to <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasms,</hi> and unintelligible Unions, and make them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise <hi>Forms</hi> as a mean and dull Dispensation.</p>
            <p>But at last he saith, <hi>A Petitioner may accompany his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with an earnest desire of obtaining it, tho the Language in which it is written, be unknown to him.</hi> Very true, if he indited the matter of the Petition, and trusted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put it into that Language, which the Person to whom he makes it, doth understand, but not his own: But all Languages are alike to Gods Infinite Wisdom, and so there can be no pretence on that account, to keep only to some particular Tongues, tho unknown to the Party; and if it were so to all men, no man would have a Petition presented in a Language which he did not know: But in Prayer to God, the design of it is not to acquaint him with something which he knew not, but to excite the hearts and affections of men to an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the things which are fit for them to ask; Now let any man undertake to prove, that mens affections are as easily moved by Words they do not understand, as by those they do; and I will give up this Cause.</p>

            <head>XXV. <hi>Of the Second Commandment.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Dispute about this is not, Whether the Second Commandment may be found in any of their Books, but by what Authority it comes to be left out in any: As he confesses it is <hi>in their short Catechisms and Manuals:</hi> But not only in these; for <note place="margin">P. 63.</note> I have now before me the Reformed Office of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin, Printed at <hi>Salamanca, A. D.</hi> 1588. published by Order of <hi>Pius</hi> V. where it is so left out: And so in the English Office at <hi>Antwerp, A. D.</hi> 1658. I wish he had told us in what publick Office of their Church it is to be found: But himself pleads for the leaving it out, when he saith, <hi>The People are in no danger of Superstition or Idolatry by it; since the First Commandment secures them from it; and there is nothing in this, but what is vertually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the First, and is rather an Explanation, than a new</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 64.</note> 
               <hi>and distinct Precept.</hi> But is this so plain and clear, that a Mans Conscience can never make any just and reasonable Doubt concerning it? There is a terrible sanction after it; and men had need go upon very good Grounds in a matter of such moment. Hath God himself any where declared this to be only an Explication of the First Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? Have the Prophets, or Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles ever done it? How then can any mans Conscience be safe in this matter? For it is not a trifling Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, whether it be a distinct Commandment, or an Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the First; but the Lawfulness or Unlawfulness of the Worship of Images depends very much upon it: For if it be only an Explication of the First, then unless <hi>one takes Images to be Gods,</hi> their Worship is lawful, and so the Heathens were excused in it, who were not such Ideots; But if it be a new and distinct Precept, then the Worshipping any Image or Similitude, becomes a grievous
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57901:57"/>
sin, and exposes men to the Wrath of God in that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere manner mentioned in the end of it: And it is a great confirmation that this is the true meaning of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all the Primitive Writers of the Christian Church, not only thought it a Sin against this Commandment, but insisted upon the force of it against those Heathens who denied that they took their Images for Gods: And therefore this is a very insufficient Account of leaving out the <hi>Second Commandment.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. That they are ever taught to break Faith with Hereticks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That their Church doth allow any Equivocations, or Mental Reservations.</p>
            <p>As to the former I am sincerely glad to find a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple so destructive to all humane Society, so utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned, when he saith, <hi>He is taught to keep Faith with all sorts of People, of whatsoever judgment or perswasion</hi>

               <hi>they be; and to stand to his Word, and observe his Promise given, or made to any whatsoever.</hi> And whatever Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practices there may have been of that kind formerly, we hope there will never be occasion given to revive that dispute.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Second, We embrace his Declaration against it, and hope there is no Equivocation, or mental Reservation in it. But there are some things which must here be taken Notice of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He cannot deny that there are Authors in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his Church, which may be charged with teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Doctrine; and those not a few, nor inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; who not only allow the Practice of Mental

Reservations and Equivocations, but say with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, it hath been received in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for no less than Four hundred years; and that in some Cases they are all still agreed in it. See <hi>Parsons</hi> Treatise of <hi>Mitigation, c.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We do not deny, that <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. hath condemned Equivocations, and Mental Reservations in Swearing, as <hi>at least Scandalous and Pernicious in Practise;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot charge the Pope with abetting this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But we cannot but reflect on what our Author said about the Deposing Doctrine, <hi>That although Popes had believed it, and acted by it, yet the greater number opposed it.</hi> And what shall we say in this Case, if the Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Casuists in some Cases approve it, and think it no <hi>Lie or Perjury,</hi> as in that of <hi>Confession;</hi> but if it be really so in any one Case, then it may be some other fault, but it is not a <hi>Lie or Perjury</hi> in any other, when a Man doth not think himself bound to speak all he knows.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>WE have no difference with them about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as far as they hold to these points: 1. That Men are strictly obliged to Work out their Salvation with fear and trembling in time of Health. 2. That it is very <note place="margin">P. 67, 68.</note> dangerous to defer their Repentance to the last. 3. That if any are surprized, they ought in Charity to have all possible assistance, to put them into the best way for their Salvation.</p>
            <p>But yet there may be some particular Doctrines owned in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which may give men too much encouragement to put off true Repentance; as 1. The easiness of being put into a state of Grace by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance; for which no more is required than removing the impediment; as appears by the Council of <hi>Trent. Sess.</hi> 7. <hi>Can.</hi> 6. and afterwards it defines that bare Attrition doth sufficiently dispose a Man to receive Grace in that Sacrament, <hi>Sess.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 4. So that altho a Man hath led a very bad Life, if he hath but this Attrition for his sins when he doth confess them, he is put into a state of Grace by this Sacrament. And what can any Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more, and what can he do less! I do not mean a bare natural Attrition, the sufficiency whereof is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. in the same Proposition, Fifty seventh; but that which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> calls <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Contriti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orsake his Sins for fear of Punishment; if really no more be required for a state of Grace but this, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if Men put off the doing of that which may be done at any time so easily by the help of a Priest.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Treasure of the Church is another thing which is very apt to hinder Mens speedy Repentance; for by that they believe there is a stock ready of so many Merits
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57901:58"/>
and Satisfactions of others, if duely applied to them by Indulgences, that they need not be at such pains to Work out their own Salvation with fear and trembling. When a Man by the Sacrament of Penance is put into a state of Grace, the Eternal Punishment is discharged, and nothing remains but some Temporal Pains; and to ease him of these he hath many helps, but especially the Treasure of the Church, which the Pope hath the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of, as he is bound to believe; and by Indulgences he may easily get off some Thousands of years of Purgatory-Pains; and if these should fail him, there is another help yet left, which is leaving a stock for Prayers for his Soul when he dies; <hi>which,</hi> even our Author assures him, <hi>are very available towards bis speedier release out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> p. 58.</p>

            <head>XXVIII. <hi>Of FASTING.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Question here is, Whether a Man doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their Churches Command about Fasting, who forbears all forbidden things, but takes liberty in those which are not forbidden?</p>
            <p>It is not, Whether they may not break the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, against Gluttony and Drunkenness; But whether they break the Law of the Church about Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And notwithstanding what our Author hath said, I see no Reason for the Affirmative. I do not deny, 1. That it is a very indifferent sort of Fasting, <hi>to abstain</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 69.</note> 
               <hi>from Flesh, unless all other sorts of Excesses at the same time be carefully avoided.</hi> 2. <hi>That Excesses on such days are more scandalous, because there is a pretence of Fasting.</hi> 3. <hi>That God's Command doth at all times sorbid Intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> Which are the chief things he insists upon. But <note place="margin">P. 71.</note> yet this doth not reach the point, which is about their <hi>Churches Command.</hi> For their Casuists distinguish Fasting
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57901:59"/>
into 1. <hi>Natural;</hi> which is total Abstinence; and this is required only in order to receiving the Eucharist. 2. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi> which is the same with Temperance, or Fasting for Health. 3. <hi>Ecclesiastical;</hi> which is defined by them to be, <hi>An Abstinence from Food forbidden by the Church.</hi> And if this Definition be true, it cannot be broken but by eating what the Church hath prohibited.</p>
            <p>And therefore their Casuists, as far as I can find, are agreed in these things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a Man may eat a full Meal of what is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and not break the Churches Precept of Fasting, provided Vespers be first said. And the later Casuists blame <hi>Covarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <head>XXIX. <hi>Of Divisions and Schisms in the Church.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TWO things he saith upon this Head.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That they are all agreed in matters of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That they only differ in some School Points;</hi> from whence he infers, That they have no Schisms or Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among them.</p>
            <p>But that this is no just consequence, will appear by the Schisms and Separations among us, made by such who profess to agree in all matters of Faith. Yet let us see how he <note place="margin">P. 72.</note> proves that they agree in all matters of Faith; <hi>because they agree to submit equally to the Determinations of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this very way evidently proves that they do not all agree, because they do not equally submit to the Churches determinations. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some say they are bound to submit to the Churches Determinations, as it represents the Universal Church; Others say no; but as the Churches Power is virtually lodged in the Guides of it. Now this is a very material Difference: For if it be on the former Account, then not the Popes and Councils Declarations are to be regarded, but as they express the sense of the Universal Church; and so the Majority of Votes, and Numbers in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57901:60"/>
the Representative and Diffusive Church is chiefly to be regarded. And on this Ground some reject the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing-Power, though plainly decreed by Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; but they unhinge their Churches Authority by it: Now how is it possible for them to agree about matters of Faith, who differ fundamentally about the way how any things come to be matters of Faith. If they be decreed by Popes and Councils, say some; and so the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Power is become an Article of Faith. No such matter, say others, for a greater Number in the diffusive Church oppose it, as in the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and elsewhere. Very well! But how then can these Parties be said to agree in matters of Faith. and an equal Submission to the Determinations of the Church?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some again say, That it is not the consent of the present Church can make any Article of Faith, but there must be an universal Tradition from the Apostles times. And so they tell us the Deposing Power can never be an Article of Faith, because it wants the Consent of all the Ages before <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. So that upon this Ground there can be no Article of Faith which cannot be proved to be thus delivered down to us. Others again say, this is in effect to give up their Cause, knowing the impossibility of proving particular Points in this manner; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they say, the present Church is wholly to be trusted for the sense of the foregoing.</p>
            <p>Now these differences are still on Foot in their Church; and from these do arise daily disputes about Matters of Faith, and the Seat of Infallibility, whether in the Guides, or the Body of the Church; if the former, whether in the Church Representative, or Virtual? whether the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Infallibilty of the Pope be a matter of Faith or not? Our Author saith, Not; others say, Yes; and yet he saith they are agreed in matters of Faith. So that by his own Confession they differ about other things than mere School-Points.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:57901:60"/>
But suppose they were agreed in Articles of Faith, can there be no Schisms or Divisions in their Church? What thinks he of all the Schisms between Popes and Popes? Of all the Schisms between the Popes and the Emperors Parties? Which were as notorious, and scandalous, and mischievous, as ever were in the World. What thinks he of the Schisms between the Bishops and the Regular Orders, which were as cross and peevish towards the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and SecularClergy, as our Dissenters themselves? And among the Regular Orders, what Heats and Contentions have been, <hi>Not about the practice of a devout Life,</hi> I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him, but about matters of Doctrine; and which both Parties severally plead to be matters of Faith? As in the noted Controversies of this last Age, about the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, the power of Grace, and the Popes Personal Infallibility; and they cannot say they are as yet agreed about these things.</p>

            <p>OUR Dispute is not, About the lawfulness of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring from the World by such Persons who are rendred unfit for doing Service in it; and the more they spend their time in Devotion and Contemplation, so much the better.</p>
            <p>But it lies in these Things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether the Perfection of a Christian State of Life lies in being cloystered up from the World, or labouring to do good in it? For this was the great snare made use of, to draw men into it, because they represented this as the most perfect state; whereas according to the Doctrine and Example of Christ and his Apostles, the active Life of doing good, is far beyond it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether, altho such a retirement be allowed, it be a thing pleasing to God, to tye such Persons up
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57901:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by indispensable Vows, whatever their Circumstances may be, not to alter that State of Life; who either in Youth, or through Force, Passion, or Discontent, have entred into it? And this may be so much rather questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because those who assert the Pope may dispense, go upon this Ground, because Circumstances may alter the obligation of a Vow; and when a greater good is to be attained, it ceaseth to oblige; which to my apprehension doth not prove the Popes Power to dispense, but the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable Nature of the Vows themselves.</p>
            <p>Whether all things of this nature being liable in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, to great Degeneracy and Corruptions; and the numbers of such Places being unserviceable either to Church or State, it be not in the Power of the King and States of the Kingdom, to dissolve and reduce them to ways more suitable to the Conveniencies of both?</p>
            <p>As to what he discourses about <hi>Councils of Perfection, the Distractions of the World, the Corruptions of the best Things,</hi> &amp;c. They reach not the main Points, but are only general Topicks, which we are not concerned to debate.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Misrepresenter</hi> charges the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with many horrid Practices, as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Massacres, the Murders of Two Kings of <hi>France,</hi> the Holy League, the Gun-powder Treason, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And charges these as being done according to the Principles of that Church.</p>
            <p>But in Answer to this he saith. 1. In General, <hi>That the Doctrine of it is holy, teaching the Love of God and our</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 77.</note> 
               <hi>neighbour; and that none can be saved by Faith alone.</hi> In which Doctrine we heartily concur with them. 2. <hi>That altho many uncertain things pass for certain, and false for true, yet</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 79.</note> 
               <hi>he cannot deny that all ranks and degrees of men have been corrupted among them, being scandalous in their Lives, wicked.</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:57901:61"/>
               <hi>in their designs, without the Fear of God in their hearts, or care of their own Salvation.</hi> This is a general Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, but no particular Answer to the things object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 3. <hi>That tbe whole Cburch is not to be charged for the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 81.</note> 
               <hi>sake of such villanies.</hi> Very true, unless some Doctrine owned in that Church gave encouragement to them: As suppose any should ever have fallen into Rebellion upon the belief of the Deposing Power; is not that Doctrine chargeable with the Consequences of it? They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely to blame who charge a Church with what her Members do in direct Opposition to her Doctrine; but it is quite another Case, when the main Ground they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg for their Actions is some allowed Principle in it. 4. <hi>They are not accountable for the Actions of every Bishop, Cardinal, or Pope; for they extend not their Faith beyond</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 82.</note> 
               <hi>the Declaration of General Councils.</hi> But suppose General Councils have declared such Doctrines, and Popes act but according to them; is not their Church then accountable for their Actions? 5. <hi>There is more Praying and Fasting,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 83.</note> 
               <hi>and receiving the Sacraments, more visiting the Prisoners, and the Sick, more Alms-giving in any of our neighbouring Popish Towns, as.</hi> Paris, Antwerp, Gant, <hi>&amp;c. than in any Ten Towns of the Reformation.</hi> And is there more <hi>Charity</hi> too? It doth not appear, if they be as ready to censure others, and admire themselves, as our Author, who so freely gives his Judgment about a matter it is impossible for him to know.</p>
            <p>We see no reason to admire or imitate the manner of their Praying, and Fasting, and receiving the Sacraments; for to pray without understanding, to fast without Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, to receive a maimed Sacrament, are things we do not envy them for; But altho our Devotion be not so pompous, and full of shew, yet We may pray and fast in secret, according to our Saviours Directions, far more than they do; however our People are mightily to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57901:62"/>
blame if they do not understand what they pray for, if they do not receive more of the Sacrament than they; and we verily believe there is as great and remarkable Instances of <hi>true Charity</hi> among those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as among any People in the World.</p>

            <head>XXXII. <hi>Of MIRACLES.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. OUR Author saith, <hi>He is not obliged to believe any one Miracle besides what is in Scripture.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 83.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He sees no Reason <hi>to doubt the truth of many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which are attested by great numbers of Eye-witnesses, examined by Authority, and found upon Record, with all the Formalities due to such a Process.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, how can these two things stand together? Is not a Man obliged to believe a thing so well proved? And if his other Arguments prove any thing, it is, that he is bound to believe them. For he thinks there is as much Reason to believe Miracles still, as in the time of the old or new Law. If he can make this out, I see no reason why he should not be as well obliged to believe them now, as well as those recorded in Scripture. But I can see nothing like a proof of this. And all Persons of Judgment in their own Church, do grant there is a great difference between the Necessity of Miracles for the first establishing a Religion, and afterwards. This is not only asserted by <hi>Tostatus, Erasmus, Stella, Andradius,</hi> and several others formerly; but the very late <hi>French</hi> Author I have several times mentioned, saith it in express Terms. <note place="margin">Moyens Surs &amp; Honestes, &amp;c. To. 2. p. 149.</note> And he confesses the great Impostures of modern Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which, he saith, ought to be severely punished; and that none but Women and weak People think themselves bound to believe them. And he cannot understand what they are good for: Not to convert Hereticks; because not done among them: Not to prove there are no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57901:62"/>
or errors among them, which is a thing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; with much more to that purpose, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with <hi>Monsieur Paschal, That if they have no other use, we ought not to be amused with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Christ promised, that his Apostles should do greater Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles than himself had done.</hi> And what then? Must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or S. <hi>Dominic,</hi> or S. <hi>Rosa,</hi> do as great as the Apostles had done? What Consequence can be drawn from the Apostles times to latter Ages? We do not dispute <hi>God's Omnipotency, or say his hand is sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tned;</hi> but we must not from thence infer, that every thing which is called a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is truely so; or make use of God's Power, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the most incredible stories. Which is a way will serve as well for a false as a true Religion; and <hi>Mahomet</hi> might run to Gods Omnipotency for cleaving the Moon in two pieces, as well as others for removing a House over the Seas, or any thing of a like nature.</p>
            <p>But, he saith, <hi>their Miracles are not more ridiculous and absurd than some in the Old Testament.</hi> Which I utterly deny; but I shall not run out into the examination of this Parallel, by shewing how very different the Nature, Design, and Authority of the Miracles he mentions, is from those which are believed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And it had been but fitting, as he set down the Miracles of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> so to have mentioned those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which were to vye with them; but this he was willing to forbear, for certain good Reasons. <hi>If most of poor Man's Impossibles be none to God,</hi> as he concludes, yet every thing is not presently true which is not impossible; and by this way of Arguing, there can be nothing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against the most absurd and idle Fictions of the Golden Legend, which all Men of Understanding among themselves, not only reject for want of Authority, but of Credibility.</p>

            <p n="2">2. He saith, <hi>That these things are particularly deputed by the Prayers and Blessing of the Priest to certain uses for God's Glory, and the Spiritual and Corporal Good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is somewhat too general; But <hi>Marsilius Columna,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hydragiolog.

            </p>
            <p>And now, as our Author saith, <hi>What Superstition in the use of it?</hi> He names several things of God's own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing to Parallel it; as <hi>the Waters of Jealousy, the Shew-bread, the Tables of Stone;</hi> but the first was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, the other had no such effects that we ever heard of. <hi>Elisha</hi>'s <hi>Salt for sweetning the Water,</hi> was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Miracle. Is the <hi>Holy Water</hi> so? As to the <hi>liver of the Fish for expelling the Devil,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57901:63"/>
knows the Book is not owned for Canonical by us; and this very place is produced as an Argument against it; there being no Ground from Scripture, to attribute the Power of expelling Devils, to the Liver of a Fish, either naturally or symbolically: <hi>Vallesius</hi> offers at the only probable account of it, that it must be a Divine Power given to it, which the Angel <hi>Raphael</hi> did not discover; <note place="margin">Valles. Sacr. Philosoph. c. 28. p. 229.</note> and yet it is somewhat hard to conceive, how this Liver should have such a power to drive away any kind of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as it is there expressed, unless by a Devil there, no more be meant than some violent Disease, which the <hi>Jews</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed to arise from the possession of evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: But however here is an Angel supposed, who made this known to <hi>Tobit;</hi> but we find not <hi>Raphael</hi> to discover the virtue of Holy Water against Devils. As to <hi>Christs using Clay to open the eyes of the blind,</hi> it is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applied, unless the same miraculous Power be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in it, which was in Christ himself: And so is the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles laying on of hands, and using Oyl for miraculous cures;</hi> unless the same Gift of Miracles be in every Priest which consecrates Holy Water, which was in the Apostles: And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself confesses, <hi>That no infallible effect doth follow the use of Holy Water, because there is no Promise of God in the case, but only the Prayers of the Church: But</hi> 
               <note place="margin">De Cultu Sanct. l. 3. c. 7.</note> 
               <hi>these are sufficient to sanctifie the Water,</hi> saith our Author: And to what end? For all the spiritual and corporeal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits before-mentioned? Is no Promise of God necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for such purposes as those? How can any Church in the World dispose of Gods Power without his Will? It may appoint significant and decent Ceremonies, but it can never appropriate Divine Effects to them; and to suppose any Divine Power in things which God never gave them, is in my Opinion, Superstition; and to use them for such ends, is a superstitious use: St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> whom he quotes, speaks of the Consecration of the Water of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57901:64"/>
Baptism, <hi>Catech.</hi> 3. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> only of a consecrated Bread, which the <hi>Catechumens</hi> had <hi>(De Peccat. Merit. &amp; Remiss.</hi> l. 2. c. 26.) but he attributes no Divine Effects to it. Pope <hi>Alexanders Epistle</hi> is a Notorious Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit. Those Passages of <hi>Epiphanius, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>S. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> all speak of miraculous effects; and those who had the power of Miracles, might sometimes do them with an external sign, and sometimes without, as the Apostles cured with anointing, and without: But this is no ground for consecrating Oyl by the Church, or Holy Water, for miraculous effects. If these Effects which they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Holy Water,</hi> be miraculous, then every Priest must have not only a power of Miracles himself, but of annexing it to the Water he consecrates; if they be super-natural but not miraculous, then Holy Water must be made a Sacrament to produce these effects <hi>ex opere ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato;</hi> if neither one nor the other, I know not how to excuse the use of it from <hi>Superstition.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Misrepresenter,</hi> (as he is called) charges this Point home, <hi>Because they deny Salvation to those who believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith in the Apostles Creed, and lead vertuous and good Lives, if they be not of their Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:57901:65"/>
To this the Representer answers in plain terms, <hi>That this is nothing but what they have learnt from the mouth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 92.</note> 
               <hi>of Christ and his Apostles.</hi> And to this end he musters up all their sayings against Infidels, false Apostles <hi>Gnosticks, Cerinthians,</hi> as tho they were point-blank levelled against all that live out of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>this is no uncharitableness, but pure zeal, and the same the Primitive Church shewed against Hereticks, such</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 95.</note> 
               <hi>as</hi> Marcion, Basilides, <hi>and</hi> Bardesanes, <hi>who were condemned in the first Age for denying the Resurrection of the dead,</hi> &amp;c. What in the first Age! Methinks the Second had been early enough for them: But this is to let us see what Learning there is among you. But do we deny the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the dead? Or hold any one of the Heresies condemned by the Primitive Church? What then is our Fault, which can merit so severe a Sentence? <hi>We oppose the Church:</hi> What Church? The Primitive Apostolical Church? The Church in the time of the Four General Councils? I do not think that will be said, but I am sure it can never be proved: What Church then? <hi>The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church?</hi> Is it then damnable to oppose the present Church? But I pray let us know what ye mean by it; <hi>The universal Body of Christians in the World?</hi> No, no, abundance of them are <hi>Hereticks and Schismaticks</hi> as well as we: <hi>i. e.</hi> All the Christians in the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> parts, who are not in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> So that two parts in three of Christians, are sent to Hell by this Principle; and yet it is no uncharitableness. But suppose the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>the only true Church,</hi> must men be damned presently for opposing its Doctrines? I pray think a little better on it, and you will change your Minds. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Man do not submit to the Guides of this Church in a matter of Doctrine declared by them; Must he be Damned? What if it be the Deposing Power? Yet his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57901:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Principle is, <hi>If a Man do not hold the Faith entire, he is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 96.</note> 
               <hi>gone.</hi> But Popes and Councils have declared this to be a point of Faith: therefore if he doth not hold it, he must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> damned. There is no way of answering this, but he must abate the severity of his Sentence against us. For upon the same Reason he questions that, we may question many more. And all his Arguments against us, will hold against himself; <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>he that disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 97.</note> 
               <hi>one Article of Catholick Faith, does in a manner disbelieve all.</hi> Let him therefore look to it, as well as we. But he endeavours to prove <hi>the Roman Catholick Church to be the true Church, by the ordinary Notes and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 98.</note> 
               <hi>Marks of the Church.</hi> Although he is far enough from doing it; yet this will not do his business. For he must prove, that we are convinced that it is the true Church; and then indeed he may charge us with <hi>Obstinate Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but not before.

               </gap> damned for their Infidelity, where the Gospel hath not been sufficiently proposed to them; and no Christian for not believing any Article of Faith till it be so proposed; that we must be damned for not believing the Articles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, which never have been, and never can be sufficiently proposed to us.

            <head>XXXVII. <hi>Of Innovation in matters of Faith.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Substance of his Discourse on this Head may be reduced to these things. 1. <hi>That the Church in every Age hath Power to declare what is necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 108, 109</note> 
               <hi>with Anathema to those who Preach the Contrary; and so the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>in declaring Transubstantiation, Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be necessary Articles, did no more than the Church had done before on like Occasions.</hi> 2. <hi>That if</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 112, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>the Doctrines then defined had been Innovations, they must have met with great Opposition when they were introduced.</hi> 3. <hi>That those who charged those points to be Innovations,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 116.</note> 
               <hi>might as well have laid the scandal on any other Article of Faith which they retained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are things necessary to be examined, in order to the making good the charge of Innovation in matters of Faith, which we believe doth stand on very good Grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to consider, Whether the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> had equal Reason to define the necessity of these Points, as the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> had to determin the point of the Trinity; or those of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 109.</note> the Truth of Christ's Incarnation. He doth not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57901:66"/>
it to be in the Churches Power to make new Articles of Faith, as they do imply new Doctrines revealed; but he contends earnestly, That the Church hath a Power to declare the necessity of believing some points which were not so declared before. And if the Necessity of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving doth depend upon the Churches Declaration, then he must assert, that it is in the Churches Power to make points necessary to be believed which were not so; and consequently to make common Opinions to become Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith. But I hope we may have leave to enquire in this Case, since the Church pretends to no new Revelation of matters of Doctrine, therefore it can declare no more than it receives, and no otherwise than it receives. And so nothing can be made necessary to Salvation but what God himself hath made so by his Revelation. So that they must go in their Declaration either upon Scripture, or Universal Tradition; but if they define any Doctrine to be necessary without these Grounds, they exceed their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and there is no Reason to submit to their Decrees, or to believe their Declarations. To make this more plain by a known Instance: It is most certain that several Popes and Councils have declared the Deposing Doctrine, and yet our Author saith, <hi>It is no Article of Faith with him.</hi> Why not, since the Popes and Councils have as evidently delivered it, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath done Purgatory, or Transubstantiation? But he may say, <hi>There is no Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema joined to it.</hi> Suppose there be not; But why may it not be, as well as in the other Cases? And if it were, I would know, whether in his Conscience he would then believe it to be a necessary Article of Faith, though he believed that it wanted Scripture and Tradition? If not, then he sees what this matter is brought to, <hi>viz.</hi> That altho the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declare these new Doctrines to be necessary to be believed; yet if their Declaration be not built no Scripture and Universal Tradition, we are not bound to receive it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:57901:67"/>
2. <hi>As to the impossibility of Innovations coming in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notorious opposition,</hi> I see no ground at all for it, where the alteration is not made at once, but proceeds gradually. He may as well prove it impossible for a Man to fall into a <hi>Dropsy</hi> or a <hi>Hectick-Fever,</hi> unless he can tell the punctual time when it began. And he may as well argue thus, Such a Man fell into a Fever upon a great Debauch, and the Physicians were presently sent for to advise about him; therefore the other Man hath no Chronical Distemper, because he had no Physicians when he was first sick; as because Councils were called against some Heresies, and great Opposition made to them, therefore where there is not the like, there can be no <hi>Innovation.</hi> But I see no Reason why we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline giving an Account, by what Degrees, and Steps, and upon what Occasions, and with what Opposition se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Doctrines defined at <hi>Trent</hi> were brought in. For the matter is not so obscure as you would make it, as to most of the Points in difference between us. But that is too large a Task to be here undertaken.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is no Colour for calling in Question the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith received by us on the same Grounds that we reject those defined by the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> for we have the Universal Consent of the Christian World for the Apostles Creed; and of the Four General Councils for the Doctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation; who never pretended to determin any Point to be necessary which was not revealed in Scripture; whose sense was delivered down by the Testimony of the Christian Church from the Apostles times. But the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> proceeded by a very different Rule; for it first set up <hi>an Unwritten Word</hi> to be a Rule of Faith, as well as <hi>the Written;</hi> which although it were necessary in order to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, <note place="margin">Sess.

But neither this Apostle, nor S. <hi>Peter</hi> himself, give the least intimation of it.

                           <p>The Apostle speaking to all Communicants, plainly shews, that the Institution of Christ was, That all should partake of both Kinds, and so to continue to do as long as this Sacrament was to shew forth the Death of<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57901:74"/>Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> till his Second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <hi>the Inquisition at Toledo,</hi> Jan. 10. 1683. <hi>as errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Schismatical;</hi> and so by the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> Oct. 24. 1682.</p>
            <p>VVe do not question but there are Divines that oppose it; but we fear there are too many who do not; and we find they boast of their own numbers, and despise the rest as an inconsiderable Party: This we do not <hi>Misrepresent</hi> them in, for their most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Books do shew it.</p>
            <p>However, we do not question, but there are several Worthy and Loyal Gentlemen of that Religion, of <hi>different Principles and Practises:</hi> And it is pity such be not distinguished from those who will not renounce a Doctrine so dangerous in the Consequences of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because the <hi>Anathema</hi>'s he hath set down, are not Penned so plainly and clearly, as to give any real Satisfaction; but with so much Art and Sophistry, as if they were intended to beguile weak and unwary Readers, who see not into the depth of these things, and therefore may think he hath done great matters in his <hi>Anathema's,</hi> when if they be strictly examined, they come to little or nothing; as</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Cursed is he that commits Idolatry.</hi> An unwary Reader would think herein he disowned all that he accuses of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57901:77"/>
doth not curse any thing as <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but what <hi>himself</hi> thinks to be so. So again, <hi>Cursed is he</hi> (not that gives Divine Worship to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but) <hi>that prays to Images, or Relicks as Gods, or Worships them for Gods.</hi> So that if he doth not take the Images themselves for Gods, he is safe enough from his own <hi>Anathema.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Cursed is every goddess worshipper, i. e.</hi> That believes the Blessed Virgin not to be a Creature. And so they escape all the force of this <hi>Anathema. Cursed is he that Honours her, or puts his trust in her more than in God.</hi> So that if they Honour her and trust in her but just as much as in God, they are safe enough; <hi>Or that believes her to be above her Son:</hi> But no <hi>Anathema</hi> to such as suppose her to be equal to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Cursed is he that believes the Saints in Heaven to be his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that prays to them as such.</hi> VVhat if men pray to them as their <hi>Spiritual Guardians and Protectors?</hi> Is not this giving Gods Honour to them? Doth this deserve no <hi>Anathema?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Cursed is he that worships any breaden God, or makes God of the empty Elements of Bread and Wine: viz.</hi> That supposes them to be <hi>nothing but Bread and Wine,</hi> and yet supposes them to be <hi>Gods</hi> too. Doth not this look like nonsense: And yet I am afraid our Author would think it a severe <hi>Anathema</hi> in this matter, to say, <hi>Cursed is he who believes Nonsense and Contradictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be needless to set down more, since I have endeavoured by clear stating the several Controversies to prevent the Readers being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mposed upon by deceitful <hi>Anathema's.</hi> And yet after all he saith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Cursed are we, if in answering and saying</hi> Amen <hi>to any of these C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But there may be no Equivocation in the very VVords, and yet there may be a great one in the intention and design of them: There may be none in saying <hi>Amen</hi> to the Curses so worded; but if he would have prevented all susp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cion of Equivocation, he ought to have put it thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cursed are we if we have not fairly and ingenuously expressed the whole Meaning of our Church as to the Points condemned in these Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's; or if we have by them designed to deceive the People:</hi> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
