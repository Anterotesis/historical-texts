         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The assumption is in the text, vers. 10. where it is said; As the reasonable soule is in man: that is, of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of man, so the holy Spirit is in God. Hitherto may that testimony 1. Cor. 3.16.<note place="margin">

else, saue the effects and gifts of God, they are most manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, and confounded by the words of the Scripture, 1.

The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption is plaine in the text, where it is said, that the spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and distributeth all those gifts.

Of which the Councell of Trent in the fourth sessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: <hi>VVhosoeuer doth not with like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of mind, reuerence the Traditions of the Church, as he doth the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, let him be accursed.</hi> But against these Traditions, first, note the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the Scriptures. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this argument: The Traditions of the Church either agree with the holy writ, or they dissent from it. If they be consonant to it, then they say the selfe same thing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, and so they are Scripture: for that ought not in all reason to be done by moe, which may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by fewer. Or they dissent from the Scripture (as all the traditions of the Popes, as namely, that tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the Cup in the Lords Supper is prohibited to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4144:28"/>
vnto the lay people, and such like). And if they disagree with the Scripture, they cannot fill vp the Scripture, for that which is repugnant to any thing, doth not fil vp, but rather quite ouerthrow it. Another testimony of the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Scripture is most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, in the 2. Tim. 3.6. <hi>The whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration from God, and is profitable to teach, to reproue, to correct, to instruct; that the man of God may be perfect, and perfectly instructed to euery good worke.</hi> From whence wee may frame these arguments. First, the Scripture is a <hi>totum,</hi> an entire thing: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is perfect; for a <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> is that, which wanteth no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary parts. Secondly, that which sufficeth vs for doctrin,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Adoro ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudinem Scriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. Tertul.</hi>
                        </note> for reproof, for correction, and instruction, that is full and compleate: for there is none that can shew any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, wherunto the scripture should be profitable. But the Scripture is sufficient to those things: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Thirdly, that which maketh a man perfect, and furnished to euery good
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4144:28"/>
worke that same must needs be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: but the Scripture doth so. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Maior is therefore true, because there is no effect which is more perfect then its cause, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a perfect effect presupposeth the cause to be perfect, and nothing can giue that to another, which it hath not it selfe, if the Scripture therefore make men perfect, then it must also be perfect.</p>

                        <hi>VVhat is the third proprietie of the holy Scripture?</hi>

Cor. 4.3. <hi>If our Gospell be hid, it is hid to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which perish</hi>: whence it necessarily followes, that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is not hid, but cleare, and open to those which do not perish, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saith, 2. Pet. 1.19. <hi>You doe well, in that you attend to the word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as vnto a light that shineth in a darke place,</hi> Psal. 19.15. <hi>The word of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4144:29"/>
God is cleare.</hi> Psal. 119. <hi>The word of God is a light to our feete and steppes.</hi> Secondly, the Scripture is easie, as it is an instrument, which it hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued to it from the principal guide, the holy Spirit, who is that true teacher and interpreter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Ioh 14.26. <hi>The aduocate which is the holy Ghost, he shall teach you althings.</hi> 1.

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that euery one is the best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of his owne words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as therefore the Scripture is the Word of God, &amp; of the holy Ghost, and not of the Pope of Rome, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4144:29"/>
the holy Spirit hath the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to interpret, as that true aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and teacher of verity. But why then doth the Bishop of Rome cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to himselfe this authority to interpret the Scriptures? I answer; because hee knowes well enough, how bad his cause is, and therefore dares not submit his Tenents to the Word of God, or the Scripture, if it be rightly vnderstood, and therfore will he wrest, and stretch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at his owne pleasure. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which point, I would haue you note the words of a certaine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state from the faith, <hi>Caspar Schoppius</hi> Papist, who is now at Rome with the Pope; he in that Epistle he wrote touching his defection from vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Papists, about sixe yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, set out at <hi>Ingolstadium,</hi> in the 24 page, saith thus, <hi>The summe of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies betwixt the Catholikes &amp; the Lutherans consists in these two things; That besides the holy Scripture, the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Apostles, &amp; of the Church, are necessary to be belieued. And that the holy Scriptures themselues, neither can,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4144:30"/>
nor ought to be interpreted of any with authoritie, saue of the Catholike Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church. In which two Doctrines, if one be once perswaded and setled, he will easily yeeld and adioine himselfe to the Church of Rome in the rest of the chiefe points of faith: For if I were to dispute with the Heretikes, about any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith, it must needes be that there be somewhat set downe in the Bible, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching my opinion, or that there be nothing at all to be found for it. If there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Bible for me, presently then I say, that it was wont so to be obserued by tradition from the Apostles, in the Church of Rome. But if there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what contained in the Bible, touching mine opinion, and the Heretike will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete it another way then might serue my turne, then presently I oppose to him, the Church of Rome, that it hath so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it: so that euery Dispute ought to be reduced to these two heads.</hi> Thus farre he. And truly this is it that the Pope of Rome labours for, that he may wrest the Scripture as see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him good; and then it is, as if any offering to fight with another,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4144:30"/>
and the weapon should be a sword, he would fight vpon this condition, that he may be suffered to weild his aduersaries sword as he will. And so it is likewise, as if any would haue a suit in Law, tryed before the Iudge according to the lawes, but vpon this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it may be lawfull for him to interpret the law on his owne side; iust so the Pope doth, for he saith, I will dispute with you out of the Scripture, but so, that it may be lawfull for me to interpret the Scripture on mine owne behalfe. I would haue this also noted, that if the Papists demand, who is the Iudge in the controuersies of faith? Wee answer,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>S. Th. p.</hi> 174. <hi>item p.</hi> 203.</note> that the chiefe and highest Iudge of controuersies of faith, is he who is the Author, both of faith and of the Scripture, to wit, the holy Ghost. According to that of Ioh. 16. <hi>When the comforter shall come, he shal reprooue, he will iudge the world of sin.</hi> And then only the Scripture to be the Law and Sentence of this iudge, according whereunto iudgement must be giuen concerning contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies

                     <p>Of three sorts.

Because he is powerfull by the Ministerie of the Word, and inclineth the hearts of such men as are elect, to beleeue and obey the Gospell, Luk. 24. v. 25. <hi>Then he opened their vnderstanding, that they might vnderstand the Scriptures,</hi> Act. 16. v 14. <hi>The Lord opened the heart of Lydia, to attend vnto those things which were spoken by Paul.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>There be two: namely, the causes or meanes whereby Christ wrought this expiation, and so satisfied for our sinnes, and 2 the Proprieties of that Expiation.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>These be of two sorts, either <hi>Prime,</hi> or arising from the prime causes.</p>

                        <hi>What is the prime cause?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The obedience of Christ in that he humbled himselfe,<note place="margin">

According to that, Rom. 5. v. 19. <hi>As by the disobedience of one man,</hi> to wit, of <hi>Adam, many were

                     <p>By two tokens.

                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:4144:44"/>
                        <hi>What is the other token of those most grieuous torments in the soule of Christ?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His bloody sweat: for this was a manifest signe that all the naturall forces in Christ were much weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and as it were bound from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their office, by reason of that great torment and terrour, so that nature could not keepe the blood any more in the veines, but was faine being congealed, and clotted, to cast it out as it were, and driue it to the exteriour parts, of which great violence and terrour, the like example can no where be read in any Historie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Which is the other suffering or torment of Christ in soule?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The latter was that which a little before his death hee felt vpon the Crosse, when he stroue against that temptation of his perpetuall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and abiection from the face of God, whereupon hee sent forth that dolefull cry, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> where by a Metonymy he calleth that feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4144:44"/>
temptation (wherewith those are wont to be troubled whom God hath cast from his sight, and quite forsaken) desertion or forsaking. For requisite it was, that Christ should endure such a temptation, that hee might deliuer vs from eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I haue seene the Passion of Christ, now tell me his death?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The death of Christ,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Th. p.</hi> 355.</note> is the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Soule from his Body, whereby he satisfied for, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our sinnes and deliuered vs from eternall death. And so much the very shedding of blood and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of Christs side did manifest, of which <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh, Iohn 19. v. 34. <hi>One of the souldiers</hi> (saith he) <hi>pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his side, and presently issued out blood and water</hi>; by the blood, Christ sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that our sinnes were ranso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and satisfied for: by the water, that we are washed from the filth of our sinnes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It followeth now in order that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct me as touching the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and benefits of Christs Passion,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4144:45"/>
tell me therefore what is the first proprietie of Christs Passion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This it is, that it was altogether necessary, in regard that mankinde could no way else be freed from eternall death, but by the death of the Sonne of God: And that for this reason, because the most high God is most iust, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer remitteth sinnes without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; sithence, that by nature he hateth sinnes, and can in no wise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them: for he that is iustice, most eminently, cannot away with iniustice, euen as the fire cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide water. As it is said, Psal. 5. <hi>Thou art not a God that willeth wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Againe, plaine places of the Scripture doe testifie the same, Rom. 8. v. 3. <hi>That which was impossible to the Law, that hath God done by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Sonne, i. e.</hi> that which by no other meanes could haue beene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, was done by the death of the Sonne of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. v. 14. <hi>Therefore because the children are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of flesh and blood, he also in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was made partaker of them, that hee
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4144:45"/>
might abolish by death him that had the power of death,</hi> that is, <hi>the Deuill</hi>; and in the verse following, <hi>and might set at libertie those which through the feare of death were subiect vnto bondage all their life long,</hi> that is, that he might redeeme those which otherwise should haue perished eternally, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Christ had wrought their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And truly if there had beene any other way to haue satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for sinne, then that might haue beene performed, either by our selues, or by some other creature. But we could not haue done this for our selues. 1. Because whatsoeuer good we doe, we doe already owe it vnto God, and that which wee owe vnto God, is not the price of Redemption or satisfaction: but it is due debt. 2. Because wee adde somewhat to the score of our debts euery day, and therefore wee can neuer bee able to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and pay them. And that wee doe daily adde sinne vnto sinne, See Iohn 15. vers. 15, 16. Psal. 130. v. 3. Math. 6. v. 12. Math. 18.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4144:46"/>
                        <hi>v. 25.</hi> Thirdly, Because sinne is a hurt and iniurie to God, and so an infinite euill, and therefore also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth either eternall punishment, or one equall thereunto, out of which (if it had beene laid vpon vs) we could neuer haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to haue freed ourselues. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature could satisfie for vs, for example, Not the Angels: first, Because man, and no other creature may be punished for that sinne man had committed, the Iustice of God requiring that it should be so, as it is said, Ezech. 18. v. 30. <hi>That soule that hath sinned, euen that shall die.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Because no creature, no not the Angels are able to escape and free themselues out of eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.<note place="margin">

                        </note> Whereupon it followeth, that it was requisite, that hee who should satisfie the Iustice of God for our sinnes, should be truly God, and truly man.

vndergoe not the temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, but the eternall too; the eternall not by reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and continuance of it, but in value and equiualence, that is, his punishment was to be equiualent to eternall punishment, or to haue an equall proportion with eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, But no mans punishment can equiualize eternall punishment, but only of him who is himselfe eternall who is truly God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Fathers said very right and deuoutly. For God to suffer it is more, then for all men to be damned eternally. 3. Because the satisfaction must needes haue beene of infinite worth and valour, to the end it might sufficiently serue for the purging and ransoming of all mens sins. But none there is that can work such a satisfaction of infinite valour, vnlesse he himself be infinite, that is God.</p>

                        <hi>What is the 2. propriety of Christs passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That it was truly expiatory, and satisfactory, that is, our sins by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4144:47"/>
of Christs expiation were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen vs, which must be noted, 1. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Samosatenians,</hi> who blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously say, that the Passion of Christ was only exemplary, that is, that Christ by his Passion would giue vs onely an example to obey God in all things, and to beare the Crosse which God shall lay vpon vs patiently, as Christ before vs pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently did beare his Crosse. This dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous doctrine, that throweth our consciences headlong into the pit of despaire, arose from no other spring, then the deniall of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Sonne of God. For, because there was none could sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for our sinnes, except hee were God, as wee haue also a little before prooued, and the Samosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenians deny Christ to bee truely God, therefore no farly was it, if they thought, that the Passion of Christ was not satisfactory but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exemplarie But to their blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies we oppose; First, the Diuinity of the Son of God, proued and euict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already by euident testimonies,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4144:48"/>
to wit, when we necessarily infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that Christ who suffered for vs was the Sonne of God, and hence it will follow that his suffering was of infinite valour, and consequently, that it was satisfactory. Secondly, most apparent testimonies of holy writ, Esay 53. v. 4. <hi>He himselfe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and bare our infirmities truly,</hi> and v. 5. <hi>He was tormented for our sinnes, and hee was broken for our iniquities,</hi> Rom. 5. v. 9. <hi>Now then being iustified by his blood, we shall be saued.</hi> 2. Cor. 5. v. 18. <hi>All these things are of God, who hath reconciled vs vnto himselfe by Iesus Christ,</hi> and vers. 21. <hi>He made him who knew no sinne to be sinne for vs.</hi> 1. Tim. 2. v. 5, 6. <hi>There is one God, one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of God and men, euen the man Christ Iesus who gaue himselfe, a price of our Redemption.</hi> An example is one thing, and a price or ransome is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, Galat. 2. v. 20. <hi>The Sonne of God hath giuen himselfe for me, for if righteousnesse be by the Law, then Christ died with out a cause</hi>; as if he had said, Christ dyed to that end, that by his death he might bestow on vs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4144:48"/>
in satisfying Gods iustice thereby for our offences: but there is a very plaine place, Gal. 3. v 13. <hi>Christ redeemed vs from the curse of the Law, when he was made a curse for vs: for it is written, cursed is he that hangeth on the tree.</hi> 1. Iohn 1. v. 7. <hi>The blood of Iesus Christ,</hi> the Sonne of God, <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs from all our sinnes.</hi> 1. Iohn 2. v. 2. <hi>He is the propitiation for our sinnes.</hi> These are the most pregnant places of Scripture for this point, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto wee may adde this argument. If the Passion of Christ was but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary, surely he would neuer haue cryed out with a loud voice, <hi>My God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> for those words are not set down as an example for vs to follow, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to do quite contrary to them, euen to haue alwaies sure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in God, &amp; neuer to thinke, or cry out, that we are forsaken of him, as it is said, Rom. 8. v. 15. wee must Cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father, in thee doe I settle my soule. Againe, if the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christ was but exemplary, how were then the Fathers saued
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4144:49"/>
which were before Christ, and so had not his example? and how was the thiefe saued, that could not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Christ in his example, whereas he was now hanged on the Crosse as well as Christ, and that before his conuersion. Secondly, this same propriety of Christs Passion must be noted against all such, as attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the purging of their sinnes, and the merit of the forgiuenes of them to almes-deeds, or other workes of their owne: for if so bee that there is no remission of sinnes, but by shedding of bloud, as wee haue showne before, and almes-deeds, or other workes, euen the best of them shed no bloud, certainely then by no workes of ours whatsoeuer can there be wrought expiation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne.</p>

                        </note> there are contained many pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of errour. The first errour is, that Christ hath need of a Vicar, or Deputie in earth, whereunto wee oppose these arguments. First, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is no Vicar, but implyeth the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the principall Regent, or Gouernor, for therefore Kings haue their Deputies, because they be but weake men, not able to looke vnto all their subiects by themselues, but Christ is an omnipotent King. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, He needeth a Deputie, who cannot vpon all occasions be euery where present with his subiects, but Christ is alwaies euerie where present with his members, as hee promiseth, Matthew 28. <hi>Whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer two or three are gathered together

                        </note> as the Hebrew phrase teacheth. The second error is, that they thinke it a righteous thing for some one man, and hee a Bishop, or Minister of the Church, to attribute vnto himselfe this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, to bee the vniuersall Head and Governour of the whole Church, whereunto wee oppose these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: First, because Christ doth plainely forbid primacie in the Church, Matth. 20. Luk. 22. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because the Apostles themselues diuided the Office of the Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship among themselues, for that they saw, that one man could not be ouer all Churches, as the Scripture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, Gal. 2.7, 8, 9. where <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>When they saw that the Gospell of Vncircumcision was committed vnto me, as the Gospell of Circumcision vnto</hi> Peter, <hi>and when</hi> Iames, <hi>and</hi> Cephas, <hi>and</hi> Iohn, <hi>which were counted Pillars, knew of the grace giuen vnto me, they gaue vnto me and</hi> Barnabas <hi>the right hands of fellowship, that we should doe the

First then, Christ commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Peter,</hi> and in the person of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> all the Apostles, for that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued Christ to be the Son of God. Secondly, he sheweth the profit and fruit of that confession, to wit, for that this doctrine and confession was to be the foundation whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christs Church should bee built, so that it should neuer bee ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Satan. Otherwise that <hi>Peter</hi> neuer vnderstood these wordes of himself, as if he were that stone, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Ch. is reared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he himself professeth openly, 1.

                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:4144:56"/>
The fourth errour is, that they take for certaintie, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of Rome, and so consequently, that he was at Rome, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is vncertaine, neither can it be firmely proued, that <hi>Peter</hi> was euer at Rome, but the contrary; for that place which before wee cited, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. is very remarkeable; namely, in that <hi>Paul</hi> did so deuide the Apostleship, and part it with <hi>Peter,</hi> they shaking hands of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Paul</hi> should goe to the Gentiles, to conuert them, and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> should labour in the conuersion of the Iewes: This promise, the right hand being giuen vpon it, <hi>Peter</hi> should haue broke, if he had gone to Rome to conuert the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; neither doe we reade that two Apostles went into the same Citie, especially, it being so farre off, to preach the Gospell. Wherefore sithence by the confession of all, it is apparent, that <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Gospell at Rome; what neede was there that <hi>Peter</hi> should come thither, especially at the very same time, as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4144:56"/>
the Papists say that they were both at Rome in <hi>Nero</hi> his time. II. Out of the last Chapter of the second to <hi>Timoth. v.</hi> 16. <hi>In my first defence,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, when I appeared before Nero, there was none that stood to me, but all forsooke me, I pray God it bee not laid to their charge</hi>: But if <hi>Peter</hi> had then beene Bishop of Rome, as the Papists will haue it, what a disgracefull thing had it been and vnworthy a Bishop to forsake his brother and his owne companion? <hi>Bellarm.</hi> saith, that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was at that time gone abroad to visit the Churches. But we answer, that it was not meete that he should go away, then when hee should haue assisted his brother, but should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue put off the visitation vnto some other time, which hee would haue done, doubtlesse, if he had been at Rome. Againe I say, that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm.</hi> coines that answer of his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he neither backs it with any place of Scripture, nor of any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, but speaketh it out of his owne braine. III. This may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the circumstance of time,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4144:57"/>
for they say that <hi>Peter</hi> was 25 yeares at Rome, and 7 yeares at Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheia, which he make 32 yeares, and yet they say that <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified at Rome vnder <hi>Nero,</hi> and that hee came to Rome the 2 of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour. Now <hi>Claudius</hi> raigned but 13 yeares, and <hi>Nero</hi> 13, so that both their Regiments lasted but 26 yeares;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Secundum Hieronim.</hi>
                        </note> how then could <hi>Peter</hi> come the 2 of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and continue 27 yeares Bishop of Rome, and yet be crucified vnder <hi>Nero.</hi> IV. We say that <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> who are of that opinion, do not agree with themselues; yea, and <hi>Hierome</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally manifestly contradicts himself. For when as hee in one place had said, that <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified vnder <hi>Nero,</hi> afterward expounding those words of Christ, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 11 <hi>Behold I send vnto you Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> Flatly affirmes that <hi>Peter</hi> was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Iewes at Ierusalem. When the Ancients therefore are opposite vnto themselues, hereby it may appeare that they knew not certainely in this point, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4144:57"/>
how much we are to detest the impudency of the Popes, which set downe for certainty, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of Rome. The fifth er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is, that they inferre the Pope of Rome to be <hi>Peters</hi> successour: for first, there is no sure ground to euince that <hi>Peter</hi> was euer at Rome; how then could the Pope of Rome succeede <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondly, if wee grant this to the Papists out of pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that <hi>Peter</hi> was at Rome, yet it doth not follow, that the Pope of Rome was <hi>Peters</hi> successour: for the Turke also hath his seate at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, notwithstanding it doth not follow, that the Turke is the lawfull Emperour of the East, or of Greece, the Emperours before hauing their lawfull residency, and abode at Constantinople: for the place makes not the succession law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but two things there bee which make lawfull succession: first, the power giuen of God; secondly, the imitation of the Predecessors in life and manners. As <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith in a certaine place, and after him <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:4144:58"/>
and <hi>Hierome: True succession is succession in doctrine, and hee cannot bee said lawfully to hold the Chaire of Peter, who holdeth not the doctrine of Peter.</hi> But neither of these the Pope of Rome hath: first, whence will hee proue, that God hath giuen him that power to sit at Rome, as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the Church? surely he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring so much as one letter out of the Scripture of God, to proue this; nay, Christ enioyned the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Disciples, to wit, that one of them should not desire to bee aboue another. 2. The true succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which is in doctrine, the Pope of Rome hath not: for if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Pope, and the Epistles of <hi>Peter</hi> be compared together, there will appeare as great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, as betwixt light and darknes: yea, we are about to proue by and by, that the Pope of Rome is the Ringleader of idolaters, so farre is he off from being <hi>Peters</hi> successor in doctrine.</p>

About which matter <hi>Peter,</hi> epist. 2. c. 2. v. 9. speaketh most sweetly, <hi>You are a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen generation, a royall Priesthood, a holy Nation, a people whom God hath chosen as peculiar to himselfe, that the virtues of him might be manifest, who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you out of darknes into his admirable light.</hi> See concerning this most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable doctrine, to wit, the vnion of the members with Christ the Head, in the Syst. of Diuinitie. pag. 376.</p>

                        </note> That the Papists here do contradict themselues, when they say, the Church of God must be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and yet the Romish Church must be that Church of God; which is all one, as if I should say; the Church must be the vniuersall Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiscan Church, or the vniuersal Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couian Church, or a particular vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Church; for to bee the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church, and to be a particular one, is all one. Againe, we answer, that we doe not denie, that the Church ought to be Catholike, in that sence wherein the word is vsed in the Creed, as afterward it shalbe made plaine. And we say, that our Church hath alwaies been, and now also is Catholike, because that after the Apostles had gathered the Church out of all Nations, there did alwaies from time to time remaine some reliques of the true Church in all Nations, although those reliques were hid and obscured, as that book
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4144:63"/>
                        <hi>Catalogus testium veritatis,</hi> which wee haue a little before cited, doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that in the very time of Popery, there was alwaies in <hi>Greece, Italie, Spaine.

But whereas the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites obiect vnto vs, that in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and in the East <hi>Indies,</hi> there are no Protestant Preachers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell as yet, but all Papists, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Iesuites labouring the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of the people? I answere them: first, that the Pharisies also did run about both by sea and land, to draw men vnto their faith, and yet for all that, their religion was not true. Secondly, I say, that the Papists haue slaine moe in the <hi>Indies</hi> then they haue conuerted, as you may see by a place, which I haue ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my politiques <hi>l. 1. c. 4.</hi> that in a very short time a hundred fortie thousand men were murdered by them. Thirdly, I am sure the Diuell also goes a compassing the whole world, and seduceth many, yet is hee for that neuer a whit the better.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4144:64"/>
Fourthly, I auerre, that our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters also haue taught the true Gospell in America: inasmuch as <hi>Calum</hi> sent thither two Ministers of the Church from Geneua, the one whereof was <hi>Ioannes Lerius,</hi> who committed that storie to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And at this day there are Orthodoxe Ministers in the East Indies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which do publikely preach the true Doctrine of the Gospell, carried ouer thither by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the Low-Countries And doubtlesse toward the end of this world, the true Religion shall be in America; as God now is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the way for it by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and Low-Countrie Merchants; that that of Christ may bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, Matth. 23. <hi>The Gospell shall bee preached throughout the whole World, that it may bee a witnesse to all Nations.</hi> For GOD in all his workes is wont to effect a thing successiuely, and therefore first hee sends vnto those nations some light of his essence and his truth, by the Papists, and afterward will make

                        </note> as the consent is in truth and goodnesse, and not in euill and falsehood: for such an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in euill and falsity is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the very Deuils, and what greater agreement &amp; consent then among robbers? so also among the Turkes, there is very great consent, so that Mahometisme is farre and neare by them propagated; yet doth it not hence follow, that Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is the true Church. Secondly, I answer, that in our Church there is great consent in the truth; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer after <hi>Luthers</hi> time, there arose many Churches, the Diuel being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies busie to cast his plots against the true Church, and to stirre vp in it diuers hearts; yet the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe Professours are at good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement about the Articles of Faith, as that excellent Booke,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4144:65"/>
called, the <hi>Harmony of Confessions,</hi> doth testifie; wherein it is manifestly prooued, that there is exceeding great consent betwixt the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>France, England, Scotland, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and those which are in <hi>Germany</hi> neere vnto <hi>Rhene,</hi> and in other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces: for that disagreement which is betwixt the Lutherans and the Orthodoxe Professours, doth not straightway quite dissolue the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which is betwixt the true church. Thirdly, I deny that there is so great agreement in the Romish Church, as they boast of, for it can bee easily showne, that the popish Writers agree not in any one Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle among themselues, as it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily disputed against other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and alleageth their oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and contradictions to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: this may further appeare by <hi>Ioh.

                     <p>To the Church of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this propriety doth also agree that it is <hi>Catholick</hi> &amp; that first in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>places,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

Th. p.</hi> 404.</note> not because it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth many kingdoms, but because it is scattred ouer the whole world, &amp; not tied to any certain place, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny determinate country, or city. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in respect of <hi>men,</hi> because it doth consist of men of all sorts, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all men of al nations, Act. 10. Thirdly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>times,</hi> because it shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue all times, euen vnto the end of the world, as it is said, Mat. 28. <hi>I will be with you euen vntill the end of the world.</hi> Fourthly, in respect of <hi>vnitie,</hi> because the Catholike Church is at
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4144:66"/>
all times but one, to wit, in vnity of doctrin, &amp; consent in that doctrine. And thus much wee haue spoken of the proprieties of the Church. Now if we shall examine and trie the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Church by these proprieties, it will appeare to be no pure Church, but be very corrupt, euen as a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten apple is an apple corrupted, and no otherwise, then a man that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the plague, is a man, but no sound man. And that the Popish Church is not the pure Church, I will prooue it by two manifest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: the first, an idolatrous Church is not the true &amp; pure Church, but such a one is the Popish Church, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi> The proposition is euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God doth abhorre nothing more then idolatrie; therefore hee saith, <hi>Flie from idols</hi>; and, <hi>No Idolater shall bee saued.</hi> The assumption I confirme thus: That Church which giues that honor, which <hi>Dauid</hi> giues vnto God the Creator, in the very same words vnto the creature, to wit, the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> that same Church is idolatrous. But the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4144:66"/>
Church of Rome doth so goe now, that the Church of Rome doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute that honour which is due vnto God, vnto the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi>: I proue it by a most euident testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie out of that same Psalter of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the Virgin, which was compiled by <hi>Bonauentura,</hi> who liued 250 yeres agoe, and canonized of the Pope of Rome, so that hee is accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints, and the title of a Seraphicall Doctour, which is more then Angelicall, giuen vnto him. This same Psalter was by the permission of the higher powers printed in Latin at Brixia, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia in Italy eight yeares since, being before printed at Ingolstadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in the Dutch tongue some 20 yeares agoe: in the Preface where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto it is expressely said, that it was compiled, the holy Ghost inditing and dictating it. And further, that very Psalter is in speciall vse in the Romish Church, but especially is it currant among the Monkes of Saint <hi>Bennets</hi> Order, which are called Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stercians. Now in this Psalter, all
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4144:67"/>
those things which <hi>Dauid</hi> attributes to the high and most mighty God,<note place="margin">Ye haue this Psalter in <hi>Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> works printed in seauen Tomes at Rome 1588 vol. 6. pag. 502 in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish ye haue diuers passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it, and amongst the rest, these in <hi>Foxes</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology, printed 1583. fol. 1600. <hi>Missale Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. edit.

Againe, that the Romish Church is an idolatrous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, I proue it out of the Romish Masse booke, where in the Seruice appointed for Good Friday, it is said, that the Priest so soone as hee hath put off his shooes, and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth to adore the Crosse, shall kneele three times, before he kisse the Crosse, and then afterward the Ministers of the Altar, they must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so kneele, and three times adore the

Crosse. II. <hi>Arg.</hi> That Church which approueth manifest crimes, is not the pure Church: but the Church of Rome is such. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is herein manifest, for that the Papists themselues do yeeld sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and holinesse of manners to be a note of the Church.

See my <hi>Gymnasium logicum,</hi> wherein you haue this in that Theame <hi>Fides,</hi> somewhat opened. The second er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is that we come by the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, not by faith alone, but also by the merit of good workes; contrary vnto those say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Scripture, Ephes 2.8. <hi>By the grace of God you are saued through faith, and not of your selues.</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham belieued, and that was imputed vnto him for righteousnesse.</hi> Againe, <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him not that worketh, but that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him, which iustifieth the wicked, his faith is counted for righteousnesse.</hi> Luk. 8 Mark. 6. saith Christ, <hi>onely belieue:</hi>

So then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these words bee not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly extant, By faith alone we are iustified, yet the sense is manifestly put downe, and other words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto equiualent are contained in the Scripture: for whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, Rom. 3.28. <hi>We conclude, that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the Law.</hi> Certainely it is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4144:71"/>
all one, as if he said, Wee conclude that a man is iustified only by faith; for a man must needs be iustified ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by faith, or by workes; a third way none can be able to shew, <hi>Paul</hi> plainely saith to the Galath.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.15. <hi>Non opus est lege, quando impius per solam fidem iustificatur.

And that no man is iustified by workes, and so consequently, that our works doe not merit for vs forgiuenesse of sinnes, I prooue it by euident testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of holy Writ, I.

Secondly, a man knoweth not by those humane causes, and by the euent of Fortune, and the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and changes of these outward things. And therein the Text it selfe is a mouth to expound it selfe, for there it is said, that a man by externall changes, such as are riches, pouerty, health, sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, honour, contempt, that a man cannot by these things nor any other externall estate, iudge, and certainely know, whether hee bee in the fauour of God, or be hated by him.

glasse behold and know the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and afflictions of the Church militant on earth; and indeed that the Saints departed are not priuie to our affaires done vpon the earth, nor know any thing in specialtie, what happeneth among the liuing, that place in the 2. of Kings, Chap. 22. witnesseth, where God saith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iosiah,</hi> a most religious and holy King: <hi>I will gather thee vnto thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that thine eyes may not see all the euils: which</hi> I <hi>will bring vpon this place,</hi> Esay 57. <hi>The iust and the righteous are taken away from the sight of the euill,</hi> that in his yeares he may not behold the calamities, which are to be sent vpon the land for wretched impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

For in the Supper of the Lord remission of Sinnes is not granted vnto vs, neither hath the Bread or the Wine any power to purifie from sins, as the Papists peruresly do imagine.

                     <p>It consists in two things: First in a sure trust and confidence, whereby we beleeue for certaintie, that Christs body was giuen and his bloud shedde for vs: that is, for that person that commeth to be partaker of the Lords Supper.

and establishing of our faith as touching the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, for Christs body giuen vnto death for vs, and for his blood shed vpon the Crosse likewise for vs. The other vse is the nourishing, strengthening, reuiuing, and chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our consciences, which were by the burthen of sinne oppressed, dried vp, and disconsolate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Which is the secondary vse arising from the former?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is threefold: first, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of our selues, that euen as Christ offered himselfe once vpon the Altar of the Crosse for vs; so we should in this publike action of the Church offer vp our selues, and our whole life, euen all that are ours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God and his sonne. Secondly, the publike confession of our faith, to wit, that by these external symboles and tokens, as by a militarie marke and signet wee may testifie, vnto what company we belong, and to what religion wee adioyne our selues. Thirdly, the obligation of our selues, that wee should also by
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4144:96"/>
this publike action in the sight of the Church, bind our selues to loue our neighbour, and to do the works of charitie, especially to them that are partakers with vs in the same beliefe and religion. And hereupon it was, that the Ancients called this Supper of the Lord <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, <hi>a loue-feast</hi>; and that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies wont, which came vnto the Supper, to giue some almes vnto the poore, that so they might testi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ie, how that by the vse of the Lords Supper, they were obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme workes of loue and charitie towards their neighbours. And this is the true doctrine of the Lords Supper, drawne out of the onelie Word of God, and taken from the nature of Sacraments.<note place="margin">

of the holy Supper, before that euer he gaue his body and blood vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his disciples, did vnder the bread and wine offer vp himselfe truly, though after an vnbloody manner, for the honour of his Father, and that he did appoint then his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and all Ministers afterward to doe the like. As the Masse-priests indeede after a few words vttered, like Magical Spels and Charmes, &amp; after a few histrionicall gestures and ceremonies doe beare vs in hand that they doe. And further they blush not to affirme, that this Sacrament is a sacrifice, a most true propitiatorie sacrifice for the sins, punishments, and all wants not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the liuing,<note place="margin">Si Deus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misit peccata per vnam hostiam nec dum iam opus est se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda. <bibl>Chrys.</bibl> Saluatoris hostia semel oblata absoluit omnia fidaque in omne te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pus ꝓdurat.

                  <p>First, the <hi>subiect</hi> of our exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is our selues, and not others, as the Apostle saith; <hi>Let euery man examine himselfe, and so let him eate, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Cor. 11.28.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>matter</hi> wherein our examination must chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist (presupposing our generall and particular knowledge) is of three sorts. The first is, as touching our repentance: the second concerneth

our Faith. The third is about our Charitie.</p>
                  <p>Touching our <hi>Repentance</hi> thus. We cannot choose but know (our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences witnessing vnto vs) how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously wee doe daily offend against Gods holy statutes, both in thought, word, and deed: wherefore wee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hideous sinnes and misdeeds; for which, if God in his iustice would deale with vs,<note place="margin">1.

Let vs enter into the closets of our owne hearts, and see whether we find our selues inwardly sorry for all our misdoings: Secondly, confessing all our sinnes vnto the Lord: and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, growing to an inward hatred and loathing of sin, both in our selues and others: fourthly, fully purposing to conforme our selues according to Gods holy Lawes and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:4144:105"/>Touching our <hi>Faith</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Sin was that by which man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came miserable, and because he brake the commandements of God, and lightly regarded the behests of the most High, therefore was he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned out of his most blissefull and happy estate; but stood guiltie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death and condemnation both of body and soule for sinne. When man, sinfull man, stood in this dolefull case, destitute of all help and succour either from himselfe, or other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture liuing in the world, it pleased God of his owne loue and free mercy graciously to behold wretched man, and to send him a Sauiour, euen Iesus Christ the righteous, promising re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, libertie from the snare of the diuell; and in stead of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, euerlasting life to all those, which with a true faith and stedfast beliefe lay hold on Christs merits, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the promises of God in Christ to their owne soules in particular. This, when wee shall haue diligently weighed in our mindes, then let vs turne to our hearts, and see whether

                  <p>Touching <hi>Charitie</hi> on this wise. As charitie is the fruit and effect of a true and liuely faith (so that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible we should haue a sound faith, but wee must bee fruitfull in good workes and deeds of charitie; for as the light can in no wise bee separated from the sunne, nor heate from the fire; so neither can these two insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vertues be disioyned,<note place="margin">

that is, the outward elements of bread and wine; as also from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardfull contemplation of euery ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that holy ministration.</p>
                  <p>First therefore when wee see the <hi>bread and wine set before vs</hi> on the Lords Table, we know that they <hi>are appointed for the nourishing</hi> &amp; streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of our bodies, but here wee must not stay.

                  <p>Secondly, when wee see the <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bread, and powring out of the wine</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our hearts are to bee led to the meditation on the cruell death of the Crosse, which Christ suffered for the remission of our sinnes, when his most blessed <hi>body was broken,</hi> and his most <hi>precious blood shed</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of mankind.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when wee see that the bread which is broken and giuen vnto vs by the Minister, is all of <hi>the

same loafe, or at the least of the same graine</hi>; and the wine whereof wee drinke, that it commeth from the same grapes, and receiued by vs in the same cup, wee are hereby to bee led to the meditation on that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> which we haue with al Gods Saints, which are partakers of those holy mysteries, and to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that vnion, which wee haue, or should haue among our selues, as members of one mysticall body, whereof C. Iesus is the head.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, when we eate that holied bread, and drinke that consecrated wine, wee know, that they turne to nutriment for our bodies, and so consequently that they grow <hi>into one substance</hi>: hereby are wee led to a further meditation on our <hi>incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> into Christ Iesus, to be made one with him, and hee with vs: so that hereby we may assure our hearts of our reconciliation with God, and of all the benefits of Christs death and passion: for seeing Christ is become ours, how shal not God with Christ giue vs all things?</p>

                     <hi>And these are those holy Meditations whereupon we must bestow the best of our thoughts in that so sacred a businesse: now as touching the triall of our soules, after the receiuing of those holy mysteries, note but this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that the Lord hath fed our soules so graciously at his owne ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we must take heed we proue not vnthankfull to the louing kindnesse of the Lord. And therefore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of vs, and that not for a day or a weeke, or some small time, but euen for euer continually to retaine a thankfull remembrance of those blessings, whereof we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers in Christ Iesus; as also neuer to let slip out of our mind that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeable promise, which hath past betwixt God and vs. The Lord promising to be our God, and wee promising henceforth to become Gods faithfull &amp; obedient seruants, to serue him in holinesse and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse all the remainder of our life.

Wherefore to good purpose it is, that we propose to our hearts a triall of our selues, euen after our receiuing: for though a man by the sight of the soyle may gather by some gesse, what fruit wil come vp; yet when he sees the fruit, the matter is farre more sure.
