            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The firſt of theſe (which was formerly publiſhed as a Catechiſm, and is now cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected)
<pb facs="tcp:59503:3"/>
was to me a work of greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty than greater Volumes; which thoſe will underſtand, that have tryed what it is to avoid <hi>Defectiveneſs, Redundancies,</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders</hi> in ſuch a draught, (which yet I know I have not perfectly attained). The Uſes to which it was intended are theſe. 1. Whereas Mr. <hi>John Dury</hi> (who hath laboured above thirty years for the healing the Diviſions among the Proteſtant Churches) did ſend to the Miniſters of this County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> to give him their advice and aſſiſtance in that moſt deſireable work; and whereas one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of our Advice was, that the Churches ſhould hold their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> in <hi>Neceſſary things,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> in things <hi>not neceſſary,</hi> and <hi>Charity in both,</hi> and that they ſhould each ſend to other a <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>their Faith,</hi> containing only ſuch <hi>Neceſſary things,</hi> and thereupon deſire the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement and Communion of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: <hi>This Profeſſion</hi> is purpoſely fitted to that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi>; containing as much as neighbour-Churches ſhould require; in order to that diſtant Communion with us or others, which ſeveral Churches are capable of; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nothing but what all Chriſtian Churches are agreed in. And whereas many
<pb facs="tcp:59503:3"/>
have ſaid, that it is defective, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth nothing but what a Papiſt will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe; I anſwer, It is ſo much the better: The Churches had a perfect or ſufficient Symbole or Confeſſion of Faith, before Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery (Name or Thing) was known in the world: And they are not bound to alter and enlarge it, as oft as errours ſhall ariſe: The Rule muſt ſtill remain the ſame, and [A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of all that is contrary to this Rule] is that which we muſt do in oppoſition to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and Errours. We have no new Religion, but the ſame antient Faith which was before Popery was conceived. If we have nothing but what they confeſs to be true, then <hi>our Faith</hi> is juſtified by them, (and ſo we are on the ſurer ſide): but they having much which we deny, their <hi>Faith</hi> as <hi>Popiſh</hi> is condemned by us, though their <hi>Faith as Chriſtian</hi> we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another uſe of this <hi>Profeſſion</hi> is to be a <hi>ſufficient</hi> teſt for particular Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; (where Authority leaveth it to the Church.) I will not reject him as defective in the Articles of his Belief, who believeth but what is comprehend in this Summe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is alſo uſeful for the <hi>Catechizing</hi> of the Ignorant, and the clear explication of the
<pb facs="tcp:59503:4"/>
Creeds and the ten Commandements, to the underſtandings of the weak. I know it is an inconvenience to children, to have Anſwers ſo <hi>long</hi> to ſome of the Queſtions: Which I would have redreſſed, if I could have done it without greater inconveniences. And I know that there are hundreds of Catechiſms abroad already: But if I could have told where to have found one that had contained as much as this doth, in as few words, and no worſe order, I had ſpared this labour. Since the firſt Edition of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I received the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that I have taken notice of, in certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, from the moſt Learned Author Mr. <hi>Thomas Greaves,</hi> much ſuited to the ſame deſigns as this.</p>
                  <p>To this laſt uſe ſome will think that there is wanting the Definition of the Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Lords Supper: But to them I ſay, 1. The antient Church did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely conceal the myſterie of the Euchariſt from the Catechumenes, till they were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized. 2. And then it was by <hi>ſight</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the actual celebration, that they firſt and chiefly learned the nature of it. 3. And he that <hi>nameth</hi> them with their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> and <hi>Ends,</hi> (as I have here done) ſuppoſing that he ſpeaketh to ſuch as have ſeen the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
<pb facs="tcp:59503:4"/>
may perhaps eſcape the cenſure of omitting any thing that is of true Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; the Doctrine and Thing ſignified by them being before explained. 4. But yet I have afterwards given a Deſcription of them, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. &amp; 46. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 8. &amp; 34. from whence it may be fetched for the uſe of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is alſo uſeful to my ſelf, and others in my caſe, that have ſwarms of malicious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, that would fain be queſtioning the ſoundneſs of our Faith, and accuſing us of Errours; and that have need to make it known what indeed is our Religion to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates or Brethren, for their ſatisfaction and our juſt defence. If any queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What is <hi>My Religion? It is here expreſſed</hi>: It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in [<hi>my Belief of all that God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me, and my Love of God in himſelf and in all the appearances of his Goodneſs; my Truſt in his fidelity, and Hope of all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Mercies; and my Obedience to him in all his Laws; My Aſſent and Conſent in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to all the Will of God revealed in Nature or the Holy Scriptures, as far as I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them: and in particular and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to all the parts of this Profeſſion.</hi>] This is my Religion; I doubt not but this much
<pb facs="tcp:59503:5"/>
will be acceptable with God, and ſufficient to ſalvation: If it be not acceptable to men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ſufficient to my being Reputed Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and accepted into their Communion, the Day is at hand that ſhall reveal, whether the fault was <hi>theirs</hi> or <hi>mine.</hi> I will reject no man of <hi>this Religion</hi> from my <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Communion</hi>: I will cenſure, or moleſt, or perſecute none ſuch: If they will do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by me, the ſuffering will at laſt be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, where the fault was greateſt.</p>
                  <p>And yet (though I adhere to the antient ſimplicity) I will not be wanting to ſatisfie any as far as I am able: And therefore I have added the other two parts: <hi>The Agreement of the Aſſociated Miniſters,</hi> is intended for nothing elſe but a ſufficient enumeration of all thoſe things which Paſtors, being left to ſo much liberty by the Magiſtrate, ſhould Agree in voluntarily among themſelves: But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that it is only for ſuch times and places of Liberty; (and there it may ſerve inſtead of all the Volumes of Canons and Decrees:) But in places and times of greater ſtrictneſs, where the Civil Rulers grant no ſuch Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Churches, much of the Articles of Agreement are in vain, and not to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed; eſpecially much in the ſixth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb facs="tcp:59503:5"/>
Articles: And as we juſtly ſwear in the Oath of Supremacy, that the King is the only Supream Governour of this Realm, in all Cauſes Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical (that is, as <hi>to all Coercive Government about ſuch Cauſes,</hi> diſtinct from <hi>Spiritual Government by the Keyes of the Word upon mens Conſciences</hi>) ſo we muſt accordingly obey him; and no Agreements, or Covenants, or Canons of our own or others, without a true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prohibition from the Law of God, muſt be pretended againſt our obedience to lawful powers. For Gods Law having already bound us to obey our Rulers, we cannot by any Power, or Covenants, or Agreements of our own, diſoblige our ſelves: Otherwiſe men might evade a great part of their duty; and while they pretend to diſpence with the Laws of God, they ſhould, in a ſort, ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as above him. But if man command us to diſobey our Maker, we muſt diſobey that command, though with patient ſubmiſſion to ſufferings, without reſiſtance, or reproaching of our Governours.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſome men of narrow prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, are calling for Aſſent to many more particulars (eſpecially about Church-Offices, and Worſhip, and Diſcipline) and will not
<pb facs="tcp:59503:6"/>
bear with thoſe that in ſmaller things diſſent from them, eſpecially if Miniſters; I have added 80. <hi>Theſes</hi> about the Offices of the Miniſters of Chriſt, containing ſuch things as one would think, for <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Quality,</hi> might be taken as ſufficient for our <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with thoſe whoſe <hi>Opinions</hi> hinder not the proſperity of <hi>their Charity</hi> and of <hi>the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now call me by what <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Title</hi> thou ſeeſt cauſe; here thou haſt my <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and my <hi>Judgement</hi> about the matters of the Church: If thou deſire to ſee the practical part that will bear it, exemplified in any <hi>Forms,</hi> I ſhould not refuſe to give thee ſuch ſatisfaction upon any juſt occaſion. I know of <hi>no Title</hi> that well agreeth to the nature of that <hi>Religion</hi> which indeed <hi>I hold,</hi> and which I have here propoſed, and which I think would be fit for the Churches to agree in, but <hi>CHRISTIAN</hi> &amp; <hi>CATHOLIKE,</hi> and theſe I own: If thou give me any other, let him that maketh or uſeth it, be reſponſible for it.</p>
                  <p>Underſtand alſo that this <hi>General Part,</hi> containing the <hi>Poſitives of the Catholike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and fit materials of <hi>Catholike Concord,</hi> is but the <hi>firſt Part</hi> of the Book, the <hi>ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59503:6"/>
being ſomewhat large, as containing the particular terms on which the Abaſſines, Armenians, Greeks, Romaniſts, Lutheranes, Calviniſts, Arminians, Contra-remonſtrants, Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, Independents, and moderate Anabaptiſts ſhould be agreed: and diſcovering that with moſt of the parties, the preſent diſagreements are not ſuch as ſhould break Communion, and cauſe them to reject each other as too many uncharitably do.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with one neceſſary Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement to thee, that if thou wouldſt not be cheated of thy Religion by thoſe that are ſtill perſwading men that the eſſentials or Fundamentals of Religion as diſtinct from the Integral parts cannot be known, becauſe no one certain perfect form of words is given to the Church which containeth thoſe and none but thoſe, remember that it is the <hi>matter</hi> and ſence <hi>believed, Loved</hi> and <hi>Obeyed</hi> that is the eſſence of Religion and neceſſary to ſalvation for it ſelf; but the <hi>Words</hi> are only <hi>Neceſſary</hi> as <hi>revealing</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the <hi>Matter</hi>: And therefore the <hi>ſame form of words</hi> or <hi>ſentences</hi> is not <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> alike to all.
