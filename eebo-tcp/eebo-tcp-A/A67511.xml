         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Metamorphos'd Beau, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Royal <hi>Britannia,</hi> who after many brave and glorious Exploits,
perform'd in Service of its Country, at length came to an Anchor
in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> a Harbour both Safe and Secure, notwithstanding
those dangerous Rocks and quick Sands, that border about it,
Threatning Ruine and Destruction to any bold Adventurer that should
dare to Attempt, or Expect Shelter in its Liberty, which several by
fatal Experience can Testifie; but now, thanks to our Senate, is made
Navigable.</p>
            <p>Upon the Arrival of which, I went Aboard, in pursuit of a Friend,
who had the Honour of a considerable Post of Command, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my Desires I found him; but so Transmogrify'd, that, I protest, I
could hardly give Credit to my own Eyes; <hi>Ye Gods!</hi> Cry'd I, <hi>What do
I behold? Or are my Opticks deceiv'd? This is certainly some Illusion, and not
my Friend; who when he first Imbark'd, made such a Noble Figure, That the
Men o'er whom he was to Command, were fill'd with Admiration; the Fair
Sex, in Murmuring Sighs, Condol'd his Loss; and by their Repeated Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
invok'd</hi> Mars, Bellona, Neptune, <hi>and the Boistrous</hi> Aeolus, <hi>to protect
him from all danger, and waft him safe ashore again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gods were all Propitious to their last request; and return'd their
mighty Charge back again with Life; but, alas, had Expos'd his Person
to all the Casualties that attend such Desperate Performances; <hi>Mars</hi> and
<hi>Bollona,</hi> notwithstanding they Honour'd him with Victory, and guarded
his Life, gave him to understand, by those several Marks of Honour,
which they so liberally bestow'd on him, that he was not Invulnerable; <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
that Bright God, and Watry <hi>Neptune,</hi> with his briny Surface, by their
Multiplicity of Embraces, so Tann'd his Hide, that he seems to be the
Off-spring of an <hi>Ethiopian:</hi> Nay, surly <hi>Boreas,</hi> that was the chiefest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
in his return, by his Rough Usage, had Exercis'd the part of a
profest Enemy, on his Attire; for, Oh ye Powers! What a strange
Metamorphose have ye Created, not to be parallell'd! those Locks, those
Sacred Locks, that us'd to Adorn his Shoulders, and Modestly Harbour'd
as much Powder as would stock a Suburbian Tonsor, are now become
as Lank, as the Mane of an old Hackney. Thy Phiz, that Charming
Phiz, so admir'd by the Ladies, and was impossible to behold without
becoming its Captive, hath now lost its Charms, though beset with
Rubies, and most fearful Scars, instead of Tempting Patches. Thy Eyes,
those fatal Luminaries, that have darted so many Killing Glances, and
learing Ogles, and prov'd as dangerous as <hi>Basilisks</hi> to the Female Sex,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59565:3"/>
are now dull, and heavy. Thy Tongue, thy fluid Tongue, thy bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tongue, that was Tipt with Eloquence, and attended with such
an Acute Wit, by which thou Conquer'd'st more Hearts than <hi>Alexander;</hi>
and deliverd'st Love-Sentences as profound as an Oracle, is now Seal'd
with Silence. Thy Garb, that us'd to be so very Nice, and hang with
such a dexterous Air, is now as shatter'd as the Rigging of thy Ship;
and looks as if it had hung 18 Months at a Stall in <hi>Long-Lane;</hi> Nay, thy
Fragrant Perfumes, and Odoriferous Scents of Essence Bottles, hath lost
their Odour, and is Usurpt by the more powerful, Pitch, Tarr, and Okum.</p>
            <p>Prithee, my Friend, answer'd he, why do'st thou Cautarize me thus?
I Bless my Stars, my <hi>Corpus</hi> hath receiv'd no dammage; but am return'd
sound Wind and Limb, Boy; full fraught with Vigour, and dare attack
a whole Fleet of Female Frigates. Come, no more of this; do'st not
remember the Old Phrase in the Almanack? <hi>Omnia rerum Vicissitudo.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
upon the Receipt of my Golden hopes, for this Summers Expedition,
I'll new Rigg, assume my former Station, disannul the Tar, and appear
all <hi>Beau;</hi> give my self Airs, renew my former Acquaintance with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and for the future, fight under <hi>Venus</hi> Banners only.</p>
            <p>Yes, Faith, cry'd I, thou hast been a Champion, for the Ladies cause;
and hast play'd the part of a Heroe; Witness thy damn'd Snuffling, and
drawing of thy Legs; and hast had more Pills, Bolusses, and Ingredients
of Compounds and Simples in thy Guts, than would furnish an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries-Shop;
and can'st thou be so void of Reason, as to flatter thy self
with hopes to think the Ladies will dispence with that Weather-beaten
Phiz, those frightful Scars, and halting Legs of thine, when every day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
new Objects to their Eyes? Why, in the <hi>Park,</hi> thou wou'd'st be
taken for the Relick of some <hi>Hospital;</hi> in the <hi>Play-house,</hi> for some Old
<hi>Cock-Baw'd,</hi> or a Bully of <hi>Alsatia.</hi> Nay, the very Mob, will congratulate
you with <hi>Your humble Servant Colonel</hi> Hacker. No, Prithee harbour no
such thought; but think rather of being the Subject of their Derision.
Therefore take my Advice, Let the Bottle be thy Mistress for the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
And since 'tis thy Fate, to be thus Metamorphos'd, by which thou
art discarded of the Ladies Favours; yet notwithstanding, it may prove
very Beneficial, and useful to you, on the contrary Party. In the first
place, thy <hi>Soars</hi> will be discanted on, as so many Badges of Honour, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Service of your Countrey, (and <hi>Venus</hi> together) Likewise
be a means to conceal you from the Knowledge of old Duns, cast-off
Mistresses, Bilk'd Coachmen and Link Boys. In a word, thou would'st
puzzle an <hi>Athenian</hi> to make an Inspection into the Tar, and from thence
to decipher a Compleat Beau.</p>
            <p>Come, no more hesitating, on my Misfortune, I beseeeh you, answer'd
he, or ridiculing my Person; but go down with me, and I will give you
such a Bowl, that shall convince you, if thou art not an Infidel, that our
Living, and present Appearance, may Compensate with a Gaudy Suit and
an abandon'd Pocket.</p>
            <p>Upon which he carry'd me to his Cabbin, which we found bedeck'd
with a Jovial Crew, surrounding an Inundation of Celestial Liquor; where
without Ceremoney we took our Seats; and were Conformable to our
Company: and straight a Health was propos'd to the Royal <hi>Britannia,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59565:3"/>
and prosperity, to fair <hi>Albion;</hi> and no sooner was it mentioned, but Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were given to Furle her Sails, let fly her proud Streamers, Sound
her Instruments of War, and discharge; her thundering Gods bidding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
to the insulting Billows; and Quaft our jolly Cups to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<hi>Bacchus.</hi> But as ill Luck would have it, in the midst of our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousing,
my Friend was taken with a sudden Qualm; but whether the
Fatigue of his Wooden Castle, or the Noble Spirit of our Liquor,
occasion'd this Disaster, I know not; but calling me aside, desir'd me
to withdraw with him; and take a Walk to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s. For, said he,
I believe the Walk and Diversion we shall find there, will Divert my
Indisposition. Bless me! Cry'd I, I am afraid your are worse than you
think for; and that your Malady has seiz'd on your Brain; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
none but a Madman would offer to leave such good Company, where
nothing but Friendship flows, and Bumpers Crown our Joys, for an
Ogle of some Damn'd Amorous Jilt, offering up her Orisons, for good
success to her Letcherous Tail; or some old Insatiate Whore, whose desires
are no more to be Quench'd then the Sulphurous Flames of <hi>Aetna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No, no, my Friend; Sit down, keep your Temper, be Easie, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
your Friends; and I do not question but in a short time you'll see
your Errour. But alas, all the Rhetorick I was Master of, could not
perswade him; for the Flesh and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s were predominant. You
see, my Friend, cry'd he, we have had hot Service already, and 'tis like
to continue, which at this time, I would willingly avoid, by reason I
can impute my present Indisposition to nothing but the Fumes of the
Bowl; and a Natural Inclination of seeing some of my Old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which my long Absence hath almost blotted from my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
and likewise an Itch of Curiosity, to see that noble Fabrick, of whom
Fame speaks so Loud. Then Embracing me, with a damn'd insinuating
Hugg, let's haste to our Mother Church, and see what Female Saints
adores her Shrine. Yes, Faith, cry'd I, the Petty-coat, I find Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
your chiefest Devotion, and is the only Saint you want to Adore;
and since that neither your Absence, or Foreign Climates, have had any
Operation on your Fleshly Constitution, which in part to gratifie, and
also to satisfie your Curiosity, since thou art so Obstinately bent, I will
comply with your Request, tho' I must Confess, 'tis with no small Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy,
to leave these brave <hi>Bacchanalians,</hi> Enlivening their Noble Souls,
to Board, perhaps, a <hi>Fireship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No sooner resolv'd on, but perform'd; we took Leave of our Company,
(but on my part with much regret,) so Strowl'd down <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> and up
<hi>Ludgate-hill;</hi> but as soon as we approach'd the Gate, my Friend made a Stop;
Bless me! ye Powers, cry'd he, What Venerable old Antiquary hath
new Rigg'd Queen <hi>Bess?</hi> By my Soul she looks as Amorous, as if she
was Seated on her Throne, with her Unhappy Favorite by her side.</p>
            <p>Sir, answer'd a Fellow that over heard him, the same Bountiful Hand
hath done no less for Old king <hi>Ludd,</hi> and his two Sons; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
our wise Ancestors Converted his Palace to a Prison, it now
makes as great a Figure as any of our Inns of Court; and I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
its Students are as great Proficients in the Law. Upon which, I

is Allow'd to be the best of Prisons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The best it self, is bad enough, answer'd my Friend, by reason of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</p>

            <p>Well then, said I, let's see this Cave of Captivitie; and who knows
but we may light on some old Rakish Acquaintance there, bury'd in
oblivion? With all my Heart, said he, and let's refer our Intrigues at St.
<hi>Pauls,</hi> to some other opportunity. I am certain, cry'd I, 'twill be more
acceptable to Visit poor Prisoners, and bestow some Charity on them,
than to fall on our knees at St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> with a seeming Devotion, and
our Lew'd Thoughts roving after vain Chimera's. Come then, since
thou art resolv'd, we'll see this famous Seminary, whose lofty Structure
derives it Original from the Ruies of Heroick <hi>Ludd.</hi> Upon which the
Fellow was mighty officious, and presently had us to the Porch,
which was throng'd with several of his Function, as we understood,
waiting (like so many Porters at a Bench) for Employment; and no
sooner were we up the Steps, but our Guide with an Audible Voice, cry'd
<hi>Doctor, Doctor;</hi> upon which, the Doctor quitted his Kennel, muttering
at the Fellow for making such a hideous Noise, telling him he believ'd
by his Yelping he thought he was at his old Rendezvouze, the <hi>Bear-Garden.</hi>
No, Old <hi>Swag-belly,</hi> Answered <hi>Touzer,</hi> the <hi>Bear-Garden,</hi> is of
more repute than a Prison; Therefore no Comparisons, I beseech you;
for there is Liberty; and Confinement is the Devil. Besides, what's
more Scandalous than a Jayl? With that replyed the Turn-key, thou
little sorry Fellow, to complain of the Scandal of a Goal, when Thou thy
self art the chiefest ingredient that Scandal is compounded of; which
by tracing thy Pedigree but three degrees backwards, will be evident
proof; as first, a <hi>Devil</hi> to a Printing-house; from thence advanced to
a <hi>Butcher;</hi> and now art arriv'd to a degree worse than both, a <hi>Bull-Dog;</hi>
the three only Qualifications, I know of, that Center in that word
<hi>Scandal;</hi> and well may our Studients Condition be desperate, who are
continually plagu'd with such a Number of Spunging, Sharping, Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Whelps, as you and your Brethren. Our Guide finding his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist
too hard for him, slunk in his Ears; which if he had had but his
desert, would have been separated from his Calves-head some years ago;
and return'd him no Answer, but desir'd him to open the Hatch, which
accordingly he did, and in we went.</p>
            <p>And our Conductor bid us to follow him, which very cautiously we
did; and turn'd into a Room on our Left hand, which my thoughts
was very absurd, seeing that on the Right was a more Spacious Place,
for the first reception of Strangers; and I told our Guide my Sentiments
of his Conduct: <hi>Sir,</hi> answer'd a Fellow that over-heard me, <hi>We who have
the Misfortune to be confin'd here, have all been guilty of the like Enormity;

Box. Having made this Repartee, he mov'd to a Table by the Fire-side,
which was begirt with Students, Contemplating on the History of the four
Kings; some Swearing that he that should offer to Beg with two Trumps in
his Hand, understood the right of the Game no more than he did the Turkish
Alcoran. In denyal of which, and to Convince those bold Assertors
of their Error, up starts a Smoke-dry'd Fellow out of the Chimney-Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and gives a Challenge to take a Game for a Pot of Sir <hi>Iohn Parsons,</hi>
and was presently receiv'd; but how it should be paid for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was a Nice
Point; for cry'd <hi>Scowerian</hi> the Taplash, There must be the Ready Rino for
Sir <hi>Iohn.</hi> But however, tho' there was no Faith in the Bar, yet for
their Honours sake, the Cause should not be dropt, as long as there was
Moveables to be engag'd. Well, silence was proclaimed, and to it they
went, to decide this mighty Argument, which a long time was very
dubious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay so partial was Fortune, That the Plantiff's whole depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
was on the turning up of a Lucky Knave; and as chance would
have it, accordingly he did, which occasion'd repeated Vollies of Huzza's,
and was very much applauded by his own Party, for the Managing
of his Cards for so Nice a Cut, and his profound Judgment in that
Noble Science. But alas, how fickle is Fortune? And just reason have
the Artists to decipher her on a Wheel, to shew the Unstableness of her
Favours; by which they give us to Understand, that we ought not to
put too much Confidence in the uppermost Spoke; for notwithstanding
she Favour'd him in the Game, yet she Bilk'd him of the Prize; for
the Fellow making more than ordinary haste, hearing of the Huzza,
makes a Trip upon the Stairs, and down falls Sir <hi>Iohn.</hi> Ill News hath
swift Wings, and this Disaster occasion'd a Quarrel between the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Taplash: Nay some declared, they had rather have heard of
the downfall of <hi>London-Bridge;</hi> and fell a Railing at the Fellow, and
Cursing of Fortune, calling her all the Names that Malice could invent,
as <hi>Whore, Bawd,</hi> and <hi>Bilking Strumpet;</hi> whereon a Stander-by, being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more sedate than the rest, made this reply:
<q>
                  <l>Fortune ye term a <hi>Strumpet, Bawd,</hi> and <hi>Whore,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Yet still the Sons of Fortune we adore.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But rather than be thus Baffled, and their hopes prove Abortive, they
agreed to take the other Game; but withal, gave the Fellow a strict
Charge to take more Care for the future, or else his Ears, if his Purse
could not, should pay for it. In which Engagement we left them, and
ask'd our Guide the Name of that Room. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> say'd he, <hi>Tis call'd
the</hi> Rules, <hi>and is more Commodious to Accommodate Strangers than the Cellar,
by reason they can be more Private with a Friend, and not Expos'd to the
View of all the Prisoners.</hi> However, said my Friend, you who when you
were at Liberty, could not Live within Compass, must now be Content
to be Confin'd to the <hi>Rules</hi> of a Prison. In answer to which he shook
his Head, and led us into the aforemention'd Room.</p>
            <p>This Place Gentlemen, <hi>said he,</hi> is called the <hi>Lumbree;</hi> but from whence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives

            <p>No sooner had the Fellow done speaking, but all of a sudden descends the
Stairs a Torrent of Mob, hauling of two Criminals, crying, <hi>Open the</hi> Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crackers,
<hi>open the</hi> Stocks, who were presently obey'd, and the Criminals
boored with abundance of Expedition; who sat in greater State, and Pomp,
and attended by a larger Retinue, than old King <hi>Lud</hi> in all his Grandure.
But making an inquiry into their Misdemeanour, I understood it was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Contriv'd Business, and a design'd thing on one of the Offenders, tho'
they could not manage it, without bringing the other Party in, lest they
should give a distaste to the whole House, for Prisons have their Picque's and
Parties, as well as States; but most seem'd to rejoyce at one of the Sufferers
Calamity, whose Obstinacy confin'd his Heels some hours longer than his
Fellow Sufferers. But a Friend, by Accident, happening to come to Visit
the Old Duke, at last perswaded him to sign his Submission, which is
Recorded as an Example for others to take Warning by. But as soon
as he found his Heels at Liberty, up Stars he scowr'd, threatning what he
would do, when time should serve.</p>
            <p>And straight the Clock struck five, upon which, up comes a Fellow
from the Cellar, making a most hideous Noise, and runs up stairs Yelp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Five a Clock, Mr.</hi> Steward, <hi>Five a Clock, Mr.</hi> Steward. Who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
made his Personal Appearance, at this dreadful Summons, jangling
his Keys, like a Sexton of a Parish; and seats himself at the upper-end
of the Table, with the Constable of the Day at his right Hand, and
several other inferiour Officers gave their Attendance, to assist at the
casting up the Total of the Boxes. The Mob likewise crowding to see
how they rise, and several others to Dun. The Boxes being brought,
our they lug Pen, Ink, and Paper; and after some three or four times
Telling, and as many times casting up, least Mistakes should happen,
they set down the Sum, and pay off the Distributions, and adjust Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts;
a very hard Task, I assure you; and dare affirm, are as much
puzled, as if the State of the Nation lay before them. In the performing
of which, there arose a hot Debate about the Allowance of some Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner,
in which dispute we left them, and went up Stairs into a large
Room on the Right Hand, Which <hi>Towzer</hi> told us was called the <hi>White
Room. In this Room</hi> said he, <hi>we make our Election; and if any Difference
happen to arise that cannot be decided among our selves, we send for the Right
Honourable the Lord Mayor, or Sheriffs, and entertain them in this Room, and
are Oblig'd, to leave it to their Descision; after which, there is to be no dispute.

is also a Fire kept, for the Vse of Charity-men, by reason they have no Chimney
in their Ward, where a Sundays they boyl their Kettle-Pot of Chumps, a certain
Allowance they have on Sabbath days, to the great Destruction of Neck-Beef, of

is commonly beset like a Noble-mans Gate; and if I might speak my Sentiments;
I think they Verify the old Proverb,</hi> God sends Meat, but the Devil Cooks;
<hi>And Faith 'tis well they have no Sir</hi> Courtly-Nice, <hi>to Diet. This place
is also commonly chosen for to decide any Quarrels, in trying who is the

Eat than Fight: In a Word, 'tis the most necessary Room in the whole House.

               <hi>But being tyr'd with this long Harangue, on this spacious Room,
we desir'd him to with-draw into some other Apartment:</hi> O Gentlemen,
<hi>says he,</hi> I must beg your Patience a little longer, for I had like to have Omitted
one of the greatest Concerns that is manag'd in this Room; for the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Nature of a Club, in order to the Election the succeeding Morning, by which

making of Parties for the Election of a Lord Mayor, than there is in this Puny-Colledge,
in the choice of a Box-man; at which time, if the Devil were to cast
a Net, he would have a hopeful Fry, for I dare avouch without any Ostentation,
that in an Assembly of any Twenty of them, you shall find a Score of Knaves:
Now, Gentlemen, I have done here, and will shew you the the next Apartment; Withall
begging your Pardons for being so tedious; and Promise you, in shewing you the
remainder, to Vse all the proxility I can.</p>
            <p>This, Gentlemen, is called the <hi>Lower-Ward,</hi> and is kept the most decent of all
the Wards in the House; you see 'tis very sweet and Clean, and their Beds are
in very good Order, likewise a good Convenience for dressing of their Diet; and
have a more regular Order, than the rest of the Wards: <hi>But seeing of a poor
Ignorant Fellow in a black Cap walking about, I ask'd what he was?
Upon which, answer was made me,</hi> That he had been a Wholesale <hi>Patten-Maker.
Methinks, said my Friend, he resembles an old heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
for I can see his Arse thro' his Pocket-holes.</hi> Misfortunes, Sir,
<hi>said one that stood by,</hi> will dismantle a Christian Stoick, and were you but to
hear how he has been dealt by in his Dealings, you would Commiserate his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For his Shop-Books will make it appear, that he never gave Credit above Six-pence,
or was Debtor 50 Shillings. 'Tis discours'd his Creditors are a going to
take out a Statute of Bankrupt against him, which will be very hard, considering
his Circumstances; but rather than deliver up his Accompts, we advise him to
turn himself over to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> that he may gain his Liberty, and Travel with
his Effects, before 'tis too late; and not to spend the Residue of his Stock in a
Prison: But we find he is rather inclin'd to continue here, and in short Time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects

            <p>Our Guide taking us up another Pair of Stairs, in the Ascending of which,
I perceiv'd a dark Entry, and a lesser Stair-Case, which occasion'd me to
ask where that went? For you must know, I was very inquisitive, as you
will find by the sequel; he told us, It led to the Masters-side, and that
he wou'd bring us down that way, when he had show'd us all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
In order to which, he proceeded. And had us into another Room,
telling us, it was call'd the <hi>Chappel-Ward,</hi> which made my Friend Laugh,
asking him if they Exercis'd any Religious Worship there, or were of
the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> for I have heard Ministers and their Widows have
the Priviledge of this Colledge. <hi>That is true, Sir,</hi> said one of them; <hi>But

us, was call'd the <hi>Charity-Ward,</hi> belonging to the Men that begg'd at the

go, the more you will Complain, I am afraid:</hi> Well, said my Friend, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
our Curiosity, we must dispence with the Hogo: This Ward is
very much Discours'd of, on the Account of Monsieur <hi>Shawny,</hi> who is
fixt against the Wall, of whom they tell you very Strange Stories; as
that he derives his Pedigree from the Antipodes, and is of an invisible
Substance, can pass or repass through the Key-hole of a Door, or any
small <hi>Crevice,</hi> and convey what ever is requir'd of him, upon Non-Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Flooridge, which is eighteen-pence, a due Debt, contracted by
Custom, to be spent among them that lye on the same Floor; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he is but little in Stature, he is of great Strength of Body, can
carry Coats, Waste-coats, Hats, Shooes, or Stockings, which I am afraid
you will hardly Credit, much more if you was to hear them affirm, that
not long since, he carry'd off a Night Gown and Waste-coat, and had
got off clear, had he not had a Fool to his Clerk; for the Miscarriage of
which, he was Cashier'd from his Office, ridicul'd by the whole House,
and very narrowly escap'd the Stocks. This being all that was worth
our Notice there, our Guide told us, <hi>We were now going to the</hi> Lofty-Ward,

that well enough, and could Wish they were all so.</hi> Methinks, said my Friend, You are
very ridged in your Discourse: <hi>Not at all, Sir,</hi> said he, <hi>For if any Difference happens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, we have such a Clamorous Noise, that I am Confident it would drown St.</hi> Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
<hi>Bells; say you so,</hi> reply'd one of them, <hi>Mr. Lick and Smell? I assure you, if you
cannot Dispence with our Tongues, you shall have nothing to do with our Tails.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this being nothing to the Purpose, I desir'd them very seriously to tell me
the Truth, for I took that only for Banter.</hi> No, <hi>cry'd the whole</hi> Seraglio, She is
in Love, and Dotes even to Distraction: <hi>Dotage indeed, says I; for it cannot be call'd
Love at these Years.</hi> No, <hi>answer'd she,</hi> I Love and burn with as pure a Flame, as e'er was
Sacrific'd at Love<hi>'s</hi> Altar: <hi>Then fell on her</hi> Knees <hi>at the Bed-side, &amp; turn'd her Face from
us. Upon which, I ask'd who it was that she was in Love with?</hi> Divinity, <hi>answer'd they,</hi>
in Masquerade, and a Fellow-Prisoner with us, but he shuns her Company, and is deaf to
her Courtship, which is the occasion of her Frenzie. <hi>Oh Love, cry'd I, how Immense
is thy Power, and Uncontroulable thy Will! thou that could'st in the height of Rage,
and Passion, melt the Fierce</hi> Atticus <hi>into humble Love, and pierce his Obdurate Heart
with the Fair Nymphs all-Conquering Eyes: Nay, was it not Love, that Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd</hi>
Daphne <hi>to a Tree, and</hi> Iove <hi>himself into a Town-Bull?</hi> Oh why do'st thou
Tyrannize o'er Age; whose Strength's decay'd, and Vigour's spent? Is there not Youth, Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Youth, to Exercise thy Power on, and dart thy Flames at? Oh, Commiserate her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
Quench her Desires, or put a Period to her Days. Faith Master, <hi>said a Fellow that
stood by, as a Guardian to her,</hi> That's a good Prayer, and may it find success; for we can
very well spare her, for we have such a parcel of Hypocritical Animals, both Old and Young,
Male and Female, that occasions a great deal of Trouble in our Civil Government. But to
be as brief as possible, I will relate but a few of their Qualifications: We have some as Rank
as <hi>Goates,</hi> as Prime as Wolfes, as Salt as Bitches, and as Lustful as Satyrs, as Apish as
Monkeys, and as full of Play as my Ladys Lap-dog: Nay, as serious as a Whore at a

as Sober as Citts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>No sooner had the Fellow done speaking, but up Starts an Old Woman, Saying,
<hi>I hope Sir, you will not Credit what this Sorry Rascal says. Why,</hi> said he, <hi>You old</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-piece,
<hi>I say nothing but the Truth, and can prove it, if occasion require. Sir,</hi> cry'd

he, <hi>This Old</hi> Fornicatress, <hi>this Old</hi> Harridan, <hi>this Old piece of</hi> Mortality, <hi>who hath
never a Tooth in her Head, will hold a Discourse for five Hours by the Clock, on Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisence,
and Swear she'll not trust to her Age:</hi> At which the Old Countess began to
Exercise her Tongue, and likewise her Hands, letting fly a Chamber-Pot at his
Head, Muttering, <hi>Why so Old, why so Old, you beggarly Bastard?</hi> In which Ingagement
we left them. And turning about, I Spy'd a Fellow, reading some Lines, that was
Writ on the Wall, with Small-Cole, Swearing he was of the same Opinion; the
Words, as near as I can Remember, was to this Effect.</p>
            <q>
               <l>This is a Place of no Disgrace,</l>
               <l>Tho' Fools do Censure so;</l>
               <l>But I do you tell, and mark it well,</l>
               <l>You must Pay before you go.</l>
               <l>And yet by G—d, tis very Odd,</l>
               <l>To be Confined here;</l>
               <l>And were it not for Pipe and Pot,</l>
               <l>Z—ds, 'twould be too severe.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>I thereupon ask'd my Guide what he was, that seem'd to be so contented with
his Confinement, but the Fellow over-hearing me, made answer,</hi> That he was a Man
of Carriage. And Confin'd here for the Vprightness of it, I suppose, <hi>said my Friend.</hi> That
you may Censure as you please, Sir, <hi>said he,</hi> but I am Contented with my Condition:
<hi>Why Faith, said I, Patience per-force, is a Medicine for a Mad-dog; but down
he went, singing</hi> Providence provides for me, and I am well Content.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And we ascended the Leads; where we found several jolly Lads, some diverting
themselves at Nine-pins, others Viewing the Adjacent Villages, and walking in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
to</hi> Highgate, <hi>Swearing tho' the Body was confin'd, thoughts were free;
But at the further-end next the</hi> Thames, <hi>was on Old</hi> Vertuoso <hi>with two or three more
of the same Kidney, puzzling his Numb-Skull (for Brains, he had none) on the Ebb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Tide, telling them divers Opinions, but could give no Substantial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for what he alledg'd, but concluded that without doubt the Moon had an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Prethee old Duke, follow <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Example: What's that, <hi>said he?</hi> If you will promise
to imitate his Example, I'll tell you: That's at my own Choice, <hi>cry'd he,</hi> for I suppose
<hi>Aristotle's</hi> was a Voluntary Act, and not by Compulsion: Yes Faith was it, <hi>said he,</hi>
and thine would be a very Obliging one, and so great Vse to the Publick; and to hold
you no longer in suspence, I'll tell you how it was: <hi>Aristotle,</hi> by reason he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,

in his Pocket, and if you please to accept of it, I'll give you a retaining Fee, for your
Advice,: O Sir, I beg your Pardon, <hi>answer'd the Spark,</hi> I am no Counsellour, but give
my advice, Free and Candid, as a Friend; but withall, give me leave to assure you, 'tis
in respect to your Family, the performance of which I am certain, would Conduce much for
their Interest. For my Daughters, at least, I presume, Sir <hi>cry'd he,</hi> for whose sake, I
suppose, you give me this Advice; thinking if I had but once made my <hi>Exit,</hi> (which I
find is very indifferent to you in what manner) and you at Liberty, you would have but
little difficulty to board her. No, No, Sir <hi>said he,</hi> I would have you, look back, and
reflect on your past Transactions, and consider what brought you hither: Take an Old Mans
Counsel, Lust not after the Flesh-Pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor harbour any more thoughts of a
Petticoat: Why so Old a Sinner? <hi>reply'd he:</hi>

            <p>I have answer'd the Ends of my Creation, and you deny it your Daughter; but
I hope she'll have more Grace than to mind you; and to save Charges, you care
not if she makes two Meals a Day on Chalk and Oat-meal; and Faith, I pity her
with all my Soul: And since thou art so perverse and obstinate, may this Fate attend
you, May you Live no longer, than till every ones a weary of you, and then I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident

my heart, said he, but let us take a turn or two more, and then I'll wait on you,
which accordingly they did. But Viewing of him pretty narrowly, I thought I
was no Stranger to his Face, tho' at present I could not call him to mind, and my
Friend was of the same Opinion, and asking a Gentleman that stood by us, his
Name, his Name, Sir, said he, is <hi>M</hi>—and is confin'd here for his Faults,
not Misfortunes; and no soo ner had we ask'd the Question, but he came up to us.
Gentlemen, cry'd he, may I be so bold as to Crave your Names? Sir, said we, we
have just got the start of you, in making an enquiry of yours, and are very glad
it hath answer'd our Expectations, for we partly remembred your Physiognomy,
tho' time and absence, hath almost Bury'd our Acquaintance; then calling himself
to mind who we were, embrac'd us both, Cry'd, By my Soul, my old Friends and
Acquaintance, I am heartily glad to see you, tho' 'tis my Mis-fortune to be in
a Goal. The occasion, I suppose, said I, is the same that made Honest <hi>Harry</hi> here,
<hi>Turn Tar,</hi> and I for this three Years lead as recluse a Life as a Nun, and wholly
devoted my self to Rural Pleasures; and Faith 'twas by meer accident, we dropt
in here; but before we came in, I prognosticated we should light of some Old
Friend, and are heartily sorry it should be your Fate. Come, prithee hesitate no
more on it, the worse Luck now, the better another time, answered he; and since
'tis to Chance alone we can impute this happiness; let's enjoy our selves: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I beg the Favour of you, to honour me so far as to go to my Apartment,
whereby we may renew our Acquaintance, and divert our selves in Discoursing
on our former Intrigues; and tho' I cannot Promise you such Entertainment as
we Us'd to have, yet I believe you will not find it so despiseable as the place
may represent it to be; for we have several Gentlmen, notwithstanding their
Confinement, can dispence with a Bottle or two, and are extraordinary good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Sir, said we, Let us beg the Favour of you to Permit us to see the House,
since we have already made such a Progress, and after we shall be at your Service.
Well, old Acquaintance, I'll not dispute it with you, since you have a Mind to
see this Cave of iniquity, but Acquiesce with your desires, and wish it may answer
your Curiosity, and I'll have the Honour, to wait on you my self, say'd he.</p>
            <p>With that we tipt <hi>Towzer</hi> a Hog, and dismist him, and told our Friend we had seen
the Common-side already, and gave him our Sentiments on it. O, Cry'd he, the
the chiefest Scene is the Cellar, which I can compare to nothing but <hi>Sodom;</hi> there
we have Tragy-Comedies Acted every Night; but before I carry you there, I will
shew you our side, which is something more regular than the Wards, for we have
Chambers to our selves, but as there is no Palace without some Webs, so it cannot
be expected this should be without some inconveniences, which may well be dispenc'd
with, considering those many the Wards are subject to.</p>
            <p>Then taking us by a narrow pair of Stairs, on the Right hand, told us the first
he should present us with was call'd <hi>Puppies-Parlour,</hi> a Room that any Prisoner at any
time may have free Access to, (provided 'tis not in Use) to finish their intrigues
of Love, and is the only Room in the House for Procreation, and seldom a Night
passes but its made use of by the Publick; the Opposite Room is known by the
Name of <hi>Clap-Arse-Hall,</hi> but for what Reason I know not. Then down we went
to the next Floor, where the Chambers were pretty tollerable, bating the Sash-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
but found nothing worth our observation, but an old Hermit in a Room, that
on my Conscience I believe hath not been wash'd since the Gate hath been re-built;
what's the reason, said I to my Friend, this Old man keeps his Chamber in no better
Order? But answer was made me, He was the very Quintessence of a Sloven, and
abhors any thing that's Cleanly and so wedded in his Opinion, that he holds it a
Crime to destroy his Vermine, but will decently brush them off, to seek for fresh
Quarters. Nay, alters the very Course of Nature, and abominates humane Society;
the Night which was ordain'd for Rest he turns to Day; and the Day, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for Labour, converts he to Night; nor can you put a greater Affront on him,
than to ask him why he does not Endeavour to get out, or tell him his Chamber
wants to be Clean'd; and had rather hear of the Plague, Pestilence or Famine, than
a Mop or a Broom. But come, says my Friend, I will keep you here no longer, least we
should increase our Company. So down we went to the next Floor, where we found
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est Rooms in the House, their Chambers were clean and descent, and some had

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Furniture, which was handsome and genteel; the Men for the most part of a

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Aspect, and made an indifferent Figure, and were more Civiliz'd in their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59565:8"/>
Conversation; there we found quart Pots with Lids to them, and Dishes that bore
'em Company, which was an Evident proof, that good living was no Stranger there.</p>
            <p>And as we were going to leave that Floor, we were stopt by a Crow'd list'ning to
the Ringing of a Bell at the passage Door, which was no sooner ceas'd, but the <hi>Cryer</hi>
made Proclamation after this Manner:</p>
            <p>O Yes! O Yes! Any Man or Woman, Prisoner, or not a Prisoner, Boy or Girl, that can
give any Tale or Tydings of a Man Child about sixty Years of Age, and may be known
by these following Marks, He is too little for a Man, and too big for a Monkey, wears a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Brim'd Hat, walks like a Cropper Pidgeon, wears a Piss-burnt Wigg, and hath a very
old Fashioned Phiz, and is known by the Name of—, he hath been missing from
his Nightly Habitation ever since Yesterday five a Clock in the Afternoon; and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath the good Fortune to find him, may take him for their Pains, and shall receive
the Thanks of the whole House, provided they discharge him from the Prison.</p>
            <p>The Crowd being dispers'd, our Friend told us, there remain'd nothing now but
our Descent into <hi>Sodom,</hi> where we will take a Pot or two of the best Liquor it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords;
In the doing of which, I do not question but you will find Diversion enough.
But going down Stairs, my Friend show'd us a little Room, which had escap'd
our Notice. <hi>Here,</hi> said the, <hi>Is the old Trade of Basket-making going forward: Yes, and
Bastard making too, Sir,</hi> said the Man that was at work, for—and—was catch'd a
hussling here not long ago: <hi>That may be,</hi> answer'd he, <hi>For when Puppies Parlor is taken
up, this is made use of for the same Purpose, tho' it bath not the same Convenience, but no
Opportunity must be Lost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now being come to the Descent into <hi>Sodom,</hi> I was mightily surpriz'd, hearing the
Noise below, and beholding the steep and narrow Entrance to it: Bless me! Cry'd I
to my Friend, this Descent seems to Contradict the Holy Scripture, which affirms,
that the way to Destruction is Easy, and broad is the Path thereof; but here the
Descent is narrow, and almost <hi>Perpendicular, Omne in praecipiti Vitium Stetit</hi>—an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
our Confin'd Friend, but here we are in a <hi>Medium.</hi> Well, down the <hi>Precipice</hi>
we went, which put me in Mind of <hi>Quevedo</hi>'s Descent into Hell.</p>
            <p>But as soon as we were down, our Hostess Conducted us into the Bar, asking us,
What we would be pleas'd to Drink? The best you have, said we. The motion I
found pleas'd her well, for dropping a formal Curt'siye, and Screw'd her Chops into
a forc'd Smile, said indeed 'twas very good, she was sure. Z—ds, said our Friend,
that's always your Apology by G—d; set down the Liquor, and your Absence,
I beseech you, sweet Lady; and give us leave to Praise it that are to Drink it; with
that she left us, shaking her Head; saying, You are a sad Man: But asking him why
he us'd his Landlady thus? S'BI—d, what I do is in my own Defence, reply'd he;
and if I had not begun with her first, she would have had the Impudence to have
Dun'd me before your Faces.</p>
            <p>Now being settled, and the Cellar full of Company, we began to make a Scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
into their several Stations, and Observe their Motions; and the first that was
worth our Observation, was an old Weather-beaten Fellow in a Gown that hung by
Geometry, and a Face as Fiery as the Sun; who being Elevated with the Spirit of Malt,
in a most Lamentable Tone, Belch'd forth this Song in Praise of King <hi>Lud,</hi> Cruelty
of the Creditors, and Miserable Condition of the Prisoners, who gave great Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and was as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Noble King <hi>Lud,</hi> long time hast thou stood,</l>
               <l>Not fram'd of Wood, but of Stone,</l>
               <l>And since sure thou art like a Creditors Heart,</l>
               <l>That Cares not a Figg for our Moan.</l>
               <l>While we in this Gate, do Beg thro' a Grate,</l>
               <l>Lamenting our State in this City;</l>
               <l>Yet our Yawling, and Bawling, and Calling,</l>
               <l>Moves not a Creditors Heart unto Pity.</l>
               <l>In a poor thread bear Coat, we tear our Throat,</l>
               <l>With a Pitiful Moan for Relief;</l>
               <l>Good Sir, we Cry, the Box hanging by,</l>
               <l>Here's a hundred and more full of Grief.</l>
               <l>But Gallants they Ride on, and never think upon</l>
               <l>The Sorrowful Moan that we make;</l>
               <l>But with Rumbling, and Iumbling their Coaches,</l>
               <l>The Stones in the Street, they do shake.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59565:8"/>
Others pass by, and hearing our Cry,</l>
               <l>Will cast up an Eye of Disdain;</l>
               <l>Saying that if we were once but set free,</l>
               <l>We soon would come hither again.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And no sooner had he ended his Song, but one of the Company wrapt out an Oath,
that 'twas matter of Fact, and Caution'd him to take Warning, having now the
Liberty of the Hatch: Why, reply'd he, Thou little Illiterate Coxcomb, and Spawn
of a Knight of the Post, who the Devil made you a Solicitor, that could not keep your
self out of Goal? And have the Impudence to pretend to teach me! I that have born
all Offices of the House, and am the Senior of my Ward! Nay, from the Stocks
have been Exalted on Mens shoulders to my lofty Apartment! I that have out Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>W—t</hi> the Officer, and put the day of the Month on his Moveables! To be
Taught by such a little Narrow Soul'd Fellow as thou! No, be it known unto you,
I Scorn to take your Counsel, or mind your Musty Morals; and taking his Glass of Ale,
Here said he, thou Superanuated Block-head, here is defiance to them all, and thou
that stiles thy self a Solicitor, and hast not the Sense of a Bum-Bayliff: <hi>Why so much
at a time, Mr.</hi>—said a stander by to him. Look there now, reply'd he, there's an
Animal, when he first came hither, look'd like one of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Lean Kine, but now
thanks to my Lord-Mayors Basket, is as Fat as a Whipping-Post, and sets up for an
Assistant; you shall be an Assistant, with a Pox to ye! If I was, answer'd he, I'd tame
your Tongue. That's more than you can your Wifes: or Tail either, answer'd he,
thou dull insip'd Rascal: Sirrah, I'l have thee Hang'd out at the Gate to bring a Trade
to the House, thou sordid Mercenary Blockhead, that for three Halfpence, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
thy own Father, and Pimp for thy own Wife: At last the Fellow being in a
Passion, told him When he first came, he had not a Rag to his Arse: That's a Lye,
said he, and I'll prove it, for 'tis well known, I had nothing else; but however, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
to convince you, I bear no Malice, or am in the least Angry, I here Create
thee Sole Heir and Executor to the Gown on my Back, and all that it harbours.
He than sat down, charg'd his Gun, and gave the Word for the other Pot.</p>
            <p>No sooner was this Fray over, but another fell a Rating at his Hostess, telling her
she had not fill'd the Pot, and yet thought much of Scoring, and behang'd to her:
with that said her Husband, Fill it Wife, fill it, I desire no otherwise, for what I get
is only by Strangers, but for Scoring I will no more, nor is it reasonable: But his
Wife being vext, at her second Journey for one Pot, pull'd him away, by the Sleeve,
crying, Come Husband, come: But harkye, said one, Do you say, you get nothing but
by Strangers? What the Devil do you mean? Do you think I was born Yesterday? You
must tell them so, that knows no better; what's your Hot-Pots, your Stout, Brandy,
Nick'd Measure, Tobacco, and double Scoring? Doth this consist with Reason, when
you can afford to take a Guniea for thirty five Shillings? Is not all this Evident proof?
<hi>S'B—d</hi> I can prove you have got four Shillings, and a Meal for you and your Husband,
by an Apple-Pye that stood you but in two; and yet all this is nothing: At which they
could make no reply, but he slunk away, Lolling out his Tongue, and she look'd as
the Devil over <hi>Lincoln;</hi> and 'tis thought by the Learned, that her Countenance did
the Dairy-Woman on the other side the Gate, ten Shillings worth of Dammage.</p>
            <p>Well, Gentlemen, say'd our Friend, How do you like your Diversion? Why as
well as a Play, answered we, and protest 'tis as Comical: But look there is two a
Fighting, and <hi>Sodom</hi> is in an Uproar, and Fair Play is the Word: Yes Faith, said
he, but seldom made use of, but the occasion of this Quarrel, which you see is
already over, happened, as I am inform'd, last Night, and is thus:</p>
            <p>He with the Bloody-Nose, made an Agreement with her in the red Top-knot, by
the Fire-side, to meet last Night at Twelve a Clock on the Stair-case by <hi>Puppies-Parlour,</hi>
to take a Game of <hi>Ar—e</hi> together; which Bloody-Nose over-heard, went at the
Hour appointed, and found her alone (for her Lover with whom she had made the
agreement over-slept himself) and being pretty Dark, he makes use of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and goes to her; she thinking it had been him which she expected, without
any reluctancy yielded to his Embraces, and no Question but they made good Use
of their time; but having enjoy'd, her he discovers himself to her, telling her he was
mightily oblig'd to her for her Civility, but more to the Obscurity of the Night;
also that stollen Love was sweet, and Silence very commendable. At which she was

               </gap> But he continued there, expecting his Rival; and 'twas not long before
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59565:9"/>
he came, crying as softly as possible he could, My Dear, my Dear! Upon which he made
a little Noise to signifie he was there; for answer he could not, least he should be
betray'd by his Voice; which he hearing, did not doubt but 'twas she, and cry'd aloud
I was afraid I had out-stay'd my time, but I'll make thee amends: That's more than
you can do, by G—d, answered he aloud, for I have waited here this hour at least,
to tell you your Mistress was so impatient that I was forc'd to supply your place, for
which I do expect a reward. Yes, I'll give you Satisfaction, and be damn'd to you,
answer'd he, and falls aboard on him like a Fury; and had he not had timely Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
his sweet Meat would have had but sower Sauce; but being heard, they were soon
parted, and sent to their several Beds; but to day the disappointed Lover hearing
his Rival had divulg'd last Nights intrigues, bent his thoughts on nothing but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
(for Jealousie is a Green-Ey'd Monster) and gives him a Challenge into the
White-Room; but he having obtain'd his desires, thought it not worth his while
to hazard a Battle, for what he had already enjoy'd, and so declin'd it, and laugh'd at
him. But the Intrigue and Scuffle being blaz'd over all the House, and his Mistress
also ridicul'd, he was resolved to fall aboard him the first opportunity, and was
well satisfied the Error she had committed was through Ignorance: He hearing
he was in the Cellar, could no longer Bridle his Passion, but comes down in a Rage,
and falls on him, and has given him a Bloody Nose, and he in return for his Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
hath presented him with a Black-Eye, which I suppose will end the difference;
and a Pot or two will make 'em as good Friends as ever.</p>
            <p>Prethee, said I, what is she? Why Faith, no Angel. That I presume, cry'd I, unless
it be a dark one; but be she what she will, she carrys it off with Courage; Yes Faith,
answer'd my Friend, she has Stock enough for a Corner-Shop, and is one of the first
rank in <hi>Sodom;</hi> her Name is <hi>Lay-Cock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Prethee observe these two at the Upper-end of the Table, the one is a self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
Coxcomb, and looks like a Devil out-Law'd; a Quill-driver by Vocation, and
by his plausible Discourse thinks he merits every ones Attention, by which he exposes
his Weakness, and becomes a Jest to the whole House: The other is a poor ignorant
Fellow, that's Confin'd here by his Wife, by reason he could not perform Family
Duty, and goes by the Name of <hi>Semper Idem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No sooner had he done Speaking, but the Word was given for Strangers below
to depart the House; Strangers above depart, the House; and the Table was put in
Order for the Nocturnal Club: Upon which, we discharg'd our shot, and told our
Confin'd Friend, we would in a short time renew our Visit; and since time will not
permit us now, we will refer Discoursing on our own Affairs till the next oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
'Tis a general Maxim, said he, <hi>Out of Sight, out of Mind;</hi> and Prison Promises
are no more to be Regarded, then Madmens Oaths; not that I think you will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
from your word in the least, but only give you the Vulgar Opinion; for I
hope the Conversation and Friendship that have formerly past between us, will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige
you to perform: It is upon honour, answer'd we, and that shall be in a day
or two at farthest; and if it lies in our Power to serve you, by that Sacred Tye of
Friendship that has past between us, and shall still continue, you may Command us.
No my dear Friends, answer'd he, you can lay no greater Obligation on me, than
what you have already Contracted in the continuance of our Friendship, and the
promise of another Visit; then we will take a Bottle or two of our old Liquor, and
Injoy our selves, as formerly: Compare Notes, and see how the <hi>Park, Temple, Grays
Inn,</hi> and <hi>Play-house</hi>-Ladies stand affected; what new <hi>Comets</hi> and <hi>Blazing-stars,</hi> have
appear'd. Why I find thou art the same in Confinement, as when at Liberty, cry'd I;
Why, not said he? There will be a day of Redemption, and I hope mine draws near.
But as <hi>Othello</hi> says, <hi>Who can controul his Fate!</hi> Then having a second Summons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
we quitted the Bar, and dispers'd some loose Corns to the Prisoners to drink
our Healths, and likewise one to the Reverend Doctor; took leave of our Friend,
and departed well satisfied with the Sight and Intrigues of <hi>Ludgate,</hi> which I shall
conclude with a saying of <hi>Hamlet</hi> Prince of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
