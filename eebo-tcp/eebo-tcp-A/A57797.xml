            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SINCE man became a Traytor to his Creator; he has not feared to Rebell against his King, his Titular God: <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> cursed <hi>David.</hi> Good Princes do too too often meet with Railing, and Blaspheming Subjects; whereas they ought not to conspire against, or with violence resist, a wicked King, their lawful Soveraign. Flattering <hi>Absalom,</hi> that unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Son, that smooth fac't Traytor, had his wise <hi>Achitophel,</hi> as the Devils Oracle, to be his companion in his Treacherous Design; And, was not that Famous Counsellor, and notable Politician, rarely well qualified for a Judge, or for a President? How cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly did the Grand Rebel <hi>Absalom,</hi> by his false pretention unto Justice unjustly steal away the hearts of his Fathers Subjects? How wisely did he apply himself unto the People? How did he catch them with a Bait most proper, suitable and convenient? thus sighting out an Interjection of dissembling affection (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept unto Ambition) <hi>Oh that I were made Iudge in the Land! that every Man, which hath any Snit, or Cause, might come unto me, and I will do him Iustice:</hi> complaining of the present Government, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That there was no man deputed of the King to hear mens Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies;</hi> addressing himself with most familiar language unto the People; and expressing towards them much Condescension, great Affability, and extraordinary Courtesies. VVhen any man that had a Controversie, came unto the <hi>King</hi> for Judgement then, <hi>Absalom</hi> called unto him, and said, <hi>Of what City art thou?</hi> And when any man came nigh unto him to do him obeysance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him: he also who

had so wel studied the humour of the People, was not Ignorant concerning their Princes inclination; and therefore endeavours to frame and fashion himself unto the devout minde of his good old Father; abusing his Innocency, and Credulity with a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

It was therefore no wonder that we read of 200 men, who being called, went with <hi>Absalom</hi> in their sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and they knew not any thing. May we, because of so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a profession, joyned with such a practice, wisely conclude that <hi>Abs<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Many more Testimonies, in the Holy Bible, may be ppoduced of Faction, Treachery, Treason and Rebellion: Historyes both Sacred and Prophane, afford us many Relations of this Nature; wherein has been recorded not onely the perversness, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of Infidels, but also of Christians, yea of good and believing Christians (of all Ranks and degrees) unto Lawful Authority; And this indeed is the drift I aim at, that it may not seem won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful unto us, to see men otherwise very Good, Religious, and Conscientious engaged in Faction, and infected with Schism; the one pernitious to Civil Societies, the other to Ecclesiastical; and indeed, what the one is to the State, the other is to the Church: Among these very <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmed to be Saints, santified in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> to have received the Grace of God, to have been enriched by God in all knowledge, to have been called unto the fellowship of Jesus Christ our Lord, among
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101104:3"/>
those (I say) were found Schisms, Strifes, Envyings, Divisions, and Factions: while one boasted to be of <hi>Paul,</hi> another of <hi>Apollo,</hi> another of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and another of <hi>Christ</hi> as if Christ had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: And although I do not peremptorily charge that great Apostle St. <hi>Peter</hi> as a Schismatick, yet may I as a Temporizer, one who through fear, and cowardize, did separate himself for a time from Communion with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> because of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Iews;</hi> twice through fear did St. Peter offend; with him at this time did <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and divers <hi>Iews</hi> also dissemble, so as to withdraw from converse with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> upon which they were justly taxed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>not walking uprightly according to the Truth of the Gospel:</hi> And did not their Separation upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count almost amount unto a Schism? And now I wil not wonder at the Temporizing, or Time-serving; yea, or at the Schism of a Presbyterian Moderator: Little reason has he to wrangle at that Translation, <hi>Be fervent in Spirit, applying your selves unto the Time;</hi> I onely affirm, that Good and religious men have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been Rebels, and Schismaticks, through the darkness and ignorance of their Understanding; and through the obstinacy and perverseness of their own Wils. This Consideration cals for deep Humiliation, and serious Repentance from those amongst us, who have made great profession of Religion; and, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Command of Christ, requiring subjection to Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Authority, have Rebelled against their Soveraign; and being too too forgetful of our Churches Peace, Happiness, &amp; Welfare, have separated, rent, and divided themselves from her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and have bereaved her of many of her dear Children by their most uncharitable practises; these are they, who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their private Opinions, wild Fancies, and strange Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasms, before the Sound, Orthodox, and Established Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I profess Ingenously, That I have much Charity for many who have been accounted Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists, and Quakers; and therefore I hartily desire them to beware of Spiritual pride: Consider seriously, how great a blow, how great a fall, Religion has received by your Pride, Hypocrisie, &amp; Ambition: Remember how sad a woe <hi>Christ</hi> hath pronounced against those, through whom offences come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101104:4"/>Consider, That you of all Parties, that ever were in the World, have most of all arrogated unto your selves the names of Holy, Godly, and Religious men: Let nor the Truth and Wayes of God be any longer blasphemed, or evil spoken of for your sakes; but now give glory unto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and satisfaction to the Church; return unto her Communion, and despise her not: be less Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious, and more Charitable towards others, who are sinners, <hi>Knowing that you are also in the Body: be not high-minded therefore but fear.</hi> God Almighty so defend me by his Grace as that I may not so sin, as to rejoyce that you have thus sinned; or to insult over you, that you are, or may be miserable, because you have thus sinned. In Ecclesiastical Matters (seeing Gods Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands not expresly any one certain Form of Church-Discipline, to be imposed upon the Churches of Christ,) he expects your submission unto the Episcopal Discipline as his established Form of Church Government, most agreeable to the Word of God, or at least, not repupnant unto it; and most commonly, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, practised by the most pure, Primitive and Apostolical Churches of Christ; and lastly, as most agreeable, suitable, and convenient for, and unto the Temper and Constitution of this <hi>English</hi> Nation: And for the Ceremonies, which if I may so say) are Pendent upon, and appertaining unto that Form, as they are Cirstances of it, and themselves of an indifferent and Adiaphorus nature; yet belonging to Order Decency, and Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they be wisely prudently, and justly, enjoyned by the King, whose Power is exercised about indifferent things. I will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in so freely declare my judgement, as to assert, that though I approve not of a Church gorgeously decked and trimmed with Superstitious Ceremonies; yet am I not so mad so rude, &amp; so slovenly, as, with many of our Non-conformists, to desire to honor, or embrace, a Church in this World naked of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Beauty, Splendor, Ornaments, or Comeliness whatsoever. It must be granted, that visible and external things are many times serviceable, and profitable, for the attainment of things invisible, and internal: The serious observation of the making that Transient and AErial Cross on the fore-head of the Child without any Superstition, may many times become unto us an occasion of true devotion outlasting the aforesaid Action. Our AErial Cross cannot be a Relique, and Monument of Idolatry,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101104:4"/>
because the word Monument is deduced from Remaining; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our particular transient Crosses ever worshipped by Papists; our Cross is not of the same kind with the Popish, deferring therefrom in operations; their Cross is said to drive away Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and to consecrate things unto God which things we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe not unto our Cross: Now the diversity of Opperations doth sufficiently distinguish between things Artificial, or the kinds of things Artificial, of which number is the Cross: The Cross is a sign, yet not Sacramental, but humane; and voluntary; not of our Covenant with God, but of our Profession towards Men: it doth Historically, not Sacramentally, describe unto us Christs Death: Therefore it is a Slander that we add it to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, as Sacramental, or Essential; this out of divers good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances I have chosen out, for the sense of seeing. Now for the Sense of hearing, I shall speak a little concerning <hi>Church-Musick;</hi> which (<hi>as I have read</hi>) has been partly erected, partly allowed of, by <hi>Athanasius</hi> in the <hi>East, Ambrose</hi> in the <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> in the <hi>South:</hi> As God loves a chearful Giver, <hi>so he loves a chearfull Worshipper;</hi> Musick is Requisite, that Devotion may be refreshed by delectation; there is a Natural Sympathy between Mans soul and Melody: Of what excellent use are our Bars herein for the furtherance of our Piety! As long indeed as we are in this World we shall stand in need of divers external helps for our Devotion; we shall need the Pedagogie of Forms, and Manduction of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. I shall not now descend down unto other particulars; but shall define the Reader to consider, that I only endeavour to vindicate the established, and well known <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> not any which have been introduced meerly by the bold Innovation of presumptuous Intruders.</p>
            <p>In a word, sundry Memorable and most Excellent Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, might be produced, in order to the vindication of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet causelesly many of the Non-conformists, grieved at our established Ceremonies, and did mourn because of our Liturgy; when others of them did (<hi>as causelesly</hi>) mock at them, and deride them. Oh! that these ungodly mockers would at length arise up out of the seat of the Scornful, <hi>and meekly sit down in the School of Repentance.</hi> These men who were so curious, nice, and narrow-throated, that they could not swallow down the Commands of their lawful Superiours; when time was, did both
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101104:5"/>
Feast and Fast, and take Oathes too, as fast as Usurpers did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and indeed then, what did they leave undone, when commanded by that unlawful power? yet then they pretended unto as good Consciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as great Sanctimony, as evey men could lay claim unto. But their Hypocrisie being so amply dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, in a notable and ingenious Discourse, in Folio, (Intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>A Proposal humbly offered, for the farming of Liberty of Conscience</hi>) It will not be here Requisite to declare their Game any further; I rather desire their Conversion <hi>and that every Soul would be subject to the Higher Powers;</hi> for we ought not onely to pay Tribute to our King, (<hi>as our King</hi>) but we are also all of us, in our several Stations, places, and capacities; bound by the Law of God, of Nature, and of Nations, to the uttermost of our powers, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and protect his Royall Person, and to maintain his Dignity, and Supremacy, against all opposers whatsoever. And very careful ought all his Majesties Subjects to be, to endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to keep the peace of the Kingdom, and the Unity of the Church.</p>
            <p>Thus of old, writ <hi>Dyonisius,</hi> (the good Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi>) to <hi>Novatus,</hi> an Enemy to the <hi>Truth;</hi> Thou should'st have suffered any thing, Rather then to Rend asunder the Church of God. So sayes a late friend to the Non-conformists; Cast off that Babe (meaning the Covenant) whose production, wrought such a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and hardned obstinacy, against the famous <hi>Liturgy</hi> of our <hi>English Church</hi> that it made them not only to dispense with their Covenant with God, but also to break Covenant with their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraign; earnestly desiring them to come in, and embrace the Discipline of their <hi>Mother Church;</hi> and no longer to remain amongst such, whose Doctrines and Principles were chiefly grounded upon <hi>Pernicious Errors.</hi>
