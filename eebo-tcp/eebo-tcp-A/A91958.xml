         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honorable the Commons in Parliament aſſembled; <hi>The humble Petition and Remonstrance of</hi> Edmond Rolph, <hi>Priſoner in the</hi> Gatehouſe, WESTMINSTER:</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat in Judgment and Conſcience he hath adventured his life for the Preſervation of the Honor and juſt Power of Parliaments, with the Freedoms, Liberties and Properties of the Free-born People of this Nation.</p>
            <p>That as heretofore, ſo at preſent, all the endeavors of wicked and malicious men, are bent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to wound and deſtroy both the Parliaments Honor, and the Peoples Liberties, by ſubtle deſignments and ſcandalous aſperſions, thereby to render both the Parliament, Army, and all godly people adhering to them, odious in the eyes of the Nation.</p>
            <p>That in order to the end aforeſaid, one <hi>Osbourn</hi> and <hi>Dowcet</hi> hath lately made a falſe and ſcandalous ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, bruting it abroad that there was a deſign to poyſon the King; and becauſe it was neceſſary that they ſhould father the deſign upon ſome body, they have layd it upon the whole Army in general, and upon your Petitioner in particular; uſing all means, by colour of the ſaid ſuggeſtion, to exaſperate the People to reſiſt the Authority of Parliament, and to weaken their power by the deſtruction of that Army, which by the bleſſing of God hath been your protection to this day, maugre the malice of your adverſaries.</p>
            <p>That by means of the ſaid Suggeſtion, your Petitioner hath been by a party of the Lords impriſoned and ſentenced contrary to Law, without hearing, yea without legal Crime or legal Accuſer; having not only his life end angered by his cruel uſage, in the time of his bodily diſtemper, but alſo his name and credit deſtroyed by having that ſcandalous imputation of a Traytor caſt upon him.</p>
            <p>That this Houſe hath declared it to be a heinous Crime, againſt the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> againſt the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> that innocent men ſhould be charged with ſo high an Offence as Treaſon in the face of the higheſt Judicatory of the Kingdom, without <hi>Witneſs,</hi> without <hi>Evidence,</hi> without all poſſibility of legal <hi>Repairation:</hi> 1 <hi>part Book Decl. pag.</hi> 201.</p>
            <p>That by the Law of the Kingdom no perſon <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>impriſoned, indicted, arraigned,</hi> or <hi>condemned</hi> for any Treaſon or Treaſons, without the teſtimony of two Lawful Accuſers, as appears by the Statute of 5 &amp; 6 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Chap. 11. as was largely proved at the open Bar at the Aſſize and general Goal-delivery held at <hi>Winchester</hi> for the County of <hi>Southampton,</hi> by Mr <hi>Maynard</hi> Counſellor at Law, and a Member of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Houſe.</p>
            <p>That contrary to this and many other good Laws, providing againſt this evil, your Petitioner hath not only been detained in priſon without any legal Warrant, but hath alſo been indicted contrary to Law, (the ſaid Indictment being drawn up here by the Kings Councel, and by the ſaid Lords tranſmitted to be found at <hi>Winchester</hi> by the Grand-Jury,) and yet your Petitioner kept Priſoner in the <hi>Gatehouſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in order thereunto, <hi>Osbourn</hi> and <hi>Dowcet</hi> were by the Lords ſent to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> to give Evidence to the Grand-Jury upon the ſaid Indictment; which they accordingly did on the 28 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1648.</p>
            <p>That notwithſtanding the ſaid Indictment did conſiſt of four ſeveral heads of Treaſon, wherein the whole Army as well as Your Petitioner was accuſed, yet the ſaid <hi>Osbourn</hi> and <hi>Dowcet</hi> gave nothing material in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whereon an Indictment could be grounded; ſo that upon the examination of the whole matter, the Grand Jury returned an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon the ſaid Bill of Indictment, as by a Certificate from the Clerk of the Aſſize more plainly appeareth.</p>
            <p>That Your Petitioner, notwithſtanding he is clear in the eye of the Law, and in the conſciences of all honeſt men, yet he is ſtill a Priſoner to the will of the Lords, and left without a poſſibility of legal repairation, both for his illegal impriſonment, beſides his great charges and damages in his eſtate and credit ſuſtained, being left without all poſſibility of vindication or reparation, unleſs this Honorable Houſe be pleaſed (as in like caſes heretofore) to take him into conſideration, and as a manifeſtation of their juſt ſenſe, of their own, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies honor, and Your Petitioners unparaleld ſufferings, find ſome expedient both for the enlargement, vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and repairation of Your Petitioner; The Judges being both corrupt, and ſo neerly concerned; the Lords ſo powerful; and <hi>Osbourn</hi> and <hi>Dowcet</hi> ſo beggarly; that it is impoſsible Your Petitioner ſhould ever be repaired in his eſtate or credit, without Your Juſtice be exerciſed in the obtaining thereof.</p>
            <p>The Premiſſes conſidered, may it pleaſe Your Honors, (ſeeing that both Your own, and the Armies Honor hath been blemiſhed by the ſaid ſcandalous information,) That therefore ſome publication may be made by the Authority and Approbation of this Houſe, of the proceedings in relation to this buſineſs, to the end that Your, and the Armies Honor may be vindicated, and Your Petitioners name and credit ſo far as may be repaired; and that ſome legal way may be taken for the freedom and repairation of Your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, who is greatly impoveriſhed by the ſaid Impriſonment, it having coſt him nigh 120 l. of his eſtate ſince the time of his reſtraint, beſides the great damage received in his name and credit, which is altogether unrepairable.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as the Judges are appointed to ſit with the Lords as their Aſſiſtants in point of Law, and ought to inform them by what rule they are to proceed, being ſworn thereunto, and yet have, contrary to Law and their Oaths, connived at the apparent ſubverſion of the fundamental Laws of this Nation, by ſuffering ſuch illegal Warrants to paſs from time to time from the Lords upon ſuch illegal Accuſations; That therefore this Houſe would be pleaſed to call the ſaid Judges to an Account for theſe their undue proceedings; and out of their eſtates (who ought to have prevented Your Petitioners ſufferings &amp; damages) to allow him ſuch legal repairations as to Your Honors ſhall ſeem meet and couvenient.</p>
            <closer>And he ſhall pray, &amp;c.</closer>
