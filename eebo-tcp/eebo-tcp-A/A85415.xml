            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

When a Commoditie is ingroſſed, and brought into few mens hands, it is ſo much the more like to ſuffer, to be adulterated, and imbaſed. It was never well with Chriſtian Religion, ſince the Miniſters of the Goſpell, (ſo called by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo reputed by the generality of men, for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſidering better) cunningly veſted that priviledge of the Church, of being <hi>the ground and pillar of Truth,</hi> in themſelves; clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> prerogative amongſt men, over the Truths of God; <hi>whom he would, he ſlew, and whom he would, he kept alive: and whom he would, he ſet up, and whom he would, he put down</hi>

            <p>There came lately out of the Preſſe a few papers, ſtiling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a <hi>teſtimonie to the truth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and pretending to a ſubſcription, <hi>by the Miniſters of Chriſt within the Province of London.</hi> I wiſh, for theſe Miniſters ſake, to whom (I appeale to him, who ſearcheth my heart and reines) I wiſh nothing but good, and for the truths ſake alſo, that I could conceive the impudence or boldneſſe of any man, ſo great, as to preſent them in print unto the world for the Authors, or Subſcribers of ſuch a piece of weakeneſſe (to forbeare words of more provocation, though of truth) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their knowledge, or conſent. I ſhould be enabled by ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, both to maintain in my ſelfe (at leaſt for a time) thoſe honourable thoughts of their perſons, which (my witneſſe is on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114760:3"/>
high) I have alwayes unfeignedly laboured to doe, though ſtill op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by themſelves, in my way; as alſo to comfort my ſelfe over that Religion, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they, &amp; I, Joyntly profeſſe, that it ſhould not ſuffer upon any ſuch terms of diſadvantage &amp; diſhonour, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> thoſe papers, if ever owned by the perſons, whoſe names are ſubſcribed to them, are like to expoſe it unto. The image and ſuperſcription ſtamp'd upon the piece, and the men, (eſpecially ſome of them) whoſe Names are affixed, if not enforced, to it, are ſo unlike and contradictious the one unto the other, that being not able to found an act of judgement or conjecture, who ſhould be the Author, or Authors of it, upon both joyntly, I am in ſome ſtreight, on which hand to leane; whether to judge &amp; conclude any of thoſe learned and pious men, whoſe Names are ſubſcribed, or thoſe weake and unworthy ones, whoſe image and ſuperſcription the piece beareth, for the Authors of it.</p>
            <p>But that neither D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>1. The very title it ſelfe, and that in the firſt and principall part of it, contradicts the tenour of the Booke, and that in more places than one. The title pretendeth thus (in the firſt words of it) <hi>A te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie to the Truth of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whereas the Booke it ſelfe, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>truth of Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> by numbring the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truths of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> amongſt <hi>infamous and pernicious errours.</hi> Witneſſe 1. page 5. where this aſſertion, that <hi>no writing whatſoever, whether Tranſlations, or Originalls, are the foundation of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> is made an infamous and pernicious errour. For is not this a cleer Truth of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and aſſerted (in part) <hi>in terminis,</hi> (but with fulneſſe of evidence otherwiſe) by the great Apoſtle, where he ſaith, <hi>that other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Ieſus Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 11.</note>? Except <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> be tranſubſtantiated into inke and paper, no kind of bookes or writings whatſoever, neither <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> nor <hi>Originals,</hi> can be (in the Apoſtles ſence) any <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of Chriſtian Religion. Againe, is it not a precious Truth of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that no act of man whatſoever is any <hi>foundation of</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:114760:3"/>
               <hi>Chriſtian Religon,</hi> the Apoſtle affirming (as we heard) that <hi>other foundation can no man lay, but Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and yet the denyall of the act of man <hi>to be a foundation of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> (as viz. <hi>the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Engliſh Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>to be the Word of God</hi>) is by the ſaid book (pag. 5.) rank'd amongſt <hi>infamous and pernicious Errours?</hi> The Scriptures indeed or the word of God, are (in a regular ſence) the foundation of Chriſtian Religion: but to believe them to bee this foundation, cannot be the foundation it ſelfe, but only a ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or building upon it. So that it is only the deniall of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure to be the foundation, which is charged by this learned <hi>Province of Subſcribers</hi> to be an <hi>infamous and pernicious Errour</hi> againſt the <hi>Divine Authority of Scriptures.</hi> More inſtances of this kind, by the light whereof the palpable interfeerings between the Title, and the Booke it ſelfe, may be cleerly ſeen, we ſhall have occaſion anon to obſerve. And is it not a very hard piece of beliefe, to thinke that learned and pious men, ſhould ſo far forget themſelves in the body of their Book, as to break the Head and title of it?</p>
            <p>2. In the latter part of the ſaid title, in theſe words, <hi>and to our ſolemne League and Covenant,</hi> there is too little good ſence to anſwer the worth and parts of the men mentioned. For what can reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be meant, by a <hi>teſtimony to our Solemne League and Covenant?</hi> Do they meane, that in the Booke it ſelfe, they give the ſame <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to their <hi>Solemne League and Covenant,</hi> which they doe to the <hi>Truth of Ieſus Chriſt?</hi> Though the truth is, that it is a very poor and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>teſtimony given to the Truth of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> to make <hi>infamous &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioious errors</hi> of what opinions, aſſertions, &amp; Truths, they pleaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of conviction. To cry out: It is not meet that ſuch, or ſuch opinions ſhould live, or be tolerated (as if life and tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were an heritage appropriate, and belonging of right to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions only, how inconſiſtent ſoever either with reaſon, or with Truth) is little better teſtimony <hi>to the Truth of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> than that deportment of the Jewes was unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> when <hi>they cryed out with a loud voyce, ſtopping their eares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ran upon</hi> Stephen <hi>with one accord, to caſt him out of the Citie, and ſtone him,</hi> Acts 7. 57. But I truſt their meaning is not, that they intend by their Booke, as ſolemn and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a <hi>teſtimonie</hi> to their <hi>League and Covenant</hi> as they doe to <hi>the Truth of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> 1. To aſſert the worth &amp; excellency of it with as high an hand, with as much zeale, vigour, and vehemency of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114760:4"/>
ſpirit, as they intend to the Great <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> though they make no difference (in words) between the one, and the other. For otherwiſe, the <hi>ſolemne Covenant</hi> they ſpeake of, being onely matter of engagement, not of aſſertion or opinion, I know not what <hi>teſtimony</hi> it is capable of: unleſſe they will call a regular, full, and through obſervation of it, a <hi>teſtimony</hi> unto it: which is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (if teſtimony it be) unpoſſible to be rendered unto it in this, or in any other booke, or writing whatſoever; the beſt part of this teſtimony conſiſting <hi>in</hi> going <hi>before one another in a reall, not verball, reformation.</hi> But what it is they meane, or would have others to conceive they ſhould meane, by calling their piece, <hi>a teſtimony unto our Solemne League and Covenant, I ſolemnly</hi> and ſeriouſly profeſſe is above the reach of my underſtanding, or learning, reaſonably to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine. Have I not then reaſon to doubt, whether any of thoſe men of renowne, and not rather ſome petty Scribe, was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler of it?</p>
            <p>3. Whereas to amplifie and enrich their Title, they adde (over and above the former expreſſions, of <hi>a Teſtimony to the truth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and, <hi>And to our Solemne League and Covenant</hi>) theſe words: <hi>As alſo againſt the Errours, Hereſies, and Blaſphemies of theſe times, &amp; the Toleration of them;</hi> I ſubmiſſively demand of them, whether there be any thing more, any further matter of conſequence held forth in theſe words, above what was contained in thoſe firſt words, <hi>A teſtimony to the Truth of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If ſo, I deſire to know where, or in what part of the booke, they give <hi>teſtimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Truth of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> and again; where, and in what other part of it, they <hi>give</hi> teſtimony againſt <hi>Errours and Hereſies?</hi> I can finde no other <hi>Teſtimony</hi> given in it to the <hi>Truth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but onely that (which I confeſſe is very unproperly ſo called) which ſtands in a citation of certaine paſſages, or ſayings out of other mens writings, imperiouſly ſentenced for Errours and Hereſies; as if the Chaire of Papall infallibility were of late tranſlated from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Sion-Colledge.</hi> If not, they ſhall doe honeſtly and well in the next Impreſſion of the booke, (though it had been more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty to have done it in the firſt) to leave out of their Title, the falſe flouriſh, of, <hi>A teſtimony to the Truth of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as alſo thoſe words, <hi>And to our ſolemne League and Covenant</hi> (there being no ſuch thing in all the booke, as any teſtimony thereunto) and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114760:4"/>
content themſelves onely with calling it, <hi>A Teſtimony againſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Hereſies,</hi> onely mollifying it with this ſoft and Chriſtian explication [<hi>as we count and call Errors and Hereſies.</hi>] For certainly there are in theſe papers, that are ſo called, <hi>Errors</hi> many, and <hi>Hereſies</hi> many; which yet have nothing of the nature, but onely the names of both. So then theſe words in the Title, <hi>As alſo againſt errors,</hi> &amp;c. being ſo meerly and broadly tautologicall and empty, are a ground of conjecture unto me, that the men prenamed with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeres, are wholly innocent from the offence committed in making the book.</p>
            <p>4. Whereas the Title is yet further extended by the addition of theſe words, <hi>And the Toleration of them;</hi> which is a meere non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, a thing not in being, I cannot conceive that the judgements or parts of the ſaid perſons ſhould ſo farre <hi>faile them,</hi> as to appeare in print, and that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with a <hi>teſtimony</hi> in their pens againſt that, of which God made the world; I mean, nothing, or that which is not; I might further adde, nor is ever like to be. For if a captious pen had the expreſſion in hand, it would finde no difficulty at all in carrying it into ſuch a ſenſe, which would import a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating inſinuation againſt the Parliament, as if they were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to grant an univerſall <hi>Toleration</hi> of all <hi>Errors, Hereſies, and Blaſphemies;</hi> that unleſſe they were counterbalanced with the feare of diſpleaſing theſe mens zeale, burning ſo vehemently in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereunto, there were no other means under heaven to take them off from it; yea it may not without ſome ground of probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be conceived; that the Authours of theſe papers proclaime ſo loud their enmity againſt Toleration, to make the friendſhip of all lukewarme and formall profeſſors round about them (being the great bulk of the Kingdome) who know not what to doe, what ſhift to make for a Religion, if the State be not mercifull unto them in providing one or other for them. But as farre as yet I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or doe for the preſent apprehend the Genius or temper of the Parliament, in reference to an univerſall Toleration, I have reaſon to judge them by many degrees further from it, than to ſtand in need of the importune heat of theſe men, to quench their inclinations to it.</p>
            <p>5. The Book it ſelfe being every whit as capable of bearing the Title of, <hi>A teſtimony againſt Truth,</hi> ſound and orthodox opinions,

as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>againſt Errors and Hereſies,</hi> (as hath already, in part, and will more fully appeare hereafter) it is a peece of Incredibility to me, that men of that note and intereſt, of which the perſons named, with ſeverall others of the ſame line, are known to be, ſhould ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanicate with their reſpective reputations, as to prefix a ſingle-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured title before a parti-coloured book.</p>
            <p>6. Whereas <hi>all the Errors</hi> muſtered together in the book, are ſaid (in the title page) <hi>to be collected out of their Authours own books al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the margine,</hi> and yet (in faire and full contradiction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) are ſaid page 2. <hi>to be the very dregges and ſpawn of thoſe old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Hereſies, which have been already condemned, dead, buried, and rotten in their graves long agoe, and are now by evill men and ſeducers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out and revived</hi> (by which this preſent generation however is fairly acquitted from being the authours of them, Revivers being no Authours) I cannot ſo farre undervalue the worth of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons named, as to judge them conſcious of ſo groſſe an overſight, or (conſequently) intereſſed in the compoſure of the piece.</p>
            <p>7. Whereas the ſubſcribers of the book, ſtile themſelves (in the title page) not partitively, ſome of <hi>the Miniſters,</hi> but collectively, <hi>The Miniſters of Chriſt within the Province of London,</hi> there being to my knowledge, ſeveral <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt within the Province of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and thoſe not of the abhorred order of Independency neither, &amp; yet commenſurable too, both for parts &amp; worth, with the talleſt of the ſubſcribers, though not equall (it may be) to ſome of them in Church livings by two or three, for whom <hi>God</hi> (it ſeemeth) <hi>hath provided a better thing</hi> than to ſuffer them to fall into the ſnare of ſo unworthy a <hi>Subſcription,</hi> I muſt diſpenſe very farre with my thoughts concerning the goodneſſe of the conſciences of the men I have named, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> their fellows, to judge them ſo much as acquainted with the firſt page of the book. I cannot ſo farre ſuſpect their skill in Grammar, as to ſuppoſe them ignorant of the difference between ſome of <hi>the Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> and, <hi>the Miniſters of Chriſt</hi> (ſimply,) nor would I willingly ſuſpect the goodneſſe of their conſciences ſo farre, as to to think they would wittingly, and only to ferve a turn, as <hi>viz.</hi> to make the concurrence ſeeme the greater and more entire in the eyes of their ſimple ones, write the one, when as the truth would onely beare the other.</p>
            <p>8 Whereas they intitle their book, <hi>A Teſtimony to our ſolemne</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114760:5"/>
               <hi>league and covenant,</hi> and pag. 28. acknowledge, that <hi>neither is this, nor any other Oath otherwiſe to be interpreted, than according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, plain, and true Grammaticall ſenſe of it,</hi> confident I am, that according to ſuch an interpretation as this of the ſaid <hi>Covenant,</hi> they have not done any thing at all in a regular and due purſuance of it in this piece, but ſeverall things moſt notoriouſly and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably againſt it, and with the violation and breach of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, all they can with any tolerable colour pretend to be here done in purſuance of their <hi>Covenant,</hi> may be recall'd to theſe two heads. 1. That which is pretended to be done in order to the extirpation of Errors, Hereſies, &amp;c. 2. Their pleading for Presbyterian government. Now (for the firſt) that here is nothing done in any regular or due way for the extirpation of Errors, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, &amp;c. is evident: For what is it they doe in order hereunto? To ſcrapple together a few ſayings, or paſſages out of ſeverall mens books here and there, without taking any notice, or giving any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their true ſenſe and meaning in them; yea, and ſome of theſe as faire, cleare, obvious Truths, as ever themſelves delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any; yea ſometimes to falſifie their ſayings, by leaving out ſome materiall words in the bodies of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and onely to clamor and cry out upon them, and call them, <hi>horrid and prodigious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> (as pag. 23.) <hi>infamous and pernitious errors,</hi> (as pag. 5.) <hi>the very dregges and ſpawn of thoſe old accurſed hereſies,</hi> &amp;c. (pag. 4.) <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripturiſme, Popery, Arrianiſme, Socinianiſme, Arminianiſme,</hi> &amp;c. (as pag. 33.) I ſay onely, to poure out floods of ſuch reproachfull and foule language as this, upon mens ſayings or opinions, without ſo much as levying one word of an argument againſt them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Aſſertors or maintainers of them, or without anſwering ſo much as any one reaſon or ground, upon which they build ſuch aſſertions, is a courſe and practice, not onely irrelative altogether to <hi>the extirpation of Errors and Hereſies,</hi> but very pertinent &amp; proper for the further propagation and radication of them. For when men ſhall ſpeak evill of that, as an <hi>Error,</hi> or <hi>Hereſie,</hi> againſt which they have nothing of moment, or which is ſolid, to oppoſe, the Aſſertors may very reaſonably ſuppoſe, that they ſpeak this evil of it, not out of judgment, as knowing it to be an error, but out of affection only, not being willing it ſhould be owned for a Truth. In which caſe they cannot lightly but be further confirmed in their error (if error it be) than before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:114760:6"/>Again 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. when men ſhall rend or teare a parcell of words out of the body of a large and entire Diſcourſe, which may probably carry ſome face or appearance of an hard or unſound ſaying, which notwithſtanding by the Authors explication is reconciled, made fully and fairly conſiſtent with the Truth, without ſo much as mentioning or intimating the Authors explication of himſelfe in theſe words, and then to inſult and ſtamp with the foot, and cry out, <hi>Error, Hereſie, Blaſphemy, Anti-ſcripturiſme, Arminianiſme, and I know not what,</hi> will any man call this a way, method, or means, for <hi>the extirpation of Error and Hereſie?</hi> and not rather a direct courſe to harden and ſtrengthen men in both?</p>
            <p>3. When men for want of ſuch ſayings, which are erroneous and hereticall indeed, in the writings of ſuch men, whom their carnall intereſts call upon them to expoſe, to the uttermoſt of their power, to the publick infamy and reproach of being counted <hi>Erroneous and Hereticall;</hi> ſhall pitch upon ſuch paſſages and ſayings for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not which are ambiguous, or of a doubtfull interpretation, and ſo capable of a ſiniſter or erroneous ſenſe, as well as of a good, but which are pergnant and generally acknowledged truths, yea and fairly conſiſtent with their own principles; I referre to the judgements and conſciences of all men, who lye not under the ſad judgement of ſelfe-condemnation, whether there be any thing regular, or of any probable tendency in this, for <hi>the extirpation of Errors and Hereſies;</hi> and not rather much, which directly tends to the further radication of them. They acknowledge and <hi>profeſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world,</hi> (pag. 28.) <hi>that they ſtill ſtand as firmly engaged to the reall performance of their covenant with their uttermoſt endeavours, as at the firſt taking of it.</hi> I appeale to their own conſciences; let theſe judge, whether barely to cite a few mens ſayings, and ſeverall of theſe rationall, orthodox, and ſound (according to their Authors ſenſe and explication) without ſo much as ſhewing or pointing, where, or in what part of theſe ſayings, the ſuppoſed error ſhould lye, be the <hi>utmoſt of their endeavours</hi> for the extirpation <hi>of Errors and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</hi> If it be, then are they moſt unworthy their places in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: if it be not, then are they covenant-breakers by their owne confeſſion. And whether the Authors of the <hi>Subſcribed</hi> piece now under examination, have therein done any more, than what hath been now mentioned in order to the extirpation of <hi>errors &amp; hereſies,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:114760:6"/>
I am freely willing to make themſelves Judges.</p>
            <p>The night is too farre ſpent for them to think, that men even of ordinary judgement or conſideration, will now meaſure or judge of <hi>Error</hi> and Truth, onely by their Magiſteriall votes, or imperious deciſions, either becauſe they are a multitude, or becauſe they lay claim to <hi>Moſes Chaire,</hi> calling themſelves, <hi>the Miniſters of Chriſt.</hi> Indeed when it was midnight, the groſſe darkneſſe of Popiſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuperſtition as yet ſpread upon the face of the nation, it was enough for a <hi>Province</hi> of Prieſts, or Clergy-men, gravely met together in the Name and Authority of their ſacred Unction, to ſtigmatize what opinions they pleaſed, for <hi>Errors and Hereſies,</hi> and ſo to render them uncleane, and not lawfull to be received or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved by their blinde Proſelites. But the <hi>Day-ſpring from on high</hi> hath now (bleſſed be God) <hi>viſited</hi> this nation, and men have <hi>put away</hi> thoſe <hi>childiſh things</hi> from them, to beleeve as the Church (i. as the Clergy) beleeveth: to call <hi>Error,</hi> whatſoever 52. Church-men, though in conjunction with threeſcore Church-livings, or more, ſhall baptize by the name of <hi>Error:</hi> to build their Faith, and ſoul-proviſions for eternity, upon the ſandy and ſlippery founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the judgements (or affections rather) of ſuch men, who have <hi>put the ſtumbling-block of their iniquity,</hi> (I mean this preſent world, and ſelf-intereſts) <hi>before their faces.</hi> Theſe things conſidered, evident it is, that the Architects of the building called, <hi>A Teſtimony to the truth of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> have not laid ſo much as one ſtone aright in all this pile, for their purpoſe of <hi>extirpating Errors or Hereſies.</hi> Therefore, as to this point, they have done nothing at all in purſuance of their Covenant, but ſeveral things (as hath been ſhewed) to the violation of it. The Covenant bindes them to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the extirpation of Errors and Hereſies:</hi> and they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, or at leaſt directly acted towards, the eſtabliſhment and further rooting of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, neither have they purſued their Covenant (according <hi>to the plain and true Grammaticall ſenſe of it</hi>) in pleading as they doe for Presbyteriall government. For firſt, it is the Aſſertion and Confeſſion of that great <hi>Hyperaspiſtes</hi> of this government, Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> that the <hi>Covenant of the Kingdomes doth not tye us to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of Scotland</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Antap. pag. 259.</note>. If not ſo, hardly then to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Government. And ſecondly, whether he had <hi>confeſſed</hi> it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114760:7"/>
or no, the truth it ſelfe hereof had been never the further out of the way. For certain it is, that there is not ſo much as any one ſyllable, word, clauſe, or ſentence in it, by which, <hi>according to the plain and true Grammaticall ſenſe,</hi> it engageth any man to the contending for, or endeavouring of Presbytery. Presbyterian Government is but <hi>Apochrypha</hi> in reſpect of the Covenant. And though with Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall confidence enough they conclude (but without premiſſes) pag. 24. <hi>that Presbyteriall government (truly ſo called) by Presbyteries and Synods, is that Government which is moſt agreeable to the minde of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt revealed in the Scripture,</hi> yet as if their conſciences had not taken the expreſſion well at their hands, by that time they come to page 34. they abate of their former reckoning halfe in halfe. For here, ſpeaking of the <hi>Government</hi> they had <hi>declared for, which</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we CONCEIVE to be moſt agreeable to Scripture.</hi> But upon theſe termes, they that ſhould <hi>declare</hi> for the <hi>Independent</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>conceiving it to be moſt agreeable to the Scripture,</hi> ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their engagement by the Covenant, every whit as much as they. Therefore in whatſoever they ſay or plead in their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> for Presbyterial government, they do nothing at all in any purſuance of their <hi>Covenant, according to the plain and true Grammaticall ſenſe of it,</hi> but only in purſuance of ſuch an interpretation or ſenſe of it, which lying moſt commodious for their honour, profit, and eaſe, hath by the mediation of their affections, prepared it ſelfe a way into their judgements, and hath there obtained the preheminence above all others: it being very incident to men, to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> (as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it) <hi>gain, godlineſſe.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim, 6. 5.</note> i. in all matters of queſtion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, to judge that moſt agreeable to the minde of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Scriptures, which is beſt conſiſting with worldly ends. So that howſoever they flouriſh in the front of their book, as if they meant to give ſuch an high and honorable <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to their <hi>Solemne league and Covenant;</hi> and again in the reere, as if they had accordingly <hi>avouched that Covenant which they have ſworn to God,</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> in this piece; yet the cleare truth is, that their flouriſh, is all their fight; they have not ſtruck ſo much as one ſtroke with their pen in any legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or direct proſecution of their engagement by it.</p>
            <p>And though it had been no great work of ſuper-erogation in caſe they had done ten times more than now they have, of ſuch a tendency and import, eſpecially upon ſuch a goodly frontiſpiece
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114760:7"/>
of pretence, being alſo numerous enough (if not many to ſpare, and of ſuper-abounding abilities for ſuch a worke yet had they not violated this their <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that ten times over, yea and this in the moſt notorious and ſhameleſſe manner (in ſtead of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it) they had conſulted much better both for their credits and conſciences, than now they have done. The truth is, they have made more breaches upon their Covenant in this little piece, than can readily be brought to account, or ranged into form. For how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doe they diſſemble and prevaricate with their profeſſions? And again, after all their ſhameleſſe and moſt notorious prevarications, and unconſcionable dealings, how doe they in the cloſe <hi>wipe their mouthes</hi> (with you know who,) profeſſing that <hi>all</hi> that <hi>they had done was in the integrity of their hearts to diſcharge their dutie conſcientiouſly, in appearing for God, his Truth, and cauſe of Religion.</hi> (p. 34.) But</p>

Was it <hi>in the integrity of your hearis to diſcharge your duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly,</hi> that you charge him with <hi>errors againſt the divine authority of the Scriptures</hi> (as you doe page 5.) who you cannot but know hath bent himſelfe with the uttermoſt of his endeavoure for the vindication of their <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> yea and who you have reaſon to judge hath <hi>laboured</hi> in this argument, as much, if not more, and this with as much faithfulneſſe, as any of <hi>you all?</hi> How did not your hearts ſmite yo in drawing up this bloody charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, leſt that very book of his, which you had in your hands when you did it, and which you cite in your margine, ſhould riſe up in judgment againſt you in the great day, conſidering that your conſciences could not but tell you, that he had dealt faithfully, throughly, and ſincerely, in pleading the cauſe of <hi>the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures</hi> therein? Is this your <hi>reall Reformation,</hi> to cry out <hi>Midnight</hi> when the Sunne ſhines in his might upon your faces?</p>
            <p>2. Was it to <hi>diſcharge your duty conſcientiouſly,</hi> that you cite ſome of my words barely, ſuppreſſing (craftily) my ſence and explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, being neer at hand, as you do twice (for failing in your wickedneſſe) <hi>pag.</hi> 5. of your booke? Or doe I not, plainly, cleerly, and diſtinctly enough, declare unto the world (in my Treatiſe concerning <hi>the Divine Authority of the Scriptures</hi>) in what ſence I hold the Scriptures, whether <hi>Tranſlations, or Originalls, to be the word of God,</hi> and conſequently <hi>the foundation of Chriſtian Religion,</hi>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26. 61.</note>?</p>
            <p>3. Was it <hi>in the integrity of your hearts, and to diſcharge your duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly,</hi> &amp;c. that you muſt needs make it an <hi>Errour or Hereſie</hi> (as you doe, <hi>page</hi> 12.) to ſay, that <hi>it were a needleſſe thing for Sathan to blind the eyes of naturall men, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſhine unto them, if they had not eyes to ſee, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this glorious light of the Goſpell, when it was declared unto them? Is this to appeare for God, or his truth,</hi> to <hi>appeare</hi> againſt evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yea common ſence it ſelfe? Is there any need of charging a ſtone, that it doe not ſpeake; or a deafe man, that he doe not hear; or a blind man, that he doe not ſee? Muſt we needs ſpeake nothing but non-ſence, and inconſiſtencies, to be free from <hi>Errours and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies?</hi> Is this the <hi>Suprcma lex</hi> in the Republique of Presbyterie?</p>
            <p>4. I beſeech you, Brethern, anſwer candidly, <hi>and in the integrity of your hearts,</hi> where, in what phraſe or clauſe, of the period inſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lies the <hi>Errour,</hi> or <hi>Hereſie;</hi> for you charge it with one, or both, pag. 12. <hi>If God ſhould not make men capable of believing, I meane, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due men with ſuch principles, abilities, or gifts, of reaſon, judgment, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, underſtanding, by the diligens improvement whereof, they might come to be convinced of a willingneſſe or readineſſe in him to receive them into grace and favour, upon their Repentance and turning to him (upon which conviction, that Repentance and turning unto God, which we ſpeak of, follows) they which are condemned, would have their mouths againſt Gods proceedings with them thereunto, and furniſhed with an excuſe?</hi> The period (ſetting the parentheſis aſide, which I ſuppoſe is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent) is but one plaine hypotheticall or connex propoſition. Now
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114760:8"/>
though I confes that conſequences in ſuch propoſitions may be weak and falſe, as well as categoricall aſſertions; yet amongſt all <hi>the olde accurſed Hereſies,</hi> ſo <hi>long ſince condemned</hi> (as you ſpeake) and which you ſay are <hi>now raked out of their graves, and revived,</hi> I remember none that was ever put into any mans roll or <hi>catalogue</hi> of Hereſies, in an Hypotheticall forme. If your reading or memory will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me better, you ſhall find me a Diſciple tractable enough. But for the conſequence in the propoſition rehearſed, which you put downe in your Catalogue for an <hi>Errour or Hereſie,</hi> it is built upon this principle, or maxime: that a true plea of want of power for the performance of what is commanded, is an excuſe in the caſe of non-performance. If this principle faile, the ſaid conſequence is weake: but if ſtrong and pregnant, the conſequence is partaker with it in both. But however, doubtleſſe neither <hi>the integrity of your hearts,</hi> nor the goodneſſe of your conſciences would have ſuffered in the leaſt, though you had not compelld a poore plaine hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall propoſition, which never did, nor meant, either you, or any other man, the leaſt harme, to beare the <hi>croſſe</hi> of being numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Errours</hi> or <hi>Hereſies.</hi>

I deſire alſo ſome ingenious ſhadow (at leaſt) of a reaſon from you, how it relates to the <hi>conſciencious diſcharge of your duty,</hi> to cite an whole page together (beſides what you fraudulently leave out, as not ſerving your turne; and what you cut off, by an &amp;c.) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of three or foure and thirty lines, under the name and notion of one and the ſame errour. Was it to repreſent me to your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as a man of monſtrous and prodigious errours? one of which could not be expreſſed or conteined in fewer words, than would fill an whole page in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>; nor this without the interpoſall of an <hi>et caetera,</hi> and a falſe finger beſides? Or was it to edifie the world in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and conſideration of your great zeale, and unwearied pains, to diſcover errours; ſo that rather than one of theſe ſhould eſcape you, you would undergoe the labour of tranſcribing whole pages together? Or was it for fear, in caſe you had determinately pitch'd upon any one line or ſentence, you might more eaſily have miſſed the errour, and have beaten a buſh, where the bird was not? Or was it in hope, that within ſo large a circuit or compaſs of ground, your Reader poſſibly might finde two or three errours, though your ſelves could not well tell where to find any? But if you be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114760:9"/>
to render unto mee a reaſon of this your extraordinary Quotation, give mee leave to render one unto you. I ſuppoſe the Reaſon might well be, becauſe <hi>in that wherein you magnified your ſelves, God had a minde to bee above you</hi> for the propagating of his Truth. For whereas you (it is like) meditated an unuſuall Citation to ſhew the world a more than ordinary errour; God might ſuffer you to take this compaſſe of matter, that ſo that great and precious Truth of his, which you call errour, contained therein, might be preſented from your hand with ſo much the more advantage to be diſcern'd, acknowledged, and received by men; yea by ſuch men, who probably might never have had the opportunity to have ſeene ſo much of it, but by meanes of the booke.</p>

            <p>Doubtleſſe the paſſage though injuriouſly dealt with (as we ſhall ſhew preſently) and purloin'd of ſome of its ſtrength, towards the beginning, yet carries light in abundance in it for the conviction of any ingenuous and unprejudiced man, that what is aſſerted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is truth.</p>
            <p>6. Would not <hi>the integrity of your hearts to diſcharge your duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly,</hi> ſuffer you to paſſe by ſimilitudes, compariſons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances, but that theſe muſt be crucified too for <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies?</hi> Doubtleſſe never were parables or ſimilitudes arreſted, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of errour or hereſie, untill now. A conſiderable part of that long errour we ſpake of, cited by you in folio (p. 11.) conſiſts of a ſimilitude. When you make errors and hereſies of ſimilitudes, you give us juſt occaſion to thinke, that you are not ſo much troubled with ſome mens errours and hereſies, when you finde them, as you are with ſeeking errours and hereſies in other men, untill you finde them. But they that will find knots in ruſhes, are neceſſitated to knit them themſelves. But I beſeech you, tell me ſeriouſly: is it matter of <hi>conſcience</hi> indeed with you, to puniſh the innocent with the guilty? If ſo, I am not for your Lawes, nor Common-wealth. But</p>
            <p>7. What ſay you to the mangling, maiming, and deforming the ſayings of your Brethren, when you cite them, by leaving out very emphaticall and materiall words, and clauſes; yea ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſions, as you found in them? Or doe you not in citing the paſſage (lately pointed at) with which you are pleaſed to adorn your Catalogue of <hi>errours about naturall mans free will</hi> (p. 11.) after
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114760:9"/>
theſe words, <hi>(line 11.) in a way of juſtice,</hi> leave out all this [<hi>and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, this man having cut off the legs of another.</hi>] Were you afraid, that the paſſage would not looke ſo like an errour, as you would have it, if any line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of Scripture ſhould be ſeen in the face of it? What you <hi>expreſſe</hi> in your <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> you ſay, (p. 3.) <hi>that you expreſſe not with a bitter, but with a bleeding heart:</hi> but what you leave out, relating to this, and to other paſſages cited by you (of which notice hath been already taken) I feare you leave out, rather with a <hi>bitter,</hi> yea and bloody, than <hi>bleeding</hi> heart.</p>
            <p>8. Doe you in <hi>the integrity of your heart,</hi> and cut of conſcience to <hi>appeare for God and his Truth,</hi> judg it an Errour, or Hereſie, to ſay, <hi>that if a Doctrine be aſſerted by</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Peter, <hi>it ought to ſuffer no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement for being found among the Tenets of</hi> Arminius? For of this aſſertion of mine you make an Errour (<hi>page</hi> 13.) unleſſe the words impriſon'd in a parentheſis, which are theſe, [<hi>as moſt aſſuredly it is</hi>] muſt beare the blame. Doe you not want Errours and Hereſies to complete your catologue &amp; roll, when you are neceſſitated to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and take in ſuch as theſe? Are not moſt of your own Doctrines <hi>found amongſt the Tenets of</hi> Arminius? Some of you (I ſuppoſe) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant, but that they are: but doe you therefore judge them <hi>Errours or Hereſies?</hi> yet</p>
            <p>9. The <hi>teſtimony</hi> now under conteſt, is in nothing more unlike, at leaſt more unworthy, <hi>the Miniſters of the Province of London,</hi> than that importune, and moſt unnaturall ſtraine in it, which preſenteth ſayings and opinions, for Errours and Hereſies, which are fairely and fully conſiſtent with their owne principles and grounds. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many inſtances might readily be produced, were not prolixity inconſiſtent with our preſent deſigne.

The ſaid Author, p. 44. of this Diſcourſe, writeth thus. <hi>No man is hindered from believing, through the difficultie, or unreaſonableneſſe of the command, or through his owne ſimple infirmity, as being willing and deſirous to believe, but not able; which inability deſerves pitty: but his inability is of corruption and wilfulneſſe: he doth not believe, becauſe he will not: he is unable, becauſe hee doth not covet or deſire, which is inexcuſable.</hi> Is there not every whit as much power, and freedome of will here attributed unto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men, as can be wreſted or wrung out of any, or all thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous paſſages of mine, (erroneouſly ſo called) which are cited in the Provinciall <hi>Teſtimonie?</hi> Do I there ſay any whit more, or doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Ball</hi> here ſay any whit leſſe, than that in caſe naturall men were not wilfull, they have a ſufficiency of power to believe? And that it may not be pretended that this paſſage fell from this Authors pen at unawares, or that the contents of it were not his ſetled and beſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved judgment, you ſhall find the very ſame things, and almoſt in the very ſame words, re-aſſerted by him, <hi>pag.</hi> 226. of the ſame Diſcourſe. Are thoſe opinions <hi>erroneous,</hi> or <hi>hereticall</hi> in <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> which are <hi>orthodox</hi> and <hi>Canonicall</hi> in <hi>Presbyterians?</hi> Or if they be as erroneous in the latter, as the former, why is not <hi>I.

Treatiſe ſpecified, of the ſame import and inſpiration with that which hath been produced; but this is ſufficient for theſe two ends and purpoſes;</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. To demonſtrate, that the authority of a <hi>Province of Miniſters,</hi> though all <hi>receiving the honour</hi> of Orthodox from <hi>one another,</hi> is yet a miſerable ſupport or ſtay for the judgements or conſciences of men, in matters of doctrine. That which is aſſerted for Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and ſound by a <hi>Province</hi> of Miniſters in <hi>France,</hi> is importunely cenſured and condemned for an <hi>infamous horrid,</hi> and <hi>pernicious Error,</hi> or <hi>Hereſie,</hi> by a Province of the ſame profeſſion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. To ſhew, with how good a conſcience the Subſcribers joyntly affirme, (as they doe, page 3. that <hi>they finde, to the abundant ſatisfaction of their judgement, and rejoycing of their ſpirits, the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith humbly adviſed by the Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> ſingularly <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, prudent, ſound, and agreeable to the Scriptures, and</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FESSIONS OF OTHER CHURCHES. If it be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable</hi> with the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of thoſe Churches lately mentioned, they have as much, or more, need to confeſſe their fault, as their faith.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond particular, wherein I affirmed, that that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which theſe men call <hi>infamous, pernitious, horrid Error and Hereſie,</hi> was alſo taught to the full extent and compaſſe of what I deliver in it, by ſome of the chiefe Reformers themſelves, it appears ſufficiently by this enſuing paſſage from <hi>M. Bucer,</hi> who in his Enar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> chap. 2. verſ. 14. writeth thus: <note n="a" place="margin">Hic duo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervemus; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um nullis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſaeculis homines do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina ſalutis deſtituiſſe: proinde, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuuque un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam perie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, ſuâ cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pâ periiſſe. Naturam ita perfundit ſuâ Iuce Deus, ut hi tantum à juſtitiâ alieni maneant, qui eam ultrò à ſe rejiciunt.</note> 
               <hi>Here let us obſerve two things; that God in no age whatſoever, left men deſtitute of the doctrine of ſalvation: Therefore whoever at any time periſhed, periſhed through their own default</hi> [or neglect.] <hi>For God ſo bedeweth</hi> (or waſheth) <hi>Nature with his light, that they only remaine ſtrangers unto righteouſneſſe, who</hi> willingly, &amp; <hi>of their own accord caſt it from them. There are at this day nations not a few, to whom the Goſpel of Chriſt is not ſincerely preached: Others there are, who heare nothing of it. But if theſe did not voluntarily put from themſelves the deſire of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, the Lord (queſtionleſſe) would ſo animate them with his Spirit, that they ſhould, or might, perform the things of the Law, commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to his</hi> (grace, or) <hi>goodneſſe, and doe unto their neighbours what they would that they ſhould doe unto them. Hence it would come</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:114760:15"/>
               <hi>to paſſe, that God would ſooner ſend an Angel unto them, as</hi>

               <hi>he did unto</hi> Cornelius, <hi>than ſuffer them to remain igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his Chriſt.

the reall and true <hi>Miniſters of the Province of London,</hi> having ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant opportunity of converſe with travellers from all parts, cannot but be full of the Truth of this Information, that there was more of the truth and power of Religion in <hi>England</hi> under <hi>the late Prelaticall Government,</hi> than in all the Reformed Churches beſides. The beſt <hi>ſucceſſe,</hi> which they can with any colour of Truth entitle this Government unto, is but the ſucceſſe of the Gardiners ſheers, which proſper only to the keeping all even and ſmooth in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet-hedge, by the ſnipping off, and keeping under thoſe thriving twigs and branches, which otherwiſe would out-grow their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and hinder uniformity.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, me thinkes there is too palpable a reflexion of prejudice and diſhonour upon the Parliament in ſeverall paſſages and ſtrains of this piece, to iſſue from between the feet of the ſacred Conclave of <hi>Sion-Colledge;</hi> though wiſer men (I confeſſe) than my ſelfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the affirmative ſtronger in this, than the negative; conceiving an evill eye looking out of a faire face of words upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be no diſſenting character of the Genius of <hi>the Miniſters</hi> (indeed) <hi>of the Province of London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To draw towards a concluſion; if any man ſhall aske why I could not be content to ſit downe by my charge, with the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience wherein others charged as well as I, poſſeſſe their ſoules; no mans pen moving againſt his accuſers, but mine? I anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. I was loth, that either the ſtones in the walls, or tiles upon the houſes, ſhould take the honour and comfort of this ſervice, out of my hand. <hi>If theſe ſhould hold their peace</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the ſtones would erie</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 19. 4.</note>. The honour of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be vindicated: and if the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who are a people, will not doe it, the Gentiles, who <hi>are no people</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 10. 19.</note>, ſhall and will. If men indued with reaſon and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſhall not appear in aſſerting the honour of God againſt thoſe, who ſin with an high a hand againſt it, the inanimate and ſenceleſs creature will certainly riſe up, and <hi>take away this Crowne</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>2. The demand propoſed, ſuppoſeth that, which ought not to be ſuppoſed; <hi>viz.</hi> that my <hi>patience</hi> is not only exerciſed, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, by my Charge. The truth is, though <hi>I doe</hi> not <hi>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114760:17"/>
charged from Heaven to doe: <hi>My Brethren, count it all joy, when you fall into divers temptations</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Iam. 1. 2.</note>. I truſt the tenour of my Anſwer doth no wayes imply, that there is ſo much as the <hi>leaſt haire of the head</hi> of my <hi>patience fallen to the ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. One part of the reſt, who are compelled to drink of the ſame Colledge cup with me, may poſſibly either have reverſed the errors here charged upon them, or otherwiſe be conſcious to themſelves of inſufficiency to defend them. Another part of them, for ought I know, may riſe up in their own defence, as I have done; yea, and poſſibly may prevent me. But for thoſe Aſſertions of mine, which theſe Miniſters have Baptized by the name of Errours, I neither know any reaſon why I ſhould proſcribe them, nor yet deſpaire of ſtrength from God, ſufficient to maintain them againſt all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction whatſoever. But</p>
            <p>4. (And laſtly) The chiefe motive which ingaged me to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, was, becauſe I looke upon my ſelf as the chiefe, if not the only perſon, for whoſe ſake the 52. hands were at this time drawn out of the boſome to ſmite the reſt. When the <hi>Chiefe Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> had with more than ordinary diligence and importunity wrought <hi>Pilate</hi> to ſigne his warrant for the crucifying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe matters deſerving death were not ſo cleer againſt him, as they deſired; they procured two thieves to <hi>be crucified WITH HIM,</hi> the <hi>one on his right hand, the other on his left</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 15. 27</note>, who in all likehood had not ſuffered death, at leaſt at this time, but only to colour over the foule act of crucifying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with the juſtice of their execution (if yet this execution it ſelfe were allowable by the Lawes of God) and to repreſent the Lord Chriſt as a man only worthy ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. In like manner, I have ſome reaſons importuning me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that this Court of Aſſize was called principally, if not only for my ſake: and that no <hi>Teſtimony</hi> had been given at this time, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>truth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> nor againſt the <hi>Errours or Hereſies</hi> of other men, had not the two and fifty prudently judged it <hi>expedient</hi> that my Name ſhould be blaſted, and not the reputation of a whole <hi>Province</hi> of Miniſters ſuffer by the greeneneſſe of it. The grounds of my beliefe in this point are,</p>
            <p>1. The ſore wound given to their Cauſe by <hi>Hageomaſtix Diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. was never <hi>mollified with oyle,</hi> untill now. They never eaſed themſelves of that ſorrow, till this <hi>Congregatio magna</hi> being called
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114760:18"/>
to advice about the cure, preſcribed this Recipe in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; <hi>viz.</hi> that 4. or 5. innocent lines of this Treatiſe ſhould be cited to appear upon a Stage, purpoſely built for errors and hereſies, and here receive the ſhame due to innocencie and Truth. But in vain have they rub'd themſelves &amp; their ſore upon this <hi>Dictamnum</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dictamnus,</hi> or <hi>dictamnum,</hi> is an herbe (in Engliſh Dita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie) having a property to draw out any thing faſtned in the bodie; upon which wild beaſts are ſaid to rubbe themſelves, when they are hurt, or wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for their eaſe and cure.</note> the imflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is never a whit allayed by it. Yea to this day—<hi>Haeret late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri aethalis arundo;</hi> nor have the 52. hands of this Subſcription, with all their verſatile motions and endeavours, been able to wriggle, or wreſt it out.</p>
            <p>2. I judg the greateſt part of the other <hi>Errours and Hereſies</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced upon this theatre, to be beneath their cognizance, by reaſon, partly of the ſillineſſe, contemptibleneſſe, and irrationality of them; partly, of the obſcurity and inconſiderableneſſe of their Authors. I can hardly believe that ſuch Eagles would have ſtoop'd to catch ſuch flies, ſuch <hi>dead flies,</hi> as theſe, but only to put into my <hi>oyntment,</hi> to cauſe that to <hi>caſt forth a ſtinking ſavour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The ſaid <hi>Teſtimony</hi> produceth my <hi>Errors &amp; Hereſies</hi> (ſo called) by whole pages, &amp; half pages, as if it were loth to leave any romth for other mens? Whereas my fellow-<hi>heretiques</hi> and <hi>Erratiques,</hi> are quickly diſpatch'd; little being cited out of their books in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; I ſuppoſe, leſt their errours ſhould ſeeme as great, as large, as dangerous, as mine.</p>
            <p>4. Leſt I ſhould ſeem not to abound with errors above the rate and proportion of other Delinquents in this kind, they cite ſayings (almoſt) of all ſorts out of my writings to make errours of, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſes, ſimilitudes, ſuppoſitions, aſſertions of a moſt direct and cleer conſiſtency with their own principles, and what not?</p>
            <p>5. This <hi>Teſtimony to the Truth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> made all the haſt was poſſible after the comming out of <hi>the Divine Authority of the Scriptures aſſerted,</hi> to blaſt the credit, and way-lay the acceptation of it with the generality of men. Whereas there are very few, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of thoſe other writings, which are <hi>attainted</hi> of <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> with mine, but have been extant in Print ſome conſiderable time, yea ſome of them (to my knowledg) ſeveral years. But by the way; is it not very in-harmonious, that theſe great Profeſſors of enmity and abhorrency againſt <hi>Errors and Hereſies,</hi> ſhould perſecute the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, with ſome other conſiderations of like nature with them,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114760:18"/>
render the jealouſie very opportune and ſtrong, that my ſelfe only was the ſtanding mark, at which the arrow of the <hi>Teſtimonie</hi> was ſhot; and that the reſt were made to ſtand by only to give aime. They are brought in to partake of my condemnation; that ſo I might partake with them in their guilt and ſhame; or at leaſt with ſuch of them, who being guilty, deſerve ſhame.</p>
            <p>To conclude: whereas the <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> with many others of the ſame intereſt, are ſtill <hi>inſtant</hi> upon all occaſions, <hi>in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon,</hi> to declaim againſt me, as <hi>a friend to Publicans and ſinners</hi> (I mean, to <hi>Errors avd Hereſies</hi>) and cry out that I deſire &amp; plead for a toleration of them all; I here ſolemnly profeſs, in the ſight of God, Angels, and men, that whoever they are, that beare the Errors and wicked opinions of the times, as a burthen of ſorrow upon their hearts and ſouls, I bear my ſhare and part with them. Nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that any of them all, who ſeek to render me the hatred of men, by the imputation of ſuch a delinquency, have run, either faſter, or further, in the way of God, for the pulling up thoſe noyſome weeds out of the fields of Chriſt amongſt us, then I have done. I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly ingaged my ſelf in the publike court of my Miniſtry againſt 4. of thoſe Errors (and am at this day in full proſecution of this my ingagement) which are generally look'd upon as the moſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant amongſt us, and unto which, all others whatſoever, may (I conceive) eaſily be reduced; <hi>Antinomianiſme, Anabaptiſme, Anti-Scripturiſme, Queriſme,</hi> or Seeking; unto which I might adde a fifth alſo, called <hi>Manicheiſme:</hi> which, had it not the countenance, which the other 4. want, would ſoon be found to be of as ſad and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a conſequence to Religion, as they. I am <hi>a foole to boaſt my ſelf:</hi> but wiſe men <hi>bave compelled me:</hi> and wiſe men (I hope) will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me. I have again &amp; again in ſeverall of my writings, declared my ſenſe and judgment to be, that <hi>no Error whatſoever ought to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated;</hi> but that every Errour ſufficiently detected, and evicted, ought to be proceeded againſt, in ſuch a method and way, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch terms, which are juſtifiable by the word of God, or by ſuch principles of equity and good conſcience, that are found in prudent, diſingaged, and conſciencious men. The height of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſals in this kind, hath been this; 1. That men be very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and warie, leſt intending only to crucifie theeves, they crucifie <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo. 2. That they do not make thieves of all thoſe, who through infirmitie or miſtake in judgement only, declare themſelves to be men.</p>
