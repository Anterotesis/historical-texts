            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They are part of that heavenly

restore unto him his speech and hearing, the
use whereof for a time he had lost through
his incredulity, but also bestowed upon him
the Spirit of Prophesie: And such also was
his thankfulness to God, that no sooner had
he recovered his speech, but he imployed it

own Son, at the 76 Verse to the end of the
Psalm.</p>
            <p>His Prophesie concerning Christ is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
thanksgiving, wherein he blesseth
God for his unspeakable Mercy to the Israel
of God, in sending his own, and his only
begotten Son to work our Redemption and
Salvation. For although our Savior was not
as yet born, and much less had payd the price
of our Redemption; yet he knew him to
be incarnate, and conceived in the womb
of the blessed Virgin: Wherefore knowing,
that now the work of Redemption was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

done, and praiseth God therefore.</p>
            <p>His Prophesie concerning his own Son, is
a Prophetical gratulation, congratulating the

Exposition in these words, <hi>hath visited,</hi> that
is, hath redeemed his people, <hi>by raising up a
horn of Salvation for us,</hi> (that is a mighty
Saviour, as Psalm 18. 3.) in the house and
linage of his servant <hi>David</hi> (whose son ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the flesh the <hi>Messias</hi> was to be)
<hi>as he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets,
which have been of old.</hi> For God is said to
visit men, when he doth to them, as he had
foretold, whether in the better part, by way
of promise; or in the worse, by way of
threatning. And thus, in the better part, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
teacheth us to expound this phrase, Gen.
21. 1. <hi>The Lord visited Sarah,</hi> that is, <hi>he did
to Sarah as he had promised.</hi> Upon which
words <hi>Fremelius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> have this note:
<hi>hence are we to take the Explication of this
usuall phrase; for to visit is to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the good promised, or the evill denounced.</hi>
So Gen. 50. 24. God (saith <hi>Ioseph</hi>) will sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
visit you, Exod. 13. 19. that is, <hi>will bring
you out of this land, unto the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
as he sware to Abraham, Isaak, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65398:6"/>
Iacob.</hi> And accordingly when God did
send <hi>Moses</hi> to deliver his people out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> as he had promised, he is said to
have visited them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 16. &amp; 4. 31.
In like manner, when God sent his own
Son to redeem us, as he had formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.
he is said to have <hi>visited,</hi> that is, to
have redeemed his people, as he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by all his holy Prophets in former
times.</p>
            <p>The latter and more large Exposition,
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> beginning at <hi>ver.</hi> 71. for the
man of God being ravished with the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this unestimable benefit, doth as
it were dwell <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> upon it, being not
content to have propounded it, and once to
have expounded the same, but again, by
way of exultation, he amplifieth it in other
words, after the manner of the godly in
their songs of deliverance; as you may see
in that song of <hi>Moses</hi> Exod. 15. which
was his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or song of victory, which
the <hi>Israelites</hi> had over <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the
<hi>Egyptians;</hi> as this is <hi>Zacharies</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
or song of victory, which the Israel of God
hath over the spirituall <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all the
enemies of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>But I come to the words of the Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Salvation,</hi> where we may out of the
words going before, repeat the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65398:7"/>
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if he had said, Who, I say, hath
wrought or raised Salvation, that is, <hi>saved us
from our enemies, and from the hand,</hi> that is,
the power <hi>of all that hate us:</hi> Verse 72. <hi>That
he might work mercy with our Forefathers,</hi>
that is, that he might perform his merciful
promises made to our Fathers, and <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
that is, shew himself mindful <hi>of his holy
Covenant:</hi> Then Verse 73. <hi>The Oath,</hi> which
is either to be read by apposition, if with
<hi>Theophylact</hi> we read <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to wit, <hi>The Oath,</hi>
or to be referred to the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that he might perform or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Oath which he sware to our Father
<hi>Abraham.</hi> In this latter Exposition, as the
words are multiplied, and the phrases varied,
so the affection of the argument is also
changed: for whereas in the former Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
it was said, <hi>He visited,</hi> that is, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
his people, as he had graciously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised;
here it is said, <hi>He visited,</hi> that is,
Redeemed or saved us, that he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his promise: Where the keeping of
his promise is made the end of his sending
Christ to Redeem us; to let us understand,
That as God was most gracious in promising
our Redemption, so most faithful and just in
the performance. So that the former part
of this Psalm, from the beginning thereof to
the end of my Text, is but one sentence or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65398:7"/>
Axiome, wherein there is relation of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
the sum whereof is this, Because
the Lord hath visited, that is, hath Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his people, according to his promise, and
hath saved us, that he might keep his promise,
and perform his Oath; he is therefore to be
<hi>Blessed,</hi> that is, magnified and praised.</p>
            <p>This Analysis I have the rather propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
because we repeating this Psalm daily
in our Lyturgy, might, as <hi>David</hi> exhorteth,
<hi>Psal. 47. 7. Sing with understanding;</hi> as also
because my Text being but a part of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
is not compleat in it self, but must be
perfected by repetition of that which goeth
before, after this manner, The Lord God of
Israel is therefore to be blessed, because he
hath visited, that is, hath sent his Son to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
us, as he hath promised; and to save
us, that he might keep his promise, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his Oath which he sware to <hi>Abraham;</hi>
the tenor whereof was this, <hi>That he would
give us, &amp;c.</hi> and this is the Coherence of my
Text, Out of which we may gather these
three Observations:</p>
            <p>First, where it is said, That God did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
send his Son to Redeem us, that he
might keep his promise, and perform his
Oath: we observe the immutable truth and
fidelity of God in performing his promises;
<hi>For in Christ all the promises of Godare yea,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65398:8"/>
and amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. If therefore the
truth of God be such, that rather then he
would go back from his word, he did send
his own Son to suffer death for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
yea, if his fidelity were such, as that
therefore he sent his son that he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his promise, then can we not doubt of
the performance of any other promise of
God; this being the most difficult of all, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for God to grant, or for us to beleeve.
When the world was to be made, the Lord
did speak the word, and it was created. But
when it was to be redeemed; he gave his
Son to be a price or ransome for us. And
who would ever have thought (but that the
Lord hath revealed this his unspeakable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in his word:) that God, being of infinite
Majesty and Glory, and enjoying all self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
happiness, would give his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son to dye for his enemies? If therefore
to make good this promise, he gave his Son
to dye for us, how shall he not <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.
with him give us all other good things which
he hath promised? Such is the truth of God,
that every faithful man may say with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
2 <hi>Tim. 1. 12. I know whom I have
beleeved, and I am sure</hi> that what he hath
promised shall in due time be performed.
For as he is omnipotent, and therefore able,
so he is the God of truth, <hi>Psalm</hi> 31. 5.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65398:8"/>
yea truth it self, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4. and therefore
willing; he is <hi>Iehovah,</hi> Exod. 6. 3. one
that giveth being to his word; who though
he can do all things, yet he cannot lye, <hi>Tit.</hi>
1. 2. nor deny himself 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the faithful, who lived before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of CHRIST, did faithfully and
comfortably wait for the performance of
that promise, as being the consolation of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
Luk.</hi> 2. 25. though between the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it, and the performance, there did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
four thousand years: So whereas
the Lord hath promised his second coming
for our full redemption; though it may seem
to be delayed, we are with comfort to wait
for it, with earnestnes to long for it, and
with undoubted certainty to expect it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas <hi>Zachary</hi> praiseth the
Lord for performing his promise concerning
our redemption by CHRIST, we learn,
what is our duty; namely to praise and
magnifie the name of the Lord, as for all
other his mercies, so especially for the work
of our redemption; according to that, <hi>Psa.
107. 2. Let them praise the Lord, whom he
hath redeemed, and delivered from the hand
of the enemy.</hi> But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas <hi>Zachary</hi> giveth thanks
to God for a benefit not as yet received; for
as yet CHRIST was not born, and much less
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65398:9"/>
had he as yet redeemed us; we learn, That we
are to give thanks, not only for the benefits al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
received, but for such also as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised:
for this is a notable fruit of a lively
Faith, setting forth also most notably the
truth of God in his promises; when a man
in the assurance of Faith, which is <hi>the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. giveth
thanks for those benefits and blessings
which as yet he hath not, as though he had
already received them. It is the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the faithful, <hi>Hebr. 11. 13. who
having not received the promises, but having
seen them afar off</hi> (as <hi>Abraham,</hi> Joh. 8. 56.
saw the day of Christ) beleeved them, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
them, and rejoyced in them: For, if
he who praiseth God for benefits received,
doth glorifie God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 23. then much
more doth he glorifie him, and magnifie his
Truth, who praiseth him for benefits which
he hath only promised, because this is a fruit
of a greater Faith. Thus <hi>David</hi> shewed
himself thankful to God for the favors
which he had promised by <hi>Nathan, 2 Sam.</hi>
7. and thus ought we to be thankful for the
promises of a better life. So much of the
Context.</p>

            <p>NOw I come to the Text it self; the

Oath, wherein we are to consider both the
parties between whom it was made, and
also the tenor of the Oath it self. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as well him that sweareth, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> as he to whom the

That whereas some Oaths are <hi>assertory,</hi>
wherein some truth is avouched; others <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missory,</hi>
wherein some promise is made:
this is of the latter sort, containing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of a gift; for so he saith, <hi>That he
would give us.</hi> This gifs is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
in those words, <hi>That we should be

the fruit and end of our Redemption, which
is the true worship of God, in those words,
<hi>That we should worship him, &amp;c.</hi> which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God is set forth both by the parts
and properties thereof. The parts are two,
<hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Righteousness;</hi> for by <hi>Holiness</hi>
we are to understand the duties of the first
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65398:10"/>
Table, which we owe unto God: and by
<hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> the duties of the second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which we owe unto man. The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are three; The first, respecting our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
from whom wee are delive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> 
               <hi>without fear</hi> of them; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
respecting God, in the words <hi>before
him,</hi> the third, respecting the continuance,
<hi>all the dayes of our life.</hi> The first of these is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> spirituall security; the second, is
uprightnesse and sincerity: the third, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
or perseverance. Of these in order.</p>
            <p>Concerning the party which did swear,
we are to consider these three things. 1. By
whom hee sware. 2. How, or after what
manner. 3. To what end. For the first; it is
the manner of men in their oathes to swear
by a greater. But the Lord; when he made
this Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> because he
could not swear by a greater, he sware by
himself, <hi>Heb. 6. 13. By my self have I sworn,
saith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16.</p>
            <p>Concerning the manner: we may gather
by that, which the Lord requireth in our
oathes, what he performed in his own, <hi>Ier.</hi>
4. 2. There are three properties required in an
Oath, <hi>Truth, Iudgement,</hi> and <hi>Righteousnes.
Truth,</hi> opposed to falshood o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> perjury:
<hi>Iudgement,</hi> to rash and common swearing;
<hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> to unjust and unlawful oaths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65398:10"/>
For the first: that the Lord did swear in
<hi>Truth,</hi> it is most certain, because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that the Lord in his promise, and in
his oath should lye, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 18. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may be assured of that, wherewith
<hi>Micah</hi> concludeth his prophecy, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 20.
that the Lord will undoubtedly performe his
mercy, which by oath he promised to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
From whence we may learn this most
profitable instruction. That seeing the oath of
the Lord, whereby he promiseth to give to
all them that are delivered from the hand of
their spirituall enemies (that is, to all that are
redeemed by CHRIST) grace to worship
him in holinesse and righteousnesse, is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
we should therefore be carefull to bring
forth these fruits of our redemption; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
we can have no assurance, that we are
the redeemed of the LORD. Yea, on the
contrary, it may be verified of us; that if we
do live in sin, and do not, at the least desire
and endevour to serve God in the duties of
holinesse and righteousnesse: it is as certain
as the Oath of God is true, that as yet we
have no part in the redemption wrought by
CHRIST. And the reason hereof is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
for to be a servant of sinne, and to
be redeemed from the bondage of sinne;
are things repugnant, and imply a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
For whom <hi>Christ the Sonne of God
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65398:11"/>
maketh free, they are free indeed,</hi> Joh. 8. 36.
but he that is a servant of sin is not freed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
Now every one that committeth sin,
as habituated in sin, that is in whom sin raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
he is the servant both of sin, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 34.
and of Satan, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in <hi>Iudgment,</hi> a man is said to
swear in judgment when he sweareth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
upon just and necessary occasion; for
Oaths are then only good, when they are
necessary. This necessity of the Lords Oath
ariseth from our weakness and infidelity,
who will not beleeve the Lord without an
Oath: and therefore the Lord, in great
mercy to relieve our infirmities, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
his Promise, which in it self needeth
no confirmation, as being truth it self <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Heb. 6. 16. more abundantly</hi> then
otherwise needed, by Oath, which as it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
our great corruption, so it ought to be
a remedy for the same. It is great infidelity
not to beleeve the Word and Promise of
God, but greater not to beleeve his Oath:
In not beleeving his Promise, thou makest
him a lyar, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 10. In denying credit
to his Oath, dost thou make him any better
then a perjured person? And yet this is the
estate and condition of many professing the
Name of Christ. God hath swo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, and will
not repent, That to those whom he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemeth,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65398:11"/>
grace shall be given to worship
him in holiness and righteousness. These
men do not so much as desire, care or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to worship God in holiness and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
but live in sin, and go on in sin,
without repentance; and yet for all this,
they will needs perswade themselves that
they are the Redeemed of the Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the express Oath of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in <hi>Righteousness;</hi> men are
said to swear in righteousness, when that
which they promise by Oath is lawful
and good: and this goodness is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by the reference which it hath to
the glory of God, and good of man.
Neither doth the Lords Oath want this
property; for what could be either more
glorious to himself, or more profitable unto
us, then that which by this Oath is promised?
For as touching the glory of God, among
all the works which God ever wrought,
there is not any that setteth forth more the
glory both of his Mercy and of his Justice,
then the work of our Redemption, with the
fruits thereof: For hereby appeareth his
mercy to be such, as that, rather then he
would suffer us most miserable sinners to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in our sins, he gave his own, and his only
begotten Son to die for us. His justice such,
that rather then he would suffer the sins of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65398:12"/>
his own elect children to go unpunished, he
hath punished them in the death and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his only begotten Son.</p>
            <p>And if you consider our profit, it is evident
that (as hereafter you shal hear) in the things
promised by this Oath, our happiness doth
consist. Neither doubt I to affirm, that by
the things promised in this Oath, our estate
becometh better, then that which we lost in
<hi>Adam. Adam,</hi> though he were just, stood
righteous before God, but in his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
but we being redeemed by Christ,
stand righteous before God in the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, which far surpasseth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
both of men and Angels. <hi>Adam</hi>
was created good, but changeable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
being tempted, he fell; but we, being
once redeemed by Christ and sanctified by
his spirit, shall never fall away; but <hi>by the
power of God through faith we are kept safe
unto salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5. The happiness,
which <hi>Adam</hi> enjoyed, was in an earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
but the happiness, which Christ hath
purchased for us, is in Heaven. Thus much
of the manner.</p>
            <p>Now are we to consider the end for
which the Lord did swear: which is plainly
and fully set down <hi>Hob.</hi> 6. 17, 18. that he
might more abundantly shew unto the heirs
of promise, <hi>the stableness of his counsel:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65398:12"/>
that by two immutable things</hi> (that is his
word, and his Oath) <hi>they might have strong
consolation.</hi> For howsoever they might doubt
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rseverance unto salvation, in regard
both of their owne frailty, and also of the
strength of their enemies: yet they know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the foundation of God abideth sure,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. and that the Word and Oath of
the Lord is immutable; and that, howsoever
heaven and earth shall passe away, yet not
one jot, or title of the Oath of God shall fall
to the ground. And therefore have just cause
with <hi>David, Psalm.</hi> 40. 2. to professe them
confidence, and with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. 38. 39.
to rest assured, that nothing shall be able to
separate them from Gods love in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
our Lord. For the Lord hath sworne,
and will not repent, That <hi>he will give us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivered from the hand of our enemies,
to worship him without fear, in holinesse and
righteousnesse, before him, all the dayes of
our life.</hi> If therefore the oath of an honest
man be, or ought to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the
end of controversie, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 16. how much
more-ought the Oath of the Lord to be an
end unto us of doubting and distrust?</p>
            <p>The use, which we are to make of that,
which hath been said, concerning the Lord
his taking of an Oath, is that, whereunto we
are so often exhorted in the Scriptures, <hi>Be

you holy. as I am holy, saith the Lord,</hi> that
is, in this particular duty of holinesse (for
swearing is required in the first Table) We
are to imitate the Lord, both in respect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
the action it self, and also in regard of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the manner, and the end.</p>
            <p>As touching the action it self, where the
Lord is said to have sworne, we are taught,
that to sweare, is in it self a thing lawfull and
good, though the Anabaptists deny it in all
Christians, and the Papists in them, who in
their conceipts, are perfect; and yet in the
Scriptures wee see it practised by the holy
Angels, by the blessed Apostle in diverse pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Epistles, in the penning whereof
he was free, as from erring, so also from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and lastly by God himselfe, in this, and
many other places. Neither is it only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
as lawfull, and good, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 11.

thing which not only may be done, but also
which must be done, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. 10. 20. as

               </gap>ty both of holinesse to God, and
of righteousnesse and charity to man. For
being rightly performed, it serveth greatly to
set forth the glory of God, by ascribing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him Omniscience and Omnipresence, the
knowledge of secrets, justice, the patronage
of truth, the punishing of Falshood. Of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

9. 2. Let us rather consider, how we are to
imitate the Lord in swearing, in respect of
the object, the manner and the end.</p>
            <p>First therefore, as the Lord did swear by
the true God onely, that is, himself: so we
are to swear by no other, for what we swear
by, that we Deifie; and therefore to swear
by any other, is to forsake God, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
            <p>And as touching the manner, we are to
swear in truth, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udgement, and in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 2. for not to swear in truth is
perjury; which is forbidden, condemn'd,
and punished as a detestable sin, and as an
horrible profanation of the Name of God,
<hi>Lev. 19. 12, Ier. 5. 2. Zae.</hi> 5. 4. wherein
besides falshood and lying, which destroy
the soul, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>clude out of heaven, <hi>Apoc.</hi>
22. 15. and besides deceipt, (and that under
the religion of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whereof God is the

               </gap>venger, 1 <hi>Thes. 4. 6. Psal.</hi> 5. 7. there do
also concur two other abominations. The
one an horrible indignity offered to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of God, whereby as if he were a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of falshood, they call upon him, as a
witness, to second their untruth. The other
in that they tempt God, and dare him, as it
were, to his face, to execute his vengeance
upon them, if they avouch an untruth;
when they themselves know, that they
swear falsly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in <hi>judgement:</hi> for to swear
rashly and commonly in our ordinary talk, is
to make common, that is, to pollute the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
name of God; and to turn the Sanctuary
of verity, into a common house of vanity.
As the Name of God is holy and reverend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
ought it to be used holily, and reverendly;
And as an oath is not simply good, but upon
necessity, so ought it not to be used, but
when it is necessary. For, <hi>bonum necessarium
extra terminos necessitatis non est bonum.</hi>
Our Saviour therefore forbiddeth us to
swear at all in our ordinary talk, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34.
37. and S. <hi>Iames</hi> wisheth us above all things
to take heed, that we swear not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>left we
fall into condemnation, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 12. and
wholsome to this purpose is the councell of
the son of <hi>Syrach, Eccl.</hi> 23. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in <hi>Righteousness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for by oath
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65398:14"/>
to promise that, which is unlawfull, besides
that it argueth a full purpose, and resolution
to do evill, which is to sin with a high hand:
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> doth also offer an horrible indignity unto
God, when a man calleth upon him to be,
as it were his surety for the doing of that
evill, which he promiseth.</p>
            <p>There rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ineth the end: for so we are to
swear, that by testifying a necessary truth,
which cannot by other means be manifested<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
God may be glorified (according to that
form of adjuration, <hi>Give glory to God, Ios.</hi>
7. 19.) our brethren satisfied, controversies
ended, our duty discharged, our own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie

               </gap>thes, which
are not referred to these, or such like ends;
and by them also the holy Name of God is
taken in vain. So usually do they swear, that
swear usually; having no respect, either to
the glory of God, the good of their brethren,
or discharge of their duty; but rap out
Oathes, sometimes in choler, sometimes in
pride and vain glory, sometimes in deceipt,
to colour their falshood: sometimes in a
vain conceipt to win credit to their speeches
wherein notwithstanding they are misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
deceived, for he that sweareth much,
sometimes for sweareth: and he that maketh
no conscience of polluting the holy and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Name of God by common swearing;

               </gap>. So much of the party that did swear.</p>

               </gap>o speak of the party to
whom this Oath was made; who is here
described by his name <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by his

               </gap>tion to us, <hi>Our Father. Abraham</hi> was

nations,</hi> that is to say, of the faithful in
all Nations. Now, whereas I shewed before,
That the Lord would not have taken an
Oath, unless it had been necessary, in respect
of our weakness and incredulity, who will
not beleeve him without an Oath: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
That <hi>Abraham</hi> himself needed to
have the Promises of God confirmed to him
by Oath: From whence we learn this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
lesson, That the Faith of the best of
as hath its imperfections, and is mingled with
Unbelief. For if <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of
the faithful, the most worthy pattern of a
lively and a strong Faith, had need to have
his infirmities relieved, as it is plain that he
had; not only (as in this place) by Oath;
but also <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. by a sign; <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. by the
Sacrament of Circumcision, which was unto
him a Seal of that Righteousness which is by
Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. and almost in every Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his story, by the often repeating and
renewing of the promises unto him: What
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65398:15"/>
are we to think of our selves, who are by
many degrees inferiour to <hi>Abraham?</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we are to beware, both of the proud
phantasie of those, who dream of perfection
in this life; and also of the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reless practise
of others, who thinking they have proceeded
far enough, sit still, not seeking to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the way of Christianity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are not likely to come to the end of their
way, which is the salvation of their souls.
But we, in the humble acknowledgement of
our imperfections, must with the Apostles,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 5. pray unto the Lord to increase
our faith, and using all good means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
<hi>from faith to faith,</hi> untill we come to
a perfect man in Christ, we must with the

And whereas <hi>Zachary</hi> calleth <hi>Abraham

he concludeth against them, that they were
not <hi>Abrahams</hi> sons indeed, because they did
not the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> vers. 39, 40. This
must teach those, who come of faithfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or are nobly descended from famous
and worthy ancestors, not to rely too much
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65398:16"/>
upon their parentage, but to shew themselves
to be their children by imitating their faith,
and their godly conversation. For otherwise,
though their parents were the children of
God, they may notwithstanding be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Devill, as our Saviour telleth the
unbeleeving <hi>Iewes, Ioh.</hi> 8. 44. And therefore
<hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> warneth the <hi>Iewes,</hi> not to

If therefore we would be able, with <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>

<hi>us,</hi> who have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father, that is

here some m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n will say, there is no such
Oath as this, recorded in the Scriptures of
the old Testament, which God did sweare to
<hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereunto I answer: that it is not always
the custome of the holy Ghost, in the New
Testament, when he alleadgeth Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
out of the old, to recite the very
same words, and syllables, but sometimes,
as being the best interpreter of himself, in
stead of words, he setteth down the true
sence and meaning thereof: so in this place.
For whereas <hi>Moses</hi> Gen. 22. 16. 18. recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
this Oath in these words, <hi>by my selfe
have I sworn, saith the Lord, that in thy
seed all the nations of the earth shall be

give us, that we being delivered from the
hands of our enemies, should worship him
without fear, &amp;c.</hi> That this is the oath,
which <hi>Zachary</hi> meaneth, it is most certain:
because he giveth thanks to God, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

in this world, which they expected from
the <hi>Messias,</hi> all things should happen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their expectation. Our Saviour
therefore pronounceth them blessed, who
were not offended at him in respect of his
mean condition, and poor estate. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For rectifying our judgment in
that most weighty point concerning our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
For the very foundation of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
conversation, is the right belief concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
happiness. For all men desire happiness,
as the supream end. And such as is the end,
or happiness which they propound unto
themselves: such are the means which they
use, such are their studies and endeavours.
As for example, if men place their happiness
in pleasure, their whole course of life is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumptuous;
if in riches, covetous; if in honour,
ambitious, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For these causes, as I said, it was necessary
that it should be declared, what this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is. Our Saviour therefore in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his gracious Sermon upon the Mount
sheweth, that the happiness, which by him
they were to expect, did consist in spiritual
grace, and eternal glory. <hi>Mat. 5. 3. Blessed
are the poor</hi> or <hi>beggers in spirit, for theirs is
the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> and so in the rest,
in every whereof two degrees of happiness

Abraham might come on the Gentiles
through Iesus Christ, that we might receive
the promise of the Spirit.</hi> But most chiefly in

is, <hi>viz. That he would give us, that we

Now these two are the two parts
of the gift, which God by oath in this place
promised to give to the faithful the sons of
<hi>Abraham: viz.</hi> deliverance from the hand of
our spiritual enemies, namely the law, sin,
death, and the devil, which is our redemption
or justification: and grace to worship God
without fear in holyness and righteousness
before him all the days of our life, which is
our sanctification.</p>
            <p>2. And that it is a ful and perfect exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is easily proved: because not only to
the whole gift here promised, but to every
part and parcel thereof, happyness is ascribed
in the word of God. As first, to <hi>redemption;</hi>
for what is it to be redeemed by Christ, but
to have remission of sins by him? <hi>Ephes. 1. 7.
Col. 1. 14. By him we have redemption, even
the remission of our sins.</hi> But to the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sins, the holy Ghost ascribeth blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Psal. 32. 1, 2. Rom. 4. 6, 7. Blessed is the
man whose transgression is forgiven, whose
sin is covered. Blessed is the man to whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Secondly to a godly life: which is here
termed the worship of God in holiness and
righteousness, in which the keeping of the
law doth consist. For when a woman out of
the crowd cryed unto our Saviour, <hi>blessed is
the womb that bare thee, and the papes that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65398:20"/>
gave thee suck:</hi> Our Saviour returned this
answer, <hi>Luke 11. 28. Yea rather blessed are
they that heare the word of God and keepe it.</hi>
The same hath <hi>Salomon, Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>v.</hi> 29. 18. and
who knoweth not that, which the Apostle
teach, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. Godlinesse hath the promise
of the life that now is, and of that which is to
come,</hi> and consequently of the happinesse
both of this life, and of the other life.</p>
            <p>3 To the parts of Gods worship; as namely
to <hi>holiness. Apoc. 20. 6. Blessed and holy is the
man, who hath his part in the first resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Which testimony yeeldeth unto us a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proof. First, because he useth the terms of

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
of life. And not only to holiness in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
but to the severall branches thereof is
blessedness ascribed; as to saving knowledge,
<hi>Prov. 3. 13. Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. to faith, <hi>Luke 1. 45. Ioh.</hi>

               </gap>3. for this indeed is the
top of our happiness in this life, to worship
God, as without fear of damnation; so in a
found expectation of eternal life. And this
seemeth to be implyed in the Hebrew word
<hi>Hithbaracu,</hi> which being of a reciprocal sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,

            <p>THus much of <hi>Zacharies</hi> exposition of
Gods Oath, now we come to the
words thereof, <hi>that he would give us, &amp;c.</hi>
The thing then promised in this Oath is a
gift: Of this gift we are to speak; first in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and then in particular. In general,
we may observe, first, the main difference
between the Covenant of works, made with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65398:22"/>
all mankind: and the Covenant of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, the heires
of promise, In the former, the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rse against
those, that do not continue in a total and
perfect obedience. In the latter, the Lord, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in stead of requiring perfect obedience to be
performed of us to our justification and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
promiseth to those, which believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and justification without works:
and being redeemed and justified by faith, he
promiseth to give them grace to walk in
new obedience, as being an unseparable fruit
of our redemption and justification, and as
the high-way wherein we are to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our glorification. Of this new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
the holy Ghost prophesieth by <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
Chap. 31. vers. 31. 32, 33. <hi>Behold the
days come saith the Lord, that I wil make a
new Covenant with the house of</hi> Israel, <hi>and
with the house of</hi> Judah, <hi>not according to the
Covenant which I made with their fathers,
when I brought them out of</hi> Aegypt (which
was the covenant of works:) <hi>but this shal be
the Covenant that I wil make with them, I wil
put my law in their inward parts, &amp; write it
in their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the covenant of
grace recited by the Apostle, Heb. 8. v. 8. 9. 10
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65398:23"/>
of which, being a better Covenant, Christ is
the mediator, v. 6. according to that <hi>Iohn 1.
17. This Law was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but grace
and truth came by Iesus Christ.</hi> The same
Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt repeated by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 36. 26.
27. The Gospel therefore or Covenant of
Grace is not a new law, nor Christ a new
law-giver (as the Papists absurdly teach, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
the Law and the Gospel; saving
that they teach, that the Gospel requireth
more perfect obedience to be performed by
our selves, then the Law it self doth prescribe
unto justification) but to them that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
and justified by faith, it promiseth
grace to walk in new obedience. Howbeit
this is true, that as men deprived themselves
of what was promised in the Old Covenant,
by disobedience: So if men do live in sin
without faith, and without repentance, not
so much as desiring, caring, and endeavouring
to worship God in holyness and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
they can have no assurance that they are
within the Covenant of grace, made only
with those that truly beleeve: God having
promised to those, which are redeemed and
justified by faith, to give them grace to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him, in holyness and righteousness.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we note, that our justification
and sanctification are both the free gifts of
God, for it is he that redeemeth and justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65398:23"/>
and it is he also that sanctifieth, which
point needeth no proof, seeing God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
swear they are both his gifts. The use where
of in a word is, that both they, which want
these benefits, being neither freed from the
guilt of their sins, nor purged from their
corruptions, may know where to seek them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
&amp; also those that have them maybe thankful to
God the giver of them: which is the thing,
whereunto the holy Ghost by <hi>Zachary</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth
us in this Psalm.</p>
            <p>Now this gift promised by Oath (that I
may come to the parts thereof) is twofold;
our redemption or justification (for to be
redeemed is to have our sins remitted, <hi>Ephes.
1. 7. Col.</hi> 1. 14. and to have our sins remitted is
to be justified) and the fruit or end of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
which is our sanctification, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in the faithful, sincere, and constant
service of God in holyness and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>Of these I am to speak, First, joyntly of
both together; and then of either of them
severally. In the ioynt consideration, we are
to observe both the order and coniunction
of them. The order is plainly expressed by
the Participle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>that being delivered
from the hand of our enemies we should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him &amp;c.</hi> For the meaning of the holy
Ghost is, that God would give us, both that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65398:24"/>
we should be redeemed and delivered from
the hand of our enemies; and also that we
should worship him; But to note the order,
he hath expressed the former part, which is
the benefit of redemption, by the Participle,
<hi>that being delivered from the hand of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
we should worship him, &amp;c.</hi> which
teacheth us, that before we can worship
God aright, we must be delivered from the
bondage of our spiritual enemies, and that
for two reasons. For first, naturally we are
the servants of sin, and of <hi>Sathan.</hi> Being
servants of sin, we are in two respects utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disabied from serving God, until we be
delivered out of this bondage, for first, <hi>being
servants of sin, we are fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from our first parents; being a privation of
all spiritual goodness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. not only
in respect of the act, but also in respect of
the habite and power (as blindness is of

is good; but also we are not able thereunto,
<hi>Of our selves we cannot so much as think a

wel, that <hi>Adam</hi> by his sin wholy lost the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of thinking those things which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to God, and also of willing that which
is good, and much more of doing that which
is good: for wil may be present when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
is wanting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. But it is
God that worketh in us both to wil, and to
do, <hi>Phil</hi> 2. 13. Insomuch that the faithfull

thing that is good, may truly say every of
them, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 10. not I, but the grace of
God which is with me.</hi> For <hi>the carnal mind,</hi>
or the disposition of our corrupt nature is
<hi>not subject to the Law of God, neither can it
be,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. <hi>Augustine</hi> truly faith, that
man by his fall lost <hi>bonum passibilitatis,</hi> and
our Saviour professeth, that without him, or
not being in him, <hi>we can do nothing.</hi> John 15.
5. Doth not the holy Ghost elsewhere teach
the same, when he affirmeth tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally

sometimes, <hi>regeneration,</hi> whereby, we being

which we are made new creatures created

was a motion from nothing to those things
which are; so the new (<note n="x" place="bottom">Chrysost. in Eph. 2. 10. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> &amp;c.</note>) creation is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from our not being of grace, and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

notably to confu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, being servants of sin, sin raigneth
in us, as a Iyrant, without resistance, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

it imposeth a necessity of sinning, so that by
nature, as we do no good, neither can we

do we nothing but sin, neither can we do any

of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. So much of the order.</p>

               </gap>nce
of these two graces. For when the
Lord sweareth, that to those whom
he redeemeth and justifieth, he wil give
grace to worship him in holyness and
righteousness; from hence we do necessarily
collect, that sanctification is an unsepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
companion of justification; and that no
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65398:27"/>
man can have assurance, that he is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unless he be in some measure sanctified.
Let no man therefore deceive himself with a

2. 14. for unlesse thou doest, at the least, desire
and endevour to worship God in holnesse
and righteousnesse; it is as certain, as the oath
of the Lord is true, that as yet thou art not
justified, nor actually made partaker of the
redemption wrought by Christ. It is true that
our Saviour Christ in the dayes of his flesh,
did redeem us meritoriously, paying a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
sufficient for all that should beleeve in
him: but none are actually made partakers of
this Redemption, but they to whom it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed;
and it is applyed only to those that
truly believe, and true faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> purifieth the

               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:65398:28"/>
faith, as all those are which truly believe in
him, in them Christ dwelleth by his Spirit
(for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. they are not his, who have not
his Spirit) applying unto them not only the
merit of his death, to their redemption, and
the benefit of his resurrection to their justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. but also the vertue and
efficacie of his death to mortifie their sinnes,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. and of his resurrection to raise
them to newnesse of life; so that for whose
sinnes Christ died, they die to their sinne;
and for whose justification he arose, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
rise to newnesse of life. The Apostle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. 4. affirmeth, that those who have
been bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zed into CHRIST, were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
into his death, and resurrection; that
as CHRIST did die and rise againe; so
they also die to sinne, and rise to a newnesse
of life.</p>
            <p>2. CHRIST was given unto us by
his Father, not only to be our justification,
and redemption; but also our <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Neither did hee come
with blood alone, or with water alone;
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 6. But as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Gospell
carefully observeth, as a thing most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 34, 35. He came both with
water and with blood, with the blood of
redemption, to expiate the guilt of our sins,
and with the water of ablution, or sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65398:28"/>
to cleanse us from the corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 6. And in respect of both, his
blood doth cleanse us from all our sins, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi>
1. 7. from the guilt, perfectly, in our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
from the corruption, in part, and
by degrees in our sanctification. See <hi>Hebr.</hi>
9. 14.</p>
            <p>3. Whosoever are the sons of God by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
as all those are, <hi>Io.</hi> 1. 12, 13. that truly
believe, they also are his sons by regeneration.</p>
            <p>4. The same is implied in the benefit of
Redemption, whereby Christ our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
doth not only redeem us from the guilt
of sin, which bindeth men over to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but also from the bondage of sinne, that
howsoever sinne doth <hi>remaine</hi> in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet it shall not <hi>reigne</hi> in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.
14. nor have dominion over them. For they
that practise sinne, are the servants of sinne,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 34. and of Satan, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. in them
sin reigneth; and therefore they are not by
Christ redeemed from the bondage of sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>For whom the Sonne maketh free, they are
free indeed, Ioh.</hi> 8. 36.</p>
            <p>5. The same is proved by the nature and
property of a true faith. For faith is a grace of
regeneration, which the Spirit of God, when
he doth regenerate us, ingenerateth in us:
wherby, as we are justified alone, because no
other grace doth concurre with it to the act
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65398:29"/>
of justification: So are we sanctified in part,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>gether with other graces; and therefore is
never severed from the grace of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or from other sanctifying and saving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>,
and further it is the property of faith, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
justified us, inwardly to purifie the heart
<hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. and outwardly to work by love,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. Therfore, though to the act of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
neither outward obedience, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
graces do concur with faith, as any
cause thereof: Yet in the subject, that is, in
the party justified; they must, and do concur,
as necessary fruits of a true and lively faith,
without which it is dead, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 20. And
therefore a true, lively, justifying faith, is also
a sanctifying faith.</p>
            <p>Now, both from the order, and conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these graces, we may infer a singular
consolation to all the true<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Children of God.
For if there be such a conjunction between
these two graces of justification and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that whosoever hath the one, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the other, and who hath not both hath
neither: then it followeth necessarily, that, as
he that is justified, is also sanctified; So he
that is sanctified, is also justified; and if the
order between them be such, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serve God in the duties of sanctification,
untill he be justified, nor cannot worship
God aright, untill he be redeemed from his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65398:29"/>

               </gap>,
that they who are in any true measure
sanctified, are also justified; that they who
sincerely desire, and endevour to walk in the
obedience of Gods holy will, making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of their wayes, are redeemed from
the hand of their spirituall enemies. And not
only may we from our sanctification come
to the certain knowledge of our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but also we may thereby make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and our election sure. For dost thou,
professing the true faith, endevour to keep a
good conscience, and to walk uprightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; then it is certain, that thou art justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by a true faith; art thou justified? then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

is certain, that thou art effectually called: art

ought to be the end of controversie, much
more ought the Oath of God in this place
end this controversie concerning universall
redemption. For God hath sworn, that to
so many as he redeemeth, he wil give them
to worship him in holsness and righteousness,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65398:31"/>
But the greater part of mankind have never
the grace to worship God in holyness and
righteousness, and therefore to them the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of redemption doth not belong.</p>
            <p>Now, when <hi>we</hi> do profess our selves to
be the redeemed of the Lord, we do withall
confess, that in our selves we are bondmen,
and servants, whom Christ came to redeem
out of this bondage. But howsoever all will
challenge to themselves the benefit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
yet how few, in comparison, do
acknowledg their bondage? But like the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
<hi>Iews,</hi> when our Saviour promised
them liberty, profess, that they never were
in servitude, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 33. and so bewray
themselves not to be redeemed. But this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conceipt of our selves before our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is necessary for us, if either we would
seek to Christ, or have him to respect us. For
if by nature we be not in bondage, what
need we a redeemer? If not lost, what need
we a Saviour? <hi>Mat. 9. 12. The whole need
not the Physitian, but they that are sick,
Christ came not to call the righteous but
sinners to repentauce,</hi> Mat. 9. 13. to preach
redemption to the Captives, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.
and to save that which was lost. He was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto us of his Father, to be our wisdom,
our lustification, our redemption, our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
our life our salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. If
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65398:32"/>
therefore we would be made partakers of
these benefits, we must acknowledg our
selves to be fools in spiritual things, that in
him we may become wise; guilty of. death &amp;
damnation, that in and by him we may be
absolved and justified: defiled and polluted
with sin, that by him we may be sanctified:
dead in sin, that in him we may be quickned
and revived: lost, that in him we may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
captives and bondmen, that by him we
may be redeemed.</p>
            <p>2. As touching the party by whom we
are redeemed; the text saith; <hi>he</hi> would give
us that we should be redeemed: which, in the
beginning of this Psalm is more plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed:
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
who hath visited and redeemed his people,
or as the words are, <hi>hath wrought redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his people.</hi> How? By <hi>raising an horn of

who according to the flesh was the Son of

by giving his son for us: the <hi>son</hi> redeemeth
us, by giving himself to be a price of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

which is the grace wrought by Christ, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from

applied unto us by the communion of the
holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Now here are divers things to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
1. The infinite and unspeakable love of
God the father, in giving his only begotten
Son, and of God the Son in giving himself for
us; and of God the holy Ghost the spirit of
grace, in communicating unto us the mercy
and love of God, and the merit and vertue
of all that Christ did or su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ered for us.</p>
            <p>For the first, <hi>herein is love,</hi> saith the beloved
Apostle, <hi>not that we loved God, but that
he loved us, and sent his Sonne to be the
propitiation for our sinnes.</hi> 1 John 4. 10. <hi>So
God loved the world, so</hi> infinitely, <hi>so</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably,
<hi>so</hi> beyond all comparison, <hi>that
he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
believeth in him should not perish, but
have everlasting life.</hi> Ioh. 3. 16. And again,
<hi>Ro. 8. 32. that he spared not his own son, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him up for us al.</hi> But her in especialy <hi>god
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65398:33"/>
mendeth his love towards us, that whilest
we were</hi> sinners, and by sin enemies, <hi>Christ
died for us,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. 10.</p>
            <p>If this love of God be shed abroad in our
hearts by his holy spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. that is,
if by the Holy Ghost working in us faith, we
are truly perswaded and assured of it, these
effects wil follow, 1. that we shal love God
again, the beams of his love inflaming our
hearts, and reflecting back some heat of
love. For therefore do we love God, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loved us first,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 19. <hi>Magnes
amor is amor:</hi> Love is the loadstone of love.
The woman in the Gospel, who had many
sins remitted, did therefore love much. <hi>Luk.</hi>
7. 47. If it be demanded, why, and how we
should love God, I answer with <hi>Bernard,
Lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de dilig. Deum, initio. Causa diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
Deum Deus est; modus, sine modo diligere.</hi>
God is good without measure, and without
measure he hath loved us, therefore without
measure, if it were possible, we ought to love
him. But though we cannot do so, yet we
ought to love him with all our heart, with
all our soul, and with all our might. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.
5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37. Or if we cannot do so by
reason of the flesh, yet at the least with an
upright soul, and a sincere heart, to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of our power. And this our love we
must express by keeping his commandements,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65398:33"/>
               <hi>Ioh. 14. 15. Exod.</hi> 20. 6. and that willingly.
<hi>For this,</hi> saith Saint John, <hi>is the love of
God,</hi> 1 Ioh. chap. 5. ver. 3. <hi>that we keep his
Commandments, and his Commandements
are not grievous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We shal love our neighbour for the
Lords sake, it is the use which S. Iohn make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
in the place even now cited, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 10. 11.
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but
that he loved us, and sent his son to be the
pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pitiation for our sins. <hi>Beloved</hi> (saith he)
<hi>if God so loved us, we ought also to love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The perswasion of this love of God
affordeth unto us singular comfort, in divers
respects. As first in afflictions. For therefore
do we glory in afflictions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5.
knowing that tribulation worketh patience,
and patience experience, and experience
hope, and hope maketh not ashamed,
because <hi>the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the holy Ghost which is given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
us:</hi> that is, because by faith wrought
in us by the holy Ghost, we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the love of God in Christ,
which love God commendeth towards
us, in that, when we were sinners, Christ
died for us.</p>
            <p>The second comfort. If God did so love us,
when we were his enemies; much more
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65398:34"/>
when by Christ we are become his friends. <hi>For
if when we were enemies, we were reconciled
unto God by the death of his Son, much more
being reconciled we shal be saved by his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third comfort. If God so loved us,</hi>
that he spared not his own Son, but delivered
him up for us all, how shal he not then with
him also freely give us all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
32. all things that be expedient for us.</p>
            <p>2. The love also of God the Son <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all knowledg,</hi> Ephes. 3. 19. who so <hi>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed
the Church, that he gave himself for it,</hi> Eph.
5. 25. <hi>who so loved us, that he washed us from
our sins in his own blood,</hi> Apoc. 1. 5. <hi>Greater
love hath no man then this, that a man lay
down his life for. his friends.</hi> Iohn 15. 13.
But Christ our sweet Saviour, being not only
man, but God also, gave himself not for his
friends but for his enemies; and that, not to a
commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and ordinary death, but to the most
painful, most shameful, and most accursed
death of the Cross; and not only to fuffer
a corporall death, but also in his soul,
to undergo the wrath of God in our
steed; the fear whereof, when he was
in that grievous agony, caused him to
sweat great dropps of blood, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.
44. and the sence thereof on the Cross,
being in his own sence as a man forsaken of
God, made him cry out. <hi>My God, my God,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65398:34"/>
why hast thou for saken me?</hi> Mat. 27. 46.</p>
            <p>The acknowledgment of this wonderful
love of Christ, ought first to work in us a
love in some measure answerable to his; that
as he gave himself for us an offering and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to God for a sweet smelling savour,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. so we should present our bodies a
living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto
him, which is our reasonable service, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.
1. And as he gave himself for us, so should we
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>willing and ready, if occasion serve, to lay
down our lives for him, the rather because
he hath promised, that whosoever shal lose
his life for his sake and the Gospels, shal save
it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 35. We owe our selves unto Christ
in a double or treble respect: first, for that in
our creation he gave us to our selves: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because in our redemption, when we were
lost, he restored us to our selves: thirdly, when
in restoring us, he gave himself for us. For
our selves given and restored, we may and
ought to give and render our selves; but
what retribution shal we make him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
For though we should give and render
our selves to him, or for him a thousand times
yet what are we to him? As <hi>Bernard</hi> sweetly
argueth. <hi>Lib. de delig. Deo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we are to imitate our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
as the Apostle exhorteth us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of his love, shewing it self in his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65398:35"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:65398:35"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65398:36"/>
wonderful humiliation and obedience for us.
<hi>Phil. 2. 5. Let the same mind be in you, which
was in Christ Iesus,</hi> who being God coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
with his Father, for our sakes abased
himselfe to become man: and being man,
humbled himself, not only to all active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
performing all righteousness, as
being made subject to the Law for us; but
also to the passive obedience, being obedient
to death, even the death of the Crosse; and
all this for us men, and for our salvation.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard the love of the Father,
in giving his Son, and the love of the Son in
giving himself for us; whereunto we may
add the love both of the Father and the Son,
in sending the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of love
to accompl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh our redemption, and also of
the Holy Ghost, who furnisheth with his
graces, and furnished, sendeth forth the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
and Ministers of God, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
unto them the meanes of our salvation;
in and by which, hee having united us to
Christ, and made us partakers of him, he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
effectually in the hearts of Gods chosen,
all those saving and sanctifying graces, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are not only enti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led unto Gods
Kingdome, but also fitted and prepared for
the same.</p>
            <p>But as in the work of our Redemption
we have observ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> love of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65398:36"/>
God: so in the second place we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his infinite justice manifested in the
same. For such is the justice of God, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then he would suffer the sins of his own
elect children to go unpunished, he hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
them in the death of his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son. The consideration whereof ought
to strike a terror in them that do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
nor repent. For if God punished the
sins of the faithful in Christ, what shal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of them, who have no part in Christ?
Undoubtedly every sin, as it deserveth death,
so is it punished with death; either with
the death of Christ in the behalf of them that
believe, or with the death of the parties
themselves, who are not in Christ. And as it
ministreth terror to the wicked; so it affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
singular comfort to the faithful, who
are in Christ. For they may from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this justice of God, safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude;
that to them, being in Christ, there
is not only no condemnation, but not so
much as any punishments so properly called,
which in order of justice is inflicted by way
of vengeance to satisfie the justice of God.
For Christ having fully satisfied the justice
of his Father in the behalf of all them that
believe; it cannot stand with the justice of
God to punish the same sins in the party,
which he hath already punished in Christ. The
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65398:37"/>
children of God are indeed subject to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
afflictions, which are <hi>mala poenae,</hi> but
unto them the nature of them is changed, so
that they be not punishments to them, but
either fatherly chastisements, <hi>(for when we
are judged,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32. that is, afflicted for
our sins, <hi>we are chastised of the Lord, that
we should not be condemned with the world)</hi>
or else trials for their good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we observe how heynous, and
how detestable our sins are in the sight of
God: the guilt whereof could not be expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
nor the justice of God satisfied, nor his
wrath for them appeased, by any other
means, but by the most precious blood of
the eternal Son of God. That both in respect
of our sins past we should be touched with
remorse, when we consider that by our sins
we nayled our Saviour to the Cross, (to
which end we are to pray, that the Lord
would pour upon us the <hi>spirit of grace and
supplication,</hi> that when we look upon him,
whom we have pierced, we might lament
and mourn, as a father mourneth for his only
son:) and also in respect of the time to come,
we should not be animated to commit any
sin, as being smal; seeing there is none so
smal, but the price of it was the precious
blood of Christ: none so light, but that if we
be not eased from the burthen of it, by the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65398:37"/>
merits of Christ, it is of sufficient weight to
presse us down to hell.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be considered in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Redemption, are the enemies from
whom we are delivered; which are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
as the Jews imagine, dreaming that their
<hi>Messias</hi> should be a temporal Monarch, who
having subdued their enemies, which held
them in subjection, should restore the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to <hi>Israel,</hi> but spirituall. And these are
the <hi>Law, sin, death,</hi> and the <hi>devill;</hi> the <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
being the strength of sinne, <hi>sinne</hi> the sting of
death, and <hi>death</hi> the power of the devil; from
the hand, that is, from the power of all which
our Saviour Christ hath delivered us.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded, why among the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
I do not reckon the world. I answer, if
by World, be meant worldly desires, as 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi>
2. 15, 16. they are comprehended under the
title of sin: if wicked worldlings, they are but
the feed of the Serpent, and the instruments
of the Devill. And in both senses, not only
our Saviour hath overcome the world for us,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 33. but the faithfull also in and by
him, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 4. and 5. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>The Law by reason of our transgression is
an enemy unto us; whether we consider the
yoke of the Ceremonial Law, or the bondage
wherein the Morall Law did hold us, From
the yoke of the Ceremonial Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

which neither we nor our Fathers were able
to bear, our Saviour Christ delivered us, blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out, or <hi>cancelling the hand-writing of

contrary to us, and took it out of the way,

            <p>And as touching the morall law, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
hath delivered us, first from the <hi>curse</hi> of

7. 8. 13. But when we being adopted in
Christ, are also regenerated by the Spirit,
and so made dead to sinne; we are morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the Law, and the Law to us, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of this irritation accidentally caused by
our corruption, alwayes prone to that which
is forbidden: and consequently are delivered
from the bondage of the Law, as of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we are by Christ freed from
<hi>death,</hi> both from the first death, as it is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and from the second. For as of all
other afflictions, so of death the nature is
changed in respect of the faithfull, to whom
it is not a punishment or curse, the sting of it
(which is sin) being taken away; but rather a
blessing; no losse, but advantage, because to
them it is the end of sin, and consequently of
all misery, the beginning of happiness, a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from the vale of tears to the kingdom of
glory, the end of a mortall life, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a life immortall.</p>

delivered us <hi>from the wrath that is to come,

of God, yet it shall no more reigne in
them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
            <p>The use of this doctrine concerning our
redemption, is:</p>
            <p>First, seeing Christ our Saviour hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us from our enemies, that therefore
we should not stand in fear of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that, <hi>Esay 43. 1. Fear not, for I have
redeemed thee.</hi> But as we are taught in the
next words, we should all the dayes of our
life worship him <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> fear:</hi> and in the end
of our dayes commend our soules into the
hand of God, saying with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 31. 6.
<hi>Into thy hands I commend my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for thou
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65398:40"/>
hast redeemed me Lord God of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. When we have sinned against God, the
remembrance of our redemption should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
us to return unto him by unfained
repentance, as himself exhorteth, <hi>Esay</hi> 44 22.
These things, saith Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> I write unto
you, that you sin not; but if any man do sin,
we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for our sins, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>3. Seeing our Saviour hath redeemed and
bought us with so great a price, therefore we
ought to acknowledg him to be our Lord
in the right of Redemption, and our selves
not to be our own men, but his servants. <hi>For
therefore Christ died and rose again to life,
that he might be the Lord both of the quick
and of the dead, Rom.</hi> 14. 9. And if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
him to be our Lord, we must be
carefull to do his will, otherwise in vaine do
we call him so: <hi>Why do you call me Lord, and
do not the things that I command you?</hi> Luke
6. 46. Not every one that saith <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi>
shal enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he
that doth the will of my Father which is in
heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. Again, being bought with
a price, we are not our own men, but his that
bought us: and therefore ought not to seek
our selves, or the satisfying of our own lusts;
<hi>but to glorifie God both in our bodies and in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65398:41"/>
our spirit, which are not ours but Gods,
1 Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. That body is not thine to
spend in sin, but is to be offered unto God, as
an holy and acceptable sacrifice. That tongue
is not thine own, as the wicked say of theirs,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 4. to use, or rather abuse at thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but to be used to the glory of God. That
heart is not thine to be addicted to worldly
vanities, but to be given to God. In a word.
<hi>Christ died for al, that they which live should
not henceforth live to themselves, but unto
him which died for them, and rose again,
2 Cor.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>4. Seeing Christ hath given himself for us to
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee us from our enemies, <hi>let us stand fast in
that liberty which Christ,</hi> at so de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r a price,
purchased for us; <hi>and not suffer our selves to
be entangled again with the yoke of bondage,
Gal.</hi> 5. 1. For what can be, either more disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
to out Redeemer, then that we should
revolt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to serve sin &amp; Satan, or more
pernicious to our selves; for then our latter
end should be worse then our beginning,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. Remember the Israelites, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
redeemed out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for desiring to
return, perished in the wilderness. <hi>Remember
Lots wife,</hi> Luk. 17. 32. who, being delivered
out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> for looking back, was turned
into a pillar of salt. The which I speak not as
though I thought, that a man who is once
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65398:41"/>
truly justified &amp; redeemed, can either totally
or finally fall away from saving grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to
admonish those, who think they stand, to take
heed they do not fall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. For if any
professing himself to be redeemed, shall fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
his example will not prove, that a man
may fall from saving grace: but his falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
will evidently prove, that he was never
in the state of grace, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

we shall abuse this great benefit of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if we have not respect to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
which is our sanctification. For else what
can be the cause of such dissolute living, as is
every where to be seen among those who
professe themselves redeemed by Christ, but
a foolish opinion, that Christ having freed
them from their sins, they may sin the more
freely, and that he having dyed for their sins,
they need not to die to them, and so abuse
the <hi>grace of God unto wantonnesse, Iude</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>For if our sanctification be the end of our

of God, if we do not refer it to this end:
yea rather, we deceive and abuse our selves
with a vain opinion of our redemption. For if
this be the end of our redemption, then those
that live in sin, as the servants of sin, either are
not redeemed (for whom Christ the Son ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
free, they are free indeed) or else they
are redeemed in vain, for that is in vain which
is frustrate of the end.</p>
            <p>Now that sanctification is the end of our
redemption, it may be proved by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of holy Scripture, and also by sound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
drawn from thence. <hi>Tit. 2. 14. Christ
hath given himself for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem

            <p>The reason is evident. For that which is
the end of all Gods blessings in this life, both
spiritual and temporal, must needs be the end
of our Redemption. But our sanctification is
the end of all Gods blessings in this life,

               </gap>
the Lord. And it was wel said of <hi>Bernard,
Licet aliquid diligere preter Deum, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for what any thing is, that is much
more. Therefore if we love our brother for
Gods sake, then do we love God much more.</p>
            <p>Here therefore two sorts of men are to be
reproved. The former is of those, who would
seem to be forward professors of religion and
piety towards God, that are very backward
in the duties of charity and righteousness to
their brethren: Such were the Pharisies, whom
our Saviour called hypocrites, bidding us to
beware of the leaven of the Pharisies, which
is hypocrisie; For, saith he, <hi>unless your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse

            <p>These man are wont to discover their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
partly by their words, and partly by
their works. By their words, being evil speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
detracters &amp; depravers of their brethren:

must also, and that principally be carefull to
worship him in holinesse. And this is to be
understood of civill callings. But as touching
the Ministers of Gods word, this may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be added for their comfort, that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them as with good conscience take
pains in their function, whether in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
studies, or in their publique ministery,
seeking to glorifie God in the edification of
the Church, or the members thereof; they do
worship God both in holinesse and in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</p>
            <p>By this which hath been said it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
that howsoever we are freed from
the curse, the rigor, the terror, &amp; irritation of
the Law; yet we are not freed from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the Law Morall. For freedom from
obedience and righteousnesse, is the servitude
of sin. But we are freed from the bondage of
sin, that we may be enabled with upright
hearts &amp; willing minds to worship the Lord
in holiness and rigteousness. And therefore,
howsoever carnall gospellers and Libertines,

it self. But this needeth no answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
being evident to all the world, that we do
urge the obedience of the Law Morall as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
as they do, and by better arguments and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
then they do. For their chief reasons are
taken from the fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly supposed benefits of
good works, that they satisfie for sin, justifie
before God, and merit eternall life. But by
these reasons they teach men to marre good
works, and not to do them; for a good work
done with the opinion of satisfaction, justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or merit, is so far from being a good
work, that it is odious and abominable in the
fight of God; as being derogatory to the most
perfect satisfaction, and all-sufficient merit of
Christ our Saviour.</p>
            <p>But we among other arguments, take some
from this text: Because our new obedience or
practise of good workes is the fruit and
end of our redemption. 2. Because it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
companion of our redemption and
justification. 3. Because God hath sworn
that he will give to them that are redeemed,
grace to worship him in holiness and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and therfore, that works in them that
are redeemed or justified, do follow nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
by necessity of infallibility. And therfore
it is impossible, the oath of the Lord being

a man should be actually redeemed or justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and yet have no care to practise good
works, that is to say, to perform the duties of

either of the evill of <hi>punishment,</hi> or of the

the spirit of fearfulness, 2 Tim. 1. 7. is a fruit

those that are under it to yeeld some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

to offend so gracious a God, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

they shall worship him without all servi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fear; seeing that it is profitable, that men
should be restrained from sinne by feare
of punishment. And to that end doth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65398:54"/>
the Lord threaten judgements and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to terrifie and to deterre men from
sinne.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, as I delivered before in
the doctrine of redemption, that our Saviour
in delivering us from the terrour and coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Law, doth free us also from ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
fear, but we are to consider <hi>quatenus,</hi>
how far forth. For such as is our redemption
(I speak of it passively, as it is in the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
such is our freedom from servile fear;
to wit, inchoated or begun in this life, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
by degrees; compleat, and perfect in
the life to come, which is called our full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
which being not totall in this life,
doth not free us totally from this servile fear.
Full and perfect charity indeed casteth out
this fear, and he that thus <hi>feareth, is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in charity, 1 Ioh.</hi> 4. 18. But whiles the
reliques of sin, or rather the <hi>body of sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth</hi>

            <p>And therefore so far forth, as we are flesh,
we are subject to servile fear: yea, so far as
we are carnall, we are servants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. 23.
but so far forth as we are spirit, we are freed
from that fear, as not being under the Law,
but under grace: Yet because concupiscence
and the corruptions of the flesh, still abide in
us; it was expedient for the subduing and

               </gap>ur
justification to our glorification, as our faith,
hope and charity do encrease, by encrease
whereof we are more and more enabled to
worship God, as without fear, so also with
willing and cheerfull minds. And therefore
we are to be stirred up to labour for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of these graces in us, that our fear may
be diminished, and our assurance encreased;
wherein our happiness in this life doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>
            <p>Security likewise is two-fold,
<list>
                  <item>Carnall.</item>
                  <item>Spirituall.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The carnall security is, when a man being
void of grace, and of the true fear of God,
and destitute of faith, hope and charity, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on carelesly in his sinnes without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
presuming of Gods favour, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:65398:55"/>
The spirituall security, as I distinguished
before, is either of the object, signifying the
spiritual safety of the faithful, because there is
no condemnation to them that be in Christ.
In regard wherof, they worship God secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or without fear, that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
without danger, or cause of fear. The
spirituall security, in respect of the subject, is,
when a man being justified before God by
faith, and assured in some measure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
as knowing himself to have received
grace to believe, and having peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

of everlasting life. And of this <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
or spirituall security, the Holy Ghost speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in this place.</p>
            <p>The summe of that which hath been said by
way of exposition, is this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that God hath
promised to give the faithful, being redeemed
by Christ, to worship him without fear, not
without the true fear of God (for that is a
chief part of his worship) but without fear
of their spiritual enemies; and namely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear of damnation: and that in two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
so that they may worship him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear, that is, without cause of fear, secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and safely without danger, because their
salvation is certain and sure, there being no

            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:65398:55"/>
Secondly, without fear it self, namely, of
their enemies, from whose power they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
themselves to be redeemed, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
from the servile fear of God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
a worship unto him, not of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaves
(who are under the dominion of the
Law) forced and extorted from them by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
fear, but the service of sons yeelding vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
obedience. Not that we are delivered,
from servile fear altogether, and at once, in
this life, but by degrees, according to the
measure of our faith, hope, and charity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we being indued in some good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
shall worship the Lord securely, or in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
not carnall, but spirituall, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not in fear of damnation, but in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of everlasting happiness.</p>
            <p>Now this being the principall point in this
whole text, and the chief thing wherein the
happiness promised in Christ, the promised
seed, doth consist in this life; <hi>viz. to worship
the Lord without fear:</hi> Therefore as I have
stood the longer in explaining the words; so I
will endevour to set down the doctrines and
uses, which are to be made of this point.</p>

to have no truth nor power of religion in

graces do proceed, as hath been said. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,

            <p>This work of humiliation, the Holy Ghost
ordinarily worketh in Gods children by the
ministery of the Law, whereby he revealeth
unto us our miserable estate in our selves, in
respect both of our sinnes, (<hi>for by the Law

and also of the punishment, denouncing the
fearfull plagues of God for sinne, both in this
life, and in the world to come. Thus when

them, but the death and sufferings of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

to humble us before God; how much more
ought we to be humbled at the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both of the temporall plagues denounced
in this world, and also of eternall torments
in hell?</p>
            <p>But when these ordinary means of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
by the ministery of the Law, will not
prevaile; it pleaseth God sometimes, by means
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65398:62"/>
extraordinary, or at the least, not so ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to draw men unto him, as it were, by a
strong hand, adding to the Ministery of the
Word, sometimes afflictions and crosses, and,
sometimes terrors and anguish of conscience.
By afflictions <hi>I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sophs</hi> brethren were brought

            <p>But here we must beware of an erroneous
and dangerous conceipt of some, who run
into contrary extreams. For as they imagine
none to believe, who have not full assurance;
so they think none to be humbled as they
ought, or effectually called, who are not
drawn, either by grievous afflictions, or by
the terrours of their conscience, to the brink
of despaire, as though there were no hope of
salvation for them. Indeed it is good for a
man to be much humbled in himself, and as
<hi>Iob</hi> speaketh, to <hi>abhor himself,</hi> repenting <hi>in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65398:62"/>

or forgetfulnesse of Christ, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no means whereby to be saved, or if a

their comfort, that the Lord doth sometimes
so cast down those whom he purposeth most
of all to exalt; and that they sometimes do
prove the most zealous Professours of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the worthiest instruments of Gods
glory; as you see in the example of <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For their profit they are to be advised,
that when they are afflicted either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
or inwardly, they would first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the hand of God, by what
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65398:63"/>
means soever the affliction doth happen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and not to seek to remove the hand
of God afflicting them; if outwardly, by
indirect or unlawfull means; if inwardly, by
worldly and carnal delights; but to labour,
that the end which God propoundeth in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
them, may be atchieved. 2. That they
would humble themselves under the mighty
hand of God, whom they have provoked to
anger against them; labouring to call to mind
their sins, whereby they have offended God;
to confess them particularly, to bewaile them,
and to be sorry for them, because by them
they have displeased God, and pierced our
Saviour: earnestly and heartily to pray to
God for the remission of their sins, for Christ
his sake; to promise, purpose, and vow amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the time to come. Thus <hi>confessing
their sins, and forsaking them, they shall be
sure to find mercy;</hi> and humbling themselves,
they shall be exalted, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13.</p>
            <p>But as I said, ordinarily, the Lord worketh
humiliation by the ministery of the Law.
Now, that we may be humbled thereby, we
are not only to believe the sentence of the
Law, denouncing the terrible <hi>curse</hi> of God,
against <hi>every one that doth not continue in
all the things which are written in the Book
of the Law, to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. to be true,
but also to apply it to our selves, after this
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65398:63"/>
manner; seeing this is most true, as being the
undoubted Word of God, that every man in
himself is subject to the fearful curse of God,
both in this life, and in the world to come,
who doth not perform the three degrees of
obedience contained in this sentence, that is,
to <hi>Do</hi> the things commanded, to do them <hi>all,</hi>
and to <hi>continue</hi> in doing all; therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, but that in my self, I am most
accursed; who, to the not performing of these
three degrees of obedience, have added the
three contrary degrees of disobedience. For
I have not only nor done the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
but also I have done the things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden:
I have not only not kept all Gods
Commandements, but also I have broken
them all: I have not only not continued in
perpetuall obedience, but I have also conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in a perpetual course of disobedience. O
therefore wretched man that I am, and in
my self thrice accursed! O that I were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the fearfull curse! O that I
were freed from this wofull state of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation!</p>
            <p>Thus by applying the sentence of the Law
to themselves, men come to see and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their own damnable estate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
whereby they are forced to seek for
salvation out of themselves, in Christ; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
if to the application of the sentence of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65398:64"/>
Law, they adjoyn a serious consideration of
the day of judgement (which the Apostle
calleth the <hi>terrour of the Lord.)</hi> at which
time <hi>all of us shall appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seat of God, to receive according to
those things which we have done in the flesh,</hi>
2 Cor. 5. 10, 11. But without this application,
men not seeing nor feeling their own misery,
neglect the promises of the Gospell, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to apply them to themselves: but most
ungraciously suffring the most precious blood
of Christ, as much as in them lyeth, to be spilt
in vain; as it is in vain to them, unto whom
it is not applied. But when by the paedagogie
of the Law, which is a School-master unto
Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. men are brought to see and
to feel their misery: O then how beautiful are
the feet of those who bring glad tidings of
salvation! How acceptable is the promise of
deliverance to them that are captives; of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
to them that in themselves are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed!
Of salvation, to them that are lost!
In respect of these, the Kingdom of God is
said to <hi>suffer violence,</hi> and these are they
which <hi>with violence take it to themselves,</hi>
Mat. 11. 12.</p>
            <p>Thus then being schooled by the Law, by
which the Holy Ghost worketh in us the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
faith, which is a preparative to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,
we become fit auditors of the Gosp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65398:64"/>
by which the Holy Spirit worketh in us the
grace of justifying faith. And therefore in the
next place we must be diligent and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
hearers of the Gospell, by the hearing
whereof<note n="*" place="bottom">Being pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

means, we must attend to the Gospel, <hi>Rom</hi> 10. 8. 17</note>
commeth faith. In which regard,
as the Gospell is called the <hi>Word of faith:</hi> So
also the Preachers of it are not only termed
<hi>Ministers, by whom you believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 5.
but also are said to <hi>justifie</hi> men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3.
and to <hi>save</hi> them, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 23. as
being the instruments of the Holy Ghost,
working in us the grace of faith, by which we
are justified and saved.</p>
            <p>By the<note n="*" place="bottom">By which the Holy Ghost worketh in us faith, and that in two degrees.</note> Ministery of the Gospel, the Holy
Ghost worketh in us the grace of faith in
two degrees; The former is of <hi>assent,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>application.</hi> As touching the former:
the Holy Ghost having prepared us by the
Law, doth in the ministery of the Gospell,
first, reveale unto us the mercies of God in
Christ. Secondly, he stirreth us up by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of reconciliation to embrace Gods
mercies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. 20. and to be reconciled
to him: And thirdly, having thus <hi>knocked,</hi> as
it were, at the door of our hearts, he himself
doth <hi>open</hi> out hearts, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 20. as he did
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65398:65"/>
the heart of <hi>Lydia, Act.</hi> 16. 14. not only to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
but as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> also signifieth
to <hi>assent</hi> unto, or to believe the Gospel. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it to be doubted, but that by that
phrase is meant, that the Holy Ghost did
work in her the grace of faith.</p>
            <p>And as touching the latter; the Holy
Ghost having opened our hearts to receive
Christ, by a true, willing, and lively assent
(which is the condition of the promise:) he
teacheth us to apply the promise unto our
selves, as belonging to us.</p>
            <p>Here therefore three things are to be done:
1. We are to believe in Christ by a lively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the promise of the Gospell. 2. So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in Christ, we are to apply the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Gospell to our selves. 3. Having by
application attained to some assurance, we
must give all diligence, that this assurance
may more and more be encreased.</p>
            <p>As touching the first: we must be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that our assent to the doctrine of the
Gospell, promising salvation to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ, be <hi>willing, true, lively,</hi> and
<hi>effectuall:</hi> otherwise, though we may believe
that Jesus the Son of the blessed Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
is the Son of God, and Saviour of all that
shall be saved (which not only hypocrites,
and wicked men, but the Devils themselves
after a sort believe) yet we cannot truly be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65398:65"/>
said to believe in Christ. First therefore it
must be a <hi>willing</hi> assent, and therefore <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
what we believe; not forced, as that of
the devils, and of some wicked men; who
being convicted with the evidence of the
truth, do, whether they will or no, know
and believe the truth of the Gospell, and
with horrour acknowledge it, <hi>Iam. 2. 19.
Mat.</hi> 8. 29. Secondly, it must be true, lively,
and effectuall. For as there is a two-fold
knowledge, the one literall, swimming in the
brain, informing the judgment, but not refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the heart and the conversation, serving
only to purchase the more stripes: <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 47.
the other spirituall, not only informing the
judgment, but also reforming the heart, and
conforming our lives to the practise of that
which we know (which in Divinity is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
the only true knowledge, I <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.
3, 4. for the other, though in regard of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it is true, because it is the knowledge of
the truth; yet it is not true formally, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the efficacy, or of the effect:) so faith,
which sometimes goeth under the name of
<hi>knowledge or acknowledgment,</hi> may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.
For there is a counterfeit, idle, &amp; dead
faith; which, having neither <hi>root,</hi> nor <hi>fruit,</hi> is
uneffectuall, either to justification, or to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification;
which is the faith of hypocrites,
and of all carnall and worldly Professours,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65398:66"/>
which the Papists themselves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>fidem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formem.</hi>
And there is a true, lively, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
faith, (which the School-men call <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matam,</hi>
and not amisse, saving that they hold
Charity, which, as I have showed, is a fruit
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ffect of faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. to be the form
thereof,) by which we receiving Christ, and
being rooted in him, or engraffed into him,
do receive from him spirituall life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.
For having, by faith, union with Christ, we
have also communion with him, both in his
merits to our justification, and in the vertue
of his death and resurrection, to our fanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9, 10. Now
this Assent is effectuall to justification, when
by it we receive Christ, who is our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For when this beliefe is willing,
lively, and effectuall, we do receive Christ
not only in our judgements, by this true and
lively assent; but also this lively assent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
both on the heart and the will, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him in our hearts by an earnest desire,
that he may be applied unto us, and we made
partakers of him, (which desire we expresse
in hearty prayer) and in our will, by resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to acknowledge him, to be our Saviour,
and to rest upon him for our salvation. For
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a man truly and effectually believe, that

according to the sentence of the Law,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65398:66"/>
and that in Christ, if he believe in him, he
shall be happy and blessed, according to the
doctrine of the Gospell: and not desire both
to be freed from that damnable estate, and to
be made partaker of happiness in and through
Christ? can a man truly and effectually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that being in himself accursed, he shall,
notwithstanding the curse of the Law, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the testimony of his own accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
conscience, notwithstanding the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Satan, become happy and blessed in
Christ, if he shall believe in him; and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
with himself, that, whatsoever the Law,
his own conscience, or the Devill can object
to the contrary, he will acknowledge Christ
to be his Saviour, and rest upon him for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?
For as the understanding, when it
conceiveth any thing to be true, not by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of reason, but by the authority of God
speaking in his Word, as in matters of faith,
hath the concurrence of the will, acted by
the Spirit of God, willingly to assent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
So when the understanding, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Holy Ghost, conceiveth and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any thing to be good, it commandeth
the will to embrace it, the will ordinarily
following the judgement of the practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to that which he doth believe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the Holy Ghost regenerating us, with it, and
by it worketh in us: and therefore a lively
faith is never severed from repentance, nor
repentance from it; for as we cannot tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repent, unlesse we believe; so we cannot
truly know that we believe, unlesse we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>This assent being true, willing, lively and
effectuall, as I have said, is the very <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
required in the promise of the Gospell,
and the first degree of justifying faith; which
if we have obtained, we may and ought to
apply the promise of the Gospel to our selvs.
This being a matter of excellent comfort, and
of singular use, I will prove by plain testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Scripture, and by evident reasons: the
rather, because I know, to some it will seem
a paradox.</p>
            <p>1. The testimonies of the Scripture are
these. For first, This is the saith for which our
Saviour pronunoceth <hi>Simon Peter</hi> blessed,
<hi>Thou art Christ the Son of the living God,</hi>
Mat. 16. 16, 17. The like profession is made
by the Apostles, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 69. and by <hi>Martha,
Ioh.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. These are written, that you

Faith many times goeth under the name
of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> acknowledgement, which is all

Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. By this lively assent, we receive
Christ, as hath been said, in our minds, in our
hearts, in our wils.</p>
            <p>If any man therefore object, that justifying
faith consisteth not in assent, but in applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the promises.</p>
            <p>3. I answer, that there are two degrees of
justifying faith, the one, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> assent
to the promise of the Gospell; the other a
sound application therof to our selves. By the
former, as being the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
we are justified <hi>in foro coelesti,</hi> in the
court of heaven: by the latter, in the court
of our own conscience. By the former, we are
justified before God; by the latter, we are
perswaded in our conscience, and in some
measure assured of our justification.</p>
            <p>4. By the second degree of faith, which
some call speciall faith, the promises of the
Gosp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll are to be applied. But they cannot be
applied to any aright, but only to those, who
have the condition of the promise, which is
the justifying faith.</p>
            <p>For the Gospell doth not promise justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65398:68"/>
and salvation to all, but to those only
who have a justifying faith.</p>
            <p>Therefore a man must be endued with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
faith, before he can or ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the promises of the Gospell to himself.
For as salvation is promised to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
so damnation is denounced to them
that believe not, <hi>Mar. 16. 16. Ioh.</hi> 5. 16. 18.</p>
            <p>5. It is a very erroneous opinion to think,
that we are justified, or do obtain remission
of sins, by being assured, and much more by
being fully assured of the forgiveness of our
sins: or that we are to believe, that they are
forgiven, to the end that they may be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
For justification and remission of sins is
promised only to those that believe by a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
faith; (I speak of those who are <hi>adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
and are come to the years of discretion, not
of infants, who are justified sometimes,
before they actually believe) therefore a man
must have justifying faith before he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins, <hi>for by faith we obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins,</hi> and by faith we are justified:
and therefore have we <hi>believed in Christ,
that we might be justified by the faith of
Christ</hi>) A mans sins must be forgiven, before
he can be assured that they be forgiven; and
it is absurd to imagine that the assurance that
our sinnes be forgiven, goeth before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:65398:69"/>
For if a man must believe or be assured of
the forgivenesse of sins before they be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
then he is bound to believe that which
is false. And lastly, a man must ascend by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
degrees of assurance, growing or procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from faith to faith, before he can attain
to ful assurance. And here I hold it expedient,
briefly to touch a certain discourse of the
learned <hi>Chamiers:</hi> that it may evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that they who do not acknowledge this
distinction of justifying faith, must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be forced to it. For, whereas <hi>Vasques</hi> obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
against us, that we teach, that we ought
to believe that our sins are remitted, to the
end that we may be justified, and may obtain
remission of sins: he answereth, that it is a
meer slander: For, saith he, <hi>Quid monstri
est, credere sibi remissa peccata ut remittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur?
Sic enim constituitur fides remissionis
prior reipsa ipsa remissione; quod omnem ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditatent
superat: Enimveroè si prius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missa
credimus, quam sint remissa, falsum
nos oportet credene. Quid plura? Nobis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
est p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rsuasissimum, remissa esse peccata
antequam credimus,</hi> &amp;c. It is a monster, that
a man should believe, that his sins be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to the end that they may be forgiven, for
so the faith that our sins be forgiven, should
go before the forgivenesse it self, which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth
all absurdity: Surely, if we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65398:69"/>
that our sins be forgiven before they be
remitted, then must we believe, that which
is false. What should I say more? We rather
are fully perswaded, that our sins be forgiven
before we do believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But say I, if no other justifying faith be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
but the speciall faith whereby
we are assured of the remission of our sins:
and if this also be true (which the Scripture
teacheth) that by faith we are to obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins, that absurdity will necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow, which he so much di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>claimeth.
For to hold that the sins of those who are <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulti,</hi>
or come to years of discretion, be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
before they do believe, is as great an
absurdity as the other; because by faith we
obtain remission of sins; neither is remission
promised to any, who are of years, but only
to those that believe.</p>
            <p>Of necessity therefore we must hold this
distinction of faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of justifying faith, which in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
goeth before remission of sins, by which
we obtain forgivenesse of sins, and by which
we are justified before God: and that there
is another degree of justifying faith, which
followeth after justification and remission
of sins: whereby we being perswaded, and
in some measure assured of the remission of
our sinnes, are justified in the court of our
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65398:70"/>
own conscience. And of this indeed it is true,
that our sins be forgiven, before we believe,
or be assured that they be forgiven.</p>
            <p>6. For the further clearing of this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith, let us distinctly consider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between the two degrees: for 1. By
the former, as I have said, we are justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God in the Court of Heaven, by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we are justified in the court of our own
conscience: by the former, we are justified
properly; by the latter we are assured of our
justification. 2. Of the justification, which we
have by the first degree, (which properly is
called justification) there are no degrees; but
of that which we have by the second degree,
which properly is not justification before
God, but the assurance of it in our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
there are degrees according to the
measure of our faith.</p>
            <p>3. The first degree goeth before the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sins, the second followeth after.</p>
            <p>4. Every man is bound upon pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to have the first degree of faith, which
is truly, and firmly to believe, that JESUS the
Son of the blessed Virgin, is the Eternall Son
of God, and Saviour of all that truly believe
in him; but no man ought to have the second,
who hath not the first; for a man must first
have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ustifying Faith, which is the condition
of the promise, before he ought to believe,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65398:70"/>
that the promise of remission of sins, or of
salvation belongeth to him.</p>
            <p>5. The former degree seemeth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to be the work of the Spirit regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
us, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 1. the latter of the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as it is the Spirit of adoption, sealing us
<hi>after we have believed, Ephes, 1. 13. 4. 30.
Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>6. The former is begotten ordinarily by
the ministry of the Gospell, and not by the
ministry of the Sacraments, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
were ordained of purpose, as I shall
shew hereafter, that they who have the first
degree, might attain to the second. For to him
that believeth truly, according to the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
the Sacrament is a seal of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which is by faith, and a pledge to assure
him, that so certainly as the sign, so also the
thing signified, which is Christ with all his
merits, are communicated to him.</p>
            <p>7. The former, as hereafter I wil make plain,
is <hi>fides principiorum;</hi> the latter, of conclusions
deduced from thence by application, and by
necessary consequence.</p>
            <p>8. Of the former, the four first notes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. are the signs and fruits: of the
second, the four latter. For though the Papists
make of them eight Beatitudes; yet there is
but one Beatitude in this life, whereof Christ
is the foundation, and Faith is the instrument,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65398:71"/>
whereby we receive and apply Christ unto
our selves; of which those eight are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
notes. For these <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of blessednesse, the Lord Jesus directeth
to his Disciples, and in them to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
saying, Blessed are you poor, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi>
6. 20. The foure first Beatitudes, as I said,
are the Notes of the former degree. for those
that have the first, are not at the first happy
in their own sense and apprehension, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the contrary; being poor <hi>beggars</hi> in
spirit, <hi>mourning</hi> for their wants, subdued
by the sense thereof unto <hi>meeknesse; hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring</hi>
and thirsting after righteousness, which
they find themselves to want: and yet our
Saviour pronounceth them <hi>bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssed,</hi> which
proveth that they are justified before God,
though not assured thereof in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
The foure latter are markes of the
second degree. For when we are in some
measure assured of Gods mercy towards us
we become mercifull to others for Gods
sake; when we have assurance of salvation,
we endevour to purifie our selves, as he is
pure; when being justified by faith we have
peace with God; we become peace-makers
among men. When men have obtained the
assurance of Faith, to them it is given not
only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer
for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:65398:71"/>
2. Thus much of assent, which being live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and effectuall, is the very condition of the
Evangelicall promise. Now I come to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
whereby we do attain to assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
And that we may soundly apply the
promise to our selves, we must first be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that we have the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
which is the first degree of justifying
Faith, whereof I have spoken, that is, a true,
lively, and effectuall assent; which we may
know our selves to have, if our belief be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall,
as before I said, both to justification,
as it is when by it we receive CHRIST,
who is our Righteousnesse, not only in our
judgements, but also in our hearts, and in
our willes: and also to sanctification, as
it is, when it produceth the duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>Having therefore the condition of the
promise, and knowing that thou hast it,
thou art bound in conscience, whatsoever
the Papist faith to the contrary, to apply
the promise to thy self as belongeth to thee.
Doest thou therfore truly believe that Christ
is the Saviour of all those that truly believe
in him; then thou art bound to believe that
he is thy Saviour, that he died for thy sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and rose againe for thy justification, that
by him thou hast remission of sins, and
that by him thou shalt be saved. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65398:72"/>
if thou knowest thy self to have the
condition of the promise, and wilt not apply
it to thy self; that is, if knowing thy self tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to believe, that Christ is the Saviour, thou
wilt not believe that he is thy Saviour, thou
<hi>makest God a lyar,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iohn, in not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the record which God gave of his Son.
And this is the record that God hath given
to us</hi> (that believe in Christ) <hi>eternall life, and
that this life is in his Son. He that hath the
Son</hi> (as every true believer hath) <hi>hath life;
and he that hath not the Son, hath not lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.
These things</hi> (saith he) <hi>I have written to you
that believe on the Name of the Son of God,
that you may know that you have eternall
life, and that you may believe on the Name
of the Son of God.</hi> The meaning of which
last words seemeth to be this: I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to you that believe on the Name of
Christ, by a true and lively assent, but have
not perhaps as yet attained to any sound as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance;
that you applying the promises of
the Gospell to your selves, and gathering te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
to your selves, that they belong to
you by such markes, as I in this Epistle have
set down; may attain to assurance, and so
proceed from Faith to Faith. For without
absurdity, the Words cannot be understood
of the same degree of Faith. I have written
to you that already believe in Christ, that you
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65398:72"/>
may believe in him. What? No otherwise
then already they do believe? Yes, no doubt,
that they which believed in a lower degree
without assurance, might know that they
have eternall life; and that so attaining to a
higher degree of faith, might thereby be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of salvation by Christ.</p>
            <p>Now, this application is made by a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall
Syllogisme, the proposition whereof,
(which some cal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) is the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Word of God.</p>
            <q>Whosoever truly beleeveth in Christ,
he shall be saved.</q>
            <p>The assumption is the testimony of our
own spirit, which is therefore called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <q>But I through Gods mercy do truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ.</q>
            <p>For the Holy Ghost having opened my
heart, as he did the heart of <hi>Lydia, Act.</hi> 16.
14. to assent unto, or to believe the Gospel,
I do receive Christ, not only in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by a firme, willing, and unfaned
assent, but also in mine heart by an earnest
desire to be made partaker of him, which is
the desire of application) and in my will
by a setled resolution (whatsoever the Law,
mine own conscience, or the Devill, can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the contrary) to acknowledge him to
be my Saviour, and to rest upon him for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65398:73"/>
which is the resolved purpose of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p>The conclusion which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is
the verdict or testimony of the Holy Spirit,
testifying with our spirits in the assumption,
according to the word in the proposition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore I through Gods mercy shall be
saved,</hi> which is the voice of speciall Faith.</p>
            <p>The consequence of this, and all other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
Syllogismes, is such, that the conclusion
cannot be false, if the premisses be true. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
a contradiction would be implied,
that is, contradictories would be true toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is impossible: For if this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
should be false, then either the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not true; that <hi>whosoever truly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in Christ, shall be saved:</hi> or the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>that I truly believe in Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the proposition of this Syllogisme, there
can be no doubt, it being the undoubted word
of God, and the main promise of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Against the assumption, two things may be
objected: the one, out of the doctrine of our
Divines: the other, out of the doctrine of the
Papists. For some of our Divines, define faith
to be a full assurance of the love of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the remission of our sins, and eternall
salvation by Christ, or in other words to the
like effect. But the faith mentioned in the
assumption is no such assurance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:65398:73"/>
I answer, that our Divines, defining the
speciall Faith, are not to be blamed for
defining it according to the perfection
thereof; for so every vertue and grace
ought to be defined; that so we may learne
not to content our selves with that imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
measure whereunto we have already
attayned, but may aspire towards perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
But if any shall hereupon inferre, that
no man doth truly believe, who hath not
that full assurance (as some vnadvisedly
have done) he shall give occasion to the
greatest part of believers, either to <hi>dispair,</hi>
that they have not Faith, because they have
not ful assurance, or because they woul not
be thought without Faith to <hi>presume</hi> that
they have a full assurance which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
men doe not attayne unto at the
first, nor at once, but by divers degrees,
after much practice of piety, and long
experience of Gods goodnes towards
them; and never is so fully obtained before
the end of this life, but that somewhat still
may, and ought to be added to it.</p>
            <p>The objection of the Papists against the
assumption is, that a man doth not know,
that he doth believe; and therefore not
being ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red, that he doth believe, he can
have no assurance of salvation. This is in
deed the thing which they must stand unto,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65398:74"/>
if they will deny, as they doe, the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of salvation. For if a man may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he doth truly believe, he may also
be assured that he shall be saved.</p>
            <p>But that the faithfull may know, that
they believe, I prove.</p>
            <p>1. Because every beleever is taught to
say, <hi>I beleeve in God the Father, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
in God the Sonne, <hi>I believe</hi> in
God the Holy Ghost. This profession of
Faith every true Christian is bound to make
with confidence; therefore every true
Christian is bound to know that he doth
believe. The father of the demoniack,
though indued but with a weake faith,
when our Saviour told him, that the cure
of his Sonne was possible, if he could
believe, returned this present answer, <hi>Lord
I believe, help thou my unbeliefe.</hi> Mark. 9
23. 24. The Eunuch, though a new convert,
when <hi>Philip</hi> told him he might be baptized
if he did believe with all his heart, answered
<hi>I believe that Iesus Christ is the Sonne of
God.</hi> Act. 8. 37. <hi>We believe and know that
thou art that Christ the Sonne of the living
God.</hi> John 6. 69. so John 11. 26, 27. This is

a sound and approved Christian. But for
this there is an evident proofe. 2 Cor. 13.

wehereas some Papists take acception, that

vindicateth and proveth his calling by
theirs: as we prove the truth of our Church,
and of our Ministery against our Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,

            <p>So much of the assumption.</p>
            <p>Upon these premisses necessarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the conclusion, which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
or verdict of speciall Faith, concluding the
certainty of salvation, by application of
the promises to him that hath the first
degree of faith. Which in my poore opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is a most comfortable doctrine.</p>
            <p>But against speciall Faith so proved, the
Papists still object divers things.</p>
            <p>1. That it cannot be truly termed faith,
and that for three reasons. For, 1. <hi>vere
fidei falsum sub esse non potest,</hi> the object
of true faith cannot be that which is
false, but of this, the object may be false,
because a man may be deceived in the
application.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:65398:76"/>
I answer: as there is a double know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the on of principles manifest in
themselves, called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the other, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
(not manifest in themselves, but
manifested by discourse) called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so
there is a twofold Faith, the one of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
contained in the word of God; the
other, of conclusions deduced from thence:
which conclusions though they are not
absolutely necessary, yet the premisses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true, they cannot be false. But the
premisses of this practicall syllogisme made
by a faithfull man, are true; therefore the
conclusion cannot be false. Indeed if the
syllogisme be made by an hypocrite, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
Christian, the conclusion is not
necessary; because the assumption is false,
or at the least, uncertaine: false, if he doe
not believe; uncertaine, if he doe not
know himselfe to believe; and then the
assumption at the most, is but this; but
I doe suppose that I doe believe; and the
conclusion must be answerable, therefore
I suppose that I shal be saved. But the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the faithfull and sound Christian,
who doth not onely believe. But know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himselfe to believe; as he assumeth,
I doe know, and I am sure that I doe
believe; so he concludeth, therefore I know
and am sure that I shal be saved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:65398:77"/>
2. True Faith is grounded upon the
Word, the speciall Faith that this man or
that man shall be saved, is not grounded
on the Word. <hi>ergo,</hi> it is not a true Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> Particulars are included in the
generall, <hi>&amp; quod omnibus promittitur,
singulis promittitur;</hi> therefore if it be true,
that all believers shall be saved, then it is
as true, that this or that believer shall be
saved; and this the Apostle teacheth,
Rom. 10. 9. if thou <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Because Faith mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is the Faith of assent, and not of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p>I answer, that as there are many places
which speak properly of assent, some wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I before cited; so there are many which
mention or meane the speciall Faith. As
namely all those places, which are very
many, and almost innumerable, wherein
the faithfull doe apply, and as it were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
those things which are spoken of
God * to themselves. As my God, my
Lord, my Saviour, the God of my salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp;c. (* Psal. 3. 7. 4. 1. 5. 2. 7. 1. 5. 13. 3.

22. 43. 4, 5. 51. 14. &amp;c. Hab. 3. 18. Luke 1. 47.
John 20. 28. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So Gal.</hi> 2, 20. Christ liveth in me, and
the life which I now live in the flesh, I live
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65398:77"/>
by the Faith of the Sonne of God, who loved
me, and gave himselfe for me,</p>
            <p>Likewise in those places where the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
professe their assurance of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and salvation, as Iob. 13. 18, 19. 25, 26,
27. Psal. 103. 3. who forgiveth all thine
iniquities, Psalm. 32. 5. Rom 8. 35. 38.
2 Tim. 1. 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, upon the Patrons of speciall
Faith, the Papists doe presle divers incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
and absurdities.</p>
            <p>As 1. If every man be bound to believe
in particular his owne salvation, then it
would follow that every man shal be saved;
because no man is bound to believe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth:
but the consequent is false, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
the antecedent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I have shewed before, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is bound upon paine of damnation
to have the first degree of Faith, which is
to give a firme assent to the promise of the
Gospell, assuring salvation to all those
that believe in CHRIST; but the second
degree none ought to have, but they only
who have the first; no man ought to apply
the promise of the Gospell to himselfe,
who hath not the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
unlesse he will pernieiously deceive
himselfe. For, <hi>as hee that believeth shall be
saved:</hi> so <hi>he that believeth not, shal be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:65398:78"/>
Mark. 16. 16. If thou dost truly
believe that CHRIST is the Saviour, thou
art bound to believe, that he is thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
And so believing in CHRIST, and
receiving him both by assent, and applyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thou shalt undoubtedly be saved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second absurdity</hi>] 2. Those that
have this speciall Faith ought not to aske
the forgivenes of sinnes, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
our Saviour teacheth his owne
Apostles to aske. For they that have full
assurance of the forgivenes of all their
sinnes, ought not to aske forgivenes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they will dally with God, for nothing
desireth that which it hath.</p>
            <p>I answer. 1. that not all believers have
full assurance; some are incipients, some
proficients, some perfect or growne men
in CHRIST. Those that are incipients,
pray both that their sinnes may bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
and that they may have some assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
there of: proficients, and those that
bee growne men, pray both that their
sinnes may bee remitted; and their assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
augmented, for none are so perfect,
but that their assurance may be increased.</p>
            <p>2. As wee dayly sinne, so wee must day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ask forgivenes, prayer being the meanes
that GOD hath ordayned to that end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Yea but saith the Papist; yee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65398:78"/>
have already full assurance of the
remission of all your sinnes, not only past,
but also to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is absurd to imagine, that
sinnes be remitted before they be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and much more that we be assured they
are remitted, before they be either remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or committed; that indeed were a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to animate, and to encourage men
to sinne.</p>
            <p>But howsoever the Pope somtimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth
sinnes to come, yet God doth not;
when God justifieth a man, he giveth him
remission <hi>of sinnes past. Rom.</hi> 3. 25. As for
time to come, we teach, that although
Christ hath merited, and God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
remission of sinnes of all the faithfull
unto the end of the world: Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
remission of sinnes is not actually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,
and much-lesse by speciall faith
believed, untill men doe actually believe
and repent, and by humble and faithfull
prayer renew their faith &amp; repentance.
For as God hath promised to the faithfull
all good things; but how? Mark. 7. 7, 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>them that ask that seek that knock:</hi> so also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins. Neither is it to be doubted,
but that remission of sin, though merited
by CHRIST, though promised by GOD,
though sealed unto us in the Sacrament of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65398:79"/>
Baptisme, is obtayned by the effectuall
prayer of those that believe and repent, for
whom CHRIST hath merited it, and to
whom GOD hath promised it in his
Word, and sealed it by the Sacrament;
even as the obtayning of the raine, which
GOD hath promised, (1 Kings 18. 1. 41.)
and the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> had fore-told, is
ascribed (<hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 16. 18.) to the effectuall
prayer of <hi>Elias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The third absurdity which the
Papists put upon the doctrine of speciall
Faith, is, that by it men are animated to
commit all manner of sinne. As if it were
no matter, how many, or how great sinnes
a man doth commit, so long as he is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by speciall Faith, that all his sinnes past,
present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to come, are remitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That which they say of sinne to
come, is a malicious slander, as I noted
before; but I answere: the practice of sinne
(especially of any crime) and going on in
the same without repentance, cannot
possibly stand with the assurance of Faith.
Neither can a man be assured of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenes
of any sinne, whereof he doth not
repent: and much lesse can he be assured
before hand of the forgivenes of that sinne
which presumptaously he doth purpose to
commit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:65398:79"/>
As for the doctrine of speciall Faith,
I doe confidently professe, that there is
scarce any one doctrine in all Divinity, of
greater force and efficacy, either to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
men to well-doing, or to preserve
them from evill. For as I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the more a man is assured of GODS
love towards him in CHRIST, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
his sinnes, and giving unto him
eternall life; the more will his heart be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with love towards GOD, and
towards his neighbour for GODS sake;
the more zealous will he be of GODS
glory, the more thankfull for his mercies,
the more desirous to please, the more
fearefull to displease, the more carefull to
obey him, the more ready when he hath
offended to returne unto him &amp;c. and
therefore not without cause, <hi>chasidim.</hi> the
favourites of GOD, who have experience
and assurance of GODS speciall favour
towards them, are every, where almost
translated <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, godly.</p>
            <p>3. Having thus by application of the
promises to our selves (as having the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
thereof) attained to some measure
of assurance, we are to be carefull to use
all other meanes which GOD hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
for the confirming of this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:65398:80"/>
The first meanes is Prayer, both for
the spirit of adoption, and for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of our Faith.</p>
            <p>As touching the former: forasmuch as
speciall Faith is the work of the Holy
Ghost, shedding abroad the love of God
in our hearts; we are therefore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Lord that he would give us his
Spirit (which he hath promised to give to
those that aske him (Luke 11. 13.) the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of adoption, crying, that is, by whom
we cry in our hearts Abba Father, Gal. 4. 6.
Rom. 8. 15. testifying with our spirits that
we are the sonnes of GOD; and if sons,
then also heyers, heyers of God, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heyers
with Christ, Rom. 8. 16. 17. by whom
we are sealed to the day of our full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
who also is the earnest of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
2 Cor. 1. 22. Ephesians 13, 14.
4. 30.</p>
            <p>And as for the other: because full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is the highest degree of speciall faith,
unto which we do never so fully attaine,
but that still more and more may and
ought to be added; therefore we are to
pray continually for the increase thereof,
saying with the father of the Damoniack,
Mark. 9. 24. <hi>I believe Lord, but help thou my
unbelief</hi> and with the Apostles, Luke 17. 5.
<hi>O Lord increase our faith.</hi> For as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>

            <p>2 Unto prayer we are to adjoyne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
for our sinnes; without which
neither is our faith lively nor our prayers
effectuall, the rather, because to it, and to
the severall duties of it, as proper notes
and evidences of a true faith, the promise
of forgiveness is made; as namely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our sinnes, to contrition in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
displeased with our selves, and grieved
for them, to deprecation in craving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for them, to an unfained desire and
purpose to forsake them, and to practise
the contrary duties. Yea if a man shall as
truly desire to confesse his sinnes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
them, and to forsake them, as hee
doth desire the forgiveness of them; such
an one may undoubtedly be assured of the
remission of them. For most gracious are
the promises of God made unto penitent
sinners, as Prov. 28. 13. <hi>Whosoever confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
and forsaketh his sinnes shall have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
so Jerem. 3. 12, 13. Levit. 26. 40, 41.
Hos. 14. 1, 2, 3, 4. 2 Chron. 7. 14.</p>
            <p>More particularly, as I said, to confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
1 John 1. 9. Job 33. 27, 28. Psal. 32. 5.
Luke 15. 21.</p>
            <p>To contrition. Mat. 5. 4. Psal. 34. 18. 51.

17. Esay 57. 15. 61. 1, 2, 3. 66. 2.</p>
            <p>To humble deprecation. Zach. 12. 10.
Luke 18. 13. Hos. 4. 2.</p>
            <p>To conversion unto God, and forsaking
of sinne, Deut. 4. 30, 31. 30. 2. 10. Es. 1. 16,
17, 18. Jerem. 3. 1. 22. 18. 8. Ezech. 18. 27, 28.

3. 7.</p>
            <p>3. To prayer and repentance we must
adde the diligent and conscionable hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word, by which Faith (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.
17.) as it is at the first begotten, so it is
nourished and encreased. 1 Pet. 2. 2.</p>
            <p>4. Because Faith begotten by the Word,
consisteth at the first in assent, without
actuall application, therefore to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word is to be adjoyned the
worthy receiving of the Sacraments,
which were ordained to this very end, that
those who have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irst degree of Faith,
may proceed to the second, and go on
therein. Dost thou therefore truly believe,
that Christ is the Saviour of all those that
believe in him? the Sacrament, which thou
receivest, is a pledge unto thee, and an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that he is thy Saviour; a pledge
I say, communicated to the receivers se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally,
to assure every one that believeth
truly according to the first degree of faith,
that as certainly as he receiveth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65398:81"/>
so he is made partaker also of the
thing signified, which is the participation
of Christ, and all his merits to his justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and salvation.</p>
            <p>5. To these we are to adde reading,
meditation, conference, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6. The practice of piety, or leading of
a godly life making conscience of all our
wayes, and walking upright before God.
For hereby especially we are to make our
calling and our election sure, 2 Pet. 1. 10.
<hi>for hee that doth these things shall never be
removed,</hi> Ps. 15. 5. And this is confirmed by
the order and conjunction of justification
and sanctification mentioned before (pag.
37.) More specially by brotherly love,
1 Iohn 3. 14. and the fruits thereof in give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
almes, Mat. 25. 35. 1 Tim. 6. 18. 19.
and forgiving the offence of others,
Mat. 6. 14. and therefore our Saviour teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us to use this argument in our prayer
for the confirmation of our faith, Mat 6.
12. but more plainly, Luke 11. 4.</p>
            <p>So much of the first doctrine.</p>

            <head type="sub">Two other uses of this property.</head>
            <p>NOw followeth the second doctrine.
For if we be enabled to worship the
Lord without servile feare, as being freed
from the terrour and coaction of the law;
then it followeth, that we are to worship
the Lord with willing mindes, as <hi>David</hi>
exhorteth his son <hi>Solomon.</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9.
and promiseth for himselfe, Ps. 119. 32.
I will runne the way of thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
when my heart is set at liberty.
For therefore hath the Lord freed us from
the servitude of sinne, and bondage of the
law, that we might serve him with free
and willing minds. The people redeemed
by CHRIST, become a voluntary people,
psalm. 110 3. or, as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, his
peculiar people, zelous, or studious of
good workes. Tit. 2. 14.</p>
            <p>Thus the duties both of piety towards
GOD, and charity to our brethren, are
to be performed with willing mindes and
cheerfull hearts. In the duties of piety we
are to serve the Lord with gladnes. Ps. 100

            <p>We must give our selves to prayer, as

               </gap>, that is, with joy,
Phil. 1. 3. 4. we must esteeme it a blessed

            <p>We must call the Sabbath our delight,
Esay 58. 13: And we must esteeme one day
spent in the house of God as better then a

2, 3, 4. 10.</p>
            <p>The duties of charity are also cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be performed, Rom. 12 8. <hi>he that
sheweth mercy let him doe it with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>

cheerfull giver, 2 Cor. 9. 7.</p>
            <p>Finally in doing the will of God, wee
are to imitate the holy Angels, according
to our daily prayer, that we may doe the
will of God upon earth, as it is done in
heaven, that is willingly, readily, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
following also the example of all
examples, our blessed Saviour, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
it was, Psal. 40. 8. and whose meat it
was to doe the will of his heavenly father,
John 4. 34.</p>
            <p>As for that obedience, or service, which
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65398:83"/>
is extorted from men by servile feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is forced, it is but momentany; For

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tany, it is but counterfeit,
whereas true piety is constant and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
Such is the obedience and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of hypocrites: who when they are
affrighted with Gods judgements, or
afflicted with his heavie hand pretend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and promise amendment: but
when the hand of God is removed from
them, they returne to their former cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and are so farre from learning obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by that which they have suffered, or
feared, that like anviles with often strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are more and more hardned;
according to that, Esay 1. 5. <hi>why should
you be shricken any more you will adde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt.</hi>
A notable example hereof we have
in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who, as upon the inflicting of
the severall judgements, promised obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Exod. 8. 8. 25. 9. 27. 10. 16. 12. 31. so
upon the removing of the plagues, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his former obstinacy, Exod. 8.
15. 32. 9. 34. 10. 20. 14. 5. Yea in the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
themselves; who, <hi>when God slew</hi> some
of <hi>them, they sought him, and they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and enquired early after GOD, &amp;c. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheles
they did but flatter him with their
mouth, and with their tongues they lied unto
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65398:84"/>
him, for their heart was not right with him,
neither were they stedfast in his covenant,</hi>
Psal. 78, 34, 36, 37. This therefore ought
to teach men not to put off their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the time of sicknesse or old age, or
to the houre of death; lest the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which then they hope to performe,
prove counterfeit. Now, that our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may be voluntary and cheerfull, and
our service of God without servile feare,
we are to be adorned with the three Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall
Vertues, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
for according to the measure of these
three graces, in the measure of our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
security and assurance, which is the
ground of our cheerfulness. Faith; for
no man can worship the Lord with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
mind, and cheerfull heart, that is not by
Faith perswaded, that his service is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him. The perswasion of Gods love
shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that is to say, Faith, maketh us to love
him againe, and in love to serve him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly;
to whom much is forgiven, they
love much, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47. That charity wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the whole law is fulfilled, proceedeth
from Faith unfained, 2 Tim. 1. 5. and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Faith it is impossible to please God,
Heb. 11. 6. <hi>Hope,</hi> for they that have faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their anchor of hope in Heaven, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65398:84"/>
the duties of piety and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with a comfortable expectation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
happiness. The hope whereof
maketh them easily to swallow all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and troubles of this life, for the
joy that is set before them, and with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
to serve the Lord, and to finish their
course with joy, Act. 20. 24. whiles we hold
fast this hope, nothing shalbe able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage,
or to with-draw us from the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
worshippe of GOD. Not the
desires of this world, which to him that
hath this hope seeme meer vanities in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the happines hoped for. Not
the terrours or bugg-beares of this world,
which are not worthy of the glory expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
(see Rom. 5. 2. 3.) Consider the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Moses,</hi> who, when hee was <hi>come to
yeares, refused to be called the sonne of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs
daughter, choosing rather to suffer
affliction with the people of GOD, then to
enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season,
esteeming the reproach of Christ</hi> (in his
members) <hi>greater riches then the treasures
of Egypt:</hi> the reason of all which is this,
<hi>for he had respect to the recompence of reward</hi>
Heb. 11. 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity,</hi> (1 John 4. 18.) which expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
fearfulness, causeth cheerfulness. To
him that loveth, the commandments of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65398:85"/>
God <hi>are not grievous,</hi> 1 Iohn. 5. 3. nor
the yoake of CHRIST tedious. Nothing
is hard to him that loveth <hi>Iacobs</hi> 7 years of
hard service for the love of <hi>Rachel</hi> seemed
to him but a few dayes, Gen. 29. 20.</p>
            <p>The third use, is a singular comfort,
which from hence ariseth to the Faithfull.
For whereas the Lord in other places,
when he would comfort his servants, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them not to feare, as Esay 43. 1. <hi>feare
not, for I have redeemed thee,</hi> Luke. 12. 32.
<hi>feare not little flocke, for it is your Fathers
pleasure to give you a Kingdome:</hi> Here in
this covenant of grace, he promiseth, and
that by oath, that hee will give us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him without feare, or at least without
cause of feare, so Esay 54. 4. which must
needes be a singular consolation unto us,
whether we respect our condition by
nature or by grace. For by Nature we are
obnoxious to our enemies, subject to the
terrour of the law, and to the feare (<hi>Heb.</hi>
2. 15.) of death and damnation; And
though we be in the state<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of grace, yet
are we infirme and weake, not able by
our owne strength to resist our enemies;
The ground therefore of this our being
without feare, is not any confidence of
our owne strength: but first of all, the
truth of God, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18.) who by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65398:85"/>
oath hath promised that wee shall worship
him without feare.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, the power of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is able to make good his promise
2 Tim. 1. 12. 1 Pet. 1. 5.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, his fidelity, in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he is also willing to performe his oath,
1 Cor. 10. 13. 1 Thess. 5. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, his Fatherly providence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Esay 54. 17. Rom. 8. 28. and protection,
Psal. 91.</p>
            <p>5. Fiftly, CHRISTS protection of us as
our King, who having vanquished all the
enemies of our salvation, and deliveder us
out of their hand, none shalbe able to hurt
us, Esay 54. 14. 17. and much lesse to pluck
us out of his hand, Iohn 10. 28.</p>
            <p>6. Sixtly, his intercession for us, as our
Priest, Rom. 8. 34. 1 Iohn 2. 2.</p>
            <p>7. Seventhly, his union with us as our
Head, with whom our life is hid in God,
Col. 3. 3. Now as whiles the head (as they
say) is above the water, the members can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be drowned, so whiles our Head is in
glory, sitting at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
none of his members can perish; but
as himselfe hath promised, <hi>because I live,
you shall live also,</hi> Ioh. 14. 19. wherefore
we are to thinke of our selves, as of the
members of CHRIST, whom the Lord
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65398:86"/>
hath quickened together with CHRIST,
and hath raised us up together, and made
us sit together in heavenly places in
CHRIST JESUS. Eph. 2. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>8. Eightly, the testimony of the Holy
Ghost the Comfortor, who shedding
(Rom. 5. 5.) abroad the love of God in our
hearts, &amp; testifying with (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16.) our
spirits, that we are the sonnes of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
the earnest (1 Cor. 21. 5. 5.) of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
sealing us (<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. 14.) untill the
day of our full redemption, and not only
freeth us from the spirit of bondage and
of feare, as being the spirit of adoption, by
whom we cry (Gal, 4. 6.) in our hearts <hi>Abba</hi>
father; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> also worketh in us peace of
conscience, (Gal. 4. 6. Rom. 8. 15. Rom. 5.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65398:91"/>
to him that tryeth and searcheth
the heart and the reynes, setting God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before

            <p>
               <hi>Arguments to move us to integrity</hi>]
Now that we may be moved to labour for
this integrity and uprightnesse of heart, I
will use the 3. usual arguments of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<hi>viz.</hi> the excellency, the profit,
and the necessity of it as it were a triple
chaine.</p>
            <p>1. The excellency of ir is such, that first
it goeth under the name of perfection:
and those thing, which are done (though
with great weaknesse and much imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
with an <hi>upright</hi> hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, that is to say
with a sincere desire, unfained purpose, and
upright endeavour to please God, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of God as done with a <hi>perfect</hi>
heart.</p>
            <p>2. Uprightnesse is the inward beauty of
Christs spouse, in regard whereof, though
she be outwardly despicable in the eyes of
the world; yet she is glorious within, <hi>Psal.</hi>
45. 13. like to the Tabemacle, which was a
type of the Church, which though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
covered with Rammes skinnes and
Badgers skinnes <hi>Ex.</hi> 36. 19. which made
but a homely shew; was neverthelesse
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65398:92"/>
most beautifull and glorious within Or
as the spouse in the Canticles c. 1. 5. saith,
<hi>I am black but comely;</hi> black without, <hi>as
the tents of Kedar,</hi> who were <hi>scenitae</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
tents of sackcloth; comely within, as
the <hi>hangings of Solomon</hi> within his house, as
the lining thereof.</p>
            <p>3. Integrity is of all things most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God, <hi>Psal. 51. 6. Behold, thou art
delighted with truth in the inward parts, I
know also my God, that thou triest the heart,
and hast pleasure in uprightnesse,</hi> 1 Chron.
29. 17. Yea, I may say more, that to be
upright, is not only <hi>pleasing</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> but also
<hi>the pleasing</hi> of him, <hi>Prov</hi> 11. 20. the <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

to let us understand by this precedent, as
being the first mentioned in this kinde,
what accompt he maketh of uprightnes.
Now, if the Lord doe graunt them glory in
his owne kingdome, it may not be
thought, that hee will (Ps. 84. 11.) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
any thing from them that is good,</hi>
Luk. 12. 32. any good thing, I say, which
they shall aske at his hands: for the <hi>prayers
of the upright are accepted of God,</hi> Pro. 15.
8. and he <hi>is neere to all that call upon him in
truth.</hi> Ps. 145. 18. insomuch that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they doe aske they doe receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>they doe those things which are pleasing
in his sight.</hi> 1 Iohn 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>3. But if neither the golden chaine of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65398:95"/>
excellency will allure, nor the silver chaine
of profit draw us; then must the iron
chaine of necessity compell us to upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The necessity may be shewed by
these considerations.</p>
            <p>1. As with uprightnesse the smallest
graces, and the weakest meakest measure of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
are accepted with God: so without
it, the best graces which we may seeme to
have, are but counterfeit; and the best
worship that we performe without it, is
but hypocrisie. For the soundnesse of all
grace, and of all worship standeth in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse.

The like is to be said of praise and

            <p>Let us come to the ministery of the

must speak in CHRIST, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. 4.

            <p>And as in celebrating the Passeover, the

our selves as in the presence of God.
Inferiours when they are in the sight and
presence of their Superiours, are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of their behaviour. He were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious
sonne, or a lewd servant, that

and presence of his father, and of his Lord,
She were a very lewd and impudent wife,
that in the sight and presence of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

man. This is our case: God is our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we are his children, he is our Lord,
and we are his servants; he is our husband,
we are his spouse, and we alwayes are in
his sight and presence. If therefore we
could truly and effectually believe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this, (which is a most certain and
undoubted truth, and no lesse certain then
that there is a God, which of all truths is
the most certaine truth) we would abstain

Is it not because they desire to please

they feare men, more then God? or

did effectually acknowledge Gods all-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
we would learne to feare him,
and to trust in him above all; knowing
that no creature is able, either to doe us
good, unlesse God use him as his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for our good, or to hurt us, unlesse
God use him as his rodde to scourge us,
and therefore as we would feare him, and

               <p>But here it will be said, that hypocrisie

is meere hypocrisie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will hardly grant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
namely, that the sinne of hypocrisie is in

as every one of them is, who either

in his infansie is baptized, or absolved

sinne; and that there is nothing
in him that God hateth, nothing that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
can be called sinne, untill he draw
upon him the guilt of some mortall sinne.
Thus, saying that they have <hi>no sinne,</hi> they
are convinced to have no <hi>truth</hi> in them,
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 8. But we confess<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that originall
sinne, which is equally in all men by nature,
is not onely a privation of all spirituall
goodness, but also an evill disposition and
proneness to all manner of sinne; as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
pride, self-love, hardness of heart,
carnall security, hatred, uncleanness, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
ambition, lying, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,

being so many habituall sinnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in all men both regenerate and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate;
but with this difference, that
in the unregenerate they remaine in their
full strength, and for the most part with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
as the <hi>incrementa</hi> of originall sin,
unless perhaps abated or restrained by the

But in the regenerate, these corruptions
remaine onely as the reliques of originall
sinne, in some measure mortified in them,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65398:108"/>
some more, some less. All which are the

those which are less mortified.</p>
               <p>All which, like the scattered fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rebels vanquished, but not utterly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
still remaine <hi>ad agonem,</hi> to encounter
with us upon all advantages. So that in
the best of us there remaineth a spice, as
of infidelity, pride, selfe-love, hardnesse of
heart, carnall security, hatred, uncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
covetousnesse, ambition, lying, so
also of hypocrisy. But so long as a man
seeth, and detesteth this corruption, and
laboureth to mortify it, so long as he is
carefull to a voide it, and jelous over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
lest his profession or other his good
endevours bee contaminated or taynted
therewith; though there be some matter of
hypocrisie remayning in hin, yet he is not
formally an hypocrite, but is reputed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.
For as it is said both of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
themselves in generall, though partly
spirit, and partly flesh, that they are men
<hi>spirituall and regenerate,</hi> having their
denomination from the better part; and
also of their actions performed in odedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
though taynted with the flesh, that
they are <hi>good workes;</hi> so is it in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
even as a wedge of gold, in which
there is much drosse, is notwithstanding a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65398:109"/>
wedge of gold, though not of pure gold;
and as an heape of corne, wherein is store
of chaffe, is called an heape of corne,
though not of pure grayne: so the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
though some drosse of hypocrisie and
as the Prophet called it <hi>tinne,</hi> Es. 1. 25. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
in them, are notwithstanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
               <p>Therefore though hypocrisie be in all

in whom this corruption reigneth without

himselfe to be a true Christian, and
yet being a meere worldling, a carnall

professour. Of which sort, by how much
the greater is the number, for the world is
full of such; by so much the greater must
our desire and care be, that we may be
<hi>cryed,</hi> and proved, and vpon tryall found
to be sound and upright Christians. Our
desire we must expresse in prayer to God,
that we may be proved and vpon tryall
approved (for untill we be tryed we know
not our selves) saying with <hi>David.</hi> Ps. 139.
23, 24. Ps. 26. 2. <hi>search me O LORD and

me, <hi>try me and know my thoughts, and see
if there be any way of wickednesse in me, and
lead me in the way everlasting,</hi> that is, in
the way which leadeth to everlasting life.
Now GOD doth try both the upright
and the hypocrite, though in a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fferent
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65398:111"/>
manner. The upright he tryeth, both by
proving them himselfe, and that for their
good. Deut. 8. 16. and by suffering them to
be tempted by others; and that, either to
manifest his graces in them, to his owne
glory, their comfort, and good example of
others: (thus he tryed <hi>Abraham</hi> Gen. 22.
12. <hi>Iob</hi> and all the martyres:) or to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
unto them their owne weaknesse,
that they may be humbled, and be made
the more circumspect for the time to come:
And to that end, he doth not only suffer
them to be tempted unto evill, but also
sometimes (when he leaveth them for a
time unto themselves) to take a foyle.
Thus God for a time left <hi>Ezechias,</hi> to try
him, that he might <hi>know all that was in his
heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 32 31. and therefore those
who come to <hi>serve the Lord, must prepare
their soules for temptation,</hi> (Eccles. 2. 1.)
But howsoever the Lord suffereth them to
be tempted, yet he doth not <hi>lead them into
temptation;</hi> and though he permitteth
them sometimes to <hi>fall,</hi> yet he doth not
suffer them to <hi>fall away</hi> from him.</p>
               <p>The Lord also trieth the hypocrites,
that their hypocrisie may be discovered.
Therefore our Saviour adviseth his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>Luke</hi> 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisie;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65398:111"/>
and his reason is, <hi>because nothing is covered,
which shall not be discovered.</hi> And thus he
doth, not onely by suffering them to be
tempted, &amp; leaving them to themselves; but
also sometimes for a punishment of their
former wickednesse and hypocrisie, he
leadeth them into temptation, giving them
over to their own lusts, and to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Satan, not only to fall into sinne,
but also to fall away from God; which
falling away is an evident signe of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 19. wherefore as the
sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> well admonisheth, c. 1. 28.
29, 30. <hi>Come not to the Lord with a double
heart, be not an hypocrite in the sight of men,
and take good heed, what thou speakest. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
not thy selfe, lest thou fall, and bring dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
upon thy soule, and so God discover thy

in truth to the feare of the LORD, but
thy heart is full of deceipt.</hi>

the offences of the second table; so in
setting downe the fruits of the spirit, he
reckoneth up the dueties of the second
table opposed to the offences thereof for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned; and not the vertues of
the first table wherein our piety, which is
to be tryed, doth consist. For this cause
the Apostle mentioneth, not either faith in
CHRIST, or love of GOD, or hope of
salvation, or assiance in GOD or the feare
of GOD, and such like, which are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
fruits of the spirit; because these are
not the notes of tryall, but the things to be
tryed; for the tryall whereof, as namely
whether we have true faith, the true love
and feare of God, &amp;c. The Holy Ghost
commonly propoundeth such notes, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

as Ps. 15. &amp; 24. Esay 33. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>1 The fruit therefore of the spirit, <hi>is

either to the preservation of the
<hi>individuum,</hi> in the nourishing and cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the body; or to the propagation of

as it respecteth the former, is <hi>Sobriety</hi>
in meat, drink, apparell, opposed to drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennes
and bellicheere before mentioned,
and vanity in apparell, as it respecteth the
latter, it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> called <hi>Chastity,</hi> opposed to
adultery, fornication, lasciviousnesse and
all uncleannesse.</p>
               <p>And this was the first generall note of
difference, that the upright Christian doth
know, or may know, that Christ is in him,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65398:115"/>
by the fruite of the spirit: but the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
though he professeth himselfe a
Christian and consequently a member of
Christ; yet neither doth nor can knowe it,
seeing that neither he is in CHRIST
by faith, nor CHRIST in him by his
spirit.</p>
               <p>2. The second is this; The upright
man walking <hi>with God,</hi> and <hi>before God,</hi> is
desirous chiefly to approve himselfe to
God who seeth the heart, (1 Thess. 2. 4.)
and therefore is as religious (if not more)
alone and in secret, as before others, yea,
chooseth rather, according to the advise of
our Saviour, (Mat, 6. 46. 18.) to do private
duetyes in secret, rather then before
others. The hypocrite, walking as before
men, who see the outward man onely,
seeketh chiefly to approve himselfe to
men; and therefore is more religious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others, then alone; and those good
things, which he performeth he doth
them to be seene of men, Mat. 23. 5. as our
Saviour sheweth in the duties of almes
prayer and fasting, Mat. 6. 2. 5. 16. And one
the other side, those sinnes which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth,
or feareth to commit before
men, he feareth not in private to commit
before God. And in a word, if men be
not acquainted with his actions, hee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65398:115"/>
carech to doe good, nor feareth to
doe evill.</p>
               <p>3. The upright man preferreth the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his owne conscience concerning
himself, (2 Cor. 1. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 1 Cor 4. 3. Iob 31. 36)
before the opinions of other men, and
therefore laboureth to <hi>keepe his conscience
cleare towards God and towards men.</hi> The
hypocrite preferreth the opinion of others
concerning himselfe before the testimony
of his owne conscience not regarding the
verdict of his owne conscience conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him; so he may have a good reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among men commending him; not
caring though he be dead, so he may have
a name that he liveth: desiring to seeme to
be good, rather then to be so; and to be
evill rather then to seeme so; which is
extreame madnesse, seeing it is better to be
good then to seeme good; and worse to be
evill, then to seem evill.</p>

1. 15.) before the Lord. The hypocrites in
their prayer cry, but not with their heart,
Hos. 7. 14. They lift up their eyes and
their hands, but not their hearts; they
poure forth their voice, but not their souls.
Their prayer is but a lip-labour, for both
their mouth speaketh what their heart
doth not think, making a common and
perpetuall trade of praying with wandring
thoughts, (which I deny not sometime to
be incident to the upright) and also asking
with their mouth that which they doe not
desire in their heart, promising (especially
in time of af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what they doe not truly meane to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
pretending what they doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65398:122"/>
making shew of that which they are
not (as in the Lords prayer throughout)
craving that in prayer, which they doe not
seeke by any indevour of their owne, or by
use of other meanes ordained of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thanksgiving</hi>] The upright praise God
with <hi>grace, (Col.</hi> 5. 16.) that is thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in their heart, and with humility ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
their owne unworthinesse,
(<hi>Gen 32. 10. 1 Chron</hi> 29. 14.) and Gods
undeserved favour towards them. The hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
give thanks without thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
without humility; praysing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
(<hi>Luk</hi> 18. 11.) when they should
praise God, or if they doe praise him, they
doe it to this end, to praise themselves.</p>
               <p>But here it may be demanded; may not
a man praise God for his grace and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
bestowed upon him, unlesse withal he
shall seeme with the Pharisey, Luk 18. to
praise himselfe.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I answer; first, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaicall
hypocrite thanketh Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for that
which he neither hath received, nor yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
from God: which is both falshood
and arrogancy. But the upright man
thanketh God for that which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
or assuredly hopeth to receive, (as
<hi>Zachary</hi> in this hymne praiseth God for
our redemption by the promised <hi>Messias,</hi>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:65398:122"/>
before CHRIST was borne,) which to
doe is not arrogancy, but thunkfullnesse;
not falshood, but truth.</p>
               <p>2 The hypocrite thanketh God to that
end and purpose, not so much to praise
God, (to whom he is a false witnesse,)
1 Cor. 15. 15. as to praise himselfe. The
upright man in thanking God seeketh not
his owne praise, but the glory of God,
stripping himselfe of all praise, that God
alone may have all the glory. For he
thanketh God, as I said, in humility, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
his owne unworthinesse, and
the more, he extolleth the undeserved
bounty and favour of God towards him,
the more he depriveth himselfe of praise:
and on the other side, the more he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
his owne unworthinesse, the more
he magnifieth Gods goodnesse towards
him. Thus <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 32. 10. <hi>O Lord</hi>
(saith he) <hi>I am lesse then the least of thy
mercies:</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 18. <hi>Who am

                  <hi>Preaching</hi>] The upright Preacher en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth
to approve himselfe to God,

owne praise, or profit; not striving to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
themselves unto God, but to please
carnall men, which whosoever doth, he
is not the servant of Christ, Gal. 1. 10,
Herein, they grievously offend, who affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the praise of humane eloquence, feed
the people as <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> did his para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,
with painted dishes; and in steed of
drawing forth the two edged sword of the
spirit, bring forth an embroidered sheath;
professing themselves embassadours from
God, but bringing no message from God,
which concernes the people to heare,
either for the informing of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or reformation of their lives, whose
preaching serves for no other use, but to
please the itching eares of carnall men, and
to work in them a loathing of the sincere
food of Gods word.</p>
               <p>The upright preacher is carefull to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
that which he preacheth unto others,
and to avoid that in his owne preson,
which he reproveth in others.</p>
               <p>The hypocrite say, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8.) but
doe not, commending that to others
which themselves have no desire nor care
to practise; and reproving that in others
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65398:123"/>
whereof themselves are no lesse guilty,
Rom 2 21, 22. Ps. 50. 16. who therefore may

and attention receiving the seed
into upright hearts, (Luk. 8. 15.) as it were

but as censurers, without reverence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

and they heare thy words, but they will not doe

loe thou art unto them as a very pleasing song
of one that bath a pleasent voice, and can play

                  <hi>Sacraments, Baptisme</hi>] The upright are
carefull in some measure to performe their
vow made in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and to find the
effect and fruit thereof: which is to seale
and assure to them that belive and repent,
their union and communion with Christ,
for they receive Christ by a true faith are
baptized into Christ, Gal. 3. 27. and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
put on Christ.</p>
               <p>The hypocrite resteth in the outward
baptisme, as if the washing of the flesh did
save, (1 Pet. 3. 11.) taking no care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his vow made in baptisme; who
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65398:124"/>
therefore though baptized, hath no part in
Christ, because his heart is <hi>not upright in
him,</hi> Act. 8. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Eucharist</hi>] The Upright are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
not onely to receive the sacrament,
but also to receive it worthily; and are
therefore earefull (1 Cor. 11. 28.)</p>
               <p>to prove and approve themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they come to the Lords table pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
their hearts (2 Chron. 30. 19) to
seeke the Lord and so receiving the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the <hi>unleavened graces of sincerity
and truth (1 Cor.</hi> 5. 8.) doe eat the body
of Christ and drink his blood.</p>
               <p>The hypocrites not greatly caring how
they receive, so they doe receive, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
their hearts to seeke the Lord, not
caring to prove, and much lesse to approve
themselves unto him, comming to the
Lords table as the guest without the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
garment, indued neither with saving
knowledge, nor true faith, nor unfained
repentance, nor sincere love, with which
graces every worthy receiver is in some
measure qualified: but being sowred with
the leaven of hypocrisy doe eat the bread
of the Lord, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, but not <hi>panem dominum</hi> that is the Lord who is the

                  <hi>Obedience</hi>] Thus much of the worship
of God, now we are to speak of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
For, 1. the upright yeeldeth simple
obedience to the commandements of
God, (<hi>Heb</hi> 11. 8.) not consulting with
flesh and blood, as for the commandements
of men, he observeth them no further then
in obaying them he may obay God, Ex 1.
17. Act. 4 19. 5. 29. Dan 3. 18. 6. 10.</p>
               <p>The hypocrite is more carefull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the commandments of men, Mat.
15 9. 6. then the commandements of God;
insomuch that for the commandements
of men he maketh the commandements of
God of none effect, yea he scarcely obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the commandements of God any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then as they are commanded by men,
insomuch that he embraceth Religion it
selfe, as commanded by the Soveraigne
Prince, being ready to change his Religion,
as the Prince changeth. So that their feare
towards God is taught by the precepts of
men, Es. 29. 13.</p>
               <p>To this purpose consider these instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The Lord commandeth us to receive
the holy communion, when it is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred:
and the upright man maketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
so oft to receive it as it is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
unlesse he be hindred by sufficient
occasion. But forasmuch as the law of man
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65398:125"/>
in some places doth require the receipt of
the Sacraments once a yeare at the least;
and namely at Easter, hence it is that many
will receive but once a yeare at the most.</p>
               <p>The upright man maketh conscience of
his thoughts, because the law of God is
spiritual, restraining the thoughts as well as
the hands. The hypocrite taketh no care
of his thoughts, which he thinketh to be
free because the law of man doth not
reach to them</p>
               <p>The Lord forbiddeth all rayling, and
cursed speaking all stealing: and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
man maketh conscience to abstaine
from all: but forasmuch as the law of man
doth not take hold of all evill speaking, nor
of all stealing, therefore the hypocrite fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to practise such evil-speaking, and
such stealing as is not punishable by the law
of men, though perhaps the neighbour be
more wronged by that ill speaking, or
damnified by that stealing, then by that
rayling against which lyeth an action of the
case, or by that stealing against which an

Not, but that the upright contrary to their

that the Lord accepting of the will for the

obedience of his servants, (who are freed

unlesse he love the Lord much more, as I

               <p>But it is the fashion of hypocrits to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
these two, which God hath so unsepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
linked together, that whosoever
hath the one in truth, hath also the other;
and whosoever hath not both, hath neither.
For some content themselves altogether
with a profession of holinesse and religion
towards God, not caring or desiring to
performe the duties of charity and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse

as it were by a touch-stone, God
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65398:128"/>
would have the uprightnesse of our piety

               <p>
                  <hi>Graces</hi>] Now I come to the graces;
every one whereof in the upright is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,

is; but in the hypocrite, counterfeit.
In these, the generall note of uprightnesse
is desire of increase, and striving forward
towards perfections (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 14) (for
in this life we are in <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
are non-proficien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, contenting themselves
with that measure of gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e which they
seeme to have, and have not, and having
not, they are so farre from increasing in
grace, that, that which they seeme to have,
(<hi>Luk</hi> 8. 8) is taken from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:65398:132"/>
And first, the faith of the upright is live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and effectuall, both to justification ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
and applying Christ who is our
righteousnesse; and also to sanctification,
because it doth purify the heart, (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.
9.) and worke by love. (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.) Againe
the faith of the upright is permanent, by it
<hi>he standeth, (Rom.</hi> 5. 2.) and by it he <hi>shall
live,</hi> Heb. 2. 4. by <hi>the power of God through
faith he is preserved unto eternall life
(1 Pet.</hi> 1. 5.) And therefore those who
are of the <hi>defection,</hi> are not of <hi>faith.</hi> And
contrarywise, Heb. 0. 39.</p>
               <p>The seeming faith to the hypocrite is
dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being nether effectual to justification
as being without roote, Luk. 8. 13. nor to
sanctification; as being without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uit.
For as the <hi>body without breath is dead,
(Iam 2. 26.) so is faith without works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is the faith of hypocrites per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
but temporary, which in time of
tryall faileth, Luk. 8. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love</hi>] The love also of the upright is
unfained, whether we speake of his love to
God, which appeareth by obedience, both
active, which is <hi>obedients legis,</hi> (for this
is the love of God, that he keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
1 Iohn 5. 3. Exod 20. 6.)
and passive, which is <hi>obedientia crucis.</hi> that
is to say, patience, for love suffereth all
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65398:133"/>
things, 1 Cor. 3. 7. or of his love to man,
which appeareth in giving and forgiving.
But more specially an undoubted sigue of
uprightnesse is to love and respect the
godly, though of mean accompt in the
world for their godlinesse sake; (<hi>Iam.</hi> 2.
24.) and to disrespect the wicked, though
great in the world, for their wickednesse.
Ps. 15. 4. following therein the disposition
of God himselfe. 1 Sam. 2. 30. and the
example of <hi>Elisha</hi> 2 King. 3. 13, 14. for in
the eyes of the upright prety maketh men
honorable, but wickednesse maketh them
vile and despicable, Dan. 11. 21. And as the
upright are an abomination to the wicked,
so contrarywise. Pro. 29. 27. The world
loveth her owne, but those, that be not of
the world, the world hateth, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a good signe that we are not of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
world, if we love and affect those whom
the world hateth.</p>
               <p>The love of hypocrites is not true, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towards God, For they be haters of
God, (Exod 20. 5. 6.) that will not keepe
his commandements; nor towards men,
being in word and tongue onely, (1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.
18.) or (as we use to speake) from the
teeth outward. But especially their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy
is discovered, as by hating or envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the godly, even for his godlinesse sake,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65398:133"/>
because they cannot endure that any should
be esteemed better then themselves: (Thus
<hi>Cain</hi> hated <hi>Abel, (1 Iohn</hi> 3. 12.) and
<hi>Saul David, (1 Sam.</hi> 18. 9.) and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
Christ,) so by favouring and affecting
the wicked. For liking is a signe of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hope</hi>] The hope of the upright man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of a better life doth in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
weane him from the world; neither
will it suffer him ordinarily, cuter to be
drawne away in sinne, by the desires of the
world, which are but vanities in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that heavenly happinesse, which he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xspecteth. (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24. 26.) no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to be
driven from goodnesse by the terrors of
the world, which he contemneth in respect
of the joy that is set before him: but causeth
him to <hi>purifie himselfe</hi> in some measure,
even <hi>as Christ is pure.</hi> 1 Iohn. 3. 3.</p>
               <p>The hypocrite, for all his pretended
hope, is either so addicted to the desires of
this world, as if he did not expect an other
world: or is so daunted with the afflictions
of this life, as a man without hope, and as
he liveth without the feare of God; so he
dyeth without hope. <hi>For what hope hath
the hypocrite, when God taketh away his
soule?</hi> Iob. 27. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feare</hi>] The upright man is indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d with
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65398:134"/>
a sonne-like feare of God, which is a feare
to offend him. For such feare and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
alwaye; goe together. Iob 1. 1. 8.
Deut. 10. 12. 1 Sam. 12. 24. The hypocrite
either hath no feare of God at all, Ps. 39. 1,
2. but is overgrowne with carnall security:
or but a servile feare, which is the feare of
bondslaves, who are under the law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he doth not indeed feare sinne, or the
offence of God, but the punishment onely
which sinne deserveth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humility</hi>] The upright man is indued
with humility. For he that walketh with
God, setting God before his eyes, and
therefore behaving himselfe as in the sight
and presence of God, cannot but <hi>humble
himselfe to walk with his God. (Mich. 6. 8.)
Abraham</hi> when he stood before the Lord,
acknowledged himselfe to be but <hi>dust and
ashes,</hi> Gen. 18. 27. The holy Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi>
when in a vision he beheld the Majesty of
God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

man of polluted lippes</hi> Es 6. 5. The Apostle
<hi>Peter,</hi> when by the miraculous draught of
fishes he perceived CHRIST, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with him, to be the Sonne of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ell
downe at his feet, and said <hi>depart from me,
for I am a sinfull man, O-Lord.</hi> Luk. 5. 8.
And no doubt, but so many of us, as have
that eye of faith, which <hi>Moses</hi> had, (<hi>Heb.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65398:134"/>
11. 27.) to see him that is invisible</hi> presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with them, are in some measure affected
with his presence, as these men were. But
pride is an evident signe of an hypocrite,
who setteth not God before their eyes.

hypocrites not walking with God; doe
not acknowledge his hand; but ascribe
their affliction, either to misfortune, or to
secondary causes, which are but the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

them, nor turne to him that smiteth them,
(<hi>Es.</hi> 9. 18.) nor promise amendment; or
if they doe, they meane not, or at least
afterwards they doe not performe, nor
submit themselves meekly to beare their
affliction, nor learne obedience by that
which they suffer, neither are they bettered
by them, but become worse, Es. 1. 5. If
they take it too much to heart, then either
they impatienly beare it, murmuring
against God, and fainting in themselves,
or they seeke an evasion out of it by some
sinne, and so fall away from God; by
which their defection, their hypocrisie is
discovered.</p>

and guile. From which the redeemed of

according to the oath of God in this place,
worshipping the <hi>Lord in righteousnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

which they owe unto men, as in the sight

            </p>
            <p>And thus we are to serve God in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<hi>before him.</hi> For howsoever word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
policie, which is mixt with dissimulation
and guile, be commonly practised and
highly extolled among men, and simplicity
contrariwise neglected and contemned,
as folly; yet by the testimony of the Holy
Ghost, true wisdom which descendeth from
above as all good gifts doe is not mixed
with dissimulation, Iam. 3. 17. but is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with simplicity, as our Saviour
teacheth his followers, Mat. 10. 16.</p>
            <p>Those therefore that wil be wise in Gods
accompt, must be content to seeme fooles
in the estimation of the world, 1 Cor. 3. 18.
As for that wisdome which is mixed with
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65398:140"/>
deceipt, the Holy Ghost doth censure it,
as <hi>earthly carnall, and devilish</hi> Iames 3. 15.
And although that be accompted the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wisedome among worldly men; yet
the wisedome of the world is <hi>foolishnesse</hi>

who by their policie to gaine their desires

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es: which
is not onely folly, but madnesse. I say
extreame madnesse, for the momentany
fruition of worldly desires, which are vain
and unprofitable, not onely to deprive
themselves of everlasting happinesse in
heaven, but also plunge themselves into
endlesse woe and misery in hell. Verily,
it were easy for any man, that is not a
foole, to become worldly wise, if he
would be so foolish, as to cast away his
soule by making no conscience of dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and disguising, of lying and deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
out-facing, of swearing and for swearing
which, because no true Christian w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therefore as every where in the world true

innocents, meaning fooles; so in the

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65398:140"/>
swaded from all doubling and guile, let us
consider, what arguments the Holy Ghost
affordeth in this behalfe. And first, as
touching dissimulation or guile, it is two-fold
either in word, or in deed. In word
when there is a divorce between the
tongue and the heart; the heart meaning
one thing, and the tongue speaking an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

that is redeemed is bound with his perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to joyne both assiduity in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
practise of piety every day, and also to
increase dayly in godliness, and in the
grace of the Spirit, being renewed in the
inner man from day to day, 2 Cor. 4. 16.
But yet this is not the thing which by oath
the Lord hath promised in the covenant of
grace to all that are redeemed; for who
then might not think himself excluded out
of the covenant of grace, seeing <hi>in many
things we offend all?</hi> (Iam. 3. 2.) and <hi>there
is not a righteous man upon earth that doth
good,</hi> (Eccles. 7. 20) <hi>and sinneth not:</hi>

gifts of Grace: To omit this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65398:148"/>
I answere, it hath beene the received
opinion, and usuall practise of all <hi>Orthodox</hi>
Divines, to hold and set downe in this
order the degrees of salvation, which are
wrought in this life, viz. Our vocation,
justification, sanctification. And that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of nature vocation, (wherin justifying
faith is begotten) goeth before justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that justification, wherein we are
made just before GOD by imputation of
CHRISTS righteousnesse, goeth before
sanctification: wherein we, being already
justified from the guilt of sinne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
from the hand of our spirituall
enimies, and reconciled unto God, receive
grace to worship him in holinesse and
righteousnesse before him. Howbeit, we
deny not, but that in time our justification
doth concurre with our effectuall vocation,
(for as soone as a man doth truly believe,
so soone is he justified before God) and
that in time the first act of sanctification
(which is our regeneration) doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
both with our justification and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
vocation. Now, of our regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is the beginning of our sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and of our spirituall life. Which
we live by faith, there seeme to be two
acts; the one, wherein we are begotten
unto God <hi>of incorruptible seed</hi> by the word
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65398:149"/>
of God; the other, wherein the image of
God being in some measure renewed in us,
and our Saviour Christ formed in us, we
are borne anew. The former, is our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
conception; the latter, our spirituall
or new birth, in the former <hi>regeneramur,</hi>
we are begotten anew, in the latter <hi>renas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimur,</hi>
we are borne anew. And as in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
generation there is a meane time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the conception and the birth, in
which time that which is begotten is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the wombe, according to the image
of the first <hi>Adam;</hi> so betweene the first act
of regeneration and the new birth, there
intercedeth a time, wherein the image of
the second <hi>Adam</hi> is in all parts by degrees
renewed, untill <hi>Christ b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> formed in us,</hi>
(Gal. 4. 19.) The former, which also is
the first act of our conversion, is the same
with our calling or vocation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein our
Saviour Christ is conceived in our hearts,
when we doe receive him by the true and
lively assent of faith; which is the seed,
the root, the fountaine of all other sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
graces; which whosoever hath, (1 Iohn
5. 1) <hi>he is begotten of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This act the holy spirit worketh ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
by the ministry of the word. For <hi>faith
commeth by the hearing of the word.</hi> (Rom.
10. 17.) For <hi>how should men believe in him,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65398:149"/>
of whom they have not heard, and how
should they heare without a preacher,</hi> Rom.
10. 14. In this regard preachers, being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
by whom others believe. 1 Cor. 3.
5. are the instruments of the holy Ghost
for our spirituall regeneration; and are
therefore called fathers in the faith, who
beget men unto God. 1 Cor. 4. 15. Phil.
10. 1 Tim. 1. 2. Now in our vocation, the
worke of the holy Ghost is partly prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and partly operative. The preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto faith is 1. the illumination of the
minde, partly by the ministery of the law,
revealing unto us our miserable estate in
our selves; and partly by the ministery of
the Gospel, revealing unto us the mystery
of our salvation by Christ. 2. the molifying
of the heart by the finger of the spirit,
humbling us in the consideration both of
our damnable estate in our selves, and of
the undeserved mercies of God offered in
Christ, from which being effectuall ariseth
a desire both to be freed from that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
estate, and to be made partakers of
that happinesse promised in Christ. 3. The
invitation of the hearers, and the stirring
of them up, to come out of that wofull
estate, and to accept of Gods mercies in
Christ, by the Ministers of the word;
who being the Embassadours of God in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:65398:150"/>
               <hi>Christs stead,</hi> doe beseech you, as if God
himself did intreate you by them, that you
would be reconciled unto God. (1 Cor.
5. 18. 20.)</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghost having thus knocked at
the dore of our hearts, doth himselfe in his
good time, open our hearts, as he did the
heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to assent to, and to believe
the Gospel, By which beliefe being lively
and effectuall, we receive Christ, not onely
in our judgements by assent, but also in our
hearts by an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arnest desire to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of him, and in our wills by an earnest
purpose and settled resolution to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and professe him to be our Lord and
Saviour, and to rest upon him for salvation.
The Holy Ghost having wrought this assent,
and by it this desire and purpose of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ unto our selves, and thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
some beginnings of hope, of the hatred of
sinne, of the love of God, and of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and of other graces, by which the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God beginneth to be renewed, and
Christ to be formed in us, being yet as it
were Embryones in the womb, he teacheth
every one of us, who have through his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
operation the condition of the promise,
to apply the promise to our selves, and to
believe not onely that Christ is the Saviour
of all that do believe, but also that he is my
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65398:150"/>
Saviour, that he died for my sins, and rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for my justification, so that when the
Minister, according to the word, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
this generall proposition, <hi>whosoever
truly believes in Christ hath remission of his
sins, and shall be saved,</hi> the conscience of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faithfull man may both safely assume, <hi>but
I through Gods grace doe truely believe in
Christ,</hi> and also certainly conclude by the
testimony of the holy Ghost, bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
with our conscience in the assumption,
according to the word in the proposition,
<hi>therefore I through the grace of God have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes and shall be saved.</hi> When the
holy Ghost hath thus taught us to apply the
promises unto our selves, and hath sealed us
<hi>after we have believed,</hi> and testified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with our spirits, that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God; then it appeareth, that we
are already born of God, and that we are
the sons of God, not only by regeneration,
but also by adoption (Eph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 15. Rom. 8. 15,
16. Joh. 1. 15, 16.) And being sonnes, God
sendeth forth the spirit of his Son into our
hearts, crying <hi>Abba</hi> father Gal. 4. 6. By this
faith, first apprehending, and then apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ unto us, we become not only the
sonnes of God, but also members of Christ;
and having union with him as our head, we
have communion also with him, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:65398:151"/>
of his merit unto justification: first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and then in the court of our own
conscience; and in respect of his graces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
sanctification, receiving of his <hi>fulnes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
grace for grace.</hi> (Joh. 1. 16.)</p>
            <p>As therefore men are first conceived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be born, and they are borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are said to lead a life in this world:
so we must first be begotten and born anew
in our vocation and regeneration, before
wee can live unto God the spirituall life
of sanctification. These two therefore were
not to be confounded; sanctification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the end, as of our election, Eph. 1. 4. and
of our justification, (Luk. 1. 75. Tit. 2. 14. 1 Pet.
2. 24.) so also of our vocation. 1 Thess 4. 7.
By our vocation, we are begotten unto God,
by sanctification, we being both begotten
and born anew, do live unto GOD. In our
vocation, the spirit of God first draweth us
unto God: (Joh. 6. 44.) in our sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we being already drawn, the Spirit of
GOD doth lead and guide us in the way
which leadeth to life. (Rom. 8. 14. Gal. 5.
18.) Vocation produceth Faith; Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
begotten, produceth sanctification, both
habituall (for the heart is purified by Faith)
and actuall, for Faith worketh by love, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
good workes as the fruit both of
Faith and Charity. (Act. 15. 9.) I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65398:151"/>
but that Faith is a part of our sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and of our inherent righteousnesse:
yet this hindereth not, but that both it self
doth sanctify us, and is also the mother of
all other inward graces wherein our habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sanctification consisteth, and of all the
works of grace wherein our actuall significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is occupied. For when the Holy Ghost
doth regenerate us, he doth ingenerate the
grace of Faith in us, and by it al other graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>The second error, That sanctification goeth

a consequent of the former) that sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
goeth before justification. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
whereof I have proved in the discourse,
whereunto I adde. 1. That sanctification is
the end and fruit of our justification, the
cognizance also and evidence whereby it is
known, and therefore a consequent thereof.
(Col. 1. 22. Rom. 6. 22.) 2. As we are made
siners, first by imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, &amp; then

partakers of his corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so we are made

and then being justified, we are in
some measure made partakers of those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which he received without measure. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the persons of men being sinners in
themselves, must be accepted of GOD as
righteous in Christ, before either there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

qualities or their actions, (which when they
are at the best are defiled with sinne) can
be acceptable unto GOD. Therefore we
must be justified, before either our qualities
or actions can be holy and righteous before
God, Neither can there be any sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without justification, and reconciliation
with God going before in order of nature:
as there is no justification without sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
accompanying and following the
same. For by the same Faith whereby we
are justified, we are also sanctified. Christ
being apprehended by faith to justification,
dwelleth in us by his Spirit to work in us
sanctification, and to whom the merits of
Christ apprehended by Faith are imputed to
their justification; to them the vertue of his
death and resurrection is applyed by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost to the mortifying of sin, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
againe to newnes of life, to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Apostle saith, Col. 2. 12. by Faith
we are risen with Christ in Baptisme. Again,
faith, by which we are justified, in order of
nature goeth before repentance, wherein
our sanctification consisteth. It is a resolved

and remission of sins goe before faith,
which may seeme a strange assertion to be
delivered by him, who holdeth, that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
whereof faith, as he confesseth, is
a principall part, goeth before justification.
But this absurdity he salveth with a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65398:153"/>
that he speaketh of justification, not in
<hi>foro Dei,</hi> but in <hi>foro conscientiae:</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
acknowledgeth no justifying faith,
but that by which we are in our conscience
assured of our justification. But when we
speak of justification, as of a degree of our
salvation, it is evident, that justification is to
be censidered as an action of GOD (for it
is God that justifieth, Rom. 8. 30, 33.) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he imputing to a believing sinner the
righteousnesse of Christ apprehended by
faith, absolveth him from his sins, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
of him as righteous in Christ. As
for that justification, which is in <hi>foro consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae,</hi>
it is not justification properly, but the
knowledge and assurance of it. Neither is
that to be accounted justifying faith proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by which we are not justified before God,
nor obtaine remission of sinnes. But before
and without this faith, by which we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
in our consciences, that is, assured of
our justification, we are as he truly saith, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
before God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> error, that all the elect before their
conversion, &amp;c. stand actually reconciled and
justified.</hi>] The fourth, that all the elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their conversion, and before they have
faith stand actually reconciled unto God,
and justified before him, may also seeme a
strange assertion to be uttered by a godly
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65398:153"/>
man. For if this were true, then every one
that will perswade himselfe that he is elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(which most men are ready to do, who
will thank GOD for their election before
they are called) may cast off all care of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
unto God, of repenting for his sins,
of suing unto God for the pardon of them,
of believing in Christ; because without
and before either faith or repentance he
hath remission of his sins, and standeth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
justifyed before GOD, and reconciled
unto him. And this is the very ground,
whereupon carnall Gospellers, who <hi>turne
the grace of God into wantonnesse,</hi> do build all
their presumptuous licentiousnesse, that
Christ having dyed for their sins, they need
not to dye to them, that Christ having freed
them from sin and from damnation, they
may sinne freely, and without danger; that
Christ having reconciled them to God, and
purchased Salvation for them, they neither
need to sue for reconciliation or pardon,
nor take care of their Salvation: that Christ
having fully satisfied the justice of God by
his obedience and sufferings, they neither
are obnoxious to punishment, nor tyed to
obedience.</p>
            <p>But this assertion is most evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
by the Scriptures, which do teach,
that the elect are by nature the children of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65398:154"/>
wrath, servants to sin and Sathan, enemies
against God, obnoxio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s in themselves to
the fearfull curse of God, as well as others;
untill they turne unto God, crave pardon
of their sins, and lay hold upon Christ by
faith, then indeed, but not till then, they are
reconciled unto God, (Col. 1. 11. Rom. 5. 10.)
who before were enemies: then, but not
untill then, they are actually redeemed,
who were before bondslaves; then, but not
untill then, they are justified, who before
were guilty of sin and damnation: then, and
not untill then, their sins are actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
For actuall pardon is of sins past.
(<hi>Orig. in Rom. 3. Lib. 3. indulgentia non futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum,
sed preteritorum criminum datur.</hi>)
Rom. 3. 25. and we may not presume that
our sins are pardoned, before we repent of
them, and much lesse may we dreame, that
they are actually remitted, before they be
committed. For the better understanding
whereof, we are to consider the merits of
Christ, and the benefits which we have ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
according to his own intention expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the covenant of grace? the condition
whereof is faith,) and are not to extend
them to those, to whom they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
Christ is the Saviour of the world,
yet al are not saved, nor to be saved for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
still remain in the state of damnation, he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:65398:154"/>
is the Redeemer of man-kind, yet all are
not actually redeemed, for many still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in the servitude of sin and Sathan. For
they <hi>that commit sin, are the servants of sin.</hi>
Whereas <hi>if the sonne had made them free, they
should have been free indeed.</hi> (2 Cor. 5. 19)
Joh 8. 34, 36. God was in Christ reconciling
the world unto himselfe; and yet very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as they continue in their rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God; so the wrath of God abideth
upon them. Joh. 3. 36. Neither ought this to
seeme strange seeing the covenant of grace
promiseth and assureth, neither Salvation,
nor remission of sins, nor other benefits of
Christ to all, but only to those that believe.

John 3. 16. Mark. 16. 16. <hi>he that believeth</hi>

phrase used by the Apostle, in the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
betwixt the first and the second <hi>Adam.</hi>
Rom, 5. 19. <hi>As by the disobedience of one

                  </gap> the many</hi> (that is the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

(that is the multitude of them that shall be
saved, he doth not say, <hi>were made,</hi> but) <hi>shall
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65398:155"/>
be made righteous.</hi> The reason of which
diversity is this; because the Apostle had
respect to all those elect, who as yet have
not believed, either because as yet they
were not, or as yet are not, or because as
yet they were not, or yet are not called.
For it is necessary that all men should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
and acknowledge themselves to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in <hi>Adam ab origine,</hi> from their first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For by generation the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi>
is actually communicated to all his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and no sooner are they partakers of
the humane nature, then they do participate
in his sinne. But we may not say, that the
righteousnes or obedience of Christ is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to all from their beginning, but
onely (I speak after the manner of the
Scriptures, of those which are <hi>adulti</hi>) to
those that believe. Neither are they in their
generation, or before, made partakers of
Christs righteousnes, but in their <hi>regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
That no man therefore should neglect
the benefit of justification, as though he had
already obtayned it, before his conversion
or effectuall calling, or regeneration in
which faith is ingenerated by the Holy
Ghost in the soules of the elect; he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the future tense; that men should
understand, that they are not borne just or
justifyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that they shall be justified, so
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65398:155"/>
soone as they turning unto GOD, shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ, and that they are just, <hi>nonnat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sed
renati,</hi> not born, but born anew, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
before we ought to presume that we
are justified, we must be called, converted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
regenerated. For whom GOD hath elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
them hath he called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to his
purpose; and whom he hath so called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
them, and no other hath he justified, Rom.
8. 30.</p>
            <p>Thus then we are to conceive of Christs
merits, and the benefits which we have
thereby: that howsoever our Saviour Christ
did in the dayes of his flesh meritoriously
redeeme and save men, paying a price of
ransome sufficient for all, and fully satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the justice of GOD in the behalfe of al
that shall be saved: yet notwithstanding
none are actually redeemed, or reconci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed,
or justified, but they only to whom the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Christ are applyed; and they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
only to those that believe (I speak of
those which are <hi>adulti,</hi> for to elect infants,
dying in their infancy, they are applyed by
the Holy Ghost) neither can any be assured
that they truely believe, but such as repent
of their sinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make conscience of
their wayes.</p>
            <p>This learned man therefore should have
distinguished between<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65398:156"/>
and actuall redemption: even as
well as between the merit of Salvation, and
the actuall possession thereof: Christ me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
our redemption, and Salvation long
since; yea his merit thereof hath ever been
in force since the beginning of the world:
(Apoc. 13. 8.) but yet none are actually
made partakers of redemption, but such as
to whom it is appyed, that is to those that
truely believe, for they only receive it, and
to them onely, according to the Covenant
of grace it was intended. Otherwise, he
might say, that all the elect are actually
saved, for whom Christ purchased eternall
life; who notwithstanding are not saved,
so much as in hope, untill they do truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
And if all the elect be actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
before God, because Christ did me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
their justification, why doth he not say
in like manner, that all the elect are actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sanctifyed: seeing Christ was made unto
us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of GOD, not onely righteousnesse,
(1 Cor. 1. 30.) and redemption, but also san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifycation;
and hath as well merited our
sanctification for us, as our justification. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
what benefits we obtaine by Christ
we receive them by Faith: and therefore in
the Scriptures, the same benefits which we
receive from Christ, are ascribed to Faith;
by which Christ and his merits are ours; by
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65398:156"/>
which also Christ dwelleth in us, Eph. 3 17.
we live by Christ, we live by Faith, Gal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.

by Faith we obtaine remission, Act. 10. 43.

by Faith. Rom. 3. 28. By Christ we
are made the sonnes of God; by faith we
are made the sonnes of GOD, Joh. 1. 12.
and so in the rest, and therefore to imagine
that we are justified before GOD without
Faith, is a dreame.</p>
            <p>Moreover this assertion cannot stand
with the perpetuall Doctrine of the Apostle
<hi>Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who teacheth that we are justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
GOD by Faith, therefore not before,
nor without Faith. By faith, saith he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
workes, that is, by the righteousnesse of
Christ apprended by Faith, and not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
righteousnesse. Neither doth he in
those places speak of justification in the
Court of Conscience, whereby we are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of our justification; for as before men
we are justified (Jam. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>4.) that is, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and known to be just by good workes;
so much more by our good workes (by
which we are to make our election (2 Pet 1.
10.) our calling, our justification sure) we
are justified in our own Conscience, that is,
assured of our justification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
this assertion is such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

            <p>5. The fifth, that faith is not the root
nor the mother of other graces, and that the
soule is not disposed to believe, sooner then
to love GOD, or our neighbour, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the act of any other grace. But this I
have sufficiently disproved in the discourse,
shewing evidently that as without faith
there can be no other grace; so not onely
from it all other graces do spring, but also
according to the measure and degree of it,
is the measure and degree of all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               </gap> of faith as well as hope and that by

I adde, that the trust in GODS pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ope. Yea but <hi>promises,</hi>

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65398:158"/>
our assent to them is with adherence, affiance
and trust. Answ.</hi> The promises are true,
the things promised are good, we believe
the promise, we hope for the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.
As contrarywise Gods threatnings
are also true, and the things threatned evill.
as therefore he that believeth the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to be true, feareth (if it be applyable
to himselfe) the thing threatned, and yet
this feare is not of the nature of faith, but
a fruit and consequent thereof: so he that
believeth a promise to be true, and can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to himself, trusteth &amp; hopeth for the
thing promised, which trust in respect of
the promise, is no more of the nature of

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in him,</hi> is ordinarily used in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
yea sometimes it is attributed to
those, who have assented onely by a bare
historicall, and temporary Faith, which is
the Faith of hypocrites, and all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as Iohn, 2. 23. (<hi>To believe on him
and one his name is all one, Iohn.</hi> 3. 8.) and
12. 42. compared with Iohn. 5. 44. Iohn. 4.
39. Many of the Samaritans believed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>in Christ,</hi> upon the report of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
who, being confirmed in their faith
by hearing himselfe, say to the woman,
42. we believe no more because of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
for we our selves have heard him.
Now what was her r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>port? that he had
told her all things that ever she did, and
therefore that <hi>he was the Christ.</hi> This is all
that they believed, when they were said
to have believed in CHRIST, And what
was their Faith, which was confirmed by
hearing himselfe? that <hi>this is indeed the
Christ the Saviour of the world.</hi> And this,
as I said, is the ordinary signification of the
phrase in the New Testament, see Iohn. 7.
31. 8. 30. 31. 33. 11. 26. 27. Act 8. 37. So
the Hebrew is joyned with beliefe,
not onely in God, but in his Prophets also;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:65398:159"/>
not that we are to put assiance in them,
but to give credit to them as to the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
of God, Ex. 14. 31. 2 Chron. 20.
20. The second act is of application, when
believing truly that he is the Saviour of all
that believe, I therefore believe that he is
my Saviour: which is the act of that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
faith, by which we are justified in our
conscience, in which sense the phrase seemes
to be used 1 Iohn. 5. 13. in the later clause,
but in the first part of that verse in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sense. so Iohn 20. 28, 29. Gal. 2. 20.</p>
            <p>The third act is of affiance, that because
I do believe not onely that he is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the world, but also my Saviour,
therefore I rest upon him for salvation,
and thus it seemeth to be used Iohn 14. 1.
But this is not the act of faith, as it justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us before God, nor yet the proper act
of the speciall faith, which doth justifie us
in our conscience, but a fruit and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
thereof. For if I truly believe that
Christ is the Saviour of all that believe,
then must I consequently believe that he
is my Saviour, (for the generall alwayes
includes the particulars) and if I doe truly
believe that he is my Saviour, then shall
I consequently put my trust in him for
salvation. Or more plainly, to use his
owne terms; he saith, <hi>that the proper act of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65398:159"/>
faith, as it justifieth, consisteth in trust, or
relyance upon the promise for our owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
when the soule dependeth wholly, or
trusteth perfectly in the promise, for remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sinnes, and for salvation,</hi> But say I,
a man cannot at all, and much lesse wholly
and perfectly trust in the promise to be
performed to himselfe, unlesse he be first
perswaded, and in some measure assured,
that the promise doth belong unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
which perswasion is the act of speciall
Faith. A man cannot be assured at all, that
the promise belongeth to himselfe, unlesse
he have the condition of the promise,
which is a true justifying faith, for the
promise is not made to all, but to those
that truly believe, Therefore I must have
a justifying Faith, which is the condition of
the promise before I can be as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ured that
the promise belongeth to me. I must be
perswaded that it belongeth to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I can confidently trust that it shalbe
performed to me.</p>
            <p>But let us consider his testimonies. For
he alleageth Iohn. 1. 12. Where to believe
in CHRIST is the exposition of receiving
Christ. Now we receive Christ, first, by
assent, and then by application, whereof
assiance is a consequent.</p>
            <p>2. Rom. 10. 14. How shall they call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65398:160"/>

where the phrase is used, as vers 11. <hi>whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
believeth on him, shall not be ashamed,</hi>
and that as the proofe of V. 9. 10, If thou
shalt with thy mouth confesse the Lord
Iesus, and shalt <hi>believe in thine heart that
God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt
be saved.: For with the heart man believeth

opposition of Faith to distrust or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
where as he confoundeth Faith and
affiance so he confoundeth also <hi>doubting</hi>
(which is opposite to Faith) and <hi>distrust</hi>
which is opposed to affiance; betweene
which there is a great difference; for
doubting is not contrary to as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the word, much differing from that

That he maketh affiance the proper act of
justifying faith, which I have already dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p>2. That he holdeth, that there may be a
full affiance, whereby a man may wholly
and perfectly trust to the promise, without
the like assurance. But this is a manifest
errour borrowed from the Papists; who
hope well of the remission of sinnes, but
dare not believe it. For this full affiance
in trusting wholly and perfectly to the
promise for the performance of it to a
mans selfe, is that which the Apostle
calleth <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the assurance of

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the assurance of faith, where, by the
way, you may take notice of a threefold
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> mentioned in the Scriptures: the
first is (1 Col. 2. 3.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
the assurance
or full perswasion of understanding to the
acknowledgement of the mystery of GOD,
and the Father, and of Christ, this is the
plerophory of <hi>assent,</hi> when a man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the mystery of the Gospel,
giveth full assent thereto, that is true,
and that Jesus the Sonne of the blessed
Virgin, is the eternall Sonne of GOD,
and the Saviour of all that truely believe
in him. The second is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65398:162"/>
assurance of faith, when thou applying
the promise to they selfe, doest assuredly
believe, not onely that Christ is the
Saviour of all that believe, but also that
he is thy Saviour. The third is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
the assurance of hope; when thou
being fully perswaded, that Christ is not
onely the Saviour of the faithfull, but
that he is also <hi>thy</hi> Saviour; doest assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trust and hope to be saved by him.
Every one of these plerophories or assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
are infallible in their kind, <hi>nec fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
iis subesse potest:</hi> but this is absolutely
to be understood of the first, the object
whereof is the word of GOD, which is
<hi>principium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the second is not
absolutely true, as a principle like the
former, but as a conclusion is necessarily
and infallibly true, <hi>concessis praemissis.</hi>
For if this proposition be true, that
<hi>Christ is the Saviour of all that truly believe</hi>
(which is the undoubted word of GOD:
and if this assumption be true also, <hi>but I
through GODS mercy doe truly believe,</hi>
(which is certainly true in all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:)
then this conclusion cannot be
false; therefore Christ is my Saviour;
whereupon followeth the plerophory of
hope; that seeing he is my Saviour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I do assuredly hope for salvation by
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:65398:163"/>
3 That he maketh the assurance of Faith
to be a consequent of that assurance of
trust, which is nothing else but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
the assurance of hope, the contrary
whereof is true, for as hope is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
and fruit of Faith; so from the
assurance of faith proceedeth the assurance
of affiance and hope; and according to
the measure and degree of that, is the
measure and degree of this. Neither is
it possible, that a man should have a full
affiance wholly and perfectly to trust to
the promise to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e performed to himselfe,
who is not first fully assured, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
doth belong unto himselfe. And
therefore it is but a cold comfort, to be
given to a man distressed in Conscience,
to tell him, that if he have affiance to trust
wholly and perfectly to the promise for
remission of sinne, he hath Faith, though
he have not full assurance. But misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
comforters are they, who teach (as
this man doth not) that where is not full
assurance, there is no Faith. But if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
to minister true comfort to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Conscience perplexed with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
concerning Faith; we must unteach
these Doctrines, either that justifying
Faith is an assurance of remission, and
much lesse a full assurance; or that it is
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65398:163"/>
affiance, much lesse a full affiance, trusting
wholly to the promise for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it to a mans selfe; which
cannot be had, unlesse thou hast
the like assurance that the promise doth
belong to thee. For indeed that faith,
by which we are justified before GOD,
is neither assurance properly, nor affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
for assurance is the second degree
of Faith, by which we are not justified
before GOD, but in the Court of our
own Conscience; and affiance is a
fruit and consequent of both. Aske
then the party distressed this question.
Doest thou believe, that the promise
of the Gospell concerning remission
and salvation doth belong to thee? If thou
dost, then thou hast assurance, that
Christ is thy Saviour, and that by him thou
hast remission, and that by him thou shalt
be saved. If he cannot affirme, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
the promise to belong unto him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
go about to perswade him, that he trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the performance of the promise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

truly believe, that Jesus the sonne of the

GOD and Saviour of all that tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65398:164"/>
thou hast the condition of the promise,
therefore thou maist, and thou must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
conclude, that he is thy Saviour,
and that thou shalt be saved by him. If

               </gap> doubteth, whether he doth truly

many say they believe, who do not truly
believe. Aske him again, dost thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that in thy selfe and by nature thou

death and damnation? To this no doubt
he will say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yes, say then it seemeth you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the sentence of the law concluding

believe the Gospell, that notwithstanding

               </gap> guilt of your own Conscience accusing,

he will confesse, as being the expresse Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Gospell, aske him then, is
there any oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hope to be saved, but by Christ? He will
say, he renounceth all other meanes, well
then, you acknowledge (you may say) that
in your selfe you are a wretched sinner, but
yet notwithstanding by Christ you shall be
happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you shall believe in him, tell me
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:65398:164"/>
then, have not you earnestly desired to
come out of that damnable estate, wherein
you wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by nature, and to be partaker
of that happinesse, purchased by
CHRIST for all that believe in him?
He will say he hath, and that he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
expressed this his desire by hearty
prayer. But you believing (may you
say) and desiring those things, have
you not also resolved to acknowledge and
professe CHRIST to be the onely Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and to rest upon him alone for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
renouncing all other meanes,
and to acknowledge him to be your Lord,
and therefore to obey him, and serve
him, making conscience of all your
wayes? All this have I done (will he
say) and yet I have not assurance. But
say I, if thou hast done all this, then
thou hast a true justifying Faith, for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ is to receive him: and tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
hast received him not onely in thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by a firme and lively assent, but
also in thy heart and will, by an earnest
desire and setled purpose of applycation,
by which thou hast received him to be thy
Saviour. Hereupon I inferre, that thou
hast the condition of the promise, and
therefore that the promise doth belong
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:65398:165"/>
unto thee, and that thou believing tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that Jesus is the Saviour of all that
believe in him, he is thy Saviour, and
therefore needest not, yea thou oughtest
not to doubt of thy salvation, for by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to apply the promise to thy selfe,
when thou hast the condition thereof,
thou makest GOD a lyar. 1 John 5. 10.
If thou wilt not believe me, yet believe
the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10. 9, 10. <hi>If thou
shalt confesse with thy mouth,</hi> the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and shalt believe in thine heart, that
GOD <hi>raised him from the dead, thou shalt
be saved. For with the heart, man belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
unto righteousnesse, and with the
mouth, confession is made to Salvation.</hi>
Believe St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> whose first Epistle was
written to this very purpose, that those
who truly believe that Jesus Christ is the
Saviour, might have assurance that he is
their Saviour. 1 John 5. 13. For so he
writeth in the same Chapter, vers. 1. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
believeth that Iesus is the Christ,
is borne of GOD,</hi> and vers. 5. <hi>Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

of GOD?</hi> Believe our Saviour himself;
For, if being asked with the Apostles
what you thinke he is, thou shalt answer
with St. <hi>Peter, Thou art the CHRIST
the sonne of the living GOD,</hi> he will
pronounce thee blessed. Matth. 16. 16.
If for all this thou canst not gather assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
know then, that the premises
being granted, thou canst not but have
assurance; unles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e thou wilt deny the

false, the premises being true.</p>
            <p>But for thy better assurance, tell me,
what you are to thinke of a man believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truly that Jesus is the Christ, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of his spirituall estate is so poore,
that he is as it were a meere beggar, who
having nothing of his owne, whereby
he might hope to be saved, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
wholly upon the mercies of GOD,
and merits of Christ? Even as beggers,
who having nothing of their owne, depend
upon the Almes of well-disposed people,
what thinke you of him, who believing
that Christ is the Saviour, is not yet as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that he is freed from that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
estate wherein he is by nature, but
mourneth in the sense and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his wofull condition, desiring
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65398:166"/>
to be freed from it? What thinke you
of him, who truly believing that Jesus is
the Christ, but not yet assured of his justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
doth therefore hunger and thirst
after righteousnesse? Whatsoever you
thinke of them, or whatsoever they be in
their own sence, they are justified before
GOD. And that I prove thus. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
are blessed, are justified, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise,
but all believers though they be
beggers in Spirit, though they mourne,
though they do but hunger and thirst after

of our Saviour himselfe, Matth. 5. 3, 4.

               </gap> doctrine of justification by faith.
For that teacheth the justification of a

is neither of an ungodly person, but of a
man already justified before God, and also
sanctified; neither is it before God, but
in the court of conscience, that justification
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65398:166"/>
is an action of God, acquitting the sinner,
and accepting of him as righteous by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Christs righteousnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this
there is no such matter, in that we are

he believe or repent, or sue for pardon, but
also before he commit them; there we are
taught that a man is justified before God
by faith; here that a man is justified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
and without Faith; there we are taught, that
faith doth justify, not as it is an habit or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
inherent, or as a part of inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse;
but onely as the hand receiving
Christ; who is our righteousnesse, and is
therefore said to justify, because the object
which it receiveth, doth justify. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this new doctrine, faith doth
neither justify, as the hand to receive
Christ unto justification, not in respect of
the object, but as a part of the generall
habite of grace infused, not justifying a
sinner before God by apprehension of
Christs righteousnesse, but assuring the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65398:167"/>
party already sanctified and justified of his
justification and salvation: in that we are
taught, that we are justified by faith alone,
but in this, we are justified, that is, assured
of justification, not onely by faith, but by
good workes, and all other meanes, by
which we are to make our calling and

            <p>The eighth error, that assent is not the act
of justifying faith.</p>
            <p>8. The eighth, that faith, as it is an
assent, doth not justifie; the contrary
whereof (speaking of a true, lively and
effectuall assent) I have fully, and (as
I hope) sufficiently proved. But let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
his proofes the first is this. <hi>The Act
of justifying faith is supernaturall,</hi> Eph, 2. 8,
<hi>this assent to the truth of the Gospell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
salvation by Christ, is not super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall.
ergo.</hi> I deny the assumption, and
affirme, that the true, lively, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
assent is supernaturall, and cannot be
had without the helpe of the holy Ghost,
as being a proper work of the holy Ghost,
when he doth regenerate any of us, No
man can say, that Iesus is the Lord,
(1 Cor. 12. 3.) but by the holy Ghost,
And who knowes not, that it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65398:167"/>
work of the holy Ghost in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Gospell, to open the hearts
of the elect, as he did the heart of <hi>Lydia.</hi>
(Act. 16.) to assent unto the word? To
use arguments to perswade the hearers to
embrace the Gospell, and to receive Christ,
may be the worke of the Minister; but
to perswade the hearer thereunto, is the
worke of the holy Ghost. Againe, that
whereby we become the sonnes of God,
is not a work of nature, but of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
spirit, by this lively assent we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the sonnes of God. For, By this
effectuall assent, as I have shewed, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
CHRIST, But as many as received
him, to them he gave this power to become
<hi>the sonnes of God,</hi> (Iohn. 1. 12. 13.) <hi>even to
them that believe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of

doe many times believe that, which they
doe not willingly assent unto, but abhorre,
and wish it were otherwise. But the faith
of Gods children is a willing assent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is a true, lively and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
assent. For in Divinity we are said
to believe; and by Faith to know no
more then we believe effectually, and
know by a lively faith. Now where there
is a true, lively, and effectuall faith, it
worketh a disposition in us answerable to
that which we believe and know. The
wicked doe believe after a sort, that there
is a God, that he is just, and good, that
he is infinite in essence, power and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
&amp;c. that IESUS the Sonne of the
blessed Virgin, is the Saviour of the world,
&amp;c. Yet none of all this doe they truely
and effectuall believe. For if they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
inded; that there is a GOD, they
would not deny him in their deeds, behave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves as if there were no God.
If they did truly believe that he is good,
yea goodnesse it selfe, they would love
him; if just, they would feare him; if
omnipresent, they would walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; if omnipotent or all-sufficient,
they would either trust in him, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> feare
him, if omniscient, they would not play
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:65398:169"/>
the hypocrites before him. If they did
truly believe, that IESUS is the Saviour,
they would desire to be made partakers
of his merits, they would be carefull to
apply them to themselves, they would
rest upon him for salvation, they would
obey and serve him as their Lord, But he
that saith he knoweth him, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in him, and hath no desire nor care
to keepe his commandements, (John 2.
1.) <hi>he is alyar</hi> (saith Sant <hi>Iohn) and there
is no truth in him.</hi> That faith therefore,
which is not lively and effectuall, but <hi>a
dead faith,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> calleth it, (Jam.
2. 10.) is no more to be accompted a true
faith, then the carcase<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or counterfeit of
a man is a true man.</p>
            <p>3. The formall object of this assent,
as it justifieth, is not every truth reavled
of God (though it believeth whatsoever
God hath revealed in his word) but that
onely which <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is called <hi>truth of
God,</hi> (John 5. 33. 18 37. 1 Tim. 2. 4.) that
is, the Gospell, which is the truth of
GOD in CHRIST, or his truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
salvation by CHRIST. Now to
give a willing, lively, and effectuall assent
to his truth, farre exceedeth the strength
of corrupted nature. John. 6. 44. Matt. 16.
16. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:65398:170"/>
These things thus premised, I come to
his argumentation, and first to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
which if it were universally true,
as it is propounded (<hi>whatsoever the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by the onely light of Nature judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be honest; that the will can desire by
the onely strength of Nature</hi>) then might
I as lawfully assume, and conclude thus, to
the great comfont of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and
<hi>Arminians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (whom in divers other points
he doth worthily,) But by the onely light
of nature the understanding judgeth it to
be an honest and a good thing to believe
in God and to obey him, to believe in
him, I say, not onely as true in his word,
but also as faithfull in his promises; and
consequently to trust in him, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
thereof; likewise to obey God
commanding us any duety, as namely to
turne unto him by unfained repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to lay holde upon CHRIST by a
true faith; therefore by the onely
strength of nature, the will may desire
or will any of these acts; namely to turne
unto God by unfained repentance, to lay
hold upon CHRIST by a true faith to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unto God for the performance of
his promises to us, which in his conceipt
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65398:170"/>
is the very act of Faith, as it justifieth.</p>
            <p>I come to the assumption: where,
I confesse, in a confused generality, the
understanding, by the onely light of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
judgeth it an honest and good
thing to believe what God revealeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely,
but when you come to the
particular object of justifying Faith, viz.
that IESUS CHRIST is the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e
of GOD, and Saviour of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him; this either they will deny
to be revealed by GOD; as to the
Jewes the preaching of CHRIST cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
was a <hi>stumbling block<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (1 Cor. 1.
23.)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to the Greekes <hi>foolishnesse:</hi>
or if they doe give a kinde of assent
unto it, yet they neither doe or can
believe it by a lively and effectuall
assent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His second reason.</hi> That is no act of
justifying faith which is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nd in devils,
hereticks, hypocrites and reprobases.</p>
            <p>But this assent to divine revelations;
because of GODS authority, is to be found
in devils, hereticks, hypocrites, and repr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tes.</p>
            <p>Therefore this assent is no act of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The proposition is not univ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:65398:171"/>
true; for so much of faith as is
found in the wicked, either men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
is common to them with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and elect, and without it there can
be no faith. If therefore justifying Faith
doe assent to divine revelations, because
of GODS authority, and there can be
no justifying faith without this assent;
then it followeth, that to assent is an act
of justifying Faith.</p>
            <p>But I answer to the assumption, that
this assent (meaning a willing, lively, and
effectuall assent to the truth of GOD in
Christ) is not to be found in divels whose
assent is not so much as willing, but with
horrour, even to that which they abhor,
as himselfe confesseth; not in hereticks,
who, as they are hereticks, dissent
from the truth. For though that asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Papists, that any one act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
bereaveth a man of faith, be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and desperate; yet this is true, that
howsoever the proper object of faith, as
it justifieth, is Christ: notwithstanding by
the same faith by the which we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
we believe, not onely all other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Christian faith, but also what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
GOD hath revealed in his word:
and whosoever doth refuse to believe
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65398:171"/>
whatsoever GOD hath revealed in his
word, he hath not a true faith. Nor in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
and reprobates, whose seeming
faith is neither lively, nor true, but dead
and counterfeit, not <hi>formata,</hi> but <hi>informis.</hi>
Indeed this distinction of faith, that it is
<hi>formata</hi> or <hi>informis,</hi> according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the schoole-men and Papists is to
be rejected, and that in two respects,
first, because they propound it as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of a true justifying faith, when as
it is not possible, that that faith which
wanteth his forme, and which is dead,
and therefore hath not his true being,
should justifie: neither is it possible, that
that Faith should be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is,
effectuall, by an active efficacy, as namely
to justifie, which is called <hi>actus secundus,</hi>
which hath not the formall, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
which is called <hi>actus primus.</hi> Secondly,
because the Papists in this distinction im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that Charity is the forme of faith, and
as it were the soule thereof, which they
seeme to ground on <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 26. For
how can one habit be the forme of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
especially such an habite, as is the
fruit and consequent of the other?
For Charity which is the end of the law,
(1 Tim. 1. 5.) proceedeth from faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayned.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65398:172"/>
For when wee are by faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of GODS love towards us in
Christ then are we moved to love GOD,
and our neighbour for GODS sake, and
the more we are assured of GODS love,
the more is our heart inflamed with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
love towards GOD, as I have
shewed. And if the habit of Charity
cannot be the forme of faith, then much
lesse can good works, which are the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
fruits both of Faith and Charity; or
as the Apostle speaketh of faith <hi>quae ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur
per charitatem,</hi> which worketh by
love, Gal. 5. 6.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the Apostle St. <hi>Iames</hi>
compare workes to the soule, but
to the breath, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
(which is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to breath) doth properly signify,
and so is used in many places, where it
is called the Spirit of the mouth, and the
Spirit of the nostrils, so that the meaning
of St. <hi>Iames</hi> is, as the body without the
breath is dead, even so Faith without
good workes (which are as it were the
breathing of a lively Faith) is dead.
Not that ever it lived, but because it is
without life; as many things are said
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65398:172"/>
to be blind which never saw, and dumb
which never spake.</p>
            <p>But howsoever this distinction in the
Popish sence is to be rejected: yet it
cannot be denyed, but that as knowledge
is either literall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is an idle know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
swimming in the braine, but not
working on the heart and Conscience;
or Spirituall, which is a powerfull and
operative knowledge: so faith, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ither
a true lively and effectuall, or else a
counterfeit and a dead Faith, which
some call a bare historicall Faith, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the literall knowledge. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is called by the Apostle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in divers places, and Gal. 5. 6. It is said
to bee <gap reason="foreign">

Faith. In respect of the former, it is said
to have root; whereby I understand that
apprehensive and attractive power of
Faith in apprehending and receiving
Christ; in respect of the latter, it is said
to be fruitfull and working by love; the
latter, which is not unfained, is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
having neither roote, Luke 8. 13. Nor
fruit, and therefore is, as St <hi>Iames</hi> saith,
<hi>dead,</hi> (Jam. 2. 20. 26.) Now as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit

and dead Faith, which is the
faith of hypocrites (though it have a
