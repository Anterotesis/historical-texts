            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(Christian
Reader) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in Church affairs, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
consented unto by
all men, aiming at refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
however diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified
among themselves
by singular perswasions,

<pb facs="tcp:31106:3"/>
and assumed names
and Titles; Some of these,
though not here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
are the bottome and
foundation of this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
collection of rules for
our walking in the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Gospel: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which, these foure
are the principall:</p>
            <p>First, That particular
Congregations or Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of believers, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into one body, for a
participation of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Jesus Christ,
under officers of their
own, are of Divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That every
<pb facs="tcp:31106:3"/>
faithfull person is bound
by vertue of positive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
to joyn himself to
some such single Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
having the notes
and marks whereby a true
Church may be knowne
and discerned.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That every
man's own voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and submission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the
ordinances of Christ in
that Church whereunto
he is joyned, is required
for his union therewith,
and fellowship therein.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
of one place, are
bound to joyn themselves
in one Congregation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb facs="tcp:31106:4"/>
through their being
too numerous, they are by
common consent distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
into more: which
order cannot be distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
without the guilt of
Schisme.</p>
            <p>These principles, evident
in the Scripture, cleer in
themselves, and own'd in
the main by all pretending
to regular Church-refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
were supposed
and taken for granted, at
the collection of these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
rules.</p>
            <p>The Apostolicall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and precept in
such cases is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we have attained, we
<pb facs="tcp:31106:4"/>
should walk according to
the same rule; unto whose
performance the promise
annexed is, that if any
one be otherwise minded,
God will also reveale that
unto him. The remaining
differences about Church
Order and Discipline, are
for continuance so Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and by the disputes
of men, made so involved
and intricate; the parties
at variance so prejudiced
and engaged, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all things of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
appeare to me,
as to others, both consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with me, and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from me, cleer in the
<pb facs="tcp:31106:5"/>
Scriptures; yet I have little
hopes of the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the promise in
revelation of the truth, as
yet contested about in
men differently minded;
untill the obedience of
walking sutably and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably
to the same rules
agreed on, be more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
accomplished.</p>
            <p>This perswasion is the
more firmly fixed on me
every day, because I see
men, for the most part, to
spend their strength and
time, more in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of those things
wherein others differ from
them, then in the practice
<pb facs="tcp:31106:5"/>
of those which by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others are own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as of the most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
concernment; so that,
though the Lord hath ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
me with some pains
and difficulty, to compose
an Irenicum in the Theory
of Ecclesiasticall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
yet perswaded by
my own judgment, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
lay it aside, lest it
should provewith others,
a wandring <hi>Raven,</hi> and
choose rather to send forth
this <hi>Dove,</hi> to direct the
poor of the flock in the
practice of those Christian
duties, which are answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the rules by all
<pb facs="tcp:31106:6"/>
agreed upon, ayming in
the first place at the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the flock com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to my own care;
and in the next, to allure
all lovers of Christ in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
to walk in those
wayes which are attended
with mercy and peace, not
wanting a promise of the
revelation of hidden
truths; and in this I am
fully resolved, that the
practice of any one duty
here mentioned, by any
one soul before neglected,
shall be an abundant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
for the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my name with these
papers, savouring so little
<pb facs="tcp:31106:6"/>

in things that come to

To such it belongs principally

granting priviledges to Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

to the Pastors of Churches,
arising from such as may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
spirituall benefit by their

thankfully to be accepted and
embraced, as an issue of Gods

they love one another, from
their readiness for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment

of love in its causes, nature,
subject, fruits, effects, tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

would not suit with present

plainly affirmed, that if there

the mind and will of God,
concerning the way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which we profess, and the

rules of walking, which we
desire to practise, that so we

stop the mouths of stubborn

wounded through the sides of

more earnestnesse, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of exhortation, then
this. Now <hi>Vnity</hi> is three-fold,
First, purely spirituall,
by the participation of the
same Spirit of Grace; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
in the same Christ,
one head to all. This we have
with all the Saints in the
world, in what condition soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they be; yea, with those
that are departed, Sitting
down in the Kingdome of
Heaven, with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi>
and <hi>Jacob.</hi> Secondly, Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
or Church-communion;
in the participation of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Gospel: This is a
fruit and branch of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
opposed to Schisme, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
Rents, evill surmisings,
self-practises, causlesse diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31106:30"/>
in judgment in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things concerning the
Kingdome of Christ, with
whatsoever else goeth off
from closenesse of affection,
onenesse of mind, consent in
judgement to the forme of
wholesome words, conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of practise to the Rule; and
this is that which in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and among them, is so
earnestly pressed, commanded,
desired, as the glory of Christ,
the honour of the Gospel, the
joy and Crown of the Saints.
Thirdly, Civil Unity, or an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
in things of this life,
not contending with them,
nor about them, every one
seeking the wellfare of each
other. Striving is unseemly
for Brethren; why should they
contend about the world, who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31106:30"/>

                  <p>Motives to the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>1. The remarkable earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

who knoweth how often;
mutuall failings to be born

weaknesse to be supported, may
mind us in these pence, of the

that is without fault throw
stones at others; Some men
rejoyce in others failings; they
are malicious and fail more in
that sinfull joy, then their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

at. Some are angry at
weaknesses and infirmities;
They are proud and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
not considering that they
themselves also are in the flesh.
Some delight to dwell alwaies

to find no charity in the like

Some more studie revenge
then pardon; some pretend to

will carrie a smooth face over

Meeknesse, patience, forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

covering, removing of

Christ; seest thou thy Brother
fail, pitty him; doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

another sinne, but you must
sin too? If you be angry,
vexed, rejoyced, alienated

from, you are partner with
him in evill, instead of helping

latter part of the Rule in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
concerning Seducers;
That a judgement of discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by the spirit, rests in the
Church, and the severall Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof, is apparent, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
2. 27. 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 15. Esa.</hi> 8. 28.
To the exercise of this they
are commanded, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 1.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 15. So its commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
encouraged, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 9,
10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14. If the blind lead
the blind, both will into the
ditch: That gold may be
suspected, which would not be
tryed. Christians must chuse
the good, and refuse the evill.
If their Teachers could excuse
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31106:52"/>
them, if they lead them aside,
they might well require blind
submission from them. Now
that the Brethren may exercise
this duty aright, and performe
obedience to this Rule, it is
required,</p>
                  <p>1. That they get their senses
exercised in the word, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
good and evil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5, 14.
Especially, that they get from
the Scripture a forme of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
words, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. of
the main Truths of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and fundamentall Articles
of Religion; So that upon the
first apprehension of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they may turne away
from him that brings it, and
not bid them God speed,
2 <hi>Epist. Iohn</hi> vers. 10.</p>
                  <p>2 To be sure to attend and
hearken to nothing, but what
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31106:53"/>
comes to them in the way of
God: Some men, yea very
many in our dayes, have such
itching ears after novelty, that
they run greedily after every
one <hi>that lies in wait to deceive,
with cunning entising words;</hi> to
make out some new pretended
revelations, and this from a
pretended liberty, yea, <hi>duty</hi> of
trying all things; little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that God will have his
own work done, onely in his
own way; How they come
it makes not, so they may be
heard: Now whereas most
of the Seducers and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of our dayes, are men
apparently out of Gods way,
leaving their own callings, to
come without a call, ordinary
or extraordinary, without
providence or promise; none
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:31106:53"/>
can put himself upon hearing
of them, without tempting
God, with whom it is just and
righteous, to deliver them up
to the efficacie of Error, that
they may believe the lies they
heare. Attend only then to,
and try only that which comes
in the way of God, to others
bid not God speed.</p>
                  <p>3. To be alwaies ready fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with, and to bear in
mind the Characters, which the
Holy Ghost hath given us, in
the word, of Seducers; which
are indeed the very same,
whereby poor unstable souls
are seduced by them; As first,
that they should come in
sheep-cloathing, goodly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of innocency and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Secondly, with good

mens lusts in their Doctrine,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. Bringing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
sutable to some beloved

Fourthly, pretences of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>THere is a three-fold dutie
included in this rule, the
maine whereof, and here cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended, is that of Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition;
whereunto the first is
previous and conducing; the
latter, in some cases conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and attending Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
conversation; whether
you consider the glory of God,
and the Gospel, therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
or the bonds of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with those mutnall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments
wherein they stand
ingaged; and obligations that
are upon them for the generall
good, and spirituall edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one of another, ought to be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31106:66"/>
watched, marked, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by each other: not that
we should curiously prie into
one anothers failings; much
lesse maliciously search into
doubtfull unknown things; for
the trouble, or disparagement
of our brethren; both which are
contrary to that love; which
thinketh not evill, but covereth
a multitude of faults, but only
out of a sense of the glory of
God, the honour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and care of each others
soules; to observe their wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
that what is exemplary
therein, may be followed; what
faileth may be directed; what
is a misse may be reproved, that
in all things God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
and Christ exalted.</p>
                  <p>Now admonition is two-fold;
1. Authoritative, by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:31106:67"/>
the way of power; 2. Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
by the way of love. The
1. again is two-fold; 1. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall
by the way of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.
2. Disciplinary, which
belongeth to the whole
Church; Of these we do not
treat. The latter also is two-fold;
<hi>Hortatory,</hi> to encourage
unto good; and <hi>Monitory,</hi> to
reprove that which is amisse:
It is this last which is peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aimed at, and intended in
the rule. This then we assert,
as the duty of every Church-member
towards them with
whom he walks in fellowship;
to admonish any from the
Word, whom they perceive
not walking in any thing
with a right foot, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the Gospel, thereby to
recover his soule to the right
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:31106:67"/>
way; that much caution and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
tendernesse and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is required in the persons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
this duty; for want
whereof, it often degenerates
from a peaceable remedy of evill,
into fuell for strife and debate.
Let them then, who are called to
perform this duty, diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
these things; 1. That in the
whole action he transgresse not
that rule of charity which we
have, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 7. Gal.</hi> 6. 2. 2. Let
him have peace at home, by an
assurance of constant labouring
to cast out all beams and moates
from his own eye, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 5. 3. Let
him so perform it, that it may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
appear, that he hath no
other aime, but the glory of God,
and the good of his brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;
all envy and rejoycing in
evill being farr away. 4. Let him
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31106:68"/>
be sure to draw his admonitions
from the Word, that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God may appear therein,
and without a Word let him not
presume to speak. 5. Let all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
attending, time, place,
persons, &amp; the like, be duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all provocation in the
least manner, may be fully avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
6. Let it be considered as
an ordinance, whereunto Christ
hath an especiall regard. 7. Let
him carefully distinguish between
personall injuries unto himselfe,
whose mention must have farr
more of forgivenesse, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
and other offences tending
to publick scandall. Lastly, Let
self-examination concerning the
same or the like miscarriage, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
accompany the brotherly
admonition.</p>
                  <p>These and the like things being
duly weighed, let every brother,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31106:68"/>
with Christian courage, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
from the Word, every one
whom he judgeth to walk disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
in any particular whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
not to suffer sin upon him,
being ready to receive content
and satisfaction, upon just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or promised amendment:
and without this, in case of just
offence, a man cannot be freed
from the guilt of other mens
sins. Let also the person admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
with all Christian pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
accept of the admonition,
without any more regret of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
then he would have against
him who should break the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
wherwith he was in danger
to be slain: Considering,</p>
                  <p>1. The authoritie of him who
hath appointed it.</p>
                  <p>2. The priviledg and mercy he
enjoyeth by such a spirituall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of such a danger, or cur
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31106:69"/>
of such an evill, which perhaps
himself did not discern.</p>
                  <p>3. The dreadfull judgements
which are every where threatned

admonition from the meanest in
the Congregation.</p>
                  <p>For the last, or repairing unto
the Church in case of not prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by private admonition; our
Saviour hath so plainly laid down
both the manner and end of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. that it
needeth no explanation; only I
shall observe, that by Church
there, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Elders of the Church
alone, but rather the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;
for if the offended
brother should take with him
two or three of the Elders unto
the offender (as he may) then
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:31106:69"/>
were they the Church, and the
Church should be told of the
offence before the reproof hath
been managed by two or three,
which is contrary to the rule.</p>
