            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is a truth evident in experience, That Gods diſpenſations towards the righteous and the wicked in this life, are like <hi>Jacobs</hi> dealing with <hi>Joſephs</hi> Sonnes, croſſe and ſtrange: <hi>For as he laid his right hand on the younger, and his left on the Elder,</hi>

and in afflicting the good, renders not according to their deeds, and ſo is unjuſt: Hence it is, that in ſuch times the wicked ſwell with the timpany of pride, and the weak pine away in a fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting conſumption; thoſe are impoſtumated with ſelfe-conceit, and theſe are inflamed with paſſion: the cure of both, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the latter, (to wit envious fretting at the wickeds proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) our Prophet indeavours in this <hi>Pſalme:</hi> The medicine which he preſcribes, is made up of various ingredients, amongſt which, none more operative then a due meditation of Gods finall retribution, both to the godly, and ungodly: which as it is principally inſiſted on throughout the whole; ſo is it ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly recommended in the cloſe, and in particular the quiet end of the juſt, both aſſerted and aſſured for our ſupport, and incouragement in the words of the Text, <hi>Mark the perfect, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Et quis id ſibi arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re andet, quod</hi> Paulus <hi>ipſe fatetur, ſe non comprehendiſſe?</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> excellently; and who is ſo arrogant as to think himſelf more holy then this chief Apoſtle? but yet <hi>let God be true, and every man a lyar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> who affirmes that of <hi>Job,</hi> which he denies of himſelf, that he was a <hi>perfect and an upright man?</hi> Chap. 1. 1. Let not Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was immediately inſpired, be thought to contradict himſelf, who in the forementioned place, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. reckons himſelf among thoſe that are perfect, <hi>Let us, as many as be perfect be thus minded,</hi> that therefore theſe ſeeming contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be reconciled, and the nature of this perfection unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: be pleaſed to obſerve theſe diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>1. Divines well diſtinguiſh of a double perfection, it is <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luta,</hi> or <hi>comporata.</hi> That is abſolutely <hi>perfect,</hi> to which nothing (that may be accounted truly good) is wanting: and thus he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117701:5"/>
onely is <hi>perfectus</hi> who is <hi>infectus:</hi> God, who made all things and himſelf is not made, only injoying an all-ſufficient perfection, in, and of himſelf. That is comparatively <hi>perfect,</hi> in which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome wants, there is a fulneſſe compared with others.</p>
            <p>Thus every Saint is <hi>perfect,</hi> in compariſon of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, among whom he liveth. In this reſpect it is ſaid of <hi>Noah, That he was a perfect man in his generations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 9.</note> his grace compared with the wickedneſſe of the Old World, well deſerving the name of perfection; indeed every upright man is <hi>perfect</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of them who are openly bad, or but openly good; ſtained with wickedneſſe, or but painted with holineſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus one Saint may be <hi>perfect,</hi> if compared with another, the ſtrong Chriſtian in reſpect of the weak, whom he out-ſtrips in Grace and Piety: ſuch Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meanes, when he ſaith, <hi>We ſpeak wiſdome among them that are perfect:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 6.</note> that is, ſuch as have attained to greater meaſures of grace then others. It was ſaid of <hi>Benajah, He was more honourable then thirty, but he attained not to the firſt three;</hi>

            <p>Intrinſecall perfection ſo called becauſe by inheſion, is no leſſe rationally then uſually thus diſtinguiſhed, there is <hi>perfectio partium</hi> and <hi>gradium:</hi> He is ſaid to be <hi>perfect, cui nihil de eſt,</hi>

               <hi>eorum, quae ad ſtatum ſalutis neceſſaria,</hi> who wants no graces that accompanie ſalvation; or he is perfect, <hi>Cui nihil deeſt in gradibus gratiarum &amp; virtutum:</hi> who is not defective in the meaſures of thoſe graces: both theſe are frequently, and firly illuſtrated by the reſemblance of a child, and a grown man; the one whereof hath all the eſſentiall and integrall parts of a man, the other a compleat uſe and meaſure of thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>If we ſpeak of the latter kind of perfection, there never was, nor ſhall be, nor can any meer man in this life attaine unto it; indeed <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men</hi> in Heaven are <hi>perfecti,</hi> made <hi>perfect,</hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t imitemur,</hi> let's mark the upright man ſo as to imitate him, eye his ſteps, ſo as to tread in them: 'Tis Gods goodneſſe to afford, and ſhould be our wiſdome to make uſe of the Godly, <hi>Tanquam ſtatuas Mercuriales,</hi> as Travellours doe of thoſe Statues which are ſet to point forth the way unto them. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Saints of the Old Teſtament, <hi>a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> alluding, no doubt, to that <hi>pillar of a cloud</hi> which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſſe to lead them the way.<note place="margin">Exod. 13. 21.</note> So ſhould our eye be fixt on thoſe Saints that are gone before us, or that live amongſt us, as a cloud for our direction in the way to heaven.

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 16.</note> we muſt be ſo of every <hi>upright</hi> man, and to that end <hi>marke</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Behold the upright man</hi> in the cloſe of his death, and this is that I conceive the Pſalmiſt chiefly aimes at: So <hi>Tremellius</hi> his reading plainly manifeſts, <hi>Obſerva integrum, &amp; aſpire rectum, finem illius eſſe pacem: Obſerve the perfest, and behold the upright, that the end of this man is peace.</hi> He calls for, not a tranſient view, but a permanent aſpect; as an Archer having ſhot an Arrow, takes not off his Eye untill he ſees it fall, ſo muſt we with a fixed eye behold the <hi>upright,</hi> til we ſee what becomes of him. This was that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> wills thoſe to whom he wrote, to doe in reference to <hi>Job;</hi> both to look upon him in that way of patience wherein he trod, <hi>You have heard of the patience of</hi> Job:<note place="margin">James 5. 11.</note> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in that end which happened to him, <hi>And have ſeen the end of the Lord.</hi> Indeed, this is that duty which concernes us in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117701:14"/>
both to the good and bad, to look upon them not in their preſent, but future ſtate. This world is as a <hi>ſtage,</hi> whereon both the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> and the <hi>Hypocrite;</hi> the <hi>Perfect,</hi> and the <hi>Wicked,</hi> are <hi>Actors</hi> and that which in both of theſe we ought chiefly to be <hi>Spectatours</hi> of, is their <hi>Exit:</hi> not ſo much how they come on, as how they go off: in regard of the Wicked this was it which <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſh'd the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to faſten their eyes upon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> had rebelliouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt him and <hi>Aaron;</hi> he calls the people to a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their end, <hi>If theſe men die the common death of all men, or if they be viſited after the viſitation of all men, then the Lord hath not ſent me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 16. 29.</note> And in regard of the Good, 'tis that which here <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> would have us chiefly to take notice of, <hi>his end is peace;</hi> not is it without good reaſon, ſince by this meanes we ſhall beſt rectifie our judgements, and avoid falſe cenſures: <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in regard of the Good, leſt we condemne him as miſerable in thoſe afflictions he undergoes: What Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes in another caſe concerning the Saints, <hi>If in this life onely we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable:</hi>

               <note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 7.</note> let me give to you, in reference to this duty, <hi>Annoynt your eyes with the eye-ſalve</hi> of the Spirit, that you may rightly diſcerne, and wiſely judge of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.

               <hi>of the reward,</hi> that bliſſefull peace which in the end ſhall be conferred on all them who walk before God <hi>in Truth,</hi> and with a <hi>perfect</hi> heart, according to this of the Pſalmiſt in the Text, <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with my Text, but I muſt not end here. <hi>Behold,</hi> another Text lies before us fit to be read, and peruſed by us. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> maketh mention of a cuſtome among the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> to ſet the dead Bodies of their Friends in glazed Sepulchres, that their proportions might be obvious to the paſſengers; how needleſſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that cuſtome was, 'tis doubtleſſe no more then juſt, that the pious lineaments of their mindes <hi>who die in the Lord,</hi> ſhould be preſented to the living in the mirrour of Art. Indeed commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation after Death, is the tribute of a Religious life: Good works are Jewels, not to be lockt up in a Cabinet, but to be ſet forth to publique view. If Chriſt would have <hi>Maries</hi> name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the Goſpell unto the Worlds end for <hi>one box of oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> poured on his Head; we cannot imagine that he would have the many pious and charitable deeds of his ſervants to be buried in <hi>Oblivion.</hi> Conſult the Scriptures, and you ſhall ſcarce finde any godly Man laid in his Grave without an Epitaph of Honour. View the Fathers, &amp; you ſhall obſerve it their practice to honor the death of the Good, by giving them their deſerved prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: So did <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to <hi>Theodoſius, Nazianzen</hi> to <hi>Athanaſius, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> to <hi>Nepotian;</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> to <hi>Malachias,</hi> and <hi>Gerard.</hi> The truth is, in reciting the vertuous acts of Dead perſons, we doe not ſo much advantage them, as benefit our ſelves. What doe they need glory on Earth, who are glorified in Heaven? <hi>Noſtrâ intereſt non ipſorum,</hi>

            <p>It cannot then (at leaſt juſtly) offend any religious Ear, if I ſhall endeavour to delineate the ſingular worth of this illuſtrious Knight, whoſe Funeralls we now ſolemnize. And here it fares with me, as with a man in a Garden, full of choice Flowers, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117701:15"/>
knowes not where to pick: abundance of matter, making me almoſt barren of expreſſion. As for a compleat Enumeration of his Virtues, 'tis a work which neither my ſcant Abilities can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, nor will the ſcantling of time permit. It cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that a good Life, which hath been weaving a piece of Graces for threeſcore yeares, and upward, can be ſpread before you in a few minutes. Beſides, the Hiſtory of his Life, and Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Worth, calls for a <hi>Livie</hi> rather then a <hi>Florus;</hi> a <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> rather then a <hi>Phocion</hi> to undertake it. I want time to draw his Picture to the length, and skill to doe it to the Life: yet, <hi>Ex pede Herculem,</hi> ſpare me but your patience a while, and I ſhall (though rudely) draw ſome few lineaments, by which you may gueſſe at the reſt.</p>
            <p>Let it not then be accounted flattery, if I take up the firſt part of the Text, and apply it in particular to him: <hi>Mark this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and behold</hi> this <hi>upright Man. Mark</hi> him in his Life, how Exemplary? <hi>Behold</hi> him in his Death, how Happy?</p>
            <p>Not to expatiate in the Characters of his Life, I ſhall limit my diſcourſe, by a double conſideration: <hi>Mark</hi> him as a Magiſtrate, <hi>Behold</hi> him as a Man; <hi>Mark</hi> him as a publique Governour, <hi>Behold</hi> him as a private Chriſtian; and in both (ſetting aſide Humane Frailties.) you ſhall finde him well worthy theſe Characters in the Text, <hi>Perfect,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To make up a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> Magiſtrate, two things are eſpecially requiſite: Wiſdom in diſcerning, Impartiallity in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: both of which were eminent in this Worthy, whom God indued with a perſpicacious eye, to diſcerne between things that differ; and a reſolute heart to doe juſtly, without any reſpect to perſons. He was farre from <hi>Caſars</hi> temper, who ſaid, <hi>Melior cauſa</hi> Caſſii; <hi>ſed denegare</hi> Bruto, <hi>nihil poſſum: Caſſius</hi> his cauſe is better, but I cannot deny my Friend <hi>Brutus.</hi> Private reſpects could not ſway him in publique Cenſures; he put off all relations to a Friend, when he put on the Robes of a Magiſtrate; he was neither backward to encourage Virtue, nor yet to puniſh Vice, and though otherwiſe, of a tender, and melting diſpoſition, yet in matters of Judicature he was wont to ſay, <hi>A fooliſh pitty, is Cruelty.</hi> In ſumme, the integrity of his Spirit, in adminiſtration of Juſtice was ſo evident, that I doubt not, but many in this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117701:16"/>
Congregation who ſat with him in publick Courts can abundantly atteſt it: It pleaſed this City to put him upon ſeverall places of great Truſt and Honour; &amp; not many years ſince, he was thought worthy to be inveſted with the higheſt Office of Dignity and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; in which he behaved himſelf ſo Faithfully, Couragiouſly, &amp; Diſcreetly, that I may juſtly ſay, <hi>His place did not ſo much honor him, as he his Place.</hi> A true Patriot indeed he was, loſing, for a time, his Liberty, hazarding his Eſtate, ſhall I ſay his Life? for the defence of this <hi>City,</hi> which he then conceived to be ſurrounded with dangers.</p>
            <p>2. You have ſeen his ſteps as a Magiſtrate, <hi>behold</hi> him now as a Chriſtian: A <hi>perfect,</hi> and an <hi>upright</hi> Saint is one, who, though not exactly, yet intentionally obſerves the precepts of both Tables; giving (at leaſt in deſire, and endeavour) to God and Man, that which of right belongs unto them. Of both theſe, we ſhall finde him a moſt conſpicuous Patterne.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Behold</hi> him in his <hi>Religion,</hi> he was one who Copied out his Life, according to the Old way of Chriſtianity; wherein he writ ſo fair a Hand, that I believe few come near him. In his <hi>Deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> he was neither fooliſhly Factious, nor Popiſhly Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: He <hi>Worſhiped</hi> God <hi>in that way,</hi> which the Papiſts call <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> and Schiſmatiques call <hi>Popery.</hi> His delight was fervent in, and therefore his repaire frequent to the Houſe of God; eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Proverb) thoſe Garments moſt Gay, which were ſullied with the duſt of the Temple. And as his often addreſſes to theſe publique places of Worſhip whilſt he lived: ſo the large ſummes of Money he gave to the Edifying, and Repairing of them when he Died, fully proclaime that to be true of him, which <hi>David</hi> ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>The zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 9.</note> Singular was his reverence in attending to Gods Word, and affectionate his reſpect to the diſpenſors of it, <hi>Eſteeming them highly in love for their workes ſake;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>2. You have ſeen him in relation to God, behold him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Men, and truly, in what relation ſoever you pleaſe to view him, you ſhall find him Praiſe-worthy. Whilſt bleſt with a Conſort, he was an affectionate Husband. Towards his Children a tender Father. To his Servants, a loving and helpfull Maſter. To his acquaintance a faithfull Friend, and in his Commerce with all men, a juſt Dealer. I cannot ſtay to inlarge on any of theſe, onely let me preſent to you, that Grace of Charity wherein I am confident he out-ſtript many, though otherwiſe of equall rank with him. As God had bleſſed him with a fair Eſtate, ſo he gave him a large Heart: nor was he more carefull by induſtry to get, then forward by Charity to give.

               <hi>Two hundred Pounds;</hi> beſides various other Gifts to ſeverall Hoſpitalls; For the Releaſing of Priſoners, and the like. And that which was moſt deſervedly imitable in him, was that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the <hi>light</hi> of his good Workes to be carried before, as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. He made his owne <hi>Eyes</hi> the <hi>Over-ſeers,</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> the <hi>Executors</hi> of his Charitable minde: Witneſſe, beſides many private, and perſonall Reliefs, that ample Guift of <hi>Five hundred Pounds</hi> which in his life he beſtowed on <hi>Chriſts Hoſpitall,</hi> of which he was ſometimes a <hi>Preſident.</hi> And which was no ſmall incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to him, and may be to others, in ſhewing workes of Mercy, he found that he gathered by ſcattering, his Store en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by Diſtributing; and that <hi>Bread</hi> againe in his Cupboard which he had <hi>caſt on the Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſidering all this which hath been ſaid, (whereof not one tittle is more then what I either knew my ſelfe, or have beene credibly informed of:) I think <hi>Envie</hi> it ſelfe cannot deny him (nn an Evangelicall ſenſe) the title of a <hi>Perfect,</hi> (or if that may be too much, yet of an <hi>

            </p>
            <p>There is yet one Character more, which the Vulgar reading affords, and I cannot omit, it ſo fitly agrees with him: and that is, <hi>Vir Pacificus,</hi> he was a Man of Peace; he much deſired unity in Affection, where there was diverſity of Opinion; and therefore he was wont to ſay, <hi>There ſhould be more love amongst us: If my Friend differ from me in Judgement, let me ſhew love to his Perſon, though I diſlike his Opinion; and let me pray that God would direct him in the right way.</hi> Neither his Prayers, nor Counſells were wanting to the peace of Church and State: which peaceable diſpoſition, however in this our contention; Age it be accounted a Crime, yet, I am ſure in Gods eſteeme, 'tis a Pearl of great Price; and whilſt Men look upon ſuch as their Enemies; God reckons them as his Children.</p>
            <p>To ſhut up this, it was a notable ſpeech of <hi>Antigonus</hi> when <hi>Zeno</hi> died; <hi>Quale theatrum amiſt?</hi> Meaning that in his life he beheld a repreſentation of many excellent Virtues, with which he was inamour'd.

               <hi>Courteſie; Charity,</hi> and <hi>Frugality; Zeale,</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better reſemble him then to the ſtone <hi>Garamantides,</hi> which, though it caſt no great luſtre outwardly, <hi>Tamen intus habet aureas guttas;</hi> Yet hath golden drops within; his delight being more in internall ſincerity, then in Externall ſhowes.</p>
            <p>To draw to an end, <hi>his end</hi> muſt needs be comfortable, whoſe life was ſo profitable; and indeed ſo it was; There were a paire of Virtues, worthy our obſervation, which he expreſs'd in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Confidence.</hi> A quiet ſubmiſſion to Gods will, and a ſweet repoſe in Gods mercie; Both which, though oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity favour'd not me to be a perſonall witneſſe of, yet I doubt not but my reverend Brother (who officiates in this place, and was often with him) can ſufficiently atteſt. The pangs of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe (which could not but be grievous) he under-went with a quiet cheerfulneſſe. And when his friends that ſtood by him, minded him of making his peace with God; He returned this Anſwer, (worthy to be written in Letters of Gold, and fit to be engraven on all our hearts) <hi>Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth; old age and ſickneſſe are no fit times to make peace w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

He dyed in peace, in his owne houſe, not in a priſon, after all his ſufferings, quietly breathing forth his laſt, in his owne bed. And which was beſt, he dyed with a quiet mind, in that comfortable ſenſe he had of his reconciliation to God, through faith in the merits of his Saviour. Nor muſt I forget to apply the vulgar reading of this latter clauſe in my Text, to him, <hi>There are remainders to this peacefull man;</hi> The relict of an hopefull poſterity: God lengthning his dayes ſo far, as to <hi>ſee</hi> not onely his <hi>children,</hi> but his <hi>childs children:</hi> upon whoſe heads, I doubt not, but his graces, through Gods mercy, will procure a plentifull ſhowre of bleſſings to be poured down. And not onely ſo, but to him likewiſe there was the <hi>remainder</hi> of a good name; like a Taper of pure wax, he burn'd clearly in his life, and hath left a ſweet ſavour behind him at his going out. And as I hope his ſoule now partakes of that glory which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

for the Saints; ſo to his body that muſt now be-laid in the Grave, there is the <hi>remainder</hi> of a glorious reſurrection, to that immortall bliſſe which is reſerv'd in heaven for all them that love the appearing of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Let not then his Children or Allies grieve beyond meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not without hope: let them not ſpend too many teares in vaine upon his grave, but rather let them, and all we who know him, eſteeme his <hi>Memory bleſſed;</hi> and though we can now no longer <hi>marke</hi> him going before us, or <hi>behold</hi> him converſing among us, yet let us ſtill remember him, and that ſo, as to reſemble him: let us ſo imitate thoſe graces which here he practiſed, that we may come at laſt to be with him, in that glory whereof he is now poſſeſt for ever.</p>
