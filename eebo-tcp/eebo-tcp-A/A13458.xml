            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Did not write nor publish (this description of fire and water triumphs) to the entent that they should onely reade the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that were spectators of them for to such (perhaps) it will relish some what tedious like a tale that is too often told: but I did write these things, that those who are far remoted, not onely in his Maistties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but also in foraine territories, may have an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the glorious pomp, and magnificent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our high and mighty Monarch King <hi>Iames</hi>: and further, to demonstrate the skils and knowledges that our warlike nation hath in engines fire-works and other millitary discipline, that there by may be knowne,
<pb facs="tcp:2597:4"/>
that howsoeuer warre seemes to sléepe, yet (vpon any lawfull ground or occasion) the command of our dread Soueraigne can rouse hir to the terrour of al malignant opposers of his royall state and dignity. But to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>In this representation of a Sea-fight there were 16. Ships, 16. Gallies and 6. Friggots: of the which Nauy, the Ships were Christians and the Gallies were supposed Turkes, all being artificially rig'd and trim'd, well man'd and furnished with great ordinance and Musquettiers: one of the Christian fleet was a great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssell or a supposed <hi>Venetian Argosey,</hi> and another was a tall Ship, as it were appointed for the safe Conuoye of the <hi>Argosey.</hi> And for the auoyding of the troublesom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Boates and Wherries, and other perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous multitudes, there was a lists or bounds made with Lighters, Hayes, and other great Boates to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 250. or there abouts: the one end of the Lists was as high (almost) as Lambeth bridge, and the other ende as low as the Temple staires, and so fastned to the sowth shore, or the vpper end of the bancks on sowth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke side, in the forme of a halfe Moone or Cemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle, So that Boates might passe vp and downe the river betwixt <hi>London</hi> side and the Lighters any way. The aforesaid Turketh Gallies lying all at an Anchor euer against Westminster, in a hauen or harbor made artificially with Masts and other prouision, 60. yards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River, which harbor or hauen was belonging to a supposed Turkish or Barbarian Castle of <hi>Tunis, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geirs,</hi> or some other Mahometan fortification, where the Gallies might scowt out for purchase, and retire in againe for safeguard at their pleasure. About 2. of the clocke on satterday the 13. of February, the aforsaid <hi>Argosev</hi> and the other <hi>Venetian</hi> ship hir conuoy, sets forward from ward the Temple, and driuing vp with the winde and tide til they came as high as Yorke house,
<pb facs="tcp:2597:4"/>
where 4. Gallies met and encountred with them: where vpon a suddaine there was friendly exchanging of smal shot and great ordinance on both sides, to the great delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all the beholders: the Drummes, Trumpets, Fises, Weights, Guns, showts, &amp; acclamations of the Mariners, Soldiers and spectators, with such reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating Echoes of ioy to and fro, that there wanted nothing in this fight (but that which was fit to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) which was ships sunk and torne in peices, men groning, rent and dismembred, some slaine, some drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, some maimed, all expecting confusion. This was the manner of the happy and famons battell of <hi>Lepanto</hi> fought betwixt the Turks and the Christians, in the yeare of grace 1571. or in this bloody manner was the memorable battaile betwixt vs and the inuincible (as it was thought) Spanish <hi>Armado</hi> in the yeare 1588. but in the end, in this frendly fight) the ship and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gosey</hi> were encompassed round by the Galleies, and surprizde and taken: whereupon, the whole Fléet made towards them to rescue them, and reuenge their recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued iniuries.</p>
                  <p>Then there was a Eeacon flered by the Turkes which gaue warning to the Castle and the Galleyes, of the comming of the Christian Fléete: Then all the Ships and Galleyes met in freíndly opposition and y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary hurley-burley battalions: then the lofty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Wars clamorous encouragements soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: the thundring Artillary roared, the Musqueteirs in numberles volleys discharged on al sides, the smoake (as it were) ecclipsing <hi>Titans</hi> refulgent Beames, filling all the Ayre with a confused cloudy mist. The Castle and the Land adiacent, continually dischardging great shot in aboundance at the Ships, and the Ships at them againe: so that after this delightfull battaile had dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lasted thrée houres, to the great contentment of all the beholders, the Uictorie inclyning to neither side,
<pb facs="tcp:2597:5"/>
all being opposed foes, and combyned friends: all vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, all tryumphers, none to be vanguishd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no conquerors. The Drums, Trumphets, Flutes and Guns, filling the ayre with repurrussiue acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: vpon which, for a Catastrophe or Period to these delightfull royalties, commaund was giuen that the Retreat should be sounded on both sides. And thus these Princely rocreations were accomplished and finished.</p>
                  <p>THese things could not conueniently be printed in order as they were done, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the diuersitie of them.</p>
                  <p>For heere I was faine to describe the fight of the ships &amp; Gallyes first, which was performed last. For the Fire-workes were performed on Thurs-day night the 11. of <hi>February,</hi> and the fight was vpon the Saterday following.</p>
                  <p>At the which fire-workes the maister Gunner of England, on the shore did performe many skilfull and ingenious exploits with great Bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, shooting vp many artificiall balls of fire into the ayre, which flew vp in one whole fierie ball, &amp; in their falling dispearsed into diuers streams like Raine-bowes in many innumerable fires. After all which, was discharged a great peale of Chambers, to the contentment of the royall spectators, and the great credit of the performers.</p>

And for her sure Gard in her absence, he had erected by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, another strong Tower, as a watch house, wherein he had placed a fiery Dragon, and an inuincible Giant: (of whome I will speake in another place héereafter.)</p>
                  <p>Now to this aforesaid Pauillion wearyed with toyle and trauaile, the Great vnresistable Champion of the world, and the vncontrolable Patron Saint <hi>George</hi> comes: and séeing so bright and luculent a Goddesse, (according as his necessitie required) demanded entertainment, whereby he might be refreshed after his laborious atchiuements, and honorable endeuours.</p>
                  <p>The curteous Quéene (although the car'd not for the soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of man) séeing his outward or externall feature and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like acouterments, did presently resolue with her selfe that so faire an outside could not be a habitation for fowle Trechery, and with most debonayre gesture, admits his entrance into the Pauilion, where after he had feasted a while, she relates vnto him the true manner and occassion, of her vnfortunate thraldome: Saint <hi>George</hi> (euer taking pleasure in most dangerous attempts, holding it his chiefest glory to helpe wronged Ladies) vowes, that as soone as <hi>Rhoebus</hi> rowz'd himselfe from the Antipodes, he would quest the burning Dragon, Conquer the big bon'd Giant, subuert the inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Castle, and enfranchise the Quéene with her followers, or else die in the enterprise thereof. After which promise of his, the Quéene to passe away the time, delights him with these pastimes following, being all fire-workes.</p>
                  <p>First, the Pauilion is beleagerd or inuirond round about with fires, going out of which, many fiery balls flies vp into

                  <p>Secondly, is séene a royall hunting of Bucks, and Hounds, and Hunts-men, flying and chasing one another round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Pauilion (as if <hi>Diana</hi> had lately transformed <hi>Acte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and his ignorant dogges ready to prey on his Carkas) from whence continually is flying many fiers dispearsed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way: The lower part of the Pauilion alwayes burning round about, giuing many blowes, and great reports, with many fires flying aloft into the Ayre.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there doth march round about the Pauilion Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall men, which shall cast out fires (as before) as it were in skirmish: another part of the Pauilion is all in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustious flame, where Rackets, Crackers, Breakers, and such like, giues blowes and reports without number.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Quéene of <hi>Amazonia</hi> with all her traine of Virgin Ladyes, with fires, marcheth round as the men did before, with the fire flying despearsedly diuers wayes: the whilst another part of the Pauilion is fired, with many blowes and reports, and fiers flying aloft into the ayre, from whence it comes downe againe in streaching flakes of slash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, aloft with the Turret, shall runns (whirling rownd) a fyerie Globe, with the Turret and all on fire, with many more greater blowes then before had bin heard, and diuers and sundry other sorts of fires (then any of the former) procéeding from thence, and flying into the ayre in great aboundance.</p>
                  <p>All which things being performed, and the vndanted Knight Saint <hi>George</hi> taking his leaue of the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Queene <hi>Lucida,</hi> he mounts vppon his Stéede, and aduente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously rides towards the inchanted Towre of <hi>Brumond.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THis inchanted Castle or Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of <hi>Brumond</hi> is in hight 40. foote and 30 square, betwéene which and the Pauilion of the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Quéene, is a long Bridge, on the which Bridge, the valiant and heroicke Champion Saint <hi>George</hi> being mounted on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, makes towards the Castle of <hi>Brumond,</hi> which being perceaued by the watchfull Dragon, (who was left by <hi>Mango</hi> the Coniurer as a Centenell) is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by him, where as Saint <hi>George</hi> (being armed at all points (but especially) with an vnrebated courage) hauing in his Helmet a burning flaming Feather, and in one hand a burning Launce, and in the other a fiery Sword, with which weapons he assailes the dreadfull Dragon, with such fury and Monster-quelling streakes, as if the Ciclops had bin forging, and beating Thunder bolts on <hi>Vulcans</hi> Anuile: where in conclusion, after a terrible and long endured Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, with his Launce he gores the Hellehound vnder the wing, that he presently aftermost hideous roring, and belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fire, is vanguished and slaine: at which the terrible shaped Giant rises (who hauing sate as a spectator of this
<pb facs="tcp:2597:9"/>
bloudy battel vpon a great stump of a trée at the Castle Gate) and adresses himselfe towards Saint <hi>George,</hi> meaning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the death of the Dragon, and to swallow his enemy for a modieum: but at their first encounter, the blowes on both sides fell like Thunder clappes, enforcing lightning, and fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exhalations to sparkle, from whence their powerfull stroakes lighted: at last the Monstar gaping wide, as an Arch in London Bridge, runnes furiously, intending to swallow his aduersary at a bit: which Saint <hi>George</hi> seeing, vpon the suddaine thrust his Sword into his gréedy throat and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threwe him: at which the Monster yelles and rores forth such a terrible noyse, as if the Center of the earth had crackt, that with the vncouth dinne thereof, the Neighbouring hills, woods, and valleyes, séemed to tremble like an earth quake.</p>
                  <p>The Gyane lying at the mercy of Saint <hi>George,</hi> entreats him to spare his life, and he will shewe him the way how he shall conquer the Castle, and bring the inchanter to his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting downefall.</p>
                  <p>Upon which promise, Saint <hi>George</hi> and the Gyant walke into the Castle together, where he tells Saint <hi>George</hi> that there is an enchanted fountaine, and whosoeuer can attaine to drinke of it, shall be he whome the Fates haue ordained to be the conclusion of the Castles glory.</p>
                  <p>In the meane space, whilst these things were doing, the Magitian <hi>Mango,</hi> hauing intelligence of the dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of his Castle, and fearing the losse of his Lady: sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely mounts him on a flying inuinsible deuill, and in a moment alights within the Castle, vpon whome St. <hi>George</hi> makes a prosent conquest.</p>
                  <p>The Castle hath on the top thereof a fiery Fountaine, which burnes and sends vp Rackets into the ayre, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reports and blowes: some great, and some lesse, and fire dispearsed many wayes in great aboundance with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable lights round about.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Magitian is taken with his Coniuring Scepter in his hand, and bound to a Pillar by Saint <hi>George</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2597:9"/>
and burned, with store of lights (as before) with fiers and. Rackets ascending and descending too and fro in the ayre.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the foure squares of the Tower are stered, with abundance of lights, with Rackets flying into the ayre, with hers dispearsed, and scattered diuers and sundry wayes, and with reports and blowes, some great, and some lesse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their making.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the fours Turrets are fyred with fire, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable lights, with aboundance of Rackets flying to and fro in the ayre, giuing diuers reports, as before.</p>
                  <p>Then the maine Castle is fyered, and vpon two of the corner Terrets are two Globes fyered, and betwixt each Globe at two other corner Turrets, are two men, catching as it were at the Globes which still turne from them, and they chassing and following the Globes, still burning and turning till all be extinguished with fire: alwayes Rackets flying and reports thwacking, and lights burning.</p>
