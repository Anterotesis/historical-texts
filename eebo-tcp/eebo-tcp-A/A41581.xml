         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Of the ſeveral Ends of Laying on of Hands, in the New
Teſtament.</head>
            <p>FOr the better underſtanding of this great Controverſy, of
late raiſed, about <hi>Laying on of Hands;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall firſt conſider the ſeveral Ends, of <hi>Laying on of
Hands,</hi> practiſed in the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Upon ſearch we finde, this Rice or Ceremony was uſed, upon a
threefold Account, or to a threefold End.</p>
            <p>1. For Healing or recovering the ſick.</p>
            <p>2. For miniſtring or giving the extraordinary gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit.</p>
            <p>3. For Ordaining and appointing of Officers.</p>
            <p>1. For Healing or recovering the ſick. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 18. They
ſhall Lay Hands on the ſick, and they ſhall recover.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts.</hi> 28. 8. The father of <hi>Publius</hi> lay ſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> laid
his Hands on him, and healed him.</p>
            <p>2. For miniſtring, or giving the Holy Spirit. To this end <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>John</hi> Laid their Hands on them at <hi>Samaria. Acts</hi> 8. 17,
18, 19. Then laid they their Hands on them and they received
the Holy Spirit. And when <hi>Simon</hi> ſaw, that through Laying on
of the Apoſtles Hands, the Holy Spirit was given, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that hereby is meant the extraordinary Gifts of the holy
ly Spirit, nothing is more evident. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. it is ſaid, they Believed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. that they had received the Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. that they were Baptized.</p>
            <p>All which could not be, unleſs they had already received the
ordinary meaſures of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Further it is yet more evident from the Text it ſelf; for after
all this, it is ſaid, They received the Holy Spirit by Laying on of
Hands, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>And that before this, the Holy Spirit was fallen upon none of
them. <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16: A phraſe, peculiar to the extraordinary Gifts
of the Holy Spirit, See <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44. and 11. 15.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:38466:3"/>
            <p>It is yet further evident, for the Falling of the Holy Spirit on
them, was ſo viſible, that <hi>Simon</hi> ſaw it. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. And thereupon
<hi>ver.</hi> 19. he ſaith, Give me alſo this power, that on whomſoever
I lay Hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>And that they Laid their Hands to this end, the Text is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,
<hi>ver.</hi> 17. They laid their Hands, and they received the
Holy Spirit. And (<hi>ver.</hi> 18.) through Laying on of Hands, the
Holy Spirit was given.</p>
            <p>So that you ſee clearly, they laid on their Hands, to give the
extraordinary or miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>But, ſay ſome, the words of <hi>Simon ver.</hi> 18. 19. are reproved by
<hi>Peter, ver.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
            <p>To which we anſwer: <hi>Simon</hi> is not reproved for what he had
aſſerted, that he had ſeen; for, that was true. But, that he would
have purchaſed this gift and power, with money; Herein lay his
wickedneſs. Becauſe thou haſt thought, that the gift of God may
be purchaſed with money, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>Upon this account alſo <hi>Paul</hi> laid his Hands on the twelve men
at <hi>Epheſus, Act.</hi> 19. 6. And when <hi>Paul</hi> had laid his Hands
upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they ſpake with
Tongues, and prophecied.</p>
            <p>And, that by the Holy Spirit here, is meant the extraordinary
Gifts of the Spirit, is clear: becauſe <hi>ver.</hi> 2. it is ſaid, they believed.
Now none can believe without the Holy Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. But
moſt clear in the Text it ſelf; for the Holy Spirit, came ſo on
them, that they immediatly thereupon, ſpake with Tongues and
propheſied. A phraſe noting the higheſt meaſures of the Spirit,
that ever were attained; yea the Baptiſm of the Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 4.
and 10. 44, 45, 46.</p>
            <p>3. For Ordaining or appointing of Officers.</p>
            <p>To this end, <hi>Timothy</hi> had hands laid on him, by the Presbytery
or Elderſhip. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. and that this was for the Miniſtry, the
whole context proveth, from <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. to the end. So alſo, 2 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi>
1. 6. is to be underſtood, <hi>Paul</hi> being one of the Presbytery:
and there alſo, about the Text, Miniſteriall gifts are ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>If any object from theſe two places, that there is a gift ſpoken
of, that <hi>Timothy</hi> received by laying on of Hands.</p>
            <p>To this we Anſwer: that we verily perſwade our ſelves, that
none, who rightly come into this office in ſincerity and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God, and in love and duty to his Church, but may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38466:3"/>
expect the bleſſing of God to the increaſe of their gifts,
and experience doth abundantly reſtifie to the truth of this.</p>
            <p>We further find upon enquiry, that all the ſtanding Officers
in the New Teſtament, were ſet apart unto their Miniſtery, by
this Rite or Ceremony.</p>
            <p>1. Meſſengers. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſent out by the
Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 2, 3. As they miniſtred to the Lord, the holy
Spirit ſaid, Separate me <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> for the worke
whereunto I have called them, and when they had faſted and
prayed, and laid their hands on them, they ſent them away.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the Meſſengers of the Churches were appointed
to their work, by Laying on of Hands.</p>
            <p>2. Elders, or over-ſeers. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. Lay Hands ſuddenly
on no man.</p>
            <p>And that this was ſpoken in reference to Elders, the whole
context before prooveth, from <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. where the Apoſtle treats
expreſly of Elders, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. Let the Elders, <hi>&amp;c: Verſ.</hi> 19. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

on no man, <hi>viz.</hi> Elders, before ſpoken of. That is, ordaine no
man an Elder ſuddenly, or raſhly, or too haſtily, without ſome
due tryall, and conſideration had of his gifts, fitneſſe, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,

            </p>
            <p>3. Deacons. Thus the 7 Deacons were appointed to their
worke, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 3, 5, 6. in expreſſe termes.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee all the New Teſtament-Officers were appointed
by Laying on of Hands.</p>
            <p>And this ſhall ſuffice for the firſt Chapter, to ſhew the ſeverall.

            <head>CHAP. II. Which of theſe Layings on of Hands is not, and cannot be meant
Heb. 6. 2.</head>
            <p>BEfore we reſolve this Queſtion, we readily acknowledge,
that A Laying on of Hands is a Principle of Religion, and a
part of the Foundation of the Chriſtian building, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. &amp;
6. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Why elſe ſeemed it good to the holy Spirit, by this Pen-man,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38466:4"/>
to put and reckon it, amongſt ſuch Principles of the Chriſtian
Religion, as Repentance, Faith, Baptiſme, the Reſurrection,
and eternall Judgment, and theſe granted by all, under the leaſt
profeſſion of Chriſtianity, to be Foundation-Doctrines.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, we notwithſtanding deny, that it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
laying on of Hands, for Healing the ſick; or for giving the
extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit; (much leſſe the laying on
of Hands practiſed by ſome in theſe days, as you may further ſee
in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.)</p>
            <p>I. Here cannot be meant, laying on of Hands for healing or
recovering the ſick; and that for theſe reaſons;</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the gift or power of healing by laying on of Hands
is ceaſed. Now that cannot be a Principle, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> which is not in
force in all ages, nor any man capable to practiſe it.</p>
            <p>At the firſt promiſe of giving this power, it was accompanied only
with miraculous gifts, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 17, 18. In my name ſhall they
caſt out Devills, they ſhall ſpeake with new Tongues, they ſhall
take up Serpents, and if they drinke any deadly thing, it ſhall not
hurt them; they ſhall lay Hands on the ſick, and they ſhall recover.</p>
            <p>Now how dangerous and deſtructive a principle is this, that
miracles ſhould be of the eſſence of Religion (as Principles are)
and yet no power to practiſe them</p>
            <p>2. As it is neceſſary, a foundation-Principle ſhould continue and
be in force in all ages; ſo it is neceſſary alſo, it ſhould concerne
the whole Church, and every member thereof, as a Foundation
doth the whole, and every part of the Building, to ſupport and
uphold it.</p>
            <p>Admit then this power were now in force; how would the
healing of any one particular member, concerne the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as a principle? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we conclude, that Laying on of Hands, for recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſick, cannot be that Principle, <hi>&amp;c: Heb.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>II. The Laying on of Hands, for giving the extraordinary gifts
of the holy Spirit, cannot be meant here; and that for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe (as before) this power of giving the extraordinary
gifts of the holy Spirit, is now ceaſed.</p>
            <p>As appears by the practice of it at this day, for although ſo
many have had hands laid upon them, to this end; yet theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
gifts, have never followed, to any one of them; but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38466:4"/>
both they and the adminiſtrators are, and remaine, as other men.</p>
            <p>Yet to call this a Principle &amp;c: what were this but to grant,
that one of the Foundation-ſtones of the Chriſtian Building were
now loſt? And if but a part of the Foundation faile, how torter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
muſt the whole building ſtand, and will ſoone decay, and
come to nothing. And it is well known, that a principle in
all Arts and ſciences, is of conſtant and ſtanding Uſe.</p>
            <p>2. That this laying on of Hands, cannot be the principle, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. becauſe this Laying on of Hands, is there called a Doctrine,
<hi>Ver.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
            <p>But, that laying on of Hands, to give the holy Spirit, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
once taught in all the New Teſtament, no not by them that
practiſed it.</p>
            <p>3. If this laying on of Hands were the principle, <hi/>
            </p>
            <p>Then this very Church of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (the firſt conſtituted
Church in the New Teſtament after Chriſts Aſcenſion) this Church
being the ſame with that, <hi>Act.</hi> 1, &amp; 2) had wanted a principle in
Religion, which were very abſurd to imagine; for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
had not Laying on of Hands to this end. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. being the
firſt place that ever it was practiſed: and ſure in all matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
worſhip, the written word muſt be our Rule; and to the
Scriptures ſilence, we muſt give conſent, according to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb:
Where God hath not a mouth to ſpeake, we muſt not have
an Ear to hear.</p>
            <p>Beſides: that they had not Laying on of Hands, to this end, is
evident, becauſe they received the extraordinary gifts of the holy
Spirit without it, <hi>Act. 2. Verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we conclude, that neither of theſe two Layings on of
Hands can be meant, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="3" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. III. What Laying on of Hands, is, and muſt be meant, Heb. 6. 2.</head>
            <p>FOr the better reſolving this Queſtion, we muſt take notice,
that it is Laying on of Hands, here in the ſingular number,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. &amp;c: therefore can be but one Laying on of Hands, that
is called here a Principle, &amp;c: and not more, as ſome would
have it; for then it ſhould be Layings on of Hands, in the plural
number.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:38466:5"/>
            <p>As in the ſame place, when the Apoſtle would underſtand more
Baptiſms then one, he ſaith, The doctrine of Baptiſms, in the
plurall number.</p>
            <p>This being conſidered, we muſt remember, what went be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore,
that it is neither Laying on of Hands for healing the ſick,
nor for giving the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Then it muſt be, Laying on of Hands for ordaining of Officers.</p>
            <p>Which will more clearly appeare by this Argument.</p>
            <p>It muſt be Laying on of Hands, either for healing the ſick, or for
giving the extraordinary gifts of the holy Spirit, or for Ordaining
of Officers.</p>
            <p>But neither for healing the ſick, nor for giving the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
gifts of the holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Therefore for ordaining of Officers.</p>
            <p>For the firſt Propoſition, That it muſt be for one of theſe three
Ends, becauſe there is no other Laying on of Hands, upon any
other account in all the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond Propoſition, that it is neither for healing the
ſick, nor for giving the holy Spirit, hath beene already proved,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Therefore it follows, it muſt be Laying on of Hands, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
of Officers. And this ſhall ſuffice, for the firſt Argument.</p>
            <p>2. That Laying on of Hands for Officers, is here meant, will
further appeare, becauſe this Laying on of Hands, is called a
Doctrine, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and therefore muſt be a Laying on of Hands,
which is ſome-where elſe taught. But the other Layings on of
Hands, were never once taught. But this Laying on of Hands, was
taught, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> 5 22. Lay Hands ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
on no man, that is, Admit none raſhly, or too haſtily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
office: and that this concernes Officers, ſee before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.
In this <hi>verſe.</hi> there are two things taught, one expreſſed, the other
neceſſarily implied: that which is expreſſed, is, that <hi>Timothy</hi>
ſhould not ſuddenly Lay Hands on any man; that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
is, that it was to be done, if adviſedly; If not to be done
at all, it were frivolous to ſay, it ſhould not be done ſuddenly.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth this Laying on of Hands
which in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. he calls a Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now leſt any ſhould ſay, that this laying on of Hands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
all Baptized believers, we therefore ſhall enmind them,
that from their own principle and practice, this cannot be; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they Lay Hands on all their diſciples, immediately upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38466:5"/>
their Baptiſme, and therefore leave no roome for this word
[ſuddenly] in the Apoſtles exhortation: and it is ſore againſt
their wills, if they may not Lay their Hands ſuddenly upon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme:
and, in their own ſence, there is none fit for Baptiſme,
that is not thereupon fitly qualified, for this their impoſition:
nor do they ever ſtay till they are further qualified for this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
and therefore the Apoſtles would in vaine have exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, to Lay Hands ſuddenly on no man. But that this was
for Officers, the moſt amongſt themſelves, that I have wet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
do confeſſe.</p>
            <p>We might yet further adde, if need were, that this Laying
on of Hands, for office, was injoyned and commanded by the
holy Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 2, 3. but now they cannot ſhew, where
the other Layings on of Hands, was in the leaſt enjoyned &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Holy Spirit. Therefore we conclude againe, it
muſt be Laying on of Hands for Officers, which the Apoſtle here
calls a Doctrine.</p>
            <p>3. Againe this Laying on of Hands, this Church of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
had practiſed amongſt them, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6. they Laid their
Hands upon the Deacons, to aſſigne them to their office. But none
of the other Layings on of Hands, was practiſed amongſt them,
as we find. Now it cannot rationally be ſuppoſed, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
writing to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſhould call that a principle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which they were not acquainted with, but rather that Laying on of
Hands, which they were under the practice of: and therefore it
muſt be this Laying on of Hands for Officers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>4. Beſides, this Laying on of Hands only remains in force,
the other two not capable to be practiſed, nor have been for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred years. It muſt therefore neceſſarily follow to be this
Laying on of Hands, which is ſtill in force: becauſe called a part
of the Foundation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. Now a Foundation muſt always
be the ſame, &amp; of conſtant &amp; ſtanding uſe to the whole building.</p>
            <p>5. This Laying on of Hands only, concerns the whole Church,
which is neceſſary a Principle ſhould do. We have already
ſhewed you how the other do not concern the whole; but this
does, in regard every member is bound to live under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church, and to be obedient to their Officers,
to whom the Rule and care of the whole Church is committed.
And therefore this muſt be the Principle, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſufficiently proved, what Laying on of Hands, is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38466:6"/>
here meant. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. We ſhall now further ſhew you, what is
here meant by this phraſe of Laying on of Hands, that is to ſay;
The Government of the Church, which was put into the Hands
of men appointed thereunto, by this Ceremony of Laying on of
Hands. The very Order of the Principles, as they are laid
down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. further confirm this.</p>
            <p>Therefore leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, (or
the beginning words of Chriſt) let us go on unto perfection: not
laying again the Foundation of Repentance from dead works,
and of Faith towards God, of the Doctrine of Baptiſms, and of
Laying on of Hands, and of the reſurrection of the dead, and of
eternal Judgement.</p>
            <p>For as the next thing to be done, after Faith and Repentance,
is to be Baptized: ſo the next thing after baptiſm, is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Church. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. 41, 42. 47. the Officers whereof
were always appointed by the Laying on of Hands. And this
was the conſtant practice of the Primitive times.</p>
            <p>And as in theſe ſix Principles, the two firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance
and Faith: and the two laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reſurrection and eternal
Judgement, are abſolutely neceſſary unto ſalvation: So the two
middlemoſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, and Laying on of Hands; are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to a right and orderly Church conſtitution, and progreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Baptiſm, to admit into the Church; and this Ceremony of
Laying on of Hands, noting the Miniſtery and Government of
the Church, when come in.</p>
            <p>We take leave yet to add, that this is the Judgment of moſt
moderne and later writers, on the Text, that we have met with.
We ſhall inſtance only ſome few in Engliſh. <hi>Wilſons</hi> Chriſtian
Dictionary. Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> in his late large comment on this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.
<hi>Trap</hi> upon the place, ſaith, That by this phraſe of Laying
on of Hands, is meant, the Miniſtery and Government of the
Church. And <hi>Cartwright</hi> upon the Rhemiſt-Teſtament on this
Text, and elſe where in his Harmony, ſaith, That he which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
Church Government, denies a Principle of the Chriſtian
Religion.</p>
            <p>Now that there might be Government and order in the Church,
Officers were appointed thereunto by Laying on of Hands.</p>
            <p>The very light of Nature, and common Experience teacheth,
that Government is a principle in all Conſtitutions, whether of
Nation, Family, or the like: without which, all would ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38466:6"/>
be out of order, for Anarchy hath alwaies been the fore-runner
of confuſion, if not of utter diſſolution. So of a houſe, without
a Foundation there can be no building. Hence the Metaphor in
the Text, Not laying again the Foundation. Implying, that as a
Foundation is to the building, to ſupport and uphold it, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
is Government in the Church.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the Apoſtles alwaies appointed Elders, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Church, in every City <hi>Acts 14. 23. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. and theſe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were ordained, by Laying on of Hands; as before.</p>

         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IIII. That the Laying on of Hands, practiſed by ſome in theſe days, on all
Baptized Believers, was never Inſtituted, Commanded, or Practiſed
by Chriſt or his Apoſtles in all the New Teſtament.</head>
            <p>HEre indeed lies the ſtreſs of the Controverſy, which chiefly
occaſioned me to write theſe few Lines, that we might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive,
and reduce ſuch as are already under the vanity of this
practiſe, and to prevent others from owning of, and ſubmitting
to ſuch a Scripture-leſs thing as this is, which ſome (who know
not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm) call an Ordinance of
Chriſt, though without any the leaſt word or warrant for it, in all
the New Teſtament of our Lord.</p>
            <p>Certainly this hath been a received Principle, we have of late
years taken up, and muſt continue to go by, if Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples;
That we muſt introduce nothing into the worſhip of
Chriſt, but what we have an expreſs Word for, from that great
Prophet in his New Teſtament. See <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, 23. For this very
cauſe we have all along ſeparated from the Biſhops, &amp; the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and ſhall we now return again? God forbid.</p>
            <p>Now that which hath not one word of Inſtitution, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for it in all the New Teſtament, is no Ordinance of Chriſt,
but Will-worſhip, and Superſtition. (Superſtition ſignifying
ſomething more then appointed.) But this Laying on of Hands,
on all Baptized Perſons, hath not one word of Inſtitution, or
command for it in all the New Teſtament. Therefore no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Chriſt, but Will-worſhip and Superſtition.</p>
            <p>That there is no Inſtitution or Command for it in all the
New Teſtament, appears, becauſe the greateſt Contenders and
ſticklers for this practice, did never yet alledge any one place, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38466:7"/>
does in the leaſt, prove any ſuch thing; if there had been any,
certainly they would have produced them. They themſelves
inſtance but two places, where the words are found, beſides
<hi>Heb. 6. viz. Acts</hi> 8. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 19. with which they have raiſed ſuch a
duſt, that hath indeed blinded the eys of ſome honeſt, well-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
people; and by good words, and fair ſpeeches, have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the hearts of the ſimple. But to lay this duſt which they
have raiſed, and to diſcover the (but) pretences they have made.
We ſhall firſt conſider their fore-mentioned Allegations in the
General, and then view them more particularly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, neither any one, nor all of theſe places, have the leaſt
word of Inſtitution or Command in them: Nor one ſyllable of
proof brought from them, that this ſhould be done to all Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
perſons. Beſides the Ends of Laying on of Hands in theſe
days, is a different thing from the Ends in theſe Texts; all which
will more appear in the particular view of them, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thing propounded to ſpeak to.</p>
            <p>And firſt for <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. Neither the Subjects nor the Ends,
are particularly mentioned and expreſſed in this place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt go to other Scriptures, to find out what Laying on
of Hands is moſt agreeable to this Text, as we do in the caſe of
Baptiſm in the ſame place: The Text neither telling us, who
ſhould have Hands laid on them, not to what End; neither is the
word <hi>All</hi> in it, as was before noted, &amp; we have already proved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
from other Texts, and clear Arguments, that this Laying on of
Hands is to another End. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>The two other places they bring (we put them both together,
becauſe they are of the ſame nature) are <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 14. 17. where
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Laid their Hands on them at <hi>Samaria:</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi>
19. 6. where <hi>Paul</hi> Laid his Hands on the twelve at <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Laying on of Hands in theſe Texts, was for the giving
of the extraordinary Gifts of the Holy Spirit, we have already
proved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. There is not one word of Command here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
us to do as they have done. They Laying on their Hands,
as moved thereunto by the Holy Spirit, having received power to
miniſter the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, as appears, becauſe
thoſe Gifts did immediatly follow their Laying on of Hands.</p>
            <p>We have alſo before proved, that the power of giving theſe
Gifts being ceaſed, the Rite and Ceremony as to this End ought
to ceaſe alſo; and cannot but preſumptuouſly be practiſed at this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38466:7"/>
day, the gifts never following, much leſſe reckoned for a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in Religion. But theſe gifts did both times immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in the <hi>Acts.</hi> The gifts now being neither found in the
Miniſter, norfollowing the Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Have we not as good ground, to adventure the Laying on of
Hands, miraculouſly to heale the ſick, having I am ſure as good
a warrant, and may hope to ſpeed as ſucceſsfully.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe two places they have not another, to pretend to,
where the words are found.</p>
            <p>As for that place, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 17. where <hi>Paul</hi> had Hands Laid on
him; from their own confeſſion this will not ſerve their turne,
for it was before his Baptiſme, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. and it was for the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his ſight, as well as for his being filled with the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
if not principally for the recovering of his ſight, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 12.
Only we will note in generall that this Laying on of Hands
to extraordinary or miraculous ends, had not at all reſpect to
Baptiſme, for it was as well before Baptiſme, as after it; as in
this caſe before us. Nor do we think it needfull to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to thoſe Texts, brought in by ſome of them, for number
but not for weight, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2, 20. we are built upon the Foundation
<hi>&amp;c:</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 14. we are made pertakers of Chriſt, if we hold
the beginning &amp;c: And 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> 9, 10. whoſoever tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>th,
and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, &amp;c: and
ſuch like Texts as theſe are, where they can find the word begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Doctrine or Foundation. We cannot but judge, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
recitall of theſe Texts, a ſufficient confutation, to any man
that hath his reaſon in his head. And wiſh with all our hearts,
they might not incurre that ſevere cenſure of the Apoſtle, of
Handling the word of God deceitfully, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. and 4. 2.</p>
            <p>And thus we doubt not, but all unprejudiced and unbiaſſed
people, conſidering what we have ſaid, will ſee they have no
footing in the Scripture (which muſt be our Rule and Directory
for our whole worſhip) for this their Laying on of Hands, much
leſſe to make it a principle of Religion, and ſo (as they do) a
Boundary of Communion.</p>
            <p>The truth is, they themſelves are ſo much at a loſſe in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that they agree not about the end. They make more Ends of
their one Laying on of Hands, then of the ſeveral kinds of Layings
on of Hands, in the New-Teſtament. Some for one end, and
ſome for another, and ſo proceed to a third and a fourth end,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38466:8"/>
as if God indeed had ſent among them, the confuſion of Tongues,
inſtead of ſpeaking with Tongues, and the miraculous Gifts of
the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Some would have Hands Laid on, for the obtaining of the
extraordinary gifts of the holy Spirit, in imitation of <hi>Act.</hi> 8.
and <hi>Act.</hi> 19. to this we have once and againe ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Some would have Laying on of Hands, for Confirmation as
they call it, and though they ſhrowd themſelves under the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Scriptures, yet to ſpeak truth, their beſt argument
is the Common Prayer book; and ſome of them have beene ſo
ingenuous to confeſſe as much; and have very much boaſted and
gloried, in this one inartificiall unconcluding Argument: for
the Scripture owns them not all in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Gouge,</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. ſaith, that though Laying on of
Hands, were anciently practiſed by the Fathers to this end, yet
it is not expreſly ſet down in Scripture. But thanks be to God
through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, we have beene better taught in
theſe laſt daies, then to own any thing in the worſhip of Chriſt,
from their Tradition or Authority, unleſſe alſo grounded on the
word of God. What is this practice then, but ſetting our poſts
by Gods poſts, and bringing in a Tradition of men, inſtead of an
Appointment of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>A third ſort there are, who practiſe this Laying on of Hands,
as a meanes to receive more of the Holy Spirit, and that in the
ordinary meaſures of it.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe, here they ſay well, if they could make the leaſt proofe
of ſuch an End from the Holy Scriptures. This fair Pretext to
obtaine more of the Spirit, hath beguiled many a poore, weake,
unſtable ſoul. We profeſſe our ſelves ſo farre one with them
in this thing, that we cannot Judge him a Chriſtian, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be accounted Chriſts Diſciple, that would not uſe all
meanes, appointed by God to obtaine more of the Holy Spirit:
we are ſo ſenſible of the daily need of more of the ſupplies of the
Spirit: and could they but ſhew one place, where ever Laying
on of Hands, was practiſed upon all Baptized Believers, upon ſuch
an Accompt, we would in great meaſure ſuddenly become their
Proſelytes. But in this matter (by their leave) we are as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as the ſilence of Scriptures can make us, that there is not
any one Text, in all the New Teſtament, that doth in the leaſt,
juſtifie and warrant ſuch a practice.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:38466:8"/>
            <p>This is to appoint a means, that was never of Gods Inſtitution,
and therefore in the Uſe of it, cannot expect his bleſſing, but rather,
Who hath required this at your Hands.</p>
            <p>Let experience teſtifie how much more of the Holy Spirit, they
have received, then others of their Brethren, who were never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this practice. It hath not been our obſervation alone (and
with greife of heart we ſpeake it, &amp; could wiſh it were otherwiſe)
that inſtead of the Holy Spirit, a ſtrange Spirit, another Spirit,
hath generally followed this practice, ſo juſt it is with God, to
give over perſons, to their own Spirit, when they introduce a
tradition of their own, for a commandement of God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Spirit for it.</p>
            <p>And who is ſo ignorant, that knows not what a ſtrange rigid
cenſoriouſneſſe, hath poſſeſt the hearts and tongues of moſt of
this way, as if indeed they had received, by Laying on of Hands, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Spirit, inſtead of the Holy Spirit of God. Witneſſe the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſome of them that we are not yet babs in Chriſt: &amp; have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
ſome their houſes, who were inſtrumental in their converſion
becauſe they are not under this ceremony, denying communion
with their Brethren, who in their own conſciences are every way
equall to them, in Gifts and Holineſſe, and hold the ſame Faith
and Doctrine of the Goſpell, and are of the ſame order and
practiſe with them, excepting this matter: yea and have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo farre, as to excommunicate ſome, for no other cauſe but
this. And as I was writing this, one told me, before good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
he was dealing with, and in danger of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for this very thing.</p>
            <p>Read theſe very men, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 5. Your Brethren that hated
you, that caſt you out for my namesſake, ſaid, Let the Lord be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified:
but he ſhall appeare to your joy, and they ſhall be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>There is yet a fourth End propoſed by ſome; <hi>viz.</hi> That they are now wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for the ſame Gifts of the Holy Spirit, that were then given; and therefore
continue the Ceremony, as a means to obtain them. This is but little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the firſt End. But to this we anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. That there was never any Laying on of Hands, practiſed in all the New
Teſtament, under the waiting, or in the expectation of the extraordinary Gifts
of the Holy Spirit, as a means to obtain them; but, as was ſaid before, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
practiſed by any, till they had firſt received power from on high, and theſe
Gifts immediatly followed thereupon.</p>
            <p>2. When the Gift or power is reſtored, then let the practice of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be reſtored alſo; For as when the power ceaſed, the Rite by right ceaſed
alſo; ſo the Ceremony ought not to be practiſed, till the power be again recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
<pb facs="tcp:38466:9"/>
for what is this elſe, but to ſet a ſeal to a blanck. And whether this
Power ſhall be reſtored again or no, is not our Enquiry at this time. But when
the Gift, then the Rite; otherwiſe we ſhould reſtore an empty Form, without its
Power. Again, as they cannot agree among themſelves about the End: ſo
neither about other Circumſtances herein. Some of them would have the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator
to be only Meſſengers. Others would have, Elders alſo.</p>
            <p>Though the Truth is, that Laying on of Hands, which they would have the
Standard of this their practiſe, was only adminiſtred by Meſſengers. <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>John Acts</hi> 8. &amp; <hi>Paul Acts</hi> 19. the only perſons Miniſtering in this kind, in all the
New Teſtament. However they can agree well enough in this (as <hi>Pilate</hi> and
<hi>Herod</hi> to crucifie Chriſt) ſo they to deal hardly with, if not to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
their Brethren. We willingly paſs by other incongruities, which they
commit, not worth taking notice of. As the neceſſity they put of two being
the Adminiſtrators of this work, when as <hi>Paul</hi> alone, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. did it. And yet
but once more practiſed in all the New Teſtament. <hi>viz. Acts</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>We hope by this time, we have ſaid enough to all impartial men, who
are not carried otherwaies, more by Will and prejudice, then by Scripture and
Reaſon. For thoſe that are already under this practice, we hope they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
what hath been here delivered, in all humility of mind, as thoſe that
have ſpoken the words of truth and ſoberneſs, our Conſciences bearing us wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the Holy Spirit, aiming at nothing more, than the truth of the Goſpel,
and the peace of the Churches. We pray that your own names and credit,
may not lye at ſtake in this matter, a temptation too incident to fleſh and blood,
and we truſt the ſame God, that hath carried out many of you, very far in the
waies of ſelf-denial, will teach and help you at this turn alſo, to judge it no
diſhonour to recede from error how long ſoever embraced, and to take up
truth when e're you find it. Our bowels yearn towards you, and we are ſad at
heart, when we think of the ſad account, ſome of you have to give in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
either for dividing from Churches, where you have had ſweet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
together with your Brethren, or for dividing of Churches, or at leaſt keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them from uniting together; and all this, upon no better an account, then
(I may ſay) a meer empty Form and Ceremony. We will only ſay this, This
will be your loſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus, which is ſhortly coming.</p>
            <p>Our heart is enlarged towards you, but we ſhall leave you to judge of this, as
God ſhall direct you, in your moſt retired and ſerious thoughts.</p>
            <p>Only we have this to adde, that we had not ſet Pen to Paper, had there
not beene ſuch a violent impoſition upon the Churches, of your Impoſition of
Hands, as to make it eſſentiall to Communion.</p>
            <p>The bleſſing of the Almighty, goe along with it, that as we have ſowen,
He will by his good Spirit be pleaſed to water, and we ſhall expect a plentifull
Harveſt, for we can aſſure our hearts, <hi>That we are not as many, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
or deale deceitfully with the word of God, but as of ſincerity, but as of God,
in the ſight of God, ſpeak we in Chriſt.</hi>
