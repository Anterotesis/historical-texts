            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOne of the extraordinary Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the <hi>Peake</hi> ſurpriſed me with greater Admiration, than Your
<pb facs="tcp:98254:3"/>
Grace's famous Baths at <hi>Buxton,</hi> which ſeemed to me like ſome rich Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conceal'd amongſt the monſtrous Hills.</p>
            <p>This Jewel of Nature is happily beſtowed on Your Illuſtrious Family, who know beſt how to adorn ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural naked Rarities, with magnificent, pleaſant, and convenient Buildings, and, by Your great Example, give incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the frequenting of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and uſeful Baths.</p>
            <p>Where ſuch natural Baths have been wanting, great Princes, or Emperors have ſupply'd their Defect by artificial ones; by which they expreſs their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the uſefulneſs of Baths to the Publick; and by the erecting them, they deſign'd to oblige the Multitude, who
<pb facs="tcp:98254:3"/>
deſired the uſe of them for their Pleaſure, Beauty, or curing Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>In the moſt flouriſhing Times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the number of Baths was infinite at <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Baths equalled four of the greateſt Palaces in <hi>Italy.</hi> And the <hi>Antonine</hi> Baths contain'd Sixteen Hundred Seats; and by its ſpacious Building, Places for Exerciſe, Ponds, Walks, Portico's, reſembled a whole Province: And theſe Baths were adorned with Statues, noble Columns, Silver Pipes, and rich Gems.</p>
            <p>Your Noble Family did formerly erect theſe Baths at <hi>Buxton;</hi> and what is wanting for Pleaſure and Convenience, is by all expected from Your generous Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:4"/>
Baths were always thought worthy of the Care of Stateſmen; and <hi>Cato</hi> oppoſed the introducing the uſe of bot Baths in <hi>Rome,</hi> by which the <hi>Roman</hi> Manners might be corrupted, and their Bodies made more Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: He diſcerned the Miſtake of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Doctors, who recommended Hot Baths for the helping of Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas it was evident, that they ſubverted and weakned the Stomach. I hope Your Grace will imitate the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of this Noble Patriot, by incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging this prejent Age to leave off the imprudent Uſe of Hot Baths, and to regain their ancient natural viguor, ſtrength and hardineſs by a frequent Uſe of Cold Bathing.</p>
            <p>Your Grace's Bath at <hi>Buxton</hi> is ſo exactly temper'd by a mild Heat,
<pb facs="tcp:98254:4"/>
that it puts the niceſt Conſtitutions in no fear of danger by the uſes of it; but the benefit of it is extraordinary, by reſtraining the preternatural quantity of Perſpiration, by ſtrengthening the Nerves and natural Heat. By theſe it is eaſie to prevent all Inflammations, Pains, Rheums, Fluxes, and Gout, and all other Efferveſcences in our Humours.</p>
            <p>The benefit of Cold Water was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known to the <hi>Germans,</hi> who dipt their new-born Children into Rivers, to harden them; and the Northern Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rub their frozen parts with Snow, to regain their natural Heat and Colour. But I will give Your Grace ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Cold bathing from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> in the moſt flouriſhing time of their Empire; by which it will appear,
<pb facs="tcp:98254:5"/>
that I publiſh no new Doctrine, but only deſign to revive the Ancient practice of Phyſick in uſing Cold Baths, amongſt which, <hi>Buxton</hi> is the moſt temperate and ſafe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antonius Muſa</hi> firſt practiſed this Cold bathing at <hi>Rome,</hi> by which he cured the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who being ſubject to Diſtillations, had long deſpaired of his Health, till <hi>Muſa</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Hot Baths to do him injury, did try a contrary Method, and cured him by Cold bathing. After which, <hi>Suetonius</hi> relates, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> uſed Hot Baths very rarely; but for his Nerves he uſed Sea-Water for a Bath, or the <hi>Albulae,</hi> which were the moſt temperate Baths in <hi>Italy;</hi> in Virtue and Heat moſt reſembling that at <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> For this miraculous Cure, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:5"/>
nobly rewarded <hi>Muſa,</hi> and placed his Statue next to <hi>Aeſculapius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Succeſs on <hi>Auguſtus, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> was encouraged to try cold Baths in all Diſeaſes: but as it happens to all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perical new Methods, it was improperly apply'd by him in the Winter, to young <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom <hi>Muſa</hi> killed ſix Months after he had cured <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> and this raſh uſe of cold bathing is deſcribed by <hi>Horace,</hi> which was expoſing their Heads and Breaſts to the falling of cold Springs on them, in the ſevere Cold of Winter. But this Accident did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage this practice, but obliged the Phyſician to be more cautious, and to find out the right uſe of Cold bathing; for <hi>Horace,</hi> by the Advice of <hi>Muſa,</hi> left the hot Baths, which did injury to his inflamed Eyes, and went to the
<pb facs="tcp:98254:6"/>
cold Baths at <hi>Cluſium</hi> and <hi>Gabii;</hi> but finding thoſe Countries too cold, he writes an Epiſtle to <hi>Vala</hi> about the cold Baths at <hi>Valie</hi> and <hi>Salernum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> afterwards practiſed Cold ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Sea, and cells it his <hi>old Art;</hi> and gave himſelf the name of <hi>Pſuchrolontes,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius;</hi> and it appears that he was ſo great a lover of Cold bathing, that in the Calends of <hi>January,</hi> he leapt into a Spring near <hi>Tybur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could give more of the Hiſtory of cold bathing from the <hi>Roman Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> but I think it ſufficient that their greateſt Emperor, the wittieſt Poet, and their moſt admired Philoſopher, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the <hi>Pſuchroluſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:6"/>
This practice of Cold bathing was certainly brought by the <hi>Romans</hi> into <hi>England;</hi> but it was known and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed alſo by the <hi>Germans,</hi> and from them it might come to their Neighbours. The Heathen Prieſts grounded their Worſhipping of Wells on the Virtue of Medicinal Waters, attributing their cheap and ſudden Cures to a preſent Deity. The bringing Alms and Offerings to Wells, was anciently forbid by <hi>Edgar'</hi>s Canons: And Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> mentions the Injunctions againſt worſhipping St. <hi>Edmund'</hi>s Well without St. <hi>Clement'</hi>s at <hi>Oxford.</hi> This Cuſtom was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards imitated by the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts,</hi> who dedicated the Medicinal Springs to particular Saints: So one of the Wells at <hi>Buxton</hi> is call'd St. <hi>Ann'</hi>s; and by the particular Offerings, Pilgrimages,
<pb facs="tcp:98254:7"/>
and Devotions, the Common People were deceived, and attributed all their Cures to the Merit of that Saint, and their own Devotion, which was due to the Phyſical Virtue of cold Springs, and God's Bleſſing on a Natural uſe of them</p>
            <p>The Diſuſe of theſe Waters at <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> I believe was owing much to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which gave a general Averſion to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtition, with which the People being out of Humour, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the good Uſe, as well as the Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Baths. And that Age being very ignorant in Philoſophy, they diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the natural Virtue of Cold Water, ſuch as is that at <hi>Holywell,</hi> and St. <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> the moſt excellent of the Coldeſt Baths, and the moſt uſed to this time.</p>

The Civil Wars have occaſion'd the neglect of many famous Waters. But I will add this moſt particular Cauſe of their diſuſe; As the Virtues of the Waters formerly ſupported the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints, ſo now the want of a proper religious Office to be uſed by the Devout at the time of bathing and drinking Waters, leaves all to a general Debauchery of Manners in ſuch publick places, and does very much leſſen the number of thoſe who would come thither, if both the Ends of Devotion and Health were ſerved by coming to thoſe places. This neglect of our Church I could not but cenſure, being no leſs injurious to the Bodies, than the Souls of good Men.</p>
            <p>I have endeavour'd truly to repreſent to my Country the Virtues of the Bath at <hi>Buxton;</hi> and it were to be wiſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:98254:8"/>
that the Church would propoſe ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Devotions fitted to ſuch Occaſions; and we muſt depend on Your Grace's Munificence, for the Splendor and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of that place, on Your Preſence ſometimes, which will occaſion a greater Concourſe there: And I muſt humbly beg Your favourable Acceptance of what I here have writ concerning <hi>Buxton;</hi> who am,</p>

               <hi>Concerning the Nature, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Effects of</hi> Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; <hi>and the Regulating of it by</hi> Baths.</head>
            <p>BEfore I diſcourſe of particular Baths, it is very neceſſary to explain the Nature of <hi>Perſpiration,</hi> which the Hot, Cold, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Baths do moſt evidently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as appears by increaſing or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the Weight of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and this will oblige me to deſcribe the ſeveral Effects or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities produced by the Elements, on
<pb facs="tcp:98254:9"/>
both the ſolid and fluid Parts of Animals, for the explaining the Changes in our <hi>Perſpiration</hi> by them; by the Fire we heat, by Water we cool, by the Air our Humours are made fluid, by the Earth, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Vegetated part of it, as alſo by our Animal Food, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Conſiſtence of our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or the dryneſs or ſolidity of our containing Parts. Theſe firſt Impreſſions on an Animal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and its Humours, I will, with the Ancients, call the firſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Heat and Cold, the Flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity or Dryneſs, are perceiv'd by our Touch; and theſe produce ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Qualities in our Bodies, as they are apply'd either to the ſolid or fluid Parts; ſo Heat rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and Cold compreſſes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
<pb facs="tcp:98254:9"/>
of any Blood and Spirits. And there is a third ſort of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which the old Writers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which depend on the ſecond Qualities, as they produce Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Effects on our organiz'd Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſo Fire firſt heats, then rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies our Humours, and thereby produces Sweat; and theſe ſeveral Qualities I will deſcribe in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe, to juſtifie and fully explain theſe uſeful Notions of our Ancient Phyſicians, which they obſerved from what occurr'd to their Senſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The external Effect of Fire on our ſolid Parts, is to heat; but we bliſter or cauterize them, to cure the Putrefaction, Fluxion, Pains, Convulſions in them: But its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on our Humours are to cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:98254:10"/>
a greater internal Motion in them, and by its own actual Heat and diffuſed Motion, ſo to excite the Motion of the Aerial Spirits, as to quicken the Circulation, and thereby produce many mechanical Actions; and by expanding the Air, the Humours are rarefy'd, or attenuated, as all Liquors boiled on the Fire ſwell, and are inflated by the expanſion of their included Air.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the violent agitation in the Particles of Fire, and the Inflation mention'd, ſome heterogeneous Parts, like a Scum, may be ſeparated from our Humours, as it appears by boyling or digeſting of Juices.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Fire attenuates, expands, and reſolves the Humours, ſo as to turn our Humours into Vapour,
<pb facs="tcp:98254:10"/>
and fit them for <hi>Perſpiration.</hi> This Effect of Fire we obſerve in diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Vegetables, which turns the Watery Liquor into a humid Vapour, condenſible into Liquor again: It diſſolves the Gums and Turpentines lodged in the Veſſels of Plants, and by the help of the Watery Vehicle, diſtils them, and melts them into the Form of an Oil; It turns the crude Tartar of Vegetables, partly into an acid Spirit, and partly calcines it into a fixt Salt; and the reſt of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Parts into Aſhes. After the ſame manner Fire will reſolve Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Humours: Firſt, The Serous Part into Water. Secondly, The natural <hi>Armoniac</hi> Salt in the Humours into a Volatile Salt, and the Acid into a fixt Salt. The Oil is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:98254:11"/>
but the <hi>Globuli</hi> of Fat melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the thin part of it diſtill'd over by the help of Water. The Earthy part is the Aſhes remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. By this Explication it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Fire changes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural States of the Principle by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation; but it produces no new ones, but every diſtinct Chymical Principle has its Parent both in the Animals and Vegetables which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it; but the Difference and Virtue is from the Fire.</p>
            <p n="4">4. External Heat attracts to the outward Parts; for by rarefying the Humours, it diſtends the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and opens the Pores, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding the included Air, and gives way to the Pulſe to preſs the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours outwardly: So in Cupping-Glaſſes, the Preſſure of the external
<pb facs="tcp:98254:11"/>
Air is taken off by the Heat of the Fire in them; and the ſame Heat rarefies the Air included in the Animal Pores and Juices, which produce the Tumour of the Part.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Heat condenſes or thickens the Animal Humours, by evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Serous Vehicles.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It colliquates fat Liquors, which coagulate by Cold, as Jel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Broaths, all Fats, and <hi>Axun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. There is another ſort of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquation made by external Heat, which we call the Putrefaction of our Humours, when the natural Viſcidity is ſo far diſſolved or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquated, as to want a ſufficient tenacity or cohaeſion of Parts, which is neceſſary to make the <hi>Bullulae</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:12"/>
               <hi>Sanguineae,</hi> for retaining Aerial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Soap gives this viſcidity to Water, which makes it fit to retain the Air blown into it. We obſerve all putrid Humours to be very thin and ſanious, as it were colliquated like melted Oil.</p>
            <p>The Effects of Cold on our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, are contrary to that of Heat; and therefore as Fire acts by the agitation of its Parts, and diffuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Particles every way, ſo Cold, whoſe Seat is chiefly in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (for we naturally depend on that for extinguiſhing the common Fire, as well as all Animal Heats or Burnings) affects our Senſe of Feeling, and produces its ſeveral Effects by its leſs agitation in the Particles of Water, than there is in the Humours of a living Animal.
<pb facs="tcp:98254:12"/>
Cold Water is heavier than our Humours, or any other fermented Liquors; that giving them a great plenty of Elaſtic Air, makes them lighter, and more eaſily agitated than Water. And the ſame Water may ſeem Cold or Hot, according to the different Degrees of Heat, or agitation of our Humours; ſo the Urine appears cold to a Perſon in a very hot Bath: Therefore I muſt attribute all the Effects of cold Water on our ſolid and fluid Parts, to its weight, preſſure, or leſſer agitation than that in our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Cold chills the Nerves, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Animal Spirits, and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Rarefaction, or natural aeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Expanſion; and hereby it occaſions the Skin to contract and ſhrivel, and
<pb facs="tcp:98254:13"/>
ſtops its Pores, and hardens the Skin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Cold Water compreſſes or condenſes the Conſiſtence of our Animal Juices, partly by its weight, or contact of Parts leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated, and alſo by compreſſing the rarefy'd Elaſtic Air in the <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulae Sanguinis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By the ſtopping of the Pores, by the compreſſing of the Juices, the internal rarefy'd Vapours which are only Watery <hi>Globuli</hi> expanded by rarefy'd Air, are retain'd; and this may be obſerved by breathing upon a Magnifying Glaſs, on the ſide next the Object, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately looking through it, the Breath appears like a <hi>Congeries</hi> of large Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Bubbles broken on the Glaſs. Theſe rarefy'd Bubbles in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb facs="tcp:98254:13"/>
and their natural hot <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums,</hi> produced by their Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Motion, Circulation, or Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; and if they be too much evacuated by hot Baths, they make the Body weaker, the Spirits exhauſted; but if moderately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, the Spirits are more invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and all the Animal Actions depending on them, Digeſtion, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, Perſpiration, are well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: And by this means Cold Water ſtrengthens the natural Heat, Spirits, and Vigor or Tone of our Bodies; and for this reaſon the <hi>Northern</hi> Nations rub their Frozen Parts with Ice, and have always harden'd their Bodies by bathing in Cold Water.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Cold Water by over-much compreſſing the fluid Parts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
<pb facs="tcp:98254:14"/>
may ſtop their Motion, and extinguiſh their natural Heat; but by a moderate compreſſion, the Humours may be check'd in their Motion; and if very viſcid, the <hi>Globuli</hi> may cohere, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become grumous, or coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate; and this way Rheumatic Blood may be made by exceſſive cold Weather, which cauſes the viſcid Particles to cohere in the Pores when too much compreſſed. The good Effects of this Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are to preſerve the natural Conſiſtence and Rarefaction of our Fluids, and thereby hinder Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but exceſſive cold makes the external Parts pale, and at laſt mortifies them with a Gangrene, by hindring the Afflux of warm Nutriment into the external Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
<pb facs="tcp:98254:14"/>
and by congealing ſome of the Blood in its Veſſels, which putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies there for want of Nouriſhment or Motion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Cold Water repels the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of Humours in wardly, and thereby it occaſions Fluxes by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Stool, or Spitting: The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the perſpirable Aerial Parts retained, cauſes Fevers or burning Heats. The Serous perſpirable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, give Matter to the Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Fluxes. Cold Countries make our Bodies pale and white; but the hotter Climes black, ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fey, yellow, by drawing the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours more outwardly, and ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Skin with their Colour: Choler makes the Face yellow or green; the well-digeſted Blood flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid; the Vitriolic Spleen Juice,
<pb facs="tcp:98254:15"/>
gives a blackneſs to the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: And by thoſe ſenſible Marks, our old Phyſicians truly judged of the preternatural State of our Humours. But our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns too much neglect the uſeful ſenſible Notions obſerved formerly; and thro' a Humour of Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they reject all the Ancients have writ, tho' very uſeful, and as certain as our Senſes, upon which they grounded all their Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The Operation of the Air on our ſolid Parts, is to compreſs them. We may eaſily diſcern that Effect, by taking off that Preſſure by Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Glaſſes, or the Air Pump; for then the ſolid Parts ſwell by the force of the Air compreſſed in our Humours, which always expands
<pb facs="tcp:98254:15"/>
it ſelf by its Elaſticity, according as the preſſure of the Air, and its Weight are alter'd; but the great uſe of the Air is inwardly, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fluidity, which was formerly underſtood by the humidity of our Humours. This Effect of the Air on our Humours was not ſo well underſtood formerly; but now we allow that Air is included in all Liquors, and gives the following Alterations to the Animal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It being included in the empty Pores of our ſolid Meats, as well as in the Bubbles of our fluids, by the heat of the Stomach, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air being rarefy'd, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves and ſeparates the Particles of our ſolid Food, and agitates thoſe of the Liquors we drink. By this
<pb facs="tcp:98254:16"/>
internal Agitation and Rarefaction of the elaſtic Particles of the Air, the Food is diſſolved, digeſted, and fermented in the Stomach, this Air becomes more elaſtic by a long Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion in the Stomach, as is the Spirit of our Animal Juices in its firſt Origine, and was properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Old Writers, <hi>The Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Spirit,</hi> which helps the Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Fluidity of Humours, and the Diſtribution of Nutriment; the more windy part is that which is too elaſtic, and goes off in the form of Wind, both upwards and downwards.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Blood this Aerial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is more purify'd, the windy Parts are thrown off by perſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or elſe by breathing. A vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Agitation or Rarefaction is
<pb facs="tcp:98254:16"/>
produced in the Blood, by every Ferment which occaſions a Fever, or Defluxion of Humours. It is rarefy'd and compreſs'd, according to the Heat, Cold, or Weight of the external Air; and a violent Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation occaſion'd by any Paſſion of the Mind, cauſes the ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition or Efferveſcence as in Fevers.</p>
            <p>By the Rarefaction of the Air, the Serous Humidities are exhaled by Perſpiration; and by the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of this, either Pains, Fevers, Defluxions, or Cachexies are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd; the continual Flux of this Humid aerial Part, is neceſſary to prevent Putrifaction in our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. This is uſually called the <hi>Ventilation</hi> of them; for as the ſtoppage of the Fumes of wet Hay
<pb facs="tcp:98254:17"/>
occaſions an actual Fire, ſo the too free Evacuations of theſe aerial Particles, over-cool our Bodies, and weaken them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The greateſt Effects of the Air is in producing of Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which conſiſt of the purer <hi>Lympha,</hi> impregnated with a fine digeſted elaſtic Air. The Glands of the Brain prove that ſome <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> is ſtrain'd thro' them into the Nerves; and becauſe none comes forth upon cutting the Nerves, the greateſt part of it muſt be aerial, by which I expreſs the light fluid elaſtical Mixture of Air, Water, and the light Oily Parts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Juices, produced out of our Nouriſhment by Fermentation in the Stomach, and a long Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Blood-Veſſels; and whilſt
<pb facs="tcp:98254:17"/>
it remains in the circulating Maſs, it is properly call'd the <hi>Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> but in the Nerves, the <hi>Animal,</hi> as it is the immediate Inſtrument of the Soul; and this does more immediately receive the Impreſſions of Hot and Cold in our Skins, and is variouſly affected, according to the change of Weather, and the preſſure of the Air. Theſe aerial Spirits are fit to repreſent the Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the external Air in Sands; the Motion of the Oily Particles of Smells, will eaſily rarifie the aerial Spirits, and thereby violently affect the whole: This gives Tenſion and Motion to all the Muſcles, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently circulates into the Blood again.</p>
            <p>Windy moiſt Air hinders Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by altering the Tenſion of
<pb facs="tcp:98254:18"/>
the Skin, or the Preſſure of the outward Air, and by cauſing an Ebullition in the Humours; for in Fevers the Perſpiration is very much ſtopped; and when the Blood is in a confuſed Motion, and quick Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, by an Inflation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Membranes, the Skin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
            <p>External Cold hinders Tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in weak Bodies, where the Fermentation is low; but it helps it in the ſtrong, as all the <hi>Northern</hi> People experience, who are more lightſome; and their Bodies weigh leſs in cold Froſty Weather, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a more plentiful Perſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that the Change of Air from Hot to Cold in the Summer, hinders Perſpiration about lb. j. and this produces Fevers and Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:98254:18"/>
when we change our Clothes too ſoon: This <hi>Perſpirabile</hi> retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes the Spirits uneaſie, till it is evacuated again by Urine, Stool, or Sweat within three days.</p>
            <p>We experience, that in our Bodies being heated, cool Air ſtops Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration; yet it is as certain that an exceſs of Cold heats ſtrong Bodies, and makes them really lighter.</p>
            <p>I have deſcribed the Effects of Fire, Water, and Air in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, becauſe they very much alter the Perſpiration; and it is plain, that the Element of Earth taken in our Food, ſupplies part of the <hi>Perſpirabile,</hi> and alters the Excreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, according to its different Qualities.</p>
            <p>From the time of our eating we perſpire unequally, that is, about
<pb facs="tcp:98254:19"/>
lb. j. in the firſt five Hours, and from five to twelve lb. iij. and from twelve to ſixteen but lb. ſs. By this Obſervation of <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> 'tis evident, that our daily Food muſt ſupply the Matter tranſpired; that till there has been a full Digeſtion in the Stomach, and a Sanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by Circulation, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity perſpires. And from this Obſervation it is eaſie to make a Rule for our Hot bathing and Exerciſe, That the Body will perſpire more by them, after five Hours, which time the Meat is digeſting in the Stomach; and that Cold bathing twelve Hours after Meat cannot ſtop Perſpiration much, or occaſion any Fever or Defluxion by ſhutting up the Pores, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration being finiſh'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:19"/>
The liquid part of our Diet is the greateſt and heavieſt, and the ſolid lighteſt, being more filled with Air; and ſo it is in our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements; in the ſpace of one Night we perſpire inſenſibly forty Ounces or more. The quantity of Urine is about ſixteen Ounces; and the hard Excrement but four Ounces.</p>
            <p>The quality of the Meat alters Perſpiration; copious and crude Meats, as <hi>Melons, Cucumbers, Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms,</hi> make the Body heavier; and all the vaporous and thin or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, lighter.</p>
            <p>Thin Meats perſpire about forty Ounces, as Mutton does; but the thicker, as Swines Fleſh, eighteen Ounces, and in the ſpace of a Night.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:20"/>
Faſting perſpires as much; which ſhews, that in good and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent feeding, we perſpire the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Ounces from our antiquated Humours, and about twenty two from our new Diet.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Flatus</hi> in our Diet is, as <hi>Sanctorius</hi> affirms, <hi>rude quoddam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirabile:</hi> and there are two parts of Perſpiration, the one is flatulent ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, the groſſer part is ſerous; but ſweating is altogether unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, unleſs we eat or drink more than is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The preſervation of our Health requires, that we ſhould add as much to our weight as we daily loſe, and that we ſhould return every Morning to the ſame weight again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:20"/>
By weighing before and after ſenſible Evacuation in a Morning, we find that if our Diet amounts to lb. viij. in a Day, lb. v. paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes off inſenſibly; and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all the other ſenſible Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations.</p>
            <p>We then account our ſelves moſt healthful, when we perſpire every Day alike; and <hi>Sanctorius</hi> aſſures us, that we ſhould live to extreme old Age, if our Bodies in the four Changes of the Year were preſerved of an equal weight; but in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Autumn</hi> the weight of the Body increaſes, and that makes a Ferment for Winter Tertians; and from the <hi>Autumn</hi> Equinox till the <hi>Winter</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, we perſpire leſs lb. j. every day; and then we begin to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire more till the Spring Equinox;
<pb facs="tcp:98254:21"/>
and he obſerves that in the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> our Bodies weigh leſs by lb. iij.</p>
            <p>In the hot Air of <hi>Summer,</hi> our Bodies are of leſs Strength; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Summer</hi> it is neceſſary to concenter our Strength and Spirits by Cold bathing: And there is not any more certain way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our ſelves from this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inequality of weight, than by theſe kind of Cold Baths, which by frequent uſe make the Skin leſs ſubject to the ſenſe of Cold, and conſequently to an unnatural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, to ſtop Perſpiration, when we ſuddenly find the Air to change from Hot to Cold; or to ſpend too much of our Strength, when it changes from Cold to Hot.</p>

That cold Water renders the Skin callous, or, as <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, is apparent by the Skins of Fiſhermen, who can indure all the Extremities of Weather, the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Skin making it unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of different Tenſions: But all the tenderneſs we keep our ſelves in, makes the Skin more ſenſible of Air, and more ſubject to contract or relaxe, and thereby tranſpires inequally.</p>
            <p>The Cauſes which ſtop Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. After eating, the Circulation goes more inwardly, and the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Guts are more tinged with Blood, they growing more warm by their fermenting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, may occaſion the Humours to flow thither; and their Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:98254:22"/>
upon the Meat may ſtop the circulating Humours there; and for this reaſon eating in the Morning, in the time of the greateſt Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is improper, till after twelve Hours, when it is over. Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence hinders Perſpiration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Evacuations by vomiting, purging, venery, ſtop Perſpiration, by turning the Circulation from the Habit of the Body, and may be improper when Perſpiration is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Water-drinking hinders it; and cool, viſcid, acid, mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, ſtyptic Diet is neither eaſily digeſted, nor perſpired.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Paſſions of Fear and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by ſtopping the Circulation hinders our Tranſpiration; and therefore <hi>Hypondriacks</hi> cannot be
<pb facs="tcp:98254:22"/>
cured, till their Bodies are made tranſpirable by temperate Baths, and humid Diet.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The pituitous <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> the ſerous, tartareous, or flatulent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and old Men, and all in whom there is a weak Heat, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire leaſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Cold Air and Water, toſſing in Bed, Wax, Oil, Fat, outwardly hinder Perſpiration, and ruine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Ulcers.</p>
            <p>The Inconveniences which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſtoppage of Perſpiration are Pains, Fevers, Windineſs, Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude, Tumours, Gangrenes, Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipela's, Sciatica's, Fluxes by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine or Stool, and the Body is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:23"/>
The Cauſes of too great a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration will cure the Stoppage of it; and are as follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All hot, vinoſe, acrid, aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, ſalt Taſtes in Diet, the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Heat of Tobacco, do injury to the Head and Spirits, which requite Cool things; that Heat over-digeſts the Humours in the Stomach, and occaſions a quicker Circulation, and febrile Rarefaction of the Blood, whereby it produces great Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Serum;</hi> it depreſſes a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Heat on the ſolid Parts and Spirits, if the Conſtitution be hot, choleric, ſalt, viſcid, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefactive; and Tobacco can be only proper for the Cold Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the ſerous, mucilaginous, and windy. I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Smoaking the Cauſe of
<pb facs="tcp:98254:23"/>
Conſumptions, and Scurvy, and Defluxions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tells us, that the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of hot things, makes the Mind effeminate, the Nerves weak, the Spirits torpid, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <hi>Haemorrhages</hi> and <hi>Deliquium's</hi> of the Spirits. This ſeems to me an occaſion of the Vapours in Men and Women, which come by the uſe of too hot Liquors and Diet, with high Sawces. Many drink Tea, Coffee, and actually warm Liquors, which put us to continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sweats, and evaporate the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; but <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerves, that no Animal drinks hot Liquors beſides Mankind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hot Baths promote Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo does hot Air: The warming of Beds, and the ſitting
<pb facs="tcp:98254:24"/>
by the Fire, and keeping in the Air of a warm Houſe, diſpoſes us to ſweat; which being, as <hi>Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> ſays, an unnatural Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they weaken the Spirits, and the Stomach, fill the Head with Vapours, occaſion Defluxions, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and flaccidity of the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>Many hot Clothes, and wearing Flannel, promote Perſpiration too much, and beget a Laſſitude, which proceeds from leſs Strength, as as well as more Weight in our Muſeles.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The violent Exerciſe of the Mind evacuates the aerial inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Perſpirabile;</hi> but that of the Body evacuates the ſerous <hi>Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> and that diminiſhes the Strength. Eating too much, makes Heat, and violent Exerciſe, always make the
<pb facs="tcp:98254:24"/>
Perſpiration viſible; but the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is only natural and healthful, and that which follows a perfect Digeſtion.</p>
            <p>Too much Exerciſe kills more than too little, becauſe of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident of ſtopping the Pores un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily by cold Air.</p>
            <p>Going into cold Water after vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Exerciſe, <hi>Sanctorius</hi> condemns as dangerous; for by Exerciſe the Humours are much rarefy'd; and by ſudden Cold the heated Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours immediately coagulate; and for this reaſon we muſt not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe before cold bathing, tho' the Antients preſcribe it, and practiſed it. And the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Clayton</hi> of <hi>Wakefield,</hi> (to whom for his Obſervations on St. <hi>Mungus</hi> Well, I am very much obliged) gives
<pb facs="tcp:98254:25"/>
me an account in a Second Letter, that the <hi>Americans</hi> make ſweating-Ovens on the ſide of the Banks of their Rivers, which they heat as we do our Ovens, and when cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, they put the Patient to ſweat in them for Fevers; and in the height of his Sweat, he runs into the River, and dives over Head; and theſe Ovens the Docter has ſeen in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Practice being againſt the Reaſon of our Philoſophy, and the Inclination of our tender Patient, it will not ſo readily prevail, tho' Experience ſtands on its ſide; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would I recommend a Practice very hazardous, to which nothing ſhould perſuade me, till I am ſatisfy'd of ſome extraordinary
<pb facs="tcp:98254:25"/>
Advantage by it, in curing ſome deſperate Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>The Paſſion of Anger, Joy, as well as Exerciſe, inlarge the Circulation outwardly, and thereby propel the <hi>Perſpirabile</hi> outwardly; and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo inlarge the Expanſion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits in the <hi>Cutis,</hi> to open the Pores thereof; ſo a Net, by only holding it gently, opens its Maſhes, but by ſtretching of it, they cloſe more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All hot Conſtitutions and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymia's,</hi> ſuch as the Scorbutic, the Choleric, the Salt ſtates of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, perſpire too much, their Bloods are like a Jelly, and the Habit of the Body dry and thin.</p>
            <p>In hot Countries, and the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Seaſon, and Youth, theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions ſuffer moſt; the <hi>Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:26"/>
is more acrid in theſe Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in Summer; and if this be retained, it produces Malignant Fevers in Summer; for Perſpiration hindered, produces a Putrefaction; and nothing hinders that more than a large Ventilation; for Gangreens are cured, and all Tumours, by reſtoring Perſpiration: But all theſe Conſtitutions are fitteſt for cold Baths, and receive Injury by hot Baths.</p>
            <p>In Sleep we perſpire about lb. iij. but in Watching about 20 Ounces; the Body will fully perſpire by being ten Hours in Bed; and we find our ſelves more lightſom in the Morning, becauſe our Bodies are really more light, by the loſs of the weight mention'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:26"/>
The way to know what Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is natural, is thus; if after a larger Supper we find by weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Morning fifty Ounces to have perſpired in twelve Hours time; and if we obſerve our weight in the Morning when we eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at Night, and that be twenty Ounces, we muſt endeavour by the uſe of the ſeveral Cauſes which promote or hinder our Perſpiration, to reduce it to come near the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, betwixt fifty and twenty Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>viz.</hi> thirty five Ounces: And this will preſerve our Health to a Hundred Years, as <hi>Sanctorius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms; who alſo aſſures us, That that Health is moſt ſtable, which alters little in Perſpiration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98254:27"/>
If by the hot Regimen I have mention'd, as Brandy, Spirits, ſtrong Wines, ſmoaking Tobacco, ſtrong Ale, hot Baths, wearing Flannel and many Clothes, keeping in the Houſe, warming of Beds, ſitting by great Fires, drinking continually of Tea and Coffee, want of due Exerciſe of the Body, by too much ſtudy or Paſſion of the Mind, by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying too young, or by too much Venery, which injures the Eyes, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and Perſpiration to a fourth part, and breeds Wind and Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, heats the Blood, and weakens the Nerves; for all the Effeminacy, Niceneſs, and Weakneſs of Spirits is produced in the Hyſterical and Hypochondriacal: I hope my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will pardon my Freedom of Correcting theſe Vices or Errors,
<pb facs="tcp:98254:27"/>
when I ſhew them the only Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to prevent or cure theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in their Bodies and Minds, which is by hardening their Bodies in the experienc'd cold Baths, firſt at <hi>Buxton,</hi> for the moſt tender, and old infirm Perſons; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at <hi>Holywell,</hi> or St. <hi>Mungus-Well;</hi> and the drinking of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters in Summer, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Stomachs for frequent drinking cold Water at other times, by which all hot Conſtitutions will receive more benefit, than by Tea, Coffee, Brandy, Spirits, or ſtrong Liquors and hot Baths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tacitus</hi> gives us the reaſon why the <hi>German</hi> Children injoyed the Strength of their Parents. <hi>Ser a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venum Venus, eoque ienxhauſt a pubertas.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>A Languor Laſſitude, and more weight, are Signs of immoderate Coition; old Men are made cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by it by the loſs of Spirits, and heavier; but young Men hotter and lighter.</p>
            <p>I do not perſuade my Reader to change thoſe Errors of living, without having firſt done ſo my ſelf; for by leaving off ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and all hot Diet, Teas, Coffee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by Water-drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bathing at <hi>Buxton,</hi> I have procured to my ſelf better Health, and more Hardineſs, than I have enjoy'd for many Years before. And by the long uſe of this cold Regimen, I believe we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our Bodies to an equal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration;
<pb facs="tcp:98254:28"/>
if we often weigh our ſelves in the time of cold bathing every Morning, we ſhall find the moſt natural and healthful Degree of Perſpiration; and we need not fear the ſtopping of our Pores ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly by cold Water, for that for the preſent will ſtrengthen our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat, and cauſe a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Perſpiration: And by <hi>Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius'</hi>s Scales he found the Body to weigh leſs after bathing in cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And that part of the <hi>Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile</hi> which paſſed too much by the Skin, is either hindred from being bred in the Body, or elſe paſſes by Urine; for the more the Perſpiration is promoted, the leſs are the ſenſible Evacuations, and <hi>è contra.</hi>

The Inconveniences and Signs of the Perſpiration too much, an languor of the Spirits, flaccidity of the Fleſh, the quick Senſe of cold Air, and Shivering with it, and a coldneſs of the external Parts: The aerial <hi>Perſpirabile</hi> retained, diſpoſes to Anger and Joy, but the ſerous to Fear and Sadneſs. All the hot Regimen and hot Baths have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the profuſe Perſpiration. It is <hi>Sanctorius'</hi>s Aſſertion, that thoſe who perſpire too much thro' the Paſſions of the Mind, are hardly brought to a due Perſpiration: for too much Motion of the Mind hurts more than that of the Body.</p>
            <p>I have more fully reckoned up the Cauſes and Signs of the ſtopt or profuſe Perſpiration, that by the
<pb facs="tcp:98254:29"/>
uſe of the hot or cold Baths, we might regulate all Exceſſes, and by different Baths, make the Rules of <hi>Sanctorius</hi> practicable, in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an equal juſt weight of our Bodies, and that the Addition by Diet, and Subſtraction by inviſible Perſpiration, may be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and healthful.</p>
            <p>That I might farther incourage the uſe of Cold bathing, I will give an account from <hi>Jones,</hi> of what he writ concerning <hi>Buxton-Baths;</hi> and from the reſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers, which mention that and other cold Baths.</p>

He mentions <hi>King's-Newnam</hi> near <hi>Coventry,</hi> and calls the Water Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, and that he found it to taſte like Alum, but not unpleaſant in drinking. There are three Wells, the biggeſt riſeth out of a Hill, and from thence the Water is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd to divers parts of the Realm to be drank: It cures the Palſie, dimneſs of Sight, dulneſs of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Cholic and Stone, old Sores, green Wounds: It Petrifies by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering about Oak or Aſh Sticks, fine Sand. At firſt Entrance it is cold, but after a while it warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, giving an indifferent Heat; no Man hath ſuſtained Injury by the ſame: The Virtue thereof was found 1579.

good for Pains, Gout, dulneſs of Sight, heals Wounds, ſmooths the Skin, helps Lameneſs and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sinews, by its Oilineſs.

            <p>I diſtill'd a clear Oil out of the Water; and, in ſhort, I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this Water, as one of the beſt bituminous Baths I believe in <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>At <hi>Godſall</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> there is a cold Sulphur-water, formerly famous for Leproſie; and this I may recommend for a Cold Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
<pb facs="tcp:98254:35"/>
Bath, and may be uſed as a Sulphur Medicine.</p>
            <p>There are divers Salt Springs in our Country; and theſe, if mild, may be uſed both inwardly and outwardly.</p>
            <p>There is an exceeding cold Spring in <hi>Sutton-Park,</hi> called <hi>Routhen Well,</hi> which the Country uſe for Cold bathing in the Itch; and it may ſerve the uſes of Cold bathing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well.

            <p>We have many Chalybeate Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters very uſeful, at <hi>Lichfield, Poleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, Bromage,</hi> and <hi>Blurton;</hi> and thoſe who would try the utmoſt of Cold bathings, muſt begin with <hi>Buxton,</hi> then go to <hi>Holywell,</hi> and at laſt try <hi>Willowbridge-Bath,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:98254:35"/>
will Oil and lubricate the Skin; and by this we imitate the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> who uſed to anoint with Oil after bathing.</p>

               <p>THE Occaſion of my Inquiry into the Nature of <hi>Baths,</hi> was ſome Obſervations I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made at <hi>Bathe,</hi> about 3 Years ſince, and what I thought ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in a late Viſit I made to <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s <hi>Bath</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire.</hi>

I found theſe two <hi>Baths</hi> of different Uſe in curing Diſeaſes; and I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved great Irregularity in the Uſe of both of them.</p>
               <p>I obſerved that many Perſons came to the hot <hi>Baths</hi> at <hi>Bathe,</hi> without any good Advice; or they who came with it, indiſcreetly and imprudently mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Bathing (by uſing of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due Evacuation, or continuing of it too long) that they went from thence worſe than they came; ſome having inflam'd their Blood, and thicken'd its <hi>Serum,</hi> ſo as to renew their Rheumatic Pains: Others died of Fevers, Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, Convulſions, Bleeding, Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes, not long after. I frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on what is alſo obſerved by the Ancient Writers of the particular Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done by Bathing; that healthful Perſons receive much Prejudice by hot <hi>Baths,</hi> which colliquate the Humours, and occaſion Fevers, and Defluxions of Humours, Pains, Inflammations, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
               <p>Theſe Inſtances may convince all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Perſons, that we ought not to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98254:37"/>
uſe hot <hi>Baths</hi> for Pleaſure, eſpecially where there is a fulneſs of Humours, and a hot Conſtitution; and ſince the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Accidents frequently happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Bathing, they will certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance all the Pleaſure of it. Theſe Inconveniencies come by hot <hi>Baths,</hi> Thirſt and Fevers, by raiſing the natural Fermentation or Rarefaction of our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours into a putrify'd State, making them viſcid and ſalt. Hence come the Pains and Rheums occaſioned by hot <hi>Baths,</hi> and the Inclinations to much Sweating, and profuſe <hi>Haemorrhages.</hi> Many Diſeaſes of the Brain are produc'd by hot <hi>Baths;</hi> as, <hi>Apoplexies, Sleepineſs, Vertigo, Convulſions, Aſthma's, Debility of the Sight, Swooning,</hi> a general <hi>Laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and a <hi>Dejection</hi> of the <hi>Appetite,</hi> and <hi>Torpor</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> and <hi>Effeminacy</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> Hot Bathing binds the Body, ſwells the Belly, if many Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and inflammatory Cholicks be there; and makes the Stomach weak, by diverting the Circulation of Humours to the Habit of the Body, and often occaſions Vomitings, and Coughs, Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98254:38"/>
and many other Inconveniences I ſhall hereafter mention.</p>
               <p>My Journey to <hi>Buxton-Well</hi> this laſt Year diſcovered to me a <hi>Bath</hi> very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erent from that at <hi>Bathe,</hi> it being a very temperate <hi>Bath,</hi> prod ucing no Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it, but rather a Coldneſs; and upon a due Conſideration I found the <hi>Bath</hi> very uſeful in many Caſes, in which that of <hi>Bathe</hi> did Injury; as in Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, hot <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pains, and all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions of Humours, and <hi>Bleedings,</hi> and all the hot inordinate <hi>Flatulencies</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> in <hi>Hyſteric</hi> and <hi>Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac Caſes.</hi> And theſe I found uſed by the Northern Countries, chiefly for Pleaſure, without any Method or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or Regularity of Diet; and as the <hi>Baths</hi> at <hi>Bathe</hi> are commended like a Medicine of ſome eminent <hi>Quack,</hi> for all Diſeaſes, tho' they require a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Remedy to cure them; ſo theſe in the Opinion of the Northern Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, cure all their Diſeaſes, whether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon a hot or cold Cauſe.</p>
               <p>By the Obſervation of the different Nature of the two mentioned <hi>Baths,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98254:38"/>
as well as the Contrariety of the Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes incident to Animal Humours, I did believe that ſome ſhort Treatiſe would be uſeful, which explain'd the Nature of the ſeveral kinds of <hi>Baths,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in what particular Caſe each might be uſeful, ſo that Phyſicians might not ſend Perſons to improper <hi>Baths;</hi> nor they incur great Hazard of their Healths by an indiſcreet Choice, or Uſe of a Diſagreeing <hi>Bath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I always believ'd our Senſes were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently acute to diſcern what was uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both to a diſeas'd as well as a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Body: For by them, we, as well as the Brutes do examine both our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine and Diet.</p>
               <p>We perceive that all Odours ſhew the hot Temper of our Medicines and Meats; That the cooler emit no Odour conſiderable.</p>
               <p>The Taſte more evidently diſcovers the Virtue of all Liquids.</p>
               <p>The Aſtringent Taſte diſcovers a Cooling, Condenſating, Repelling, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing Quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98254:39"/>
The Acid attenuates, incides without Heat, and opens and repels.</p>
               <p>The Acrid heats, attracts, diſcuſſes.</p>
               <p>Bitters cleanſe, open, attenuate thick Humours, without manifeſt Heat.</p>
               <p>Watery Taſtes cool; thicken, obſtruct, mortifie, or ſtupifie.</p>
               <p>Salt Taſtes dry without great Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Heat, aſtringe; they preſerve from Putrefaction.</p>
               <p>Sweet Taſtes concoct; mollifie, rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, or ferment.</p>
               <p>Oily Taſtes moiſten; mollifie and eaſe Pain.</p>
               <p>By the Experiments on particular Taſtes, and the obſervable Modes of our Taſtes, old Phyſicians, <hi>Galen, Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta, Orobaſius, Aetius,</hi> as is evident by their Diſcourſe upon the Taſtes of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, diſcovered the ſeveral Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments of Medicines, and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of them; and by theſe Taſtes they moſt particularly examin'd the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of all Medicinal Waters and <hi>Baths.</hi> By them the moſt barbarous Nations, the <hi>Aſiatic, African, European,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations found out the Virtue
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98254:39"/>
and Uſe of their <hi>Baths,</hi> naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in each Country, before any great Knowledge was got in Chymiſtry, Phyſick, or any general Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>There was no other Phyſick for many Years than Bathing, Exerciſe, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et at <hi>Rome.</hi> They believed Bathing to empty all Superfluities; and that Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cured all Diſeaſes depending on an ill Diet, and external Cauſes, by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating the <hi>Fumoſum</hi> and <hi>Humidum,</hi> which ought to paſs by Tranſpiration. It corrects the Heat of our Humours, and diſcuſſes the Salt Putrid Humours, producing cutaneous Effects; as, the Scab and Leproſie.</p>
               <p>We have many Senſes to help in our Enquiry into the Nature of <hi>Bath</hi> Waters: The Touch inform us of thoſe that are hotter than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat of our Humours; which are the hot <hi>Baths,</hi> the Heat of whoſe Water ſeems to me moſt probably to depend on ſome Neighbouring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Fire (as <hi>Baccius</hi> has moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conjectur'd by the burning Hill near the Neighbouring Baye;) And he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98254:40"/>
deſcribes Places in the Field, called <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuraria,</hi> where the Water really boyls as in a Caldron; And he imputes the different Degrees of Heat in the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters to their being nearer to the Chymnies or Channels of Fire, when they are very hot; and that the tepid Waters are more remote from them; and he affirms that ſome Waters are ſo hot at <hi>Puteoli,</hi> that they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on nothing leſs than actual Fire for their Scalding Heat; becauſe they burn, and bliſter, and excoriate as ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot Water does: And <hi>Baccius</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerves, <hi>in quibuſdam locis ignis &amp; aqua cum fervore emergunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Neighbourhood of <hi>Veſuvius</hi> and <hi>Aetna</hi> to the hot <hi>Baths</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> give a ſufficient Demonſtration of the Cauſe of the Heat of them; and by Parity of Reaſon we may gueſs that the ſame Cauſe gives the like Heat to <hi>Baths</hi> of colder Climates, tho' the Actual Fires are not ſo evident there.</p>
               <p>There are in thoſe Countries Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory Caves, where there is a violent actual Heat; and in ſome Places the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98254:40"/>
Noiſe of boiling Waters; all which prove the Neighbourhood of Actual Fire, which has ſufficiently manifeſted it ſelf by frequent Eruptions, which burnt to Aſhes the moſt Celebrated Buildings of thoſe <hi>Baths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fervid <hi>Baths</hi> in the firſt Degree are intolerable by their Exceſs of Heat excoriating.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Degree of hot <hi>Baths</hi> are very hot, yet fit for <hi>Baths,</hi> which are either more diſtant from the actual Fire, or made more mild by the Mixture of the cooler Minerals; as, <hi>Nitre, Alom</hi> or cool <hi>Springs.</hi> Theſe have very good or bad Effects, according as they are applied to divers Conſtitutions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes which I will deſcribe in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter.</p>
               <p>The hotteſt Bath we have, is the long <hi>Bath</hi> at <hi>Bathe;</hi> and the King and Queen's <hi>Bath;</hi> and the Croſs <hi>Bath</hi> is more mild, but much too hot for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate <hi>Bath,</hi> the Effects of which will be deſcrib'd in the next Chapter, to heat and dry, and not moiſten.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98254:41"/>
The ſecond Degree of <hi>Baths</hi> which our Senſe of Feeling diſcovers is the temperate <hi>Baths,</hi> which are near the natural Temper of our Humours; and theſe may be uſeful for the Preſervation of our Healths, as well as our Pleaſure, and the curing of ſome cutaneous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes; ſuch are the <hi>Baths</hi> of warm Water, which mollifie, diſcuſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct, ſtrengthen, and warm.</p>
               <p>Theſe are good in <hi>Ephemera's, Thirſt, Laſſitude</hi> and <hi>Itch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Degree of <hi>Baths,</hi> of which our Senſe of Feeling informs us, is the cold <hi>Baths,</hi> which chill our Humours, ſtop the Pores, and ſtrengthen our Limbs and Spirits.</p>
               <p>The fourth does not only diſcover the Heat and Coldneſs of Water, but alſo the Roughneſs or Drineſs and the Softneſs of Waters.</p>
               <p>That all theſe kind of Bathings are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful, the Experience of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges teſtifies; and they always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them to different States of our Humours: For if we be too hot, our Reaſon, as well as Experience, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98254:41"/>
cold Bathing in <hi>Ephemera's</hi> and exceſſive Heats; But if our Bodies be chill, and pained, we uſe hot <hi>Baths;</hi> and for Pleaſure, cleanſing the Skin, and Preſervation of Health, the moſt temperate <hi>Baths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Senſes which inform us of the Medicinal Nature of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals diſſolv'd in the Fountain Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are our Taſte, and Smell and Sight.</p>
               <p>Fountain Water as ſuch, only lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, cools, and mollifies; but the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and altering Quality depends on the ſeveral Minerals diſſolv'd in Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Waters. Theſe Mineral Waters we artificially imitate, by diſſolving ſeveral prepar'd Minerals in them; and by the Taſte of the natural Mineral Waters, we may be beſt directed to the neareſt Proportion and Mixture of our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial <hi>Baths</hi> in Imitation of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. There is ſcarce any two Mineral Waters which have exactly the ſame Mixture of Minerals, as we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by their Variety of Taſtes and Virtues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98254:42"/>
Our Taſte ſhews us that all Mineral Waters dry: For they evidently dry the Tongue and ſhrivel the Skin: Tho' moſt <hi>Baths</hi> have compounded Taſtes, yet ſome one is moſt predominant; and by that I will diſtinguiſh the ſeveral ſorts of Mineral Waters and <hi>Baths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſulphureous foetid or ſtinking <hi>Baths: Sulphur</hi> is diſſolv'd in theſe <hi>Baths,</hi> which is like the Soot of a Chimney, or Fuliginous Vapours from the inward inflamed Parts of the Earth. Metals burned, ſend forth the Steam of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur;</hi> and that is knownby its <hi>Putor,</hi> and the Taſte of Sulphur, is evident in many <hi>Baths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sulphureous <hi>Baths</hi> are generally hot; but there are many Sulphureous Waters evidently cold and ſtinking; for which reaſon we believe the actual Heat depends not on the Sulphur alone.</p>
               <p>Theſe Sulphureous <hi>Baths</hi> agree with the cold <hi>Cacochymia's,</hi> and cold ſolid Parts; but are injurious to all hot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, Fevers and Defluxions of Humours; in which we preſcribe to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Wine, Venery, the Sun and <hi>Baths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98254:42"/>
It was obſerv'd by <hi>Aetius,</hi> that ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous and bituminous <hi>Baths</hi> very much offend the Head if it be pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them.</p>
               <p>The ſulphureous Waters may be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by boyling <hi>Hepar Sulphuris,</hi> or <hi>Sulphur Flower</hi> in ſome <hi>Lixivium;</hi> or a Mixture of Sulphur and Filings of Iron moiſtened with Water till they grow warm; or by boyling the <hi>Pyrites</hi> in Water; the Quantity of the Water muſt be ſo much as to give it a Taſte like o the Sulphur Waters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Bituminous <hi>Baths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bituminous Waters are known by their <hi>acutus Nidor</hi> (for the Smell of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen</hi> is foetid) by this their Acrimony and Bitterneſs, they diſcuſs and heat; but they mollifie more than the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous <hi>Baths;</hi> becauſe <hi>Bitumens</hi> have an Oily Viſcidity in them.</p>
               <p>All Places that burn in the Earth, have either a <hi>Bitumen</hi> or <hi>Sulphur</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>Bituminous Waters that have only the <hi>Nidor</hi> of <hi>Bitumen</hi> in them, may ſafely be drank to heal, dry and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98254:43"/>
they heal Ulcers, cicatrize Wounds; but they fill the Head, cauſe Sleep, and hurt the Senſes and Eyes.</p>
               <p>Theſe may be artificially imitated by boyling the <hi>Piſſaſphaltus</hi> Stone in hot Water, ſuch as is got in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> out of the Coal-Pits near <hi>Bentall;</hi> or the Matter of the Tar-Wells, may be mix'd in <hi>Baths;</hi> or Ointments for mollifying and diſcuſſing, and the Pitch made of thoſe Stones in Emplaſters. No Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Waters are yet eminent with us in <hi>England;</hi> tho' I have been inform'd, that an Oil like <hi>Turpentine</hi> has been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled from <hi>Willow-Bridge</hi> Water in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> which has been much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for external Maladies.</p>
               <p>It may be conſider'd how far <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> Tar, or the common <hi>Petrolaeum</hi> may be uſed for mollifying and diſcuſſing <hi>Baths,</hi> by boyling them in Water to make a <hi>Bath</hi> like the <hi>Hydrolaeum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have heard of a Bituminous Mud in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and in other Places, which would ſupply the <hi>Illutamentum</hi> uſed by the old <hi>Romans</hi> in External Parts.</p>
               <p>

               <p>VVe cannot but admire the great VViſdom as well as Kindneſs of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in preparing ſo many Mineral Medicines for the Uſe of the Diſeaſed Part of Mankind. The great Creator only, knows the infinite Variety of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, Conſtitutions, and the great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of Mineral as well as Vegetable Medicines.

               <p>By theſe means our Reaſon, and Senſe, and Experience directs us to a right Uſe of theſe Waters; therefore nothing can be more irrational, as well as preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to Mankind, than to uſe any one <hi>Bath,</hi> as the narrow-Soul'd Phyſicians do for all ſorts of Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Nature ſeems ſo concern'd to unlock the Myſteries of her Chymiſtry, that by the Colours of ſome Waters we may diſcover their Contents, as well as by their Taſtes.</p>

               <p>By the <hi>Microſcope</hi> we have in this Age attempted to improve the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Ingredients of Mineral Waters, by obſerving the Figures of the Chryſtallizing Salts: And this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod may ſucceed well enough where there is only Salts diſſolv'd in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Water, and that but of one ſort; but ſince moſt Waters have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>I call thoſe hot <hi>Baths</hi> which have very hot Water, and ſome Tincture from the Sulphur or Bitumen.</p>
               <p>The VVaters at <hi>Bath</hi> have not only a conſiderable actual Heat, by which they produce their Effects; but they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98254:56"/>
have a Saltneſs to cleanſe, as well as a Roughneſs, to ſtrengthen. The Sulphur in them, has alſo particular Effects by its diſcuſſing <hi>Faetor:</hi> And I remember the <hi>Croſs-Bath Pump-Water</hi> taſtes evidently Vitriolic.</p>
               <p>The Roughneſs in the Water depends on the <hi>Nitrum Calcarium.</hi> The Saltneſs on common Salt, which is in double Proportion to the <hi>Nitre.</hi> The <hi>Lapis Calcarius</hi> is double in proportion to the Salts; but the other evaporates by boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

Bathing in hot <hi>Baths;</hi> becauſe the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer following continues the Pores o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Autumn Bathing occaſions the Pores to be ſo open towards Winter, as to render all Perſons ſubject to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Weather, and makes them ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Cold all Winter. And this let my Country-Men conſider, who are uſed to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bath-Waters</hi> are beſt drank when moſt free from Rain; but the beſt time is in <hi>May:</hi> For the Waters heat, and cauſe Tranſpiration.</p>
               <p>Hot Bathing and drinking Waters is improper for hot Weather.</p>
               <p>The Injuries done by the hot <hi>Baths</hi> are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Vehemency of Heat in the <hi>Baths</hi> are over dry, heats body, and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens their Humours: Therefore they are unfit for Children, and delicate tender Perſons, whoſe Fleſh is eaſily diſſolv'd by exceſſive Heat, which alſo over-drys and decays old Men, diſſipating their languid Spirits; and all thin languid Perſons are much decay'd by them; and the thin Hypocondriac are over-dry'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98254:60"/>
by their Heat, and made ſubject to <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's, Fluxes</hi> and <hi>hectic Fevers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hot <hi>Baths</hi> are injurious to choleric Conſtitutions, by exciting intermitting Fevers and <hi>Ephemera's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſort are injurious to all viſcid Conſtitutions of Humours, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Rheumatiſms, Inflammations and Pains during the Efferveſcence of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and the Defluxions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Saltneſs of Blood is encreas'd by hot Bathing, which raiſes the Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Humours, and promotes a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Circulation of them.</p>
               <p>But the drinking the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters is not injurious to theſe Conſtitutions; becauſe they cleanſe away the Choler, dilute the Viſcidity, and waſh away the Saltneſs of Humours.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Putrefaction of Humours is promoted by hot <hi>Baths.</hi> For this Reaſon we condemn ſuch <hi>Baths</hi> in Fevers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting and malignant, in the <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobia,</hi> and Poyſons and Pox. Some Minerals are diſſolv'd in that Water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Itch, Leproſie, ſcald Head, ſuch as Salt and Nitre which kill
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98254:60"/>
Worms and Lice that are the Effects of Putrefaction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In a general Leanneſs tho'they ſpend the <hi>Succus nutritius;</hi> yet they open the obſtructed Pores, and reſtore the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a Paralytic Member in an Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of it.</p>
               <p>In very great Fulneſs of Humours, hot Bathing occaſions the Breach of a Vein, by rarifying the Aerial Spirits in the Blood.</p>
               <p>If Thirſt be troubleſome, Bathing encreaſes it, and Drinking allays it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Defluxion of all Humours is promoted by hot <hi>Baths,</hi> which col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquate or rather rarifie the Aerial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in our Humours, and open the Glands through which they may flow. And for this reaſon we forbid hot <hi>Baths</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Defluxions in <hi>Catarrhs, Gout, Aſthma's</hi> or Pains; <hi>Inflammation</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalic</hi> Diſeaſes depending on a Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Ephemera,</hi> or intermitting Fevers, and in all ſorts of Inflammatious and hot Pains, with Fevers, as, Eryſipelas, Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Cholicks, Head-ach, Strangury, Stone, Gout, Rheumatiſm, Quinſie, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotis,

All Ulcers and Inflammations receive Prejudice in the Beginning by hot <hi>Baths,</hi> and alſo by drinking the Waters very hot; but in the Declination, the <hi>Bath</hi> diſcuſſes the Inflammation and cleanſes the Ulcers; but all neceſſary Evacuations ought to precede.</p>
               <p>Hot <hi>Baths</hi> ripen all inward Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes in the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, Womb, Inteſtines, Bladder. Theſe <hi>Baths</hi> are injurious in all Putrefactions; as, Fevers, eſpecially <hi>Hectics, Apople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xies, Phrenſies, Carbuncles, Cancers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hot <hi>Baths</hi> excite Venereal Pains, as all Fevers do, and make all Coughs and Catarrhs worſe; for which we better preſcribe cool Diet, Air and cool Drinks, which better agree with them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In all <hi>Haemorrhages</hi> theſe hot <hi>Baths</hi> are miſchievous; as in that by the Noſe, Womb, Anus, Vomiting, or piſſing Blood,

and Coughing it up, or in the Hepatic Flux.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Theſe <hi>Baths</hi> are injurious in Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Humours out of the Body as <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betes, Gonorrhaeas, Abortions</hi> and too much ſweating.</p>
               <p n="11">11.

               <p n="12">12. The great Expanſion of Spirits producing Watching, uſual to old Men, and ſalt Conſtitutions are made worſe by Bathing.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The great Exploſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in Convulſions is much irritated by the Heat of Bathing; as in <hi>Epilepſies, Hyſteric</hi> Paſſions, and other <hi>Convulſions, Palpitations, Singultus, Coughs, Sneeſing.</hi>

                  <hi>Of</hi> Cold-bathing; <hi>the Benefits and Injuries of it: To which is adjoyn'd an account of the</hi> Bath <hi>at</hi> Buxton <hi>in</hi> Derbyſhire.</head>
               <p>THE uſe of Cold bathing is very Ancient; for <hi>Pliny</hi> relates that <hi>Carmis,</hi> a <hi>Maſſilian</hi> Phyſician, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Cuſtom of Hot bathing, and perſuaded the <hi>Romans</hi> to bathe in Cold Water; in the midſt of the Winter, Months during the greateſt Cold, he dipt the ſick in the Lakes of Water. <hi>Videbamus ſenes conſulares in oſtentationem uſque rigentes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Cold Demerſion was uſed in <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s time, by <hi>Antonius Myſa,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Euphorbius,</hi> to aſtringe the Pores, to unite the Heat, and to ſtrengthen the Limbs; and <hi>Galen</hi> was ſo much of their Opinion, that he thought the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98254:69"/>
Hot Baths were only preparatory to Cold bathing; and on that, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Benefit depended.</p>
               <p>Bathing in Rivers, and the Sea, was moſt Ancient for Exerciſe, Pleaſure, and curing Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>A place for ſwimming in Cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was provided for in the <hi>Roman Baths,</hi> and was more Ancient than they.</p>
               <p>The manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> was to conclude their Hot Bathing with the Cold Water; which ſhews the good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they had of Cold Immerſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi>'s Method of Bathing was thus; firſt they exercis'd in a Morning; then they enter'd the <hi>Laconicum,</hi> where the Air was warm or hot by the Steams of the Water, or Fire; and there the Pores are open'd, and they ſweat; the tenſity of the Skin relaxes, and the Humours more rarify'd to paſs the Suda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Glands, thro' which the Pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed by the heat, or the leſs preſſure of the external humid Air, propels the attenuated <hi>Serum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:98254:70"/>
From the <hi>Laconicum</hi> they deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Lavacrum,</hi> or into hot Water, where they ſweat as much as they pleaſe: And from thence they came to the Cold Water, that what was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated by exerciſe or bathing, might there be cooled, and the Strength con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by thickening the Skin, that the innate Heat might not tranſpire too much, and thereby make the Body cold; for Cold bathing conſtringes the Pores, and hardens the Body, as hot Iron is cool'd and harden'd by cold Water. By theſe it is evident, that they invented the Hot Baths to prepare weak Bodies for the Cold. From the Cold Bath they went into the <hi>Tepidari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> or <hi>Apodyterium,</hi> where the Air was tepid, and they were rubb'd from Sweat; and anointed. Afterwards Meat and Drink, and Sleep were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd.</p>
               <p>It was the Cuſtom of the <hi>Germans</hi> to carry the new-born Child to a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there to dip it in the Water, to ſtrengthen the Body, and to try their natural Vigour; for if it were very
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98254:70"/>
weak, it often dy'd; for which reaſon <hi>Galen</hi> condemns this Cuſtom as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and dangerous. This Cuſtom he ſays is more fit for Beaſts, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them a hard Skin, inſenſible of Cold; and he believes it not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Men to have a thick and hard Skin; for according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Obſervation, a rare thin Skin is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for thoſe who tranſpire out many hot Vapours and Fumes; for if they be retain'd, the Body ſuffers by them: And a thick Skin is uſeful againſt the Injuries of the Weather: Both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes are to be avoided; the Skin is not to be thicken'd ſo far as to hinder tranſpiration; or to be kept ſo rare, that by all Accidents of Weather it may be much affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virgil</hi> takes notice of the Cuſtom of bathing Children in cold Water, in theſe Verſes;</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Durum à ſtirpe genus natos ad flumina primum,</l>
                  <l>Deferimus, ſaevoque gelu duramus &amp; undis.</l>

               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:98254:71"/>
This is the Method <hi>Galen</hi> gives for Cold bathing, for the preſervation of Health in Perſons fully grown, for ſtrengthening the Limbs, and thicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Skin againſt the Injuries of Cold, he adviſes this Method in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, in the hotteſt time of the Year, in the middle of the Day, and in fair Weather, when the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not perfectly Cold, but Tepid, and the Perſon be faſting and empty, then he muſt uſe this Bath, having firſt exercis'd, to excite a natural Heat, to reſiſt the Coldneſs of the Water: And after Exerciſe, and Friction, let him <hi>demergere</hi> into Cold Water. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion ought to be ſudden, and not gradual, to prevent a Horror.</p>
               <p>The Perſon who muſt be us'd to Cold Water, ought to be in the midſt of the fourth Seven Years, in perfect Health, and to be well rubb'd with Linnen, and after well rubb'd with Oil. The firſt time the Water muſt be Tepid, not very Cold; but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time he may uſe it very Cold;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98254:71"/>
and at his going out let him be rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with Oil till he is very hot. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this Three or Four Days; then after an Interval, if he approves of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, but not a Third bathing for the ſame time.</p>
               <p>They ſtay a moderate time in the Water who come out well-colour'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Friction; but if they be leſs warm, and pale colour'd, they have ſtaid in too long, which muſt be avoided.</p>
               <p>After Clothing, let the Perſon reſt an Hour at leaſt, and then eat more than he drinks; for after this Cold Immerſion, the Appetite increaſes, the Thirſt abates, they concoct better, their Muſcles are ſtronger, and the Skin is more hard and denſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Baths</hi> unite the Heat, turn the fuliginous Vapours into Sweat, excite the Expulſion of the Excrements, and looſen the Body: It cures Laſſitude if uſed by intervals, and the Heat occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by travelling in the Sun; the <hi>Caninum appetitum ex immodicâ tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratione.</hi>

Thus far <hi>Galen</hi> has inſtructed us in the uſe of Cold <hi>Baths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives us this Aphoriſm concerning <hi>Baths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Salt <hi>Bath</hi> heats and dries; a Hot <hi>Bath</hi> extenuates the Perſon that is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, but heats and moiſtens him that has eat: And Cold <hi>Baths</hi> effect the contrary. By which Aphoriſm we perceive he knew the Virtue of Cold bathing, that it warmed and hindred the extenuation of our Body when empty, by cloſing the Pores, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the evaporation of our Aerial Spirits; but the Cold Baths cool and dry them that have eaten: It cools by checking the Fermentation of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and their rarefaction: It dries by repelling the nutritious Humours from the Skin, as Hot <hi>Baths</hi> are ſaid to plump it up by relaxing it, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refying the Humours contain'd in the Veſſels of it.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Aphoriſms about the uſe of Cold Water in Fomentati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons, we may learn the Benefits and Injuries of Cold Water; for Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98254:72"/>
are bathing particular Parts only.</p>
               <p>This is the uſe of Cold Things, or Water; we muſt apply them to the place that bleeds, or about them; and they may be uſed to extinguiſh the ardor and burning of Inflammations, which have a Sanguine Colour at the firſt, but if the Inflammation have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd long, it cauſes a livid Colour: It alſo helps an <hi>Eryſipela</hi> not ulcerated, but is very dangerous to them that be ulcerated. He alſo recommends Cold Water to foment the hot Tumours, and Pains of the Gout, or Joynts, which are without Ulcers, and for Convulſions. In theſe he preſcribes the affuſion of much Cold Water, which mitigates the Pain, and extenuates the Part; and a moderate <hi>Stupor</hi> allays the Pain.</p>
               <p>By theſe Aphoriſms we are plainly taught, that the Cold Baths may be profitable for all <hi>Haemorrhages, Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, Eryſipela's, Pains, Gout, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions;</hi> and he deals thus Ingenuouſly in giving an account of the Injuries
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98254:73"/>
of cold Fomentations: And the ſame are of cold Baths.</p>
               <p>Cold is injurious to Ulcers, for that hinders the Evacuation of their Sores, and the Nutrition of the Part. It thickens the Skin by contracting the Parts.</p>
               <p>Cold hinders pain'd Parts from Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purating, by checking the Flux of Blood to it. It produces <hi>Livors</hi> or Blackneſs in the Parts if too long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd, by ſtopping the Circulation of the Blood, and Tranſpiration of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours. It occaſions <hi>Febrile</hi> Rigors, from the Irritation of the Nerves, by hot Vapours retain'd in the Body. It occaſions Cramps from the ſame Cauſe; and the Stoppage of the Circulation thro' the Muſcles.</p>
               <p>All theſe Inconveniences happen in Cold Bathing, which I will give an Account of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aetius</hi> mentions the famous <hi>Albulae, quae ſapore ſubſalſe &amp; tactu lactei teporis.</hi> He ſays they were <hi>Aluminous, Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous,</hi> and that by their <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt they cleanſe Ulcers; and that they were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98254:73"/>
drank the firſt day three <hi>Hemina's, viz.</hi> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Ounces; the ſecond Five <hi>Hemina's;</hi> the third Six <hi>Hemina's,</hi> to purge and cleanſe: They promote Sweat and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, ſtop Bleeding, ſtrengthen the Parts, ſtop all Fluxes of Women and Men, heal the Ulcers of the Bladder and Kidneys, prevent Abortions, Fluxes of the Belly, Laxity of the Stomach, Vomiting; they excite Appetite, cure all hot <hi>Intemperies,</hi> an ill Habit of the Body, and Dropſie, diſcuſs <hi>Flatus,</hi> and cure Cholicks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gallen</hi> mentions the Injuries of the <hi>Albulae,</hi> that one by Stoppage of the Skin fell into a Fever by the uſe of them: And tho' they be eminently pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying Waters in their own Springs, yet they produce no ſuch Effect in the Bodies of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aetius</hi> commends Cold Baths for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all Diſeaſes depending on Deflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions of Humours, eſpecially if they have any Medicamental Taſte, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Minerals (of <hi>Lead, Iron, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, Nitre;</hi> for theſe are all of them the Cool Baths, as <hi>Bitumen, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> make the Hot <hi>Baths.)</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98254:74"/>
He commends the <hi>Albulae</hi> to be drank, as very profitable againſt all Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caelius Aurelianus</hi> commends Cold ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all Fluxes of Blood in the <hi>Aſthma,</hi> and acquaints us with <hi>Aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades</hi>'s Opinion, that Water-drinking and the <hi>Pſeuchroluſia</hi> were neceſſary for the preſervation of our Health.</p>
               <p>Thus far I thought neceſſary to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe from the Antient Writers, to ſhew their Opinion and uſe of Cold bathing; and from hence I ſuppoſe our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſicians did formerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the uſe of the Cold Immerſion in <hi>England.</hi> Such I muſt call the bathing in St. <hi>Winifred,</hi> St. <hi>Mungus,</hi> and <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Baths, by which many particular Diſeaſes are cur'd, or the Health pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd: But the Niceneſs and Effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Age, has much neglected their Uſe; and the reaſon of this may be the abſurd Advice given to Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, to frequent the Baths at <hi>Bathe</hi> for all Diſeaſes; and the uſe of them will render all Perſons more Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: But I hope all prudent Men
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98254:74"/>
will in time conſider the diſingenuity of that Advice, and endeavour by the uſe of the Cold Bath, to render their Bodies ſtrong, and their Skins leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the changes of Weather. It is the Hot Countries which want Hot Baths, to evaporate the extreme Hot Particles of their Blood; but in our <hi>Northern</hi> Climes, we muſt cloſe our Pores, preſerve our native Heat, and, if we will live long, and healthful, we muſt render our Skins denſe and cloſe, by Cold Water, that the ſudden and frequent Changes of the Air may not give us ſo many intermitting Fevers, and ſo many Defluxions of Humours, which render the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthful; nor upon all Occaſions let the Air affect the Spirits of <hi>Hyſteric</hi> and <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> Perſons.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The extreme Cold, ſuch as that at St. <hi>Winifrid's-Well,</hi> and the other at St. <hi>Mungus-Well,</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> near <hi>Knaresborough.</hi> The Experience of our Countrymen has approv'd of theſe Baths,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98254:75"/>
as very uſeful in the Rickets, and many other Diſeaſes, which depend on Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration in too great a meaſure; and the High Fermentation, the quick Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation or Digeſtion of Humours, or the frequent Defluxions or Evacuations of them thro' the Glands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Degree of the Cold Baths is the Bath at <hi>Buxton,</hi> for that being one of a Milky Tepor at the firſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by being long felt, renders the Body more cold and ſhivering; and by this chilling of the Body I may eaſily infer, that tho' it has an actual Heat, and boyls up with Bubbles, as the Baths do at <hi>Bathe,</hi> yet it has not a Heat equal to the Rarefaction and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Warmth of our Humours; and for this reaſon I cannot but reckon it as one of the Cold Baths: And a moſt excellent Contrivance Providence has ſhewn in it, by giving it ſo much Heat as to hinder the ſudden or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conſtriction of our Pores, ſo as to occaſion Fevers or Defluxions, and to indue it with ſuch Ingredients of Salt and Nitre, or Alum, as to cool,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98254:75"/>
ſtrengthen, cleanſe the ſolid Parts, and cloſe up the natural Heat of our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, by conſtriction of the Pores.</p>
               <p>The Effects of theſe two kinds of Cold Baths may very probably be gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at, becauſe theſe Baths have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Qualities and Effects to the Hot Baths, and therefore it is very juſt to aſſert, that where the Hot Baths diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with our Patients, the Cold ones will be proper.</p>
               <p>According to this Rule I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Vertues both of the extreme Cold, and the Tepid Bath at <hi>Buxton;</hi> they all have the ſame Effects, but <hi>Buxton</hi> is more mild and ſafe, becauſe of its actual Tepor.</p>
               <p>Children, Women, and old Men faint in the Hot Baths; but the Cold ones agree with every Age and Time; but the Coldeſt Baths agree beſt with young Perſons in perfect Health, whom they make more robuſt; but they muſt be brought to the uſe of them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and the beſt time to uſe them is in the Summer, not in the Winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:98254:76"/>
The uſe of the Bath at <hi>Buxton</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſafe, it is fitteſt for all infirm Perſons to uſe firſt, before they try the colder kinds; for by the uſe of this, they may be ſafely and by degrees uſed to Cold bathing. And this is proper for <hi>Autumn-Bathing,</hi> to cloſe the Pores againſt <hi>Winter,</hi> and after the uſe of the Hot Baths.</p>
               <p>The Conſtitutions or <hi>Cacochymia's</hi> in which the Cold Baths are moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, are the <hi>Cacochymia's</hi> which are Hot, as the <hi>Choleric,</hi> which may be very much cooled, and altered by drinking of Cold Water, eſpecially the Water of St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Well at <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> for that will cleanſe away all the Choleric Sediments from the Stomach, Guts, Liver, and Blood; and by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing long, check the Pulſe and high digeſtion of the Blood; for that does not occaſion any Sweat after bathing, but we ſtay in the Bath till we are very chill, and then go to a warm Bed, and lie there without ſweating, till we become dry and warm again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:98254:76"/>
Hot Baths make the Pulſe vehement, great, quicker, and by this the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are more attenuated, the Aerial <hi>Bullulae</hi> in the Blood agitated, rarify'd, and by compreſſion propell'd thro' the Glands of the Skin, becauſe the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the external Air is much leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd by the Humidity and Heat of the Bath.</p>
               <p>But in all the Cold Baths the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary happens; the Pulſe becomes ſlow, ſmall, rare, languid; the <hi>Bullulae</hi> in the Blood are more compreſs'd, and the external ſolid Parts ſhrink, and are conſtring'd, and all Evacuations are ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
               <p>Becauſe of theſe Effects I infer, that the uſe of <hi>Buxton</hi> Baths externally and internally, are proper for all the Hot <hi>Intemperies</hi> of the ſolid Parts, and all the Hot <hi>Cacochymia's, viz.</hi> the <hi>Choleric,</hi> the <hi>Salt,</hi> the <hi>Viſcid,</hi> the <hi>Muriatic</hi> or <hi>Corroſive,</hi> the <hi>Vitriolic</hi> or <hi>Melancholic</hi> and <hi>Putrid</hi> State of Animal Humours.</p>
               <p>But as the temperate hot Baths cool by opening the Pores, and evaporating the Hot rarify'd Humours, or Aerial
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98254:77"/>
                  <hi>Bullulae,</hi> ſo the Tepid Baths, or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Cool Baths, a little ſtop the Pores, and for ſome time after the uſe of Cold Baths of that temper, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Perſons to be warmer ſenſibly to themſelves, as I have heard them to complain, from their Obſervation of their own Temper.</p>
               <p>But as the hotter Baths at <hi>Bathe</hi> do wonderfully inflame all Perſons, and thicken their <hi>Serum;</hi> ſo on the contrary the coldeſt Baths produce a full Stoppage of the Pores, and occaſion a Redneſs in the Skin; and after they are put to Bed, great Sweats, Fluxes of Urine, and Stools; ſo that the uſe of the coldeſt Baths put all Perſons into an <hi>Ephemera,</hi> and that occaſions the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions by Stool, Urine, and Sweat obſerv'd after cold bathing.</p>
               <p>We ought nicely to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the permanent Effects of the Hot and Cold Baths, upon the fluid Parts of Animals, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood and Spirits, and the Alteration which the uſe of them gives, by a ſudden Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, or ſtoppage of Tranſpiration;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98254:77"/>
for the permanent Effects of the Hot Bath is the Volatilization of the Oily and Acid parts of the Blood, and the raiſing the Digeſtion of our Humours, as well as more invigorating the Pulſe and Circulation, and rarefying the Aerial <hi>Bullulae</hi> or Spirits in an Animal, tho' for the preſent they evacuate ſome hot Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and by accident cool us, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by uſing Hot Baths in Feveriſh Diſpoſitions, Defluxions of Humours; and we obſerve all Hot Conſtitutions to complain of their Heat; ſo that Cold Baths, they heat by Accident, by ſtopping the Hot Humours from tranſpiring; but cool and ſtop the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of the Aerial Particles; and they agree with Fevers, Hecticks, and all Hot Conſtitutions depending on the over-digeſtion of Humours.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of the Heat following Cold Baths, may be given from the hot rarify'd Particles being ſtraitned from evaporating, which act like a Ferment in the Blood; or elſe may be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Changes in Water upon its freezing; for the <hi>Vertuoſi</hi> inform us,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98254:78"/>
that by applying of Salt and Ice for freezing of it, it firſt ſubſides, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards riſes again in the Bottle in which it is froze; and this Effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably depends on the Air included in the Water.</p>
               <p>That Cold bathing cools the Humours appears by the following Inſtances, in which <hi>Galen</hi> experienc'd it.</p>
               <p>In a very hot burning Fever <hi>Galen</hi> adviſes as ſoon as the Signs of Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction appear, if the Strength be ſtrong, and a young Perſon, boldly to give him cold Water to drink; and if he be corpulent, and the Seaſon hot and dry, to put him into cold Water, which he ſays may be done without Injury; and thereby he will univerſally Sweat, and ſome Perſons will have <hi>bilious</hi> Stools: But if the Fever be mild, and the Strength weak, and there appear ſigns of Concoction, he adviſes the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate hot Baths, and Wine: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that of Fevers, as Fevers, Cold Water is the Remedy, unleſs there be a <hi>Putredo,</hi> an Obſtruction of the Pores, a Fulneſs or Debility of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98254:78"/>
Strength, or Stomach, or ſome Tumour in any Part.</p>
               <p>He preſcribes all bathing for Fevers in the Declination, not in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>He gives the Cold Water to drink, as much as the Patient pleaſes, in all continent Fevers, by which all Sweat, Vomiting, or Looſeneſs was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and this was the general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in Continent Fevers, by bleeding, drinking Water, and Cold bathing. But in Laſſitudes, heat upon Travels, Pimples, and Tranſpiration ſtopt, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in temperate warm Water was us'd.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Hectics Galen</hi> affirms that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Bath does no good, but the Cold, to which the hot Water only prepares them; and this he confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſcribes, if there be no putrid Fever, or Inflammation of the Lungs; but he condemns the drinking Cold Water in Fevers, as injurious to <hi>Hectics.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:98254:79"/>
The manner of bathing <hi>Hectics</hi> was thus; Let him be carry'd in a Sheet by Four Men, and dipt twice or thrice in the hot Water, and after let him be dipt in the cold once; then put him into other Linen, and dry him, and remove him to Bed; let him ſtay but little in the cold Water, and be dipt but once, and anointed with Oil.</p>
               <p>All the Ancient Writers commend ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Cold Water for the <hi>Hydrophobia;</hi> and hence comes our Cuſtom of Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Perſons bit by Mad-Dogs in the Sea-Water.</p>
               <p>Not only the frequent throwing of Perſons into the Water may cure the odd Fancy againſt Liquids, but the Coldneſs may prevent the Fever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that Venom; and as Salt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly is uſed to the Bites, ſo that Water may check the putrefaction of our Humours by that Poyſon. In this Diſeaſe the Water at <hi>Buxton</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably be drank and bathed in for one Month's time, till the Change of the Moon is over; for this Water is ſalt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98254:79"/>
and ſtyptic; by both which Qualities it may be uſeful.</p>
               <p>That the Water at <hi>Buxton</hi> is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the Salt <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> is evident by the cure of the Itch; and <hi>Wiſeman</hi> commends the ſwimming in Rivers for ſcabby Soldiers; the ſaltneſs cleanſes the Skin from its putrid Ferment; and the ſtypticity heals its Ulcerations.</p>
               <p>It is alſo obſerv'd, that the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Water is uſeful for the Scurvy by its cleanſing ſalt Quality; and it heals the putrid Gums.</p>
               <p>Theſe Salt-Waters at <hi>Buxton</hi> are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Morphew, Scald-head, Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all other Diſeaſes depending on external putrid Ferment; they may eaſe the Pains in the Venereal Diſeaſes, for all hot Baths irritate them.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Buxton</hi> Baths are uſeful alſo for the Leproſie, after general Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The drinking the Water, becauſe of its evident Saltneſs, is good againſt the Worms.</p>
               <p>The experiencing this Bath, and the two colder at St. <hi>Winifred,</hi> and St. <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:98254:80"/>
is not irrational; for the Cancerous Humour, whoſe Putrefaction they may probably more effectually check than any other Method yet known; for if theſe Cold Baths can check Putrefaction, they muſt be uſed as well as a cool Diet, againſt this State. In a Putrefaction the viſcidity of the Blood is deſtroy'd, and the Conſiſtence of the Blood is made fluid, becauſe the natural viſcidity of the Cake being diſſolv'd, the Liquor thereof cannot be made into <hi>Bullulae,</hi> to contain the Aerial Spirits, and that gives the great languor in all putrid ſtates of Blood, as the Scurvy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fever; we commonly obſerve, that a viſcid Liquor, ſuch as Soap and Water, or new Beer, may be eaſily raiſed into Bladders or Bubbles, by mixing Air in it; but in ſtale Liquors the Conſiſtence wants a Viſcidity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Air in Bubbles: And all Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes, Cancers, and very putrid Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, have a thin <hi>Sanies;</hi> we obſerve a Rheumatiſm Blood in the Cancerous; but that is only the Chyle coagulated by the Vitriolic Blood; not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98254:80"/>
that the Cake of the Blood often appears then putrid. And ſince the Hot Baths increaſe all Putrefactions, the Cold ones may probably do the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> was cur'd of a Fever by an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſt, who order'd him a Bath of Sea-Water, as <hi>Diogenes Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> affirms.</p>
               <p>Cold Water is us'd in <hi>Kent</hi> for the cure of the Quartane, as ſome of that Country have informed me, ſtanding in it before the Fit.</p>
               <p>A Bath of Tepid Water is uſeful for the cure of <hi>Ephemera's;</hi> and the Bath at <hi>Buxton</hi> is uſed by them that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent it, the ſame Night they come thither, to cure their laſſitude, heat, and thirſt: I may therefore commend this Water in <hi>Ephemera's,</hi> to cool in their Declination, and to be drank in the beginning.</p>
               <p>This Water at <hi>Buxton</hi> is uſeful in too great an <hi>Obeſity,</hi> or Tumour of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcera;</hi> by its ſaltneſs it cleanſes by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; and its ſtypticity externally ſhrinks the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:98254:81"/>
The drinking thoſe <hi>Buxton</hi> Waters may be uſeful in many Obſtructions of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> as Jaundice, Obſtructions of the Meſentery, Spleen, Kidneys, by reaſon of their Saltneſs; but their Stypticity makes them fitter for all Fluxes of Humours, in which old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors moſt commend them: And ſince the Hot Baths do that Effect of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſtructon ſufficiently, we may leave Obſtructions to their cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aetius de ſeminis profluvio</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends bathing or ſwimming for that Infirmity, and affirms that the Cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cures all Diſeaſes depending on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion of Humours, eſpecially if they have any Phyſical Quality, as the <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which being drank, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to all Defluxions; and thoſe he deſcribes as <hi>Sapore ſubſalſae, &amp; tactu lactei teporis;</hi> and there was a Mixture of <hi>Allum</hi> in them, as the old Writers gueſſed, by their ſtypticity, by which they aſtringe all the ſolid Parts both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and inwardly; and that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them leſs ſubject to Defluxions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:98254:81"/>
The Effects, Heat, and Taſte of the Waters at <hi>Buxton</hi> being ſo like the <hi>Albulae,</hi> I cannot but compare them with one another; and by Analogy to them, explain the Virtues of <hi>Buxton</hi> Waters.</p>
               <p>When they are drank, they muſt by their Humidity dilute the viſcid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, by their ſaltneſs they cleanſe away the precipitated Salts, or Sediment of our Blood, by Urine; and by their ſtypticity they ſtop the rarefaction of the <hi>Bullulae</hi> in the Blood, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent agitation of the Aerial Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in them. I compare Blood to other fermenting Liquors, which have large Aerial <hi>Bullulae</hi> contain'd in them after a demi-fermentation, which gives the briskneſs and pungency to ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</p>
               <p>By the Taſte we obſerve theſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the <hi>Buxton</hi> Waters on both the fluid Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood and Spirits; and the ſolid Parts, or hollow Pipes, which contain the other; and we do from thence rationally infer, that they are uſeful in the following Defluxions;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98254:82"/>
and Experience has confirmed the ſame, in theſe following Species of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Flux of Blood by the Noſe, Anus, Uterus, Vomiting, Spitting, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and in the <hi>Hepatic</hi> Fluxes and <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> and all <hi>Haemorrhages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the preternatural Evacuations of the Nutritious Humours by Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Looſneſs, Diabetes, <hi>Plyaliſmus, Gonorrhaea, Fluor albus,</hi> Abortion, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eyes; in all theſe <hi>Buxton</hi> Waters are convenient; and in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence of Urine, and in all <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs</hi> and <hi>Aſthma's,</hi> theſe Bath-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Buxton</hi> may ſafely be drank and bathed in; and they moſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſtop too much Sweating by their ſtypticity and coolneſs: They both thicken the Humours in the Glands, and conſtringe the Excretory Veſſels in the Skin; and inwardly they, like other cool Diet, thicken or check the rarefy'd Humours and Air; for if Fluids be a Congeries of Bubbles, with Air inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Matter we expire and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, (which the old Authors call an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98254:82"/>
ſort of Reſpiration) is ſome of thoſe <hi>Globuli</hi> or <hi>Bullulae,</hi> which are the Integrant Parts of Fluids; and the Air being rarefy'd by Motion and Heat, make the <hi>Bullulae</hi> too light for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the other Parts, and more fit to be forc'd out of the Animal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, both by the Pulſe, and Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other <hi>Globuli,</hi> to which the Rarefaction of the external Warmth contributes, by weakening the Preſſure on the Fluids in Animals.</p>
               <p>That Aluminous Baths condenſe the Skin, is evident by the tanning of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Skin is frequently condens'd by the Blaſt of cooler Air, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions its Conſtriction by a ſort of a Convulſion we call a <hi>Horror;</hi> by both theſe ways externally we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe the Skin, and conſtringe the Pores by bathing in <hi>Buxton</hi> Waters.</p>
               <p>The denſity of Skin is known by its pale Colour, hardneſs, and its Pores appearing as the Skin does in Winter, like a Gooſe-Skin: They are difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heated by Exerciſe, and ſweat little, and have no great Colour after it in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98254:83"/>
the Skin. If this Conſtriction be too much, we muſt cure it by Hot Baths, anointing with Dill-Oil, or that with Horſe-Radiſh, with a ſoft Friction.</p>
               <p>In Dropſies the uſe of Salt Water outwardly, and inwardly, ſuch as that at <hi>Buxton,</hi> may do very well; and by the Saltneſs, to cleanſe by Urine; and by the ſtypticity to ſtrengthen, or heal the Lymphaticks, in the <hi>Aſcites</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſarca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the cure of the Motion of the Animal Spirits, the Cold Baths have theſe Advantages.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Palſies they ſtop the Pores, and accidentally occaſion an Ebullition in the Humours; that is, firſt by a ſubſidence of the Aerial <hi>Bullulae,</hi> and after that by a kind of Spring natural to the Air, a Reſtitution or Expanſion again to their Natural Vigour, Motion, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, by which a Diſtenſion is made in the Nerves, and an <hi>Ephemera</hi> in the Blood; and by theſe means a De-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is made in the Nerves in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytic Perſons; and this has been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently experienc'd in the Palſie and Rickets.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:98254:83"/>
As to the Palſie, I heard a Relation of a Cure done by my Ingenious Friend Dr. <hi>Barnard,</hi> upon Dr. <hi>Gold</hi>'s Son-in-Law, who told me a Story, the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of which I cannot well recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, more than that a young Boy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paralytic, with the loſs of Speech, by a few times being put to the Cold Bath, recover'd his Motion and Speech, when he had try'd all other Hot Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and the Hot Baths, without any Succeſs. This was related to me by Dr. <hi>Gold</hi> himſelf at <hi>Bathe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Rickets, I have annexed the Letter of Dr. <hi>Clayton,</hi> concerning the Virtues of St. <hi>Mungus-Well,</hi> near <hi>Knaresborough</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire;</hi> and it ſeems to me that an <hi>Ephemera</hi> occaſion'd by Hot bathing, does the ſame thing as a preter-natural Heat, or an <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi> from an Annual or long uſe of Hot Medicines, which are Nervine. The cure of the Rickets and Palſie both by cold bathing, ſhews the Rickets to be a Species of the Palſie in Children, whilſt they are increaſing, which makes the Bodies unequally nouriſh'd, the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98254:84"/>
Pulſe of the Arteries being very deficient in the Paralytic Parts, and the Humours unequally circulated, the Head is too big for the Proportion in <hi>Embryo's,</hi> becauſe the Bones are made before the Muſcles; and the Muſcular Fleſh does not ſo well increaſe in any Bodies, as in thoſe that have due Spirits, to give a Stop to the Circulation of the Blood in the Muſcles, which probably is the Cauſe of their Motion; and the Muſcular Parts by Motion, Friction, Cold ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, grow robuſt, plump, and of a due proportion to the reſt of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and for the increaſe of the Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Fleſh and Strength, Cold Bathing is uſed at St. <hi>Mungus-Well.</hi>

               <p>In the want of Appetite, the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Well at <hi>Buxton</hi> may be uſeful both by the Saltneſs to ſtimulate and cleanſe, and the ſtypticity to ſtrengthen the Stomach.</p>
               <p>The effect of the coldeſt Baths may be try'd in the <hi>Gutta Serena, Syncope's,</hi> Deafneſs, in the loſs of Smell and Taſte, in Weakneſs of Erection, or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere languidâ,</hi> in the Weakneſs of Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;

for if the Cold Baths can cure an univerſal Palſie, why may they not cure the Palſies of particular Parts, which I have mention'd?</p>
               <p>In the want of Sleep, the <hi>Bullulae</hi> of the Serous Humours which fill the Nerves, are too much expanded, and this cauſes the <hi>Vigiliae:</hi> This elaſticity of Spirits is abated by the humidity, coolneſs, and ſtypticity of <hi>Buxton-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> both drank, and us'd for Baths; and for this reaſon we bathe in them going to Bed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Pains depending on Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Viſcidity of Humours may be corrected or prevented by theſe Baths, as hot Head-Aches, Gouts, Scorbutic Rheumatiſms, Pain at the Stomach, Cholic, Tooth Ach, Strangury, Stone, Quinſie, Inflammations of the Mouth, <hi>

Inflammations are only Species's, which are diſtinguiſh'd by the Effects the Inflammation cauſes in each Part, the drinking and bathing in theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at <hi>Buxton,</hi> being the chief Remedy to prevent them, but not to cure them, unleſs in particular Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>As to the Ulcers inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, the Bath at <hi>Buxton</hi> being drank cleanſes and heals, a <hi>Vomica, Phthiſis, Empyema, Dyſentery, Teneſmus,</hi> Ulcers of the Eyes, Kidneys, Bladder, <hi>Anus, Viſcera,</hi> Spleen, Liver, Glands, in the King's-Evil, the Ulcers of the Mouth, Throat, Noſe, Ears, Gums, Stomach, <hi>proſtatae</hi> in a <hi>Gonorrhaea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Third Species of Fluxes is that through the Nerves, and the Glands they ariſe from, as the <hi>Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Hyſteric Paſſion, Chorea St. Viti,</hi> Convulſion of Children, Palpitation of the Heart, <hi>Singultus,</hi> Coughing, Sneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Priapiſmus;</hi> in all theſe Caſes the Coldneſs and Stypticity of the Water both drank and bathed in, as that at <hi>Buxton,</hi> may do good by cooling the Humours, and ſtrengthening the Glands;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98254:85"/>
and in theſe Caſes the Hot Baths do Injury, and for that reaſon the Cold Baths muſt be moſt agreeable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Motion of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the Brain, is beſt reliev'd by the coldeſt Baths, which conſiderably overcome the Animal Spirits, when too much rarify'd, by thinking, or Paſſion, or Fevers in the <hi>Maniac</hi> or <hi>Phrenctic</hi> Perſons.</p>
               <p>In Melancholicks the Vitriolick Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter near <hi>Buxton</hi> may be moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to drink, and the Bath to uſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly for cooling the Humours, and ſtrengthening the Spirits, by conſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Pores.</p>
               <p>In this Bath we ought to bath for the <hi>Furor uterinus,</hi> and all kinds of <hi>Deliriums,</hi> to abate the exceeding Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Motion of the Aerial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits included in the <hi>Bullulae,</hi> in the Nerves, and Blood.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Animal Spirits produce the Flatuoſity in the Nerves, when too much rarefy'd; and this Rarefaction is check'd, by drinking and bathing at <hi>Buxton,</hi> in the <hi>Vertigo, Tympanites,</hi> for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98254:86"/>
which we ought to bathe in Sea-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the Ancients preſcribe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This Cold bathing is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the <hi>Aſthma;</hi> and in that Diſeaſe I and divers others have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it uſeful. And I met with a Lady at <hi>Buxton,</hi> who had uſed that Bath for ſome Years, for an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> and found benefit by it; and I find <hi>Caelius Aurelianus</hi> has much commended the <hi>Pſeucroluſia</hi> for the <hi>Aſthma.</hi> And this is agreeable to my Notion, that it depends on an <hi>Ephemera,</hi> as a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom in the Nerves. But I cannot commend this Bath in cold Flatulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as that of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Parts: But for all Flatulencies depending on the Hot <hi>Cacochymia's,</hi> as the Choleric, Salt, Vitriolic, putrid, it ſeems very profitable, by cooling the Rarefaction of the Aerial <hi>Bullulae,</hi> both outwardly and inwardly uſed. Thoſe that be of a hot, bilious, and dry Conſtitution, have their <hi>Halitus,</hi> which paſs by Tranſpiration leſs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, but more acrid, and fumoſe, as as <hi>Orabaſius</hi> calls them, and that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98254:86"/>
them more ſubject to <hi>Ephemera's</hi> and Defluxions; and for thoſe Hot and Dry Conſtitutions Water-drinking is abſolutely neceſſary; for all ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Liquors agitate and rarefie the <hi>Bullulae</hi> in the Humour, and cauſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions thro' the Glands.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Drinking Water in the Morning cools the Blood, prevents Defluxions, and waſhes off the bilious and ſalt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements by Urine.</p>
               <p>Drinking Water after Dinner cools the Digeſtion, and ſtops the high Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Windineſs in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>Drinking it at Night ſtops the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver produced by the mixture of the Chyle and Blood, as it happens in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical People.</p>
               <p>The Waters at St. <hi>Winifred's-Well,</hi> and St. <hi>Mungus,</hi> I never heard were proper to be drank, becauſe of their exceſſive Coldneſs: But the Bath-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>Buxton</hi> may be drank to two, three, or four Pints, without occaſioning any Vomiting; but it will cauſe vomiting if it be drank ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98254:87"/>
becauſe of its Warmth and Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The Injuries by cold Baths are the following; but I muſt except the Bath-Water at <hi>Buxton,</hi> becauſe of its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tepor, from them.</p>
               <p>Very Cold Water may do as much Injury as Hot Baths, tho' it ſtrengthens and collects the natural Heat in ſtrong healthful Bodies. It may extinguiſh the innate Heat, (that is, the natural Tepor ariſing from the Motion, and Mixture of our Humours) in Perſons that are weak, infirm, or very old.</p>
               <p>Cold bathing is injurious to Infants and Boys; for <hi>Galen</hi> obſerves, that it hinders their increaſe, and is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by him till 25 Years of Age; or the middle of the fourth ſeven Years. From this Obſervation I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſicians learnt the advantage of Cold bathing the Rickety Children, to hinder the growth of the diſtorted Part, and ſtrengthen the Muſcles.</p>
               <p>It agrees not with thin, lean, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Perſons; and thoſe of a Cold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98254:87"/>
or that have ſome of the Cold <hi>Cacochymia's,</hi> as the Pituitous, the Serous, Cold, Windy, or Acerb Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and thoſe who have not uſed it, muſt be brought to it by degrees, and not in the Winter-time.</p>
               <p>Since Cold Baths aſtringe and ſtop Fluxes, as Cold Diet, Cold Air, and cool Liquors do, they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient in any Obſtructions of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Animal Humours, and therefore improper for all Tumours of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> as Jaundice, Tumour of the Spleen, Kernels, and inward Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations: And <hi>Caelius Aurelianus</hi> diſlikes it in Lethargies, becauſe it ſtops the Paſſages. And he alſo condemns it in a <hi>Pthyſis;</hi> and by Analogy it is eaſie to gueſs that Cold-Water-Baths ſtop more the ſuppreſſion of Water, but may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion at firſt a great Flux, by ſtopping Tranſpiration, and exerting an Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Blood.</p>
               <p>It may help in the binding of the Body by the ſame Accident, turning the Circulation inwardly; for as Hot Baths are uſed for Revulſion, as turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98254:88"/>
the Circulation more into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body; ſo the Cold act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily to them; in other Evacuations ſuppreſſed, as the <hi>Menſes, Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids, Mola, Lothing,</hi> they are injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and in an <hi>Aſcites</hi> they ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, except the Water be ſalt.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of Fevers, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions of Humours, or violent Pains, they are dangerous; but in the Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or to prevent them, very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; as in Pains of the Head, and a <hi>Phrenitis, Stone, Strangury, Gout, Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a <hi>Tertian</hi> Cold Water is eſteem'd dangerous; and it's known to be very offenſive in all Ulcers.</p>
               <p>It may produce cold Pains; but cures the hot ones, or thoſe depending on the hot <hi>Cacochymia's,</hi> after due evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it ſeems improper in the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic-Pains, and in all in ward Ulcers, cold bathing is improper, tho' the drinking the Water is uſeful.</p>
               <p>Cold bathing is much condemn'd in the <hi>Epilepſie,</hi> or <hi>Convulſions,</hi> by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning a Flux of the <hi>Serum</hi> into the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98254:88"/>
Nerves; but in many hot Inflations, it is evidently uſeful, tho' they be Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Effects, as in a <hi>Priapiſm, Aſthma, Tympany, Mania, Melancholy, Vertigo, Incubus,</hi> and <hi>Hyſterical</hi> Fits.</p>
               <p>The Preparation for the Bath is to be by due evacuation of the Humours abounding in quantity, or purging, or altering their ill quality, to avoid the great Ebullition or Heat occaſion'd by Cold Baths at firſt.</p>
               <p>We may vomit with St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s-Well at <hi>Buxton,</hi> by drinking the Water ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, to two or three Quarts; and this is uſeful in the <hi>Gout, Sciatica, Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Meſentery, Spleen, Liver, Dropſie, Inflations, Aſthma, Melancholy, Epilepſie, Hydrophobia;</hi> in all theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Vomiting is by experience found profitable; and this may ſafely be done by that Water at <hi>Buxton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Purging may be recommended in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full Bodies, by diſſolving ℥ ſs or ℥ j. of the <hi>Epſom</hi> Salt, or <hi>Sal Mirabilis,</hi> in the Water of St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s-Well, which is of it ſelf a little laxative.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:98254:89"/>
                  <hi>Aetius</hi> orders that we ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an exact Diet in cold bathing; and it is ſafeſt when empty, for then it cannot occaſion ſo great a Flux upon any infirm Part. He adviſes it not to be uſed after Venery, great Laſſitude, nor on a full Stomach; not after Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, Purging, or any Weakneſs of Spirit, or natural Heat; and that the Perſon be twenty five Years Old, and be uſed to it by degrees; and at firſt not to abſolutely Cold Water, but that which is Tepid: And by parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I may recommend <hi>Buxton</hi> Bath as the beſt Preparative to Cold bathing.</p>
               <p>He adviſes the Friction with Linnen, the Rubbing with Oil, and after that Exerciſe: Then to leap into the Cold Bath; and when he came forth, they rubbed the Body again with Oil, till the Skin was warm, and then gave them Meat.</p>
               <p>The Ancients anointed with Oil after Rubbing, to mollifie the Skin, and take away its Tenſion and Dryneſs, they ſtopt Sweats by it; and for that end uſed Styptic Oils, as <hi>Oleum Omphaceum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:98254:89"/>
By Oils they defended the Skin from the Injury of the ambient Air; and for the ſame end it is probable the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> paint the Skin.</p>
               <p>I believe ſome Practice of this kind may be uſeful in dry and tender Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are extenuated by a long Diſeaſe, were only waſh'd in the hot Bath, and went immediately into the Cold Water, and after were anointed; and thoſe that were tired with a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they anointed before and after bathing.</p>
               <p>If Sweating be deſign'd, no Oil was uſed either before or after bathing.</p>
               <p>We may imitate the Ancient bathing by putting our Patients firſt into a warm Bath, in a Tub of hot Water, in a warm Chamber, thence into a hot Bed, to Sweat and Sleep; and when he has returned to his natural Temper, we may put them into a Cold Bath, or a Tepid one; and after rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him with Oil or Butter, or uſe him to ſwimming in cold Water, or at the going out of the hot Bath, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98254:90"/>
are to be ſprinkled with Tepid Water, if the Cold be offenſive.</p>
               <p>My Ingenious Friend Dr. <hi>Baynard</hi> will in ſome time give us his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience about Cold bathing, and how he prepares his Cold Baths artificially from Pump-Water, Nitre, or Pond-Water, with <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> and <hi>Nitre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He uſes this Cold bathing to cure <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Fevers, Itch, Convulſions, Weakneſs or Tremor of the Limbs, Rickets, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Rheumatiſms;</hi> but diſſuades this Cold bathing in <hi>Epilepſies</hi> and <hi>Haemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plagia's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The particular uſe of this bathing he gave me in Writing three Years ſince, which occaſion'd my Curioſity of reading <hi>Galen,</hi> and the old Writers on that Subject; and I cannot but believe that we had the practice of Cold ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd here, as well as the method of uſing the Hot Baths.</p>
               <p>All that has been writ on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> long ſince; only the Religious Men in our Kingdom have preſerv'd the Practice
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98254:90"/>
of bathing at <hi>Holywell,</hi> and St. <hi>Mungus,</hi> and gave the credit of curing to the Saint's Merits, which may probably be accounted for by the natural Effects of Cold-Water.</p>
               <p>I was once inform'd of an old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, who ſtaying too long in St. <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifred's</hi> Water, died there, the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Cold extinguiſhing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat: Therefore theſe Cold Baths are only fit for Summer, and young Perſons.</p>
               <p>The old Writers believ'd that Cold Water gave Foecundity to Women; and this is much aſcrib'd to <hi>Holywell,</hi> and for that cauſe may be frequented in hot Conſtitutions, and Hyſterical Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and it will ſtop all Evacuations that are injurious to the Womb.</p>
               <p>This Water I have no particular knowledge of as yet, for its Cures, but I find it moſt uſed for Devotion, and Pleaſure, by young Perſons, who have told me, that it had no effect on them, more than to make them very light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and that they never ſweat after it, nor catched cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:98254:91"/>
The time of ſtaying in theſe, is according to our eaſie bearing the coldneſs of the Water; and it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper to dip over Head divers times, in the uſe of theſe Baths.</p>
               <p>We have yet a greater Prejudice to Cold Baths than to the Hot, becauſe they occaſion Cramps, Febrile Rigors.</p>
               <p>Cold is found to be an Enemy to the Teeth, Nerves, Spinal Marrow, and Brain; and the old Aphoriſm runs thus, <hi>Nix &amp; glacies pectori inimica, tuſſes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnct, &amp; ſanguinem, &amp; diſtillationes:</hi> We commonly are ſenſible of the Injuries of Cold Air, when we are hot; and the ſudden change of the Air affects us with Diſtillation; the ſame we fear from Cold Water, and therefore we believe it dangerous, and not ſo ſafe as the Hot Baths. But to this I may anſwer, that we uſe the Cold Baths only in Summer; that for preſervation of Health the robuſt Perſons only uſe them: And the Servants near <hi>Holywell</hi> and <hi>Buxton,</hi> make it a part of their Agreement with their Maſters, that they may have leave to go to thoſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98254:91"/>
Waters every Year for their Health. But in the hotter Conſtitutions which occaſion Diſeaſes, as the <hi>Choleric, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic, Vitriolic, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Putrid;</hi> theſe want the extream Coldneſs, to reduce the exceſs of Heat, Fermentation, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, or Motion of the <hi>Globuli,</hi> call it as you pleaſe, to their natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and Experience has ſufficiently ſatisfy'd us, that <hi>Holywell,</hi> St. <hi>Mungus,</hi> and <hi>Buxton-Waters,</hi> are not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, but alſo very uſeful, for the Cure of many Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aetius</hi> commends the ſwimming in Sea-Water Cold twice before, Dinner and Supper, for the Itch and Leproſie.</p>
               <p>We may make our ſelves artificial Cold Baths of Pump-Water in the Summer; and the Perſon that uſes them muſt be prepared by bleeding and purging, as the Diſeaſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution requires. In the Morning it muſt be uſed, being empty, and dip over Head in the Water, in which he muſt continue up to the Neck, from two or three Minutes to half an Hour, as the Patient can bear it; and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98254:92"/>
then be dryed, and put to a warm Bed, with a Flannel Shirt on, and there ſleep. This Immerſion may be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thrice or oftener; and the firſt time ſit in the Tub but two or three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and longer afterwards; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Medicines may be given, as well as a ſuitable Diet to the Diſeaſe; that is, the cooleſt Diet is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Cold bathing, which is uſed for the Hot Diſeaſes, as <hi>Hectick Fevers</hi> with <hi>Phrenitis,</hi> and all <hi>Rheumatic Bloods.</hi> And for more particular Directions, it is neceſſary to conſult a Phyſician, who has found out by Experience the beſt Method of Cold bathing. I never yet heard of any who has made any ſucceſsful Tryals of it, but Dr. <hi>Baynard</hi> in <hi>Surrey-Street</hi> in the <hi>Strand;</hi> to whoſe Management I would recommend thoſe who want the benefit of a Cold Bath.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the Operations that it has on the Body, is to make the Pores of the Body contract and cloſe, ſo as to keep in that natural Heat which ſhould ſtrengthen and invigorate the Body, and ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſtrengthens the Nerves: For you muſt know, as there are many Thouſand Pores we conſtantly tranſpire thereat, ſo that they are as ſo many Chimneys to the</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:98254:93"/>
               <hi>Body, thro' which the Heat of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſtantly paſſes, and which is called, (becauſe theſe Fumes that ſo paſs are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,)</hi> Inſenſible Tranſpiration. <hi>And tho' this Tranſpiration be inſenſible, yet in a Day's time it is ſo conſiderable, that at all the Pores of the Body we tranſpire very nigh twice as much as we void either by Stool or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, or even both; for a Man that eats and drinks in twenty four Hours forty Ounces of Meat and Drink, voids not by Stool and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine paſt fifteen Ounces; the other twenty five Ounces paſs by this inſenſible Tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Therefore this being ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when theſe are too open, it muſt needs enfeeble and waſte the Body as well as a conſtant purging, and a too great evacuation any other way. Therefore the bathing in theſe Cold Waters makes the Pores contract themſelves; particularly it alſo cleanſes them of that foul Sweat that clogs them, and renders them unapt for the Performance of the Duty they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for, which is to contract or dilate themſelves proportionably to the external</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:98254:93"/>
               <hi>Heat or Cold; and if they be defective either way, too remiſs, or too rigid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably various Diſtempers happen: As when too remiſs in Children, the Rickets, generally in the Extremities a Waſting; ſo their Legs and Arms grow lean and emaciate; but that part of the Body that is next the Heart, which is the Fountain of Heat, is ſupply'd with Heat ſufficient, and therefore that part of the Body continues pretty plump; but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Head, that is fortify'd with a Scull, and not liable to this preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tranſpiration, grows extraordinary big in ſuch Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fools and heavy-ſpirited People are little liable to this Diſtemper; but the witty Children, whoſe Spirits are the moſt refin'd and ſubtle, are the apteſt thus to a preternatural Tranſpiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This bathing likewiſe upon the ſame account is good for ſome</hi> Hectical <hi>thin People, whoſe Diſtemper is owing to the ſame Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:98254:94"/>
               <hi>But there is a</hi> Hectical <hi>Diſtemper that is owing to the contrary Cauſe, the too rigidneſs of the Nerves, that keeps in the Heat too much. And this is the Cauſe of many Fevers; and therefore as bathing in theſe Cold Waters is good for the Rickets, ſo is Sweating extraordinary good in ſuch Fevers; for as the one contracts the Pores, the other dilates them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the Diſtempers it is good for is particularly the Rickets above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; as likewiſe</hi> Hectical <hi>Perſons, of a flaccid ſoft Fleſh; and for ſome windy Pains in Perſons likewiſe of a flaccid Fleſh, and the like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The manner of bathing is only as we do commonly in a River. Children they ſwill and dip them, and ſo frighten and ſtir up the Spirits, by a particular Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the more. Often pop them over the Head, and carry them to a Bed, or the like, to ſweat gently after it, that ſo the Pores may be brought to the due Tone of</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:98254:94"/>
               <hi>opening and contracting, as they ought to do; and therefore they do the ſame three or four Days, that the Dilation and Contraction may be the more perfect.</hi>

               <hi>THis Bath is in the high</hi> Peake <hi>in</hi> Derby-ſhire, 10 <hi>Miles from</hi> Chatſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, 16 <hi>Miles from</hi> Mancheſter, 16 <hi>from</hi> Cheſterfield, 20 <hi>from</hi> Derby, 30 <hi>from</hi> Weſtcheſter, 30 <hi>from</hi> Lichfield, <hi>and</hi> 20 <hi>from</hi> Stafford.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved that no Baths have a healthful Air about them, becauſe theſe Baths, <hi>viz. Buxton</hi> and <hi>Bathe,</hi> are ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very low, in a Valley, betwixt two Hills; and the Country near <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſtanding ſo very high, frequent Rains are obſerved to fall there: But in the Summer it is frequented by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons of Quality, for Hawking; the Moors thereabouts being very large like a Wilderneſs; the <hi>Poots</hi> are ſo
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98254:95"/>
plentiful there in their Seaſons, that a Perſon of Quality killed twelve Brace in a Day for one Week he ſtaid there laſt Summer.</p>
            <p>This Country being in the Winter unpaſſable, becauſe of its Snow, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented only for the Bath's ſake in the Summer time, and out of Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by others, to admire the Wonders of that Place; amongſt which that Bath is much eſteem'd as one, by all its <hi>Northern</hi> Neighbours, who viſit it once in a Year.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Wells have the Name of the Town, and that of ſome</hi> Saxon <hi>or</hi> Dane. <hi>It bath for many Years paſt been frequented for the Health of Thouſands, for bathing, as well as it is now in theſe our Days: For between</hi> Burgh <hi>and it, there is a High-way forced over the Moors, all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, of ſuch Antiquity as none can expreſs, called</hi> Bath-gate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>More came out of a Superſtition they had in the Well, than for any aſſurance they had in the Property, Quality, or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the Bath; for of it, and the uſe thereof, they were ignorant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:98254:96"/>
And to this Day the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple frequent it for Pleaſure, now they have diſuſed any Devotion to St. <hi>Ann,</hi> by whoſe Name one of the Wells is called.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cambden</hi> obſerves, that at the Riſe of the River <hi>Wye,</hi> there were Nine Springs of Hot Water, called at preſent <hi>Buxton-Well,</hi> which he ſays were found by Experience good for the Stomach, the Nerves, and the whole Body; and the moſt Honourable <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> had lately adorn'd them with Buildings; and they began to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by great Numbers of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry: About which time the Heroic and Unfortunate Princeſs, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> took her farewel of <hi>Buxton,</hi> in theſe Verſes,
<q>
                  <l>Buxtona quae calidae celebrabere nomine lymphae,</l>
                  <l>Forte mihi poſthac non adeunda, val<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</l>
               </q>
And from this Queen, the Pillar in <hi>Pool's-Hole,</hi> which is near <hi>Buxton,</hi> may have its Name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:98254:96"/>
That theſe <hi>Baths</hi> were anciently known to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſey, call'd <hi>Bath-gate,</hi> which continues Seven Miles to the Village <hi>Burgh,</hi> evidently ſhews; and from them we learned the uſe of bathing.</p>
            <p>But the Prieſts of the following Age did not underſtand how the great Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of that <hi>Bath</hi> could be produced by ſo Tepid a Water; that according to the Humour of the Age, it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Merit of St. <hi>Ann,</hi> to whom the Sick made a religious Viſit.</p>
            <p>The Bath at <hi>Buxton</hi> has a fiery Heat evident to the Senſe; but it is in a moderate Degree, or Tepor rather than Heat.</p>
            <p>It contains no ſign of Brimſtone; but it boils up with Bubbles, as at <hi>Bathe;</hi> ſo that its Heat comes from ſome actual Fire: There is the ſame depreſſion of the Earth into a deep Valley at <hi>Buxton,</hi> which appears at <hi>Bathe;</hi> and that Contrivance was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably neceſſary, to come nearer to the Central Fire, for the boyling of the Water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:98254:97"/>
               <hi>Buxton-Bath hath not the Fourth part of the Heat as the Baths at</hi> Bathe, <hi>nor the Minerals that be there;</hi> viz. <hi>the Sulphur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buxton-Water is much like as if a Quart of boiling Water were mixed with a Gallon of cold Water: But Bath-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is as if to a Gallon of ſeething Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Quart of cold Water were put; by reaſon whereof it attracteth and diſſolveth more ſpeedily, but</hi> Buxton <hi>more ſweetly, and more temperately, not bringing ſo many grievous Accidents as</hi> Bath <hi>does. This operates effectually, tho' not ſo ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as</hi> Bath <hi>Waters do; but for many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities more commodiouſly, by reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all unnatural Evacuations, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the feeble Members, aſſiſting the Animal, Vital, and Natural Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſperſing Opilations, and qualifying Griefs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was no neceſſity of Sulphur in <hi>Buxton-Water,</hi> nor no great Heat, becauſe <hi>Buxton-Waters</hi> were deſign'd by Nature for a Cold Bath, and that the moſt moderate and ſafe; for which End it was prepared with a lacteal Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98254:97"/>
to prevent any fear of a ſudden ſtoppage of Pores, and to be leſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to the niceſt Conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Well-Springs are ſituate in a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley hard by a running Brook, and run into it, where you may perceive the Hot Water on the one ſide of the River, and the Cold on the other, which hinders the River of freezing in coldeſt Weather, for a quarter of a Mile; which is an Argument of the Power of the Heat of thoſe Springs, or elſe of the Saltneſs of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There be five or 6 other Springs not ſo good as that firſt mention'd. If the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Men bored to find the Cold Springs, and turn them away, the Springs would be more excellent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This depends on the common Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Error, that theſe Baths were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for Hot Baths; and that there can be no good Effects from cold Temperate Baths; and upon this Prejudice there have been divers Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries made, to find out the cold Springs, and divert them from the hotter; but we may thank God, who has not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98254:98"/>
the Miſtakes of Men to injure his Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>I deſignedly enquired of all the old People I could meet with in <hi>Buxton,</hi> about the Heat of the Bath-Water, who aſſured me, that it has been the ſame many Years paſt; which I may confirm by the Writing of Dr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who led the People into this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, who would have it made more hot, that more cold Infirmities might be cured by it; but this is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Cold Baths ſhould be made fit for Cold Diſeaſes, nor the Hot Baths for the Hot. Let proper Baths rather be choſen for every particular Diſeaſe; Cold for the Hot, as thoſe at <hi>Buxton;</hi> and the Hot for the Cold, as thoſe at <hi>Bathe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing God hath beſtowed on us theſe Baths for our great Benefit, if ſo be there be nothing that can more readily take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Diſtempers, (as Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>de uſu partium) of Heat and Cold, or evacuateth by the Pores the ſuperfluous Humours, than a Dulce or pleaſant Bath of warm Water, or that maintaineth Health more;</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:98254:98"/>
               <hi>for whereas it is by Nature moiſt, and moderately Hot; by its humidity it hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecteth, it dryeth, heateth, all cooled or congealed Humours; it ſtrengtheneth the looſed by inſenſible Tranſpiration; it diſcuſſes and mundifies the Skin; all which is proved by daily Experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find the Taſte of St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Well-Water and <hi>Buxton-Bath</hi> to be the ſame as to Heat and Minerals. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of a Milky Tepor, very Salt and Rank, which the Ancients called <hi>Aluminous;</hi> but I will tranſlate Dr. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> concerning them, who gives the Ingredients of theſe Waters, and ſays out of 32 th. of both Fountains boyl'd to dryneſs, he had ſcarce two 3 of Salt, without any Flakes of Stone, tho' he obſerv'd in the boyling the Braſs Veſſel to be infected with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an Aſh-colour'd Stone. The Salt coagulated into Chryſtal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt; amongſt which were ſome Cryſtal of a <hi>Lapis Calcarius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Spring at <hi>Buxton</hi> runs plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and the Bath may be empty'd in a Quarter of an Hour, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98254:99"/>
fill'd again in the ſpace of an Hour, or leſs.</p>
            <p>This Bath is contain'd in a Room built over it, the Air of which is very warm; and a Fume riſes from it like boyling Water.</p>
            <p>The Water does not feel very Tepid upon our firſt Immerſion into it; but after ſome time, you may find it warmer; and in ſome particular parts of the Bath more warm to your Feet; and it fumes moſt in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Their ſtay in this Bath is an Hour or more, till every one feels themſelves very cool; and then they are wiped, and put to a warm Bed, to lie half an Hour, and ſleep; but no Body ſweats with it, nor catches cold, tho' they go in naked: But I think the Men ought to uſe Drawers, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Shifts of Linnen or Flannel. But Cuſtom hath taught the Sexes to have ſeparate times of bathing.</p>
            <p>The Bath-Water is ſo clear, that we may ſee to the Bottom, tho' the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be uſually up to the Neck.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:98254:99"/>
It is convenient to dip the Head all over in theſe Tepid Baths, or lay a wet Cloth on it; for it cools the Head much, and checks the ariſing of Fumes.</p>
            <p>The Times of bathing are Morning and Night; faſting in the Morning, and after Supper.</p>
            <p>They uſually ſwim and walk about in the Bath; for it is impoſſible to ſtand ſtill without chilling too much.</p>
            <p>The Well of which we drink is St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Well; and of that ſome drink two, three, or four Pints, which may cauſe Vomiting if drank haſtily; but I and ſome others drank it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great offence, except its ſtyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity and ſaltneſs, or Tepor, make it nauſeous to ſome.</p>
            <p>I could not find any Vitriolic Taſte in the Waters, but can fairly give an Account of their Virtues from their cooling effects on our Bodies; for they are made cooler by the uſe of it; and the actual Heat has not any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Effect on us; for by that we are
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98254:100"/>
neither heated, nor ſweat; therefore no more Heat was neceſſary, but to prevent the inconveniences of too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a coldneſs by the Water.</p>
            <p>The Saltneſs of the Water cleanſes, and has an effect as well as all Salt Baths have, as a <hi>Diuretic, &amp;c. Vide</hi> the account of <hi>Salt-Baths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtypticity of the Water helps the Coldneſs to ſtop the Pores, to ſtrengthen the ſolid Parts, and ſtop Fluxes; ſo that from the moderate coolneſs, the ſaltneſs, and ſtypticity, I may give a fair account of the Virtues of this Water.</p>
            <p>Buxton <hi>Water, by reaſon that it rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Parts, it provokes Tranſpiration, and wipeth away the Filth of the Skin; and it alſo confirmeth, joyneth, conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dateth the looſened, ſevered, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Parts, qualifying the Over-Heated Members, drying ſuch as be over moiſt; therefore good for all Diſeaſes as come of over-much contrary heat, and for ſuch as come of overmuch Moiſture; for all Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick and Salt Humours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:98254:100"/>
If theſe be the Effects of <hi>Buxton-Baths,</hi> they are the ſame as in all Cold bathing at St. <hi>Winifred</hi>'s, and St. <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>'s; for they ſtrengthen, and cool, and conſtringe the ſolid Parts, and cure the hot <hi>Cacochymia's</hi> of our Blood; for which reaſon I may eſteem <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> one of the moſt temperate and ſafe Cool Baths in <hi>Europe,</hi> as Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has confirm'd it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Diſeaſes it cures are Rickets, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, Fevers, and Rheums; Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches, weak Sinews, old Scabs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, Cramps, Numneſs, Itchings, Ring-Worms, Impoſtumes.</hi>

well; and he ſays you may uſe a more plentiful Diet at <hi>Buxton</hi> than at <hi>Bathe:</hi> And I ſee no reaſon to alter our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Diet at theſe Baths; for as we uſe more cooling Diet in hot Bodies and Baths, ſo in the cooler Baths we muſt uſe a more heating Diet; and that is an ordinary Diet of Fleſh-Meats, and moderate Drinks. In the Morning after bathing drink either St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s-Well, or 2 Quarts of the Vitriolic Chalybeate Water lately found out there: And Water-drinking does not only cool and ſtrengthen the inward <hi>Viſcera,</hi> but hinders the breeding of hot Fumes, Vapours, or Spirits in the Body, which could not ſafely be ſtopt in the Body; and both together ſeem to me powerfully to alter the hot <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymia's</hi> in Animals.</p>
            <p>At Dinner eat of your accuſtom'd Diet: Herbs, Fruits, Legumens, Milk-Meats, and Salt Meats are uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd at Baths, being at all times but indifferent Food. But if the Diet muſt be Phyſical, it muſt be ordered as the Strength, Cuſtom, Diſeaſe, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98254:102"/>
the Nature of the Bath requires. And ſince the Bath cools, and the Diſeaſes be hot, the Diet here may be made as for all hot <hi>Cacochymia's;</hi> more cold and moiſt, if the Diſeaſe require it: And the weak and thin are to be more plentifully nonriſhed, and the Quality of the Diet contrary to the hot State of Humours; but in healthful Perſons the ordinary Diet is moſt convenient in theſe Baths.</p>
            <p>Bath-Waters ſeem improper with Meats, becauſe Diuretic.</p>
            <p>In the uſe of thoſe Baths, we muſt avoid all Exceſs, Laſſitude by great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and Retention of Excrements, or Evacuations too much, by <hi>Venery,</hi> Stools, Sweats.</p>
            <p>The Ancient Writers preſcribe Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe before theſe Cold Baths; and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons commonly bathe as ſoon as they come thither. The deſign of the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe was to excite a greater Heat, to conflict with the cold Water; but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be neceſſary here, becauſe the Bath is Tepid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:98254:103"/>
               <hi>Jones</hi> orders to tarry two or three Days before you enter the Bath; and truly this time might be well ſpent in Vomiting with St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Well-Water, for thoſe it is convenient: And after purging with <hi>Epſom</hi> Salt, or <hi>Sal Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> diſſolving ℥ ſs or ℥ j. in two Quarts of that Water.</p>
            <p>The time of bathing <hi>Jones</hi> orders to be in the Morning and Evening, but after your Exerciſe and Purging, and altogether before Meat, in the Summer Seaſon, between the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and the latter End of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Bath you may tarry two or three Hours if you pleaſe, and the Body be fit for it, and the Diſeaſe require it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I think the Time is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned by every Perſon's own Senſe; for when they are very much chill, they ought to go forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After you come forth, your Clothes well air'd (in the next Room) your Bodies well dry'd, and eſpecially your Head, they may go to Bed, and Sweat, with two Bladders of Water apply'd to them hot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:98254:103"/>
This Practice is diſus'd; for it is not rational to Sweat when we come to cloſe our Pores, and cool our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; but we go to Bed only to keep our ſelves warm.</p>
            <p>The Diet, Exerciſe, Friction, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, Bleeding, mention'd in <hi>Jones,</hi> are no more than common Rules writ by <hi>Galen</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>He adviſes to continue at <hi>Buxton</hi> Fourteen, Twenty, or Forty Days; the common practice is a Week.</p>
            <p>All the Exerciſe neceſſary is what is uſual at any other time for our Healths; he who when he is very hot, would go into the Water to chill him; that is, to create hot Fumes, and ſtop the Pores; and will certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Fever or Defluxions.</p>
            <p>He propoſes a Regiſter of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Name, Diſeaſe, Country, coming and going thence, paying for it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Quality of the Perſon, ſome to the Poor, and the reſt to the Book-keeper.</p>

               <p>IN the Gout the Virtues of this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have been well experienc'd; and were ſucceſsfully tryed by <hi>Caleb Pott,</hi> Schoolmaſter of <hi>Audlem</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> who came thither on his Crutches, and went away very well, and teſtify'd this under his hand, 1689.</p>
               <p>I met with an old Divine there laſt Year, who conſtantly frequents that Bath every Summer, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that he had received great Benefit by that Bath againſt the Gout.</p>
               <p>I met with a Perſon who had been there for a Scorbutic Rheumatiſm, and he aſſured me, that after general Evacuations, his Pains immediately ceaſed by frequent bathing.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Stephen Kaye,</hi> Rector of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> who uſed the Baths
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98254:104"/>
four Years ſucceſſively, was cured of the Gravel in the Kidneys, which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd him for ſeveral Years: And alſo of the Gout, to which he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Of this he gave his Teſtimony in writing.</p>
               <p>This Bath hath had good ſucceſs in Lameneſs, and Pains of the Limbs, as appears to me by a Certificate under the Hand of <hi>Edmund Horncaſtle,</hi> of <hi>Clarbrough,</hi> in the County of <hi>Nottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham,</hi> who by the uſe of this Bath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd of his Lameneſs and Pains, and went away without his Crutches.</p>
               <p>The Statute of 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> provided for the paſſing of cripled or ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to <hi>Buxton</hi> as well as <hi>Bathe;</hi> which is a ſufficient Teſtimony of its being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for curing Lameneſs in thoſe Days.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>White</hi> the Bath-keeper gave me many Inſtances of Cures done on the Scurvy, Leproſie, Dropſie, Lameneſs, Pains, Gravel, Stone; and in the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel it had great Effect on <hi>Robert Downs,</hi> Bath-keeper there; and another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from <hi>Hull.</hi> And he farther gave

               <p>It is very uſeful in Diſtillations and <hi>Aſthma's,</hi> by which I believe I received much Benefit; the <hi>Pſeuchroluſia</hi> is no leſs beneficial than the <hi>Hydropoſia.</hi> And here we drink the ſame kind of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we bathe in, as they do at <hi>Bathe.</hi> And we alter the Humours by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which helps the Effects of the Bath-Water externally.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Tripp</hi> of <hi>Weſton-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderwood,</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> was cured of a high Scurvy, and of a Conſumptive Cough, <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1689.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Fauler</hi> of <hi>South-Wells</hi> in <hi>Nottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham-ſhire,</hi> 1691. was cured of a Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm mixt with the Dropſie and Scurvy.</p>

                  <hi>Thomas Redford</hi> of <hi>South-Wingfield,</hi> in the County of <hi>Derby,</hi> was cured of an Univerſal Leproſie, 1696. And, <hi>Elizabeth Cruchbow</hi> of the ſame Town, was alſo cured of the ſame.</p>
