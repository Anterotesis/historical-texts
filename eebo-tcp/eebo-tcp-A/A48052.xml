         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Clowns live and die in't, whose <hi>Souls</hi> lye hid here, and after
Death their <hi>Names:</hi> My Kinder Stars, (I thank 'em) have Wing'd my
Spirit with an Active Fire, which makes me wish to know what Men are
Born for, to Dyet a Running Horse, to give a Hawk casting, to know Dogs
Names; These make not Men; no, 'tis Philosophy, 'tis Learning, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Reason to know what's Good and Virtuous, and to break our
Stubborn and Untemper'd Wills, to Choose it; This makes us Imitate that
Great Divinity that Fram'd us.</p>

but Rough-casts us; No, <hi>London</hi> is the Choisest Academy, 'tis that must
Polish us, and put a Gloss upon our Country-Studies; Hither I'm come at
last, and do resolve to Glean many Vices. Thou, <hi>Tranio,</hi> hast been my
Companion, still one Bed has held us, one Table fed us; and tho' our
Bloods give me Precedency (that I count Chance) My Love has made
us Equal, and I have found a frank return in thee.</p>

But setting those aside, for thus I may seem to do it: for my own

Vice nor Virtue in you, but as you are the Person I dote on.</p>

                  <p>Had I serv'd him as bad as <hi>Eve</hi> did <hi>Adam,</hi> he coud
not have us'd me worse; but I am resolv'd now I'm got
home again I'll be reveng'd, I'll muster up the Spight of all the Curs'd
Women since <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood to do him Mischeif, and add new Vigour to my
Tongue; I have not par'd my Nails this fortnight, they are long enough to
do him some Execution, that's my Comfort.</p>

                  <p>Thou art a Fool <hi>Biancha,</hi> come Learn of me; thou art Married to
a Man too, thou dost not know but thou mayst need my Councel, and make
good use on't; Thy Husband bares thee fair yet, but take heed of going
home with him, for when once he has thee within his verge, 'tis odds he'll
have his freaks too; there's no trusting these Men: Thy temper is soft and
easy, thou must Learn to break him, or he'll break thy Heart.</p>

my Schollar, learn to Frown, and cry out for unkindness, but brave Anger,
thou hast a Tongue, make use on't; Scould, Fight, Scratch, Bite, any thing,
still take Exceptions at all he does, if there be Cause or not, if there be
reason for't he'll Laugh at thee. I'll make <hi>Petruchio</hi> glad to wipe my Shoes,
or walk my Horse, ere I have done with him.</p>
