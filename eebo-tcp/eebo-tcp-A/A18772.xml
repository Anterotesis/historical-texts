            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Agein, in diuers caſes he draweth the matters into forme of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after the manner of Logicke, too the intent the Reader ſhould looke throughly intoo the matter, and wey it accordingly. In whiche respects although this woorke may ſeeme more neceſsarie for the ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (or at least wyſe for ſuch as bee well entered in the liberall artes, and foreward in knowledge) than for the ſimple and meaner ſorte: yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding there are other respectes alſo for which euen the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest that is of any capacitie may fare the better by him. For like as the termes of art in ſetting down and diſpoſing of matters according too art, are ſomwhat darke to ſuch as are not acquaynted with them, which is not a thing ſo greatly materiall too bee ſtumbled at: So his diſcourſing and ſetting foorth of matters perteyning too fayth, religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doctrine, and ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dment of maners (which are the cheef poynts that al men ſhould looke for) are very playn, orderly, manifest, and vtterly voyd of all obſcuritie and darkneſse.

And not in theſe Epistles only, but alſo in many other partes of holy ſcripture both of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of the new, hath he trauelled right paynfully, lernedly, and godlily, to his own great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the ſkilful, &amp; to the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie and furtherance of the christen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wedle. Wherfore, I am the bolder to match this tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the former of Hemingius (as it were the forme with the matter) and to dedicate it to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, trusting that you will of your accustomed goodneſſe giue mee leaue to ſhroud my ſimple dooings vnder the ſhadowe of your fauoure, which thing I moſt humbly requeſt.

Too the intent theſe things may bée the eaſlyer vnderſtoode, the doctrine of the common Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme is too bée repeted in this place.

And let the deſcription of the perſone of Gods ſonne bée recited out of the Cathechiſme, the which I will expound in the diſpoſement of the foreſayd Epiſtle. Heb. 1. Alſo let the names of the ſonne of God bée declared among which the chéef is, <hi>the woord,</hi> which is attributed to<note place="margin">Why Chriſt is called the woord.</note> him for many cauſes. But the chéefeſt are two. Firſt, for that the ſonne is the ful and perfect image of the euerlaſting father, like as our ſpéeche is the image that expreſſeth and ſheweth the thoughtes of our mynd. Secondly, for that by the ſonne, Goddiſcloſed his woonderfull purpoſe concerning the creation and redemption of mankind, and vttered to our firſt parentes his promis concerning the ſéede that ſhould cruſh the ſerpents head.</p>

At length when the fulneſſe of time fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſette of God was come, (namely the yéere of the world 3962) he tooke vppon him mannes nature in the wombe of the virgin Marie, and by perſonall vnion cuppled it too him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, according as was foretold of him in the promiſſes, that he ſhould bée borne of a virgin. For in this reſpect is he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note place="margin">Why Chriſt is called the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeede.</note> the womans ſeede.

                  <p>3 Chriſt is the maker of heauen and earth. Pſa. 101. Thou O Lord haſt founded the earth from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Angels are ſubſtances created, as Pſal. 103. is ſayd: which makeſt thine Angels ſpirites, and thy miniſters a flame of fire, that is too ſay, cléere ſubſtances, which in ſhéereneſſe, force, nimbleneſſe, and ſwiftneſſe, are like too fire.</p>
                  <p>4 Chriſt is an euerlaſting king, bearing a rightful ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and iuſtifying all that flée vntoo him. Pſa. 45.

But the Angels are but only the ſeruauntes of this king, and impart not their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe vnto any others.</p>
                  <p>5 Chriſt is verely and naturally the ſonne of God. Pſ. 45. O God <hi>(Chriſt,)</hi> thy God <hi>(the eternall father,)</hi> hath anoynted thée with the oyle of gladneſſe for thy felowes ſakes. Now the Angels are not God, but creatures.</p>
                  <p>6 Chriſt is anoynted with fulneſſe of the holy Ghoſt, too the entent he may annoynt his felowes, that is too ſay, the reſt of the members of the church.</p>
                  <p>The Angels are not anoynted with fulneſſe of the holy Ghoſt, neither can they of their owne power anoynt others and garniſh them with the giftes of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>7 Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of the eternall Father, that is too ſay, reigneth in equal maieſtie and glory with the euerlaſting father.</p>
                  <p>The Angels ſit not at the right hand of the Father, ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reigne in equall power with the eternall father: but are the miniſters of Chriſt and of the whole churche, pitching their tents round about all thoſe that feare him, according as is ſayd more at large concerning the office and benefites of the holy Angels, vppon S.

                  <p>The effect of iuſtification, is the renewing of nature by<note place="margin">Renevvment of nature.</note> the holy Ghoſt poured out richly vpon vs, whoo by little and little aboliſheth and mortifieth the ſinne that remaineth in vs, and our falſe opinions, and our ſinfull inclinations and affections: and kindleth in our mind a new light of the true knowledge of God, and in our will and hart a new rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe or loue of God and our neibor, or a new obedience towards all the commaundements of God.

And God was with him, and deliuered him out of al his aduerſities, and gaue him fauour and wiſdom in the ſyght of Pharao king of Egypt. And he made him gouernour ouer all his houſhold. Then came there a dearth ouer all the land of Egypt, and Canaan, and great affliction, that our Fathers found no ſuſtenance.

Then fled Moyſes at that ſaying, and was a ſtraunger in the lande of Madian, wher he begat twoo ſonnes. And when fortie yeares were expyred, there appeered too him in the wilderneſſe of mount Syna, an Angell of the Lorde in a flame of fyre in a buſhe. VVhen Moyſes ſaw it, he wondred at the ſyght. And as he drew neer too behold, the voyce of the Lord came vntoo him: I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, &amp; the God of Iacob. Moyſes trembled and durſt not beholde.

The ſame GOD ſent bothe a ruler and a deliuerer, by the handes of the Aungel which appeared too him in the bushe. And the ſame brought them out, shewing wonders and ſignes in Egipt, and in the red ſea, and in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes. xl. yeeres. This is that Moſes whiche ſayed vntoo the children of Iſraell: A prophet shall the Lorde our God rayſe vp vnto you of your brethren, lyke vntoo mee, him shall yee heare.

For our knovvledge is vnperfect, and our propheſying is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: But vvhen that vvhich is perfect is come, then that vvhich is vnperfect shal bee done avvay. When I was a chyld, I ſpake as a child, I vnderſtode as a child, I imagined as child. But aſſoone as I was a man, I put away childishneſſe. Now wee ſee in a glaſſe, euen in a darke ſpeaking: but then shall wee ſee face too face. Now I know vnperfectly, but then shall I know euen as I am knowne. Nowabydeth faith, hope, and loue, euen theſe three: but the cheefe of theſe is loue.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8318:47"/>
which may bée euen in the vngodly. Mathew. vij. But were it ſo that Paule ſpake of the iuſtifying Fayth: yet can it not bée concluded thereby, that wée are not iuſtified by fayth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or for Chryſtes ſake only. For certeine it is that the loue<note place="margin">True faith and true loue are vnſeparable.</note> of God and a mannes neybor doo of neceſſitie go ioyntly too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with fayth. Like as with the riſing of the ſunne, there goeth ioyntly of neceſſitie the ſpreading foorth of his beames or lyght: Euen ſo of neceſſitie loue foloweth Fayth in thoſe that are iuſtified, in ſo much as he that loueth not, abydeth in death. Like as that body wherein there remayneth no féeling or mouing, liueth not: and yet it foloweth not therupon that feeling and mouing are the cauſe of lyfe, but lyfe is the cauſe of mouing: Euen ſo the efficient cauſe of our iuſtification is God for the obedience, paſſion and death of Chryſt only. And fayth is the inſtrument wherby wée take hold of Chryſt our ryghtuouſneſſe. Now muſt the loue of God and a mannes neybor of neceſſitie folow Fayth in him that is iuſtified, like as mouing and féeling doo of neceſſitie folow lyfe. But loue can not procéede, but of fayth, like as there can grow no good frutes, but of a good trée.</p>

or mo, or a whole day (that is too wit. 24. houres,) or but till the euentide. This manner of Faſting was vſed euen in the new Teſtament, how bée it in ſuch wyſe, that neither the day nor any certeine meates from which a man ſhould abſteine, were appoynted, but the whole thing was left frée too euery good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes conſcience, and the opportunitie of the time.

And bear men in hand that it is deadly ſinne if any man in the tyme of faſting doo eate fleſh, imagining this forbearing of certeine meates too bée Gods ſeruice, and a woorke of neceſſitie, euen though it tend too the offence of others. Alſo they taught in tymes paſt that ſinnes were purged by faſting, or at leaſt wyſe that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chryſtes Paſſion is applyed too vs for them. It was hygh tyme that theſe vngodly and Idolatrous opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reproche too the merit of Chryſte, ſhould bée found fault with.

                  <p>The cauſe alſo why Paule in this place vrgeth ſo ſore this commaundement concerning Chaſtitie and eſchewing the luſtes and vices encountering it, is for that at Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica (like as at Epheſus and Corinth and other Heathen ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and famous mart townes to which great multitudes of men were woont to flocke togither from all Nations) there was chéefly great confuſion of luſtes, and vnbrydled libertie of all vyces which ryotouſneſſe and welth bréedeth. Paule therfore both in this place and .j. Cor. vj. &amp; Epheſ. v. teacheth, that wandering luſtes are not things indifferent, neyther that there is any libertie graunted in the Goſpell, eyther of luſtfull likings, or of craftyneſſe in bargeyning: but that they are prohibited moſt ſtraightly by the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, and are moſt ſharply puniſhed by God the iuſt iudge and reuenger.

This whole defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may bée builded and warranted out of the textes of the Epiſtle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrewes. But this dayes leſſon of the ninth chapter, entreateth chéefly of the third part of Chriſts préeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod, that is too wit, of his Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>And too the intent this doctrine concerning the ſacrifyce<note place="margin">Gods iuſtice medled with mercy, was the cauſe of chriſts ſacrifyce.</note> of our hygh préeſt Chryſt may bée drayned from the verye ſprings: firſt let vs conſider that God is verely and vnchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geably iuſt, and that it is an euerlaſting and vnchaungeable rule of Gods iuſtice, that the reaſonable creatures ſhould eyther perfectly and throughly agrée with Gods wiſdome &amp; rightuouſneſſe, or (if they agréed not,) that they ſhould ſuffer puniſhment accordingly, and bée horribly deſtroyed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in as much as the firſt man and woman had offended &amp; forgone the ryghtuouſneſſe and ſoundneſſe that was giuen them in their creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they were too bée caſt away intoo eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation. But of his vnmeaſurable mercie, the ſonne of GOD made intreatance for mankynd, and too the intent Gods Iuſtice might bée ſatiſfyed, he offered himſelfe too pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement and too make amendes too Gods moſt rightfull wrath. And ſo vppon the wonderfull tempering of Gods Iuſtice and his mercie toogither, there was a decrée enacted of receyuing men intoo fauour for the ſacrifyce of the ſonne of God, whereby Gods wrath was too bée pacifyed, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe and euerlaſting ſaluation too bée recouered too mankynd.</p>
                  <p>For this ſacrifyce of the ſonne of God, all the elect haue at all tymes obteyned remiſſion of ſinnes and inheritaunce of eternall lyfe, as is ſayd. Actes. iiij. There is none other name vnder heauen, in whiche wée muſt bée ſaued, than the name of Ieſus Chryſt.</p>

And here vntoo were added ſuperſtitious opinions, that God was pacifyed and made at tone with vs for the preciouſneſſe and woorthyneſſe of the ſacrifyſes.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8318:76"/>
yee continue, by the which alſo yee are ſaued: I doo you too wyt, after what maner I preached vntoo you, if ye kepe it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee haue beleeued in vaine. For firſt of all, I haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you, that which I receyued: how that Chryſt died for our ſinnes, agreeing too the ſcriptures, and that he was buried, and that he roſe ageine the third day, according too the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and that he was ſeene of Cephas, then of the twelue. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, he was ſeen of mo than fiue hundred brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at once, of which many remaine vntoo this day, and many are fallen a ſleepe. After that appeared hee too Iames, then too all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. And laſt of all he was ſeen of mee, as one that was born out of due time. For I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, which am not worthy too bee called an Apoſtle bicauſe I perſecuted the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation of God. But by the grace of God, I am that I am. And his grace which is in mee, was not in vaine, but I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which is with mee. Therfore whether it were I or they, ſo wee preach, and ſo haue yee beleeued. If Chryſt bee preached how that hee roſe from the deade: how ſay ſome among you, that there is no reſurrection of the dead? If there be no riſing agein of the dead: then is Chryſt not riſen. If Chryſt bee not riſen, then is our preaching vaine, and your faith is alſo in vain, yea, and wee are found alſo falſe witneſſes of God. For wee haue teſtified of God, how that he rayſed vp Chryſt: whom hee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not vp, if it bee ſo that the dead riſe not ageine. For if the dead riſe not agein, then is Chryſt not riſen agein. If it bee ſo that Chryſt roſe not, then is your faith in vain, and yet are yee in your ſinnes. Therfore they which are falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſleep in Chriſt are perished. If in this lyfe onely wee beleeue on Chryſt, then are wee of all men the myſerableſt. But now is Chryſt ryſen from the dead and is become the firſt fruites of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſleep. For by a man came death, and by a man came the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the deade. For as by Adam all die: euen ſo by Chryſt, shal all bee made alyue, and euery man in his owne order. The firſt is Chryſt, then they that are Chryſtes at his comming.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:8318:77"/>
Then cometh the ende, when he hath deliuered vp the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome too God the father, when hee hath put downe all rule, authoritie, and power. For he muſt raigne till he haue put all his enemies vnder his feete. The laſt enemie that ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, is death. For he hath put all thinges vnder his feete. But when he ſaith, all things are put vnder him, it is manifeſt, that he is excepted, which did put all things vnder him. When all things are ſubdued vnto him: then ſhall the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne alſo him ſelfe be ſubiect vntoo him that did put all things vnder him, that God may be all in all things. Els what do they whiche are baptiſed ouer the dead, if the dead riſe not at all? Why are they then baptiſed ouer the dead? Yea and why ſtand we in in ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdy euery houre? Be my reioyſyng which I haue in Chryſt Ieſu our Lord, I die dayly. That I haue fought with beaſtes at Epheſus after the maner of men: what auantageth it me, if the deade ryſe not ageine? Let vs eate and drinke: For to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row we shall dye. Be not deceiued: euyll ſpeakings corrupt good manners. Awake truly out of ſleepe, and ſinne not. For ſome haue not the knowledge of God, I ſpeake this too youre rebuke. But ſome man will ſay: howe aryſe the deade? with what body come they? Thou foole that whiche thou ſoweſt, is not quickned, excepte it dye. And what ſoweſt thou? Thou ſoweſt not that body that shall bee: but bare corne (I meane eyther of wheate, or of ſome other) and GOD giueth it a body at his pleaſure, to euery ſeede his owne body. All flesh is not one manner of fleshe, but there is one manner flesh of men, another manner fleshe of Beaſtes, another manner flesh of fyshes, another of byrdes. There are alſo celeſtiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, and there are bodies terreſtrial. But the glory of the celeſtiall is one and the glorye of the terreſtriall is an other, there is one maner glory of the Sunne and an other of the Moone, and an other glory of the Starres. For one Starre differeth from another in glory. So is the reſurrection of the dead. It is ſowen in corruption, and ryſeth in incorruption. It is ſown in dishonor, and ryſeth in glory. It is ſowen in weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:8318:77"/>
&amp; riſeth in power. It is ſown in a natural body, &amp; riſeth a ſpirituall body. There is a naturall body, and there is a ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bodye, as it is alſo wrytten: the firſt man Adam was made alyuing ſoule, and the laſt Adam was made a quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge ſpiryte. Howbeit, that is not firſt which is ſpirituall, but that vvhiche is naturall, and then that vvhiche is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. The firſt man is of the earthe earthy: the ſeconde man is the LORDE from heauen. As is the earthy, ſuche are they that are earthy. And as is the heauenly, ſuche are they that are heauenly. And as wee haue borne the Image of the earthy, ſo shall wee beare the image of the heauenly. This ſay I brethren, that flesh and bloud can not enherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of GOD. Neither doothe corruption inherite vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Beholde I shewe you a myſterie. Wee shall not all ſleepe: But wee shall all bee changed, and that in a moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinckelyng of an eye (at the ſounde) of the laſte trumpe. For the trumpe shall blow, and the deade shall ryſe incorruptible, and wee shall bee chaunged. For thys corruptible, muſte put on incorruption, and this mortall, muſt put on immortalitie. When this corruptible hath put on incorruption, and this mortall hath put on immortalitie then shall bee brought too paſſe the ſaying that is vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: Death is ſwallovved vppe intoo victorie. Deathe where is thy ſtyng? Hell where is thy victory. The ſtyng of Deathe is ſinne: and the ſtrength of ſinne, is the lawe. But thankes be vnto God, which hath giuen vs victorie, through our Lorde Ieſus Chryſte. Therfore my deare brethren, be yee ſtedfaſt and immoue able, alvvayes rich in the woorks of the Lorde, for as much as yee know how that your laboure is not in vayne in the Lorde.</p>

                  <p>The conſequent is of force, holding from the efficient and ſufficient cauſe, too the effect: which he will accompliſh as he hath promyſed.</p>
                  <p>This reaſon of the conſequence, Paule himſelfe poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out a little after.

Iohn .xx. Marke .xviij. next too the reſt of the women. Math. xxviij. Thirdly too a cupple walking intoo the féeldes, whom the Apoſtles beléeued not. Mark .xvj. Fourthly too Cephas or Simon Peter.

                  <p>AN euident proofe that God is not the cauſe of euill. For<note place="margin">Not God but wee our ſelues are cauſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil too our ſelues.</note> the beginning of this Epiſtle matcheth with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diſcourſe going before, in whiche Iames hath taught that God temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no man, that is too ſay, enforceth no man too ſinne or too fall, but that eche man is tempted of his own concupiſcence, (that is too ſay of his own ſinfull inclinations) or of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vnrulyneſſe of all the powers of man raging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinſt the Lawes of God. This concupiſcence like a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring bredeth and bringeth foorth actuall ſinnes euen in the regenerate, when (ouer and beſydes the miſtineſſe of mynd, and the ſinfull inclinations, and the ſodein brayds of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,) there commeth alſo an aſſent or agréement of the wil, and a ful purpoſe too commit the ſin euen in outward woork. And ſo hath ſinne his being, not of God, but of concupiſcence ſticking in vs, or of originall ſinne whiche is bred and borne with vs. And therefore dooth Iames ryght ſagely affirme, that nothing commeth from God but good, as is ſayd in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis, God ſawe all things that he had made, and behold they were excéeding good, and Pſalm. 91. They ſhall declare that our Lord GOD is ryghtuouſe, and there is no iniquitie in him. The ſame is the méening of Iames in this place: <hi>Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good gift is from aboue, and commeth from the Father of lyght with whom there is no variableneſſe nor ſhadowing of chaunge,</hi> that is too ſay, like as God is good: ſo there procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing but good from him. Yea, all good things, vertue, wiſdome, and happyneſſe in compaſſing things, are the gifts of God only, according too this text, what haſt thou whiche thou haſt not receyued? And godlyly and ſagely ſayeth one in <hi>Plutarch:</hi> God hath made theſe things, and he dooth lende his hand vntoo mée.</p>

                  <p>The Article of our fayth concerning the Aſcenſion of Chryſt intoo heauen, is ſet foorth in the woorde of GOD with many notable recordes. As in the foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith Chapter of the Goſpell of Saint Luke the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt. Further in the ſixtenth Chapiter of Saint Markes Goſpell. And in the thrée ſcore and eight Pſalme of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid the Prophet. And likewiſe in the fourth Chapter too the Epheſians. Item in the third Chapter of the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of Saint Peter the Apoſtle. And in the ſixth and the twentith Chapters of Saint Iohn the Euangeliſt.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as I haue a little afore ſpoken of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites in Chryſtes Aſcenſion, too the intent the Phraſe may bée the ryghtlyer vnderſtoode, I will now declare the ſignifications of this woord Heauens.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt Heauen in the holy Scripture, ſignifyeth the ſkie, or the nyne Celeſtiall compaſſes: That is too witte, the firſt moueable or mouer, the Firmament or compaſſe which is decked with the fixed Starres, and the ſeuen compaſſes or welkins of the Planets, which ſtarres the Scripture calleth the powers or hoſte of heauen.

                     </gap> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Pſalme. By the woord of the Lord the heauens are ſtabliſhed, and all the powers or hoſte of heauen by the breath of his mouth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Heauen ſignifyeth the aire. As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the ſixthe Chapiter of Saint Mathewes Goſpell. Beholde, the Foules of heauen, that is too ſay, that flye in the aire. And in the third Chapiter of Salomons Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbes. The way of an Eagle in the Heauen. And in the eight Chapter of the third booke of the kings. If the heauen
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:8318:107"/>
bée ſhut vp and it raine not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, too bée in Heauen, is too enioy the ſyght of GOD, too pleaſe GOD, and being deliuered from ſinne and Death, too enioy the wiſdome, ryghtuouſneſſe, lyfe, and ioyes of GOD, which are begonne by Faith héere on earth, and finiſhed in the euerlaſting lyfe in Heauen. As Saint Marke in the tenthe Chapter of his Goſpell wryteth. Suffer chyldren too come vntoo mée, for of ſuche is the kingdome of heauen.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Heauen ſignifieth the ſeate and dwelling place of God and of Soules and Aungels, namely where God offereth himſelfe too the bliſſed Angels and ſoules too bée ſéene face too face. As is ſayde in the hundred and thrée Pſalme of the Prophete Dauid. The Lorde hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his ſeate in Heauen. And in the ſixte Chapter of Sainct Mathewes Goſpell: Dure Father which arte in Heauen. This heauen in which GOD ſheweth himſelfe too the Angels and bliſſed ſoules openly, ſome lerned men wryght too bée called the heauen of heauens, as is ſayde in the hundred and thirtéene Pſalme of the Prophet Dauid: The heauen of heauens, too the Lorde, but the earth hée hath giuen too the ſonnes of men. Alſo, the thirde heauen in the ſecond Epiſtle of Saint Paule too the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the twelfth chapter where he writeth, that he was caught vp aboue the airy heuen or Element, and aboue the ſkye, intoo the third heauen, that is too wit, the heauen of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, or the Chryſtall heauen, where he ſawe things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable. They are of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Chriſt aſcended intoo this heauen, and that there he imparteth him ſelfe in his true bodye too bée ſeene of the bliſſed Angels and Saintes. As the Prophete Dauid ſayeth in his three ſcore and eight Pſalme. Sing vntoo GOD, who is aſcended intoo the Heauen of Heauens. Ephe. iiij. He is aſcended aboue all heauens, that he might fill all things.</p>

                     <hi>The ryght hand of God,</hi> dooth in the Scriptures moſt<note place="margin">The right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God.</note> vſually ſignifie, Gods eternall almyghtyneſſe, maieſtie, and glorie. It is written in the hundred and eightene Pſalme of Dauid: The right hand of the Lord hath doone mightie things, the Lordes right hande is exalted. And in the ſecond Chapter of the Hiſtorie of the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: Being exalted by the right hande of God, he poured out vppon vs the holy Ghoſte that he had promiſed. Alſo in the thrée ſcore and ſix Chapter of the prophecie of Eſai: Heauen is my ſeate, and the earth is my foteſtoole. All theſe things hath my hand made. And in the fiftenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſeconde booke of Moyſes called Exodus: Thy right hand is magnifyed O Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Too ſit,</hi> ſignifieth too reigne and too execute the power<note place="margin">Too ſitte.</note> and office of a King. As in the ninth Chapter of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Eſai: Vppon the throne of Dauid and vppon his kingdome ſhal he ſit. Hereupon cometh the ſeat or Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore too ſit at the right hand of the Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, is the ſame thing that too reigne in equall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe, maieſtie, and glorie with him, is. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid in his hundred and tenth Pſalme ſayeth thus: The Lord ſayd vntoo my Lord, ſit thou at my right hande till I make thyne enemies thy foteſtoole. This expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the bliſſed Apoſtle Saint Paule in the fiftenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his firſt Epiſtle written too the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in theſe woordes: Chryſte muſt reigne till he haue made his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies his foteſtoole.</p>
                  <p>Sometyme alſo, but very ſeldome, the right hande of God is in the Scripture ſo termed, not in reſpect of God, but of godly men which pleaſe GOD, and are defended by God, and adorned with euerlaſting bliſſe: Like as Chriſt is ſayde too haue ſet the Shéepe on his right hande and the Gotes on his lefte. But this ſignification perteyneth not too this place.</p>

                  <p>Firſt that the maruelous publiſhing of Gods lawe which<note place="margin">Why Whitſon tide was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned too be continually kept.</note> he had ſet foorthe that day vppon the toppe of mount Sinai with notable tokens, might the more certeinly be ſpred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode.

or dayes in which the law was deliuered, and which the holy Ghoſt was ſhed foorth, and the maner of the manifeſtation of bothe, too agree. For looke on what day the lawe of God was publiſhed with flames of thunder and lightning vpon mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sinai, the ſameday was the holy Ghoſte alſo ſheaded forth vppon the Apoſtles in the likeneſſe of flames of firy tunges.

                  <p>THe holy ghoſt imparteth vnto vs both himſelf &amp; his gif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes by two means which he hath ordeined &amp; ſtabliſhed: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is too wit, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of the goſpel, herd, red, or thought vpon: and by the Sacraments of Baptim, and the Lords ſupper: as is ſayde in the Epiſtle of to morow. Act. x. The holy ghoſt fel vpon al that herd the woorde. And in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Peter which he made as vpon this day at <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> when his héerers aſked him: What ſhal wée doo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wée may obteyn the holy ghoſt? Peter anſwered: Repent, &amp; be baptized euery one of you in the name of Ieſus Chryſt, &amp; yée ſhal receiue the gift of the holy ghoſt. There is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that can obteyn the holy ghoſt, by his owne power or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert: but the ſpirite of God of his owne infinite goodneſſe preuenteth vs, &amp; offreth himſelf too vs by the word of the Goſpel, and kindleth the true knowledge of God &amp; faith in our breſts, and regenerateth &amp; renueth our mynd and wil. Therfore being helped of the holy ghoſt, wée both can &amp; muſt ſtir vp, noriſh &amp; encreaſe in our ſelues the kindled ſparks of faith, &amp; the beginnings of al other vertues: And alſo muſt deſire of God, that this ſpirite may be the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of al our deuiſes and dooings.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt Peter ſtepped forth with the eleuen, and lift vp his voyce, and ſayd vnto them: Yee men of lewry, &amp; all yee that inhabite Hieruſalem, be this known vntoo you, and with your eares heare my wordes: Theſe are not drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ye ſuppoſe: for it is yet but the third houre of the day. But this is that which was ſpoken by the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phete Ioell: It shal be in the laſt days ſayeth God, of my ſpirit I will poure out vppon all fleshe. And your ſonnes and your doughters shal propheſy, and your yong men shal ſee viſions, and your old men shal dreame dreames. And on my ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and on my handmaydens I will poure out my ſpirit in thoſe days, and they shal propheſie. And I will shewe woonders in heauen aboue, and tokens in the earth beneath, bloude and fyre and the vapour of ſmoke. The Sunne shal be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to darkneſſe, and the Moon into bloud, before that great and notable day of the Lord come. And it shal be that whoſoeuer shall call on the name of the Lorde, ſhal be ſaued. Yee men of Iſrael, heare theſe woordes: Ieſus of Nazareth, a man appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God among you with miracles, woonders and ſignes, which God did by him in the mids of you (as yee your ſelues know) him haue ye taken by the hands of vnryghtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, after he was deliuered by the determinate counſell and fore knowledge of God, and haue crucified and ſlayne: whom God hath rayſed vp, and louſed the ſorowes of death, by cauſe it was vnpoſsible that he shoulde bee holden of it. For Dauid ſpeaketh of him. A fore hand I ſaw God alwayes before me,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8318:117"/>
for hee is on my right hande, that I ſhoulde not bee moued. Therfore did my hart reioyce, &amp; my tongue was glad. More ouer alſo, my flesh shall reſt in hope, bicauſe thou wilte not leaue my ſoule in Hell, neyther wilte ſuffer thyne holy too ſee corruption. Thou haſte shewed mee the wayes of lyfe and shalt make mee full of ioy with thy countenaunce. Men and brethren, let me freely ſpeak vnto you of the patriark Dauid. For hee is bothe dead and buried, and his ſepulchre remaineth with vs vnto this day. Therfore ſeing he was a Prophete, and knew that God had ſworne with an othe to him, that Chryſt (as concerning the flesh) should come of the frute of his loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſit on his ſeat: he knowing this before, ſpake of the reſurrection of Chryſt, that his ſoule should not be left in hel neither his flesh shoulde ſee corruption. This Ieſus hath God raiſed vp, wherof we al are witneſſes. Since now that he by the ryght hand of God is exalted, and hath receiued of the father the promiſe of the holy ghoſt, he hath shed foorth that which, ye now ſee and heare. For Dauid is not aſcended into heauen but he ſayd: The lord ſayd to my Lord, ſyt on my right hand vntill I make thy foes thy footeſtoole. So therfore, let all the houſe of Iſraell knowe for a ſuretie that God hath made that ſame Ieſus (whom ye haue crucified) Lord and Chryſt. When they heard this they were pricked in their heartes, and ſayde vntoo Peter, and vntoo the other Apoſtles: Yee men and brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what shall we do? Peter ſaid vnto them: repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and be baptized euery one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, for the remiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſins, and ye shal receiue the gift of the holy ghoſt.</p>

                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:8318:119"/>Secondly the poynting of the tyme muſt be vnderſtood aright. <hi>And it shal be in the later dayes</hi> not in the end of the world, but at the laſt caſt of the Iewiſh common weale, and of the lawe giuen by Moyſes. Now there are from the publiſhing of Moyſes lawe vntoo the pouring out of the holy ghoſt vpon the apoſtles, a thouſand fiue hundred and twoo and fortie yeares.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly is to be conſidered the pithineſſe of this word <hi>Power</hi> by which God ment to betoken great aboundance and large plentuouſneſſe of a moſte bounteous gift. For whereas before that tyme, the giftes of the holy ghoſte floriſhed only among the Iewes: in the latter dayes, not onely theſe gifts of the holy ghoſt which are common too the godly, but alſo thoſe peculiar and wonderfull giftes ſhall be poured by heapes vpon all fleſh, and vpon all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions that beléeue the goſpell. And here withall the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet alludeth too the cuſtome of anoynting the préeſtes, which was a foreſhadow of the giuing of the holy ghoſt, as appeareth in. j. Iohn. ij.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly the teſtimonie concerning the perſon of the holy ghoſt in the pronoun <hi>My</hi> is to be obſerued. For ther<note place="margin">Proofes of the Godhead of the holy ghoſt.</note> is nothing in the godhead of the father &amp; the ſonne, which is not diuine, euerlaſting and almightie.</p>
                     <p>This ſpirit which is powred out vpon all fleſh, is the ſpirite of the Lord God, and is poured out of the being of the father and the Son. <hi>Ergo</hi> he is very God by nature, of one ſelfſame ſubſtance with the father and the ſonne.</p>
                     <p>Although that in the Hebrew it bée written <hi>Ruhi, <hi>my ſpirite,</hi>
                        </hi> yet notwithſtanding the ſame thing altogither is in the word of Peter, <hi>I will powre out my ſpirite,</hi> whiche things agrée with the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſpéeche that Chryſt vſeth in Iohn. xvj. The ſpirite of truthe ſhall take of myne. All things that my father hath, are myne. Therfore ſayd I, that he ſhal take of myne, and ſhew vnto you.</p>
                     <p>For as the father hath a being euerlaſting, almighty,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8318:119"/>
incomprehenſible, true, good of it ſelf, and ſtanding by it ſelfe: So alſo hath the Son the ſelf ſame things taken of the Father. And the holy Ghoſt is ſayde to take the ſame being of the father and the ſonne, that in the trinitie wée may beléeue the nature of the holy ghoſt too bée the ſame that the nature of the father and the ſonne is.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly is to bée obſerued the moſte ſwéete comfort ſet foorth in this vniuerſal peece <hi>vpon al fleſh,</hi> which teacheth that God is not an accepter of perſons, but vpright to all men that behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vprightly. For as it is his will to haue al men ſaued: ſo alſo poureth he out his ſpirite vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that repent and beleue the Goſpell.</p>

                     <p>Seuenthly in theſe woords folowing: <hi>And your ſons &amp;<note place="margin">No accepting of perſones vvith Chryſt.</note> daughters, your yong men &amp; your old men, your bondmen &amp; your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmayds ſhal propheſy,</hi> is declared by a diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vniuerſal parcel <hi>al flesh,</hi> for the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of ſexes, ages &amp; eſtates are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away: for in Chriſt Ieſu ther is no male or female, no bondma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or freeman, no Iew or Gréeke Gal. iij. but all are one in Chryſt, all become partakers a like of the benefites of Chryſtand the holy Ghoſt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that the largeneſſe of the doctrine, conteyned in this ſhort ſentence, may in ſome ſorte bée conſidered and vnderſtood, I will expound the woordes in order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all therfore, leaſt any man might doute of the certeintie of this doctrine, Peter alledged the authoritie of the Synode, or generall determination of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes and Apoſtles, and the conſente of the vniuerſall Church, which now alſo may bée ſet againſt our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, when they yell out that they are the church of God, and that they follow the conſent of the Churche. And we may know that one ſelf ſame doctrine concerning rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe or remiſſion of ſinnes, too bée giuen fréely for Chriſt our mediatours ſake, was alwayes preached in the church of the Fathers and the Prophetes, and that for the ſame cauſe chéefly, God rayſed vp Prophetes, that they ſhould bée witneſſes &amp; interpreters of the promiſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the teſtimonies of Moyſes &amp; the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes did ſhew.

                  <p>Secondly, he defineth mans rightuouſneſſe before God,<note place="margin">Ryghtuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe what it is.</note> to be forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, giuen fréely for Chriſts ſake: and that too bee iuſtified is the ſame thing that to receyue remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes, or too be acquit and ſet frée from ſin, as Paul ſayth.

This <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or matching of contraries, &amp; this excluſiue or diſbarring, is to bée faſtned in mens mindes with great héede, to the intent the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable title of redéemer &amp; Iuſtifier (which is due only to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God our Lord Ieſu Chriſte) may be giuen vnto him, and that the conſciences which are throwen downe, may haue aſſured and ſtedy comfort too hold by.</p>

Now, to beleue on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God, is, firſt to acknowledge aright the perſon &amp; benefits of Chriſt crucified, &amp; rayſed agein for vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is verely &amp; by nature God, &amp; the ſauiour promiſed by the Prophetes, pacifying God, &amp; giuing peace, rightuouſneſſe &amp; ſaluacion euerlaſting to thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleue. Secondly, to aſſent to al the whole doctrine deliuered vs by Chriſt, or with a ſtedy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to embrace al the articles of the Chriſten faith, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, this alſo: <hi>I beleue remiſsion of ſins to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me freely for Chriſts ſake.</hi> Thirdly, it is to reſt vpon Chriſt the Mediator, with ſtedfaſt truſt, &amp; to aſſure a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſelf for a certeintie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſins are forgiuen him for Chriſtes ſake, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is in Gods fauor, &amp; that God accepteth him, heereth him, &amp; receyueth him to euerlaſting life for Chriſts ſake, who hath ſuffered and is riſen ageine for vs, and not for our owne vertues or good workes.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obiect of faith &amp; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſum of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole Goſpel (which is lernedly &amp; bréefly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended in this ſermon of Peters) be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered. For he ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God by his word hath brought tidings of peace through Chriſt, who is lord of al.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore he comprehendeth the doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the perſon of Chriſt, in the word <hi>Lord,</hi> namely that he is <hi>Iehoua</hi> in very déede, and by nature God, the maker
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:8318:124"/>
and Lord of Heauen and earth, &amp; of all thinges that are in them, as it is ſayd, I am the Lord, and this is my name, I will not giue my glorie too an other. Now the name of <hi>Iehoua</hi> is attributed too Chriſt in Iere. xxiij, &amp; xxxiij. Dan. ix. Num. xxj. Therfore Chriſt is verely, &amp; by nature God.</p>
                  <p>Againe he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehendeth a ſumme of the doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe twoo woordes: <hi>Remiſsion of ſinnes, and peace purchaſed by Chriſt,</hi> Wherin hée méeneth not bodyly and worldly peace, but the appeaſement of Gods wrath againſt our ſinnes, attonement with God, quietneſſe and ioy of conſcience in all aduerſities and in death, and laſtly deſire too mainteyne outward concord and peace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that faith is not only a bare knowledge of the perſone and benefites of Chriſt, but alſo a truſt ſettled in Chriſt, it appeareth openly be this phraſe, <hi>All that beleeue in him.</hi> For it is well doone in the ſchooles, that they make this diſtinction in the maner of ſpéeches folowing, that too beléeue of God, is to beléeue him too bée, to beléeue God, is to giue credit too him and to beléeue his woorde, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue in God, is to truſt in him, too ſtay vppon him, and too repoſe the whole hope of our ſaluation in him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſix places conteyned in this notable ſentence of Peter: <hi>To him doo all the Prophetes beare witneſſe. &amp;c.</hi> Let the ſtudiouſe ſorte conſider, and ioyne thereuntoo a ſumme of the doctrine, concerning the Iuſtifying of man before God, out of the writinges that comprehended the ſubſtaunce of the Chriſten doctrine.</p>

And he prompted <hi>Samoſetanns, Arius</hi> and <hi>Fotinus,</hi> with colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and falſe opinions concerning the Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in mens willes and harts he nouriſheth and confirmeth the ſinfull inclinations and affections of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature, as careleſneſſe and neglecting of Gods wrath and iudgement, diſtruſt in God, pryde, enuyouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, lewd loue, hatred, ſlouthfulneſſe. &amp;c.

applying &amp; continuing theyr ſtudies into vitteling hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, too feaſtes, games, gaddings too &amp; froo a nightes, and other foule diſorders.

                  <p>Fourthly, he endéeuereth to quench the fayth of moſt men by aduerſities, as by pouertie, contempt, diffama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, diſeaſes, baniſhmentes, tormentes of body, and all the perſecutions that Tyrauntes and the worlde can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe. Of theſe kindes of policies chéefly, doth Peter make mencion in this place, &amp; he comforteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly, both by the example of all the brotherhood in the world, or of all the Church and the godly: and alſo with the ſhorte continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of theyr troubles: &amp; ſpecially with the helpe of God who vnderſhoreth, hartneth &amp; ſtrengthneth mens minds, that they ſhould not faint, as it is ſayd, j.

                  <p>Fifthly, the Diuell weakeneth and ouerthroweth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mo with proſperitie, fauour of Noble men, wealthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, proinotion, ydleneſſe, pleaſures. &amp;c.

Wherefore when the feare of God (whiche is as it were the kéeper of all the other vertues) is remoued, mennes mindes doo eaſly giue bridle too their ſinful luſtes, and yeld to the Diuell who plyeth them with occaſions of fallings, as Dauid, Salomon, &amp; others without nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber haue falne in ydleneſſe and proſperitie.

                  <p>The firſt of theſe is watchfulneſie which muſt ridde a<note place="margin">Watchfulneſſe</note> mans minde of carefulneſſe, dulneſſe, and drouzyneſſe in neglecting the pollicies and power of Sathan, &amp; perſuade it ſelfe that the name of <hi>Diuell</hi> or <hi>feende,</hi> is not a vayne ſcarbug, or a painted viſer, but muſt aduiſedly &amp; earneſtly looke too the ſleyghtes of him as of a moſt ſuttle and cruell enimy, &amp; endeuer to withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; cut of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginnings of his temptacions, like as Ioſeph with ſingular watchfulneſſe had an eye to the diuel, when he layd the bayt for his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, &amp; ſo withſtoode the beginnings of his allurementes.</p>

                  <p>We are ſaued by hope, <hi>Ergo</hi> we are iuſtified by hope, and not by fayth onely: I anſwer: I deny the conſequent: bycauſe there is a guyle in the double meening of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woord <hi>Saluation.</hi> For in the <hi>maior</hi> or firſt propoſition it ſignifieth remiſſion of ſins, or reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cileme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to God, &amp; the heritage of eternall lyfe.

                  <p>The firſt argument is of the finall cauſe of iuſtification.<note place="margin">The finall cauſe of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> For when wicked men obiected vntoo Paule, if good woorkes deſerue not forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, iuſtification and ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: there is no need why wée ſhould regard too doo wel: or it née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not too doo good woorks: Paule turneth this obiection vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, and raeſoneth thus.</p>
                  <p>For this cauſe dooth grace ſurmount aboue ſinne, and for this cauſe are forgiueneſſe of ſinnes and the holy Ghoſt giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs through frée mercy: that ſinne and death ſhould bée taken from vs, and new ryghtuouſneſſe and lyfe bée kindled in vs.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond argument is of the efficient cauſe.<note place="margin">The efficient cauſe of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is dead dooth nothing, and ſo ſinneth not.</p>
                  <p>Wée are dead too ſin, that is too ſay, ſin is dead or releaſed and aboliſhed: yea and drowned &amp; buried in baptim, that is to wit by the frée remiſſion of the ſin, and by the imputacion of Chriſtes rightuouſneſſe, &amp; by the beginning of ſuch mortifica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or aboliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſin, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cefoorth although ſin be not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppreſſed, yet not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, it may not reigne any more.</p>

                  <p>That which liueth and reigneth is woorkfull and effectuall, that is too ſay, is alwayes dooing of ſomewhat.</p>

béeing ſet frée from ſin in true repentance or mortifying of ſin by Chryſt, or in the effectuall woorking of Chryſtes death and reſurrection, muſt héereafter not ſin any more, but liue vntoo God, that is too ſay, enter intoo a new lyfe and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce acceptable too God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly of Chryſtes buriall.<note place="margin">Of Chryſtes buryall.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Like as Chryſt béeing buryed roſe ageine: ſo wée alſo béeing buryed with Chryſt, (or hauing killed and buryed ſin in our ſelues through Chryſt,) muſt ryſe agein, and yéeld vntoo him the ſeruiceableneſſe of a new life acceptable too God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe arguments grounded vppon the effectualneſſe of baptim, and of Chryſtes death, buryall, and reſurrection, are repeted foure times by Paule with exchaunge of woordes in this Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>As many of vs as are baptiſed in Ieſus Chryſt, are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">Ageinſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines &amp; carnall Goſpellers.</note> too dye with him. Then are wée buryed with him by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim for too dye, that like as Chryſt was raiſed vp from death: ſo wée alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of lyfe. That is to ſay, all that bée borne ageine by baptim through fayth, or all Chriſten folke, are by the merite and operation of Chryſtes death dead and buryed vntoo ſin, or ſet frée from ſin: and by the operation of Chryſtes reſurrection, new ryghtuouſneſſe and lyfe is kindled in them. Therefore like as Chryſt roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geine from Death, and from his graue: So wée alſo hauing deathe killed and buryed in vs by Baptim and Fayth, that leaneth vppon the Death and Reſurrection of Chryſt, muſt walke in newneſſe of lyfe, that is too ſay, in new lyght or knowledge of God, and in new ryghtuouſneſſe and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence acceptable too God.</p>
                  <p>He repeteth the ſame ſentence with exchaunge of woords in the next proceſſe folowing. <hi>For if wee bee graffed in death, or bee made partakers of death like vntoo him, wee shall bee partakers of his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo: knowing this that our old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is crucified with him alſo, that the body of ſin might be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed: that wee shuld no more bee feruaunts vnto ſin,</hi>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:8318:144"/>
                     <hi>for he that is dead, is iuſtifyed from ſinne.</hi> That is too ſay, like as Chryſt hauing bin dead is riſen ageine: So alſo our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture béeing dead in Baptim and by true conuerſion from ſinne vntoo God, and ſet frée from ſinne by the merit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes death, muſt riſe ageine and not ſinne any more, but lead a new life, ſuch a one as pleaſeth God. Our old man, or ſinne ſticking in vs, or our ſinnefull nature, is crucifyed, dead, and buryed with Chryſt, (that is too ſay, is clenſed and ſet frée fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne by the merite and operation of Chryſtes death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection) and is mortifyed by true repentance, perſecution &amp; troubles, that the body of u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nne (or our ſinfull nature) may bée put away, not ſo as it ſhould vtterly periſhe, but that it ſhould no more bée ſubiect too ſinne. For he that is dead too ſinne, is iuſtified or ſet frée from ſinne: or, ſinne which is dead and put away, and buryed with Chriſt, muſt not from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth woorke and bée effectuall any more.</p>
                  <p>The third tyme he repeateth the ſame ſentence in other exchaunge of woordes thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For if wee bee dead with Chryſt, wee beeleue that wee shal liue with him alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the fourth tyme he repeateth euen the ſelfe ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in ſomwhat more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t woords. <hi>Knowing that Chriſt beeing rayſed from death, dyeth no more. Death hath no more power ouer him. For in that he dyed too ſinne, he dyed once, and in that he liueth, he liueth too God. So thinke you alſo your ſelues too bee dead as touching ſinne, but too bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyue vntoo God in Chryſt Ieſu our Lord:</hi> that is too ſay, like as Chryſt hauing died once for our ſinnes and riſen ageine, dyeth no more, but liueth too God: So wée being dead vntoo ſinne, and béeing ſet frée from ſinne through the operation of Chryſtes death, by baptim and fayth: muſt not ſin any more, nor liue in ſubiection too ſinne, but vntoo God in Chriſt Ieſu, who kindleth new life and rightuouſneſſe in vs, and maketh the ſame acceptable and pleaſant vntoo God.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, concerning Chriſten libertie, whiche is a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Chriſten liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> frée from ſinne, from death, from the curſe of the morall Lawe, from the obedience that was too bée performed too the ceremoniall and politike lawes of Moyſes, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mennes traditions out of the caſe of offence giuing. And chriſten li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie is not a looſeneſſe of luſtes and wickedneſſe, or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the obedience that is due too the lawe of God or good manners. But wée are ſet frée from ſin and from the condemnation of the lawe by Chryſt, too this ende, that wée ſhold from hence foorth ſerue rightuouſneſſe, or God and our neyghbour: like as Paule ſayeth héere: Now being ſet frée from ſinne, yée are made the ſeruaunts of God. And Gal. v. Brethren, yée are called too libertie, now ſée that yée turne not your libertie intoo an occaſion of fleſhlyneſſe, but ſerue one another through mutuall louingneſſe. j. Pet. ij. Not as making your libertie a couer of maliciouſeneſſe, but as the ſeruants of God, honor yée all men, loue the brethren, feare God, and honor the King.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of this ſaying which comprehendeth a ſumme of the whole Goſpell. <hi>Eternall lyfe is the gift of God in Chryſt<note place="margin">Eternal lyfe is Gods free gift.</note> Ieſu our Lord.</hi> For like as remiſſion of ſinnes and imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ryghtuouſneſſe, and the holy Ghoſt, are of frée mercie

giuen too the beléeuers for Chryſts ſake: ſo alſo euerlaſting lyfe is not due too any deſertes of our woorkes as a wages, but is the méere gift of GOD, whiche wée obteyne by onely fayth for Chryſtes ſake. Iohn iij. and .vj. Hée that beléeueth in the ſonne hath lyfe euerlaſting. Now, although eternall lyfe bée giuen fréely for Chryſtes ſake: yet is it alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wages of good woorkes, not due by our deſertes, but promiſed of Gods frée mercie. For godlyneſſe hath promiſes of the lyfe preſent and too come. j. Tim. iiij.</p>

dimneſſe, and doutes concerning God and gods promiſes and thretnings, which doutes doo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyme to tyme breke in vpon the mind many euil inclinations, fleſhely careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſelfouer wéening, ſinful flames of affections, &amp; many defauts of ignorance &amp; ouerſight.

Cor. iij. We are tranſformed into the ſame likeneſſe by the ſpirite of the Lord. Secondly he is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the children of adoption witneſſing in our mynds that we are the children of God, and that the euerlaſting father adopting vs for his natural &amp; only begotten ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, loueth vs with a true &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection, and that we are heires of al Gods good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.

Thirdly he kindleth in our mynds fayth &amp; prayer, by means wherof we doo not any more ſhun God through ſlauiſh feare, as though he were an angry iudge, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vnto him as to a kyndeharted father, and in all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils doo (through ſtedfaſt fayth) looke for ſuccor and al good things at his hand. Theſe two benefites of the holy ghoſt dooth Zacharie comprehende in twoo woords in his. xij. chapter. I will poure out the ſpirite of thankſgiuing and prayer vpon the houſe of Dauid.</p>
                  <p>The fourth place is a difference of ſlauiſhe fear, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through<note place="margin">Difference of ſlauiſh feare and childly avve.</note> men that are ſlaues of ſinne and death, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayde at the beholding of Gods wrath and endleſſe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, doo dreadfully ſhunne God, and ſpecially in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble freat at him and hate him as a cruell tormenter, as it appéereth in Saule, Iudas, and innumerable others.

The occaſion wherof is this: It was a cuſtome in ſacrifiſes too burne part of the offering vpon the Altar, and to ſet parte of it too eate before them that beſtowed the offering. Vnto theſe feaſts reſorted certein of the Corinthians that wer conuerted to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chryſt: who vaunting of their lerning and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, reaſoned that Idols were nothing, and that it was laufull too vſe indifferent things as men liſted: and that it is a thing indifferent to eate fleſhe offered too idolles, or not to eate it.</p>

                  <p>NOt by mannes power dooth the preaching of the Goſpel woorke ſaluation too euery one that beléeueth: neyther is true knowledge of God, and rightuouſneſſe and eternall lyfe wrought in the hartes of the héerers by the woord of the Goſpell, for the woorthineſſe and vertues of the miniſters or preachers: but by the woorking of God himſelfe who tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the miniſterie and preaching of his woord kindleth godly thoughts, or the light of the true knowledge of Chryſt which is faith, and quickeneth or tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſformeth our harts and mynds intoo the ſame likeneſſe, that they may bée made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the light and lyfe of GOD. And therefore Paule ſayeth, <hi>Such truſt haue wee through Chryſt to Godward, not that wee are ſufficient of our ſelues too think any thing as of our ſelues, but all our ableneſſe commeth of God:</hi> As though Paule ſhould ſay, Whereas I auouche that you <hi>Corinthians</hi> being conuerted by my preaching, doo beare witneſſe of my faithfulneſſe, and diſproue the ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders of the falſe Apoſtles: I ſay ſo, not truſting too myne owne ſtrength, but onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too God, who wrought mightily by my preaching.

And in eſpeciall the morall Lawe by ſhewing, accuſing, and condemning ſinne, and by reueling Gods diſpleaſure, dooth onely kill and caſt away all men intoo euerlaſting damnation. And therefore it is called the miniſtration of death, as it is ſayd. j. Corinthi. xv. The ſting of death is ſinne, and the power of ſin is the lawe. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> expoundeth this ſaying lernedly and godlily in his booke <hi>Of the ſpirit and the letter, Cap. iiij.</hi> and in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters folowing. And Roma. vij. At the comming of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, ſinne reuiued, and I was dead. But Chryſts Spirite is effectuall by the Goſpell, and lighteneth, and quickeneth mennes hartes, and ſtirreth vp in their myndes, not onely the ſhadowes of outward woorkes, or imitations and geſtures or vayne conceytes and good intentes: but a true and new light, rightuouſneſſe, and lyfe: and alſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and inflameth them with a burning fayth and loue too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes GOD, and other motions conformable too the wil of Chryſt.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Rethren, I will ſpeake after the manner of men. Though it bee but a mannes Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet no man deſpiſeth it, or addeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing thereto, when it is once alowed. To Abraham and his ſeede were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made. He ſayeth not in the ſeedes, as many: but in thy ſeede, as in one, which is Chryſte. This I ſay, that the law which began afterward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond foure hundred and thirtie yeeres, doth not diſanull the teſtament that was confirmed afore of God vnto Chriſtward, to make the promiſe of none effect. For if the inheritaunce come of the lawe, it commeth not then of promiſe. But God gaue it vntoo Abraham by promiſe. VVherefore then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Lawe? The lawe was added bycauſe of tranſgreſsion (till the ſeede came too which the promiſe was made) and it was ordeyned by Aungels in the hande of a Mediatour. A Mediatour is not a mediatour of one But GOD is one. Is the Lawe then ageynſt the promiſe of God? God forbyd. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, if there had bin a Lawe giuen which could haue giuen lyfe: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no dout rightuouſneſſe shold haue come by the law.

But the Scripture concluded all things vnder ſinne, that the promiſe by the fayth of Ieſus Chryſte, should bee giuen too them that beleeue.</p>

                  <p>THe Epiſtle is of thoſe ſort that inſtruct. For the doctrine therof concerneth mannes iuſtification before God.

                  <head>The Arguments wherewith he confirmeth this propoſition are three.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt, <hi>of the weightyneſſe of the woords.</hi> The Teſtament or promiſe of God, is out of all dout, true, certein, vnchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, and too bée vnderſtood ſimply as the woords ſound.</p>
                  <p>Gods Teſtament or promiſe deliuered vntoo Abraham, <hi>In thy ſeede shall all nations bee bliſſed,</hi> affirmeth by expreſſe woords, that <hi>Bliſsing,</hi> that is too wit, remiſſion of ſinnes and euerlaſting ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is giuen, not in <hi>ſeedes</hi> as in many, that is too wit, not partly for Chryſtes ſake and partly for our owne good woorkes: but onely for the one ſéede, whiche is Chryſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a true, certein and vnchaungeable ground, that wée are iuſtified or accepted as rightuouſe before GOD, for Chryſtes ſake onely, by faith onely, and not partly by faith for Chryſtes ſake, and partly for our owne good woorkes.</p>
                  <p>Paule amplifieth the firſt propoſition, by a matter of leſſe likelyhod, or force, thus:</p>
                  <p>If it bée not lawfull too alter the Teſtament or laſt will of a man: much leſſe is it lawfull too alter the Teſtament or will of God.</p>

                  <head>The ſecond argument is of things that hang not togither.</head>
                  <p>FOr yf the inheritaunce come by the law, then is it not by promis, but God grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it to Abraham by promis.</p>
                  <p>This argument may bée included in this Syllogiſme.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Whatſoeuer is giuen by the law as a wages, eyther for our own obedience to the law, or for our own workes and deſertes, is not giuen fréely by the promis taken hold vppon by fayth onely.</item>
                     <item>The heritage of rightuouſneſſe and eternall lyfe, is giuen fréely vnto Abraham by promis.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Ergo</hi> the inheritaunce of rightuouſneſſe and eternall lyfe befalleth not by the law, or is not giuen for our own woorkes or our obedience towardes the law.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This argument dooth Paule amplifye with two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions.<note place="margin">Obiection ageynſt Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by fayth onely.</note> Of which the firſte is this: The Teſtament or promis that was made to Abraham concerning Chriſte, was ratified and approued by God foure hundred &amp;. xxx. yéeres before the publiſhing of the law. <hi>Ergo</hi> after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liueraunce of the law our obedience towards the law, or our good works alſo, muſt néedes mete to iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>To this obiection Paule aunſwereth thus: that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<note place="margin">Aunſwer to the ſayd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> which was ratified before by God through Chriſt or the promis of frée reconcilement, is not made voyde or diſanulled by the lawe, but that it continueth alwayes ſtedfaſt &amp; vnmouable, without putting any thing to it, or taking aught away from it by the publiſhing of the law.</p>
                  <p>Hereuppon riſeth the ſecond obiection. To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe<note place="margin">An other obiection.</note> is the law then? why was it made by God yf it iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie not, ne bée néedfull to ſaluation? Paule aunſwereth: <hi>it was added bycauſe of tranſgreſsion,</hi> that is to ſay, for this cauſe was the law made that it ſhould ſhew, accuſe, and condemne the ſinne that ſticketh in vs, and driue vs too ſeeke the ſéede Chriſt, who was made ſinne for vs, that we
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:8318:165"/>
might bée made the rightuouſneſſe of God in him. Out of this aunſwer is buylded the third argument, of the effects hanging vppon it.</p>
                  <p>If the law coulde deliuer from death, and reſtore lyfe<note place="margin">Anſwer of the ſayd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> and effectuall comfort, then might wée bée iuſtified alſo by the law.</p>
                  <p>But the law can not deliuer men from ſinne &amp; death, and reſtore lyfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo</hi> it is impoſſible for vs too bée iuſtified by the lawe.</p>
                  <p>He proueth the <hi>minor</hi> or ſecond propoſition thus. The law promiſeth or giueth eternal life to all thoſe that yeld perfect obedience without any ſinne.</p>
                  <p>But the ſcripture hath cloſed all things vnder ſinne, that is to ſay, the woord or law of God, conuinceth, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and condemneth all men, that they are defiled with ſinne, and giltie of Gods wrath and endleſſe damnacion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo</hi> the law deliuereth no man from eternall death, neyther can it giue lyfe: but the promiſed rightuouſneſſe and life is giuen fréely through fayth in Ieſus Chriſte, too them that beléeue.</p>
                  <p>This is the diſpoſement of this Epiſtle, in which there appeare chéefly two places of doctrine, which are alſo the cheef places throughout all the Chriſten doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The one is <hi>the glad tydings,</hi> or promis of remiſſion of<note place="margin">The Goſpel.</note> ſinnes, rightuouſneſſe, and lyfe euerlaſting, too bée fréely beſtowed vppon them that beléeue for the onely one ſéede of Abraham our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The other is, <hi>the law</hi> giuen of God, to ſhew, accuſe, and<note place="margin">The Law.</note> condemne ſinne, and to driue men to true repentaunce or ſoryneſſe for theyr ſinnes committed, and the ſéeking of help at the ſonne of God the Mediator ſhewed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</p>

Of this ſpirituall &amp; chéef vſe of Gods law, Paule ſpeaketh in this Epiſtle, &amp; he enlighteneth it with many woords in the Epiſtle to the Rom. the v. vij. &amp;. viij. chapters.

                  <p>The third admoniſhment is of the efficient cauſe or<note place="margin">The Author of the law.</note> the author of the law that is publiſhed. <hi>The law was ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Angelles,</hi> or deliuered by the miniſterie of Angels vpon mount Sinay, as it is ſayd.

                  <p>The promis was ſpoken vntoo Abraham immediatly from God himſelf: but the lawe was vttered by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts the aungels, and that, in the hand of a mediator, which was Moyſes, who in Deut. v. ſayeth thus: I was a meane &amp; went betwixt you &amp; God at that time, &amp; brought you woord what he ſayd: for you were afrayd of the fyre, &amp; went not vp into the mount. Now ſéeing that the people was not able to abyde ſo much as to heare the voyce of the law, &amp; much leſſe the thunder &amp; lightning of Gods wrath darted forth by the law: It is an euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matter that they<note place="margin">The Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the law.</note> are not iuſtified by the lawe: but that they haue neede of the true Mediator (of whom Moyſes was a figure) too go betwéene the two parties, that is to wit betwéene God, who beyng wroth with ſin, beateth mens hartes a péeces with the curſe of the law as it were with a peſtle or with thunder, and men, (who are giltie of ſin &amp; ſubiect to Gods diſpleaſure: to thintent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he participating both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natures of Godhead &amp; manhood, may vndertake Gods diſpleaſure for vs, &amp; by his intreatance &amp; merite ſatiſfie Gods iuſtice, &amp; ſet vs in his good fauour &amp; grace. <hi>For a mediator is not of one,</hi> but goeth betwixt two parties, (namely God &amp; man) that were at debate, whiche debate the law diſcouereth, nouriſheth, encreaſeth &amp; confirmeth by be wraying, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, &amp; conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning ſin. <hi>But God is one,</hi> who of his excéeding great &amp; frée goodneſſe hath made a promis of the ſéede, and ſent his beloued ſon, that he by taking mans nature vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, ſhould take away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> debate, &amp; the curſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, &amp; giue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beléeuers y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bliſſing or rightuouſneſſe &amp; lyfe that

                  <p>Fourthly, Paule anſwereth to this queſtion, whither<note place="margin">The law a leader to the Goſpell.</note> the law ſtriue ageinſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promis of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell, bycauſe wée are iuſtified not by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promis.

For in aſmuch as the holy Ghoſt ſaw, that mankind could hardly bée bent to godlineſſe and vertue, bycauſe it neglecteth the manner of liuing well, and is caried headlong vnto pleaſure: He mingled the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of melody with his precepts of inſtruction: to the intent that with the ſwéetneſſe of the delight, the doctrine of God &amp; profitable thinges might ſlip into mens mindes, according to the cuſtome of wiſe Phiſicians, who ſeaſon the mouth of the cup with a little honny when they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter any ſowre medicine to a ſicke body. For this cauſe therfore was this fine writing of the Pſalmes in méeter deuiſed, that ſuch as are youthfull both in yeares and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, might in theyr owne opinion ſing, and in very déede inſtruct their minds. For there is not any of the frantike ſort, that when he departeth out of the church home to his houſe, doth eaſly beare away with ſinne any Apoſtolicall or Propheticall precepte. But as for the ſayinges of the Pſalmes, they both ſing them at home with delight, and beare them about with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the market, &amp; many beyng ſtarke mad for anger, as ſoone as they beare the tune of Pſalmes that delight them, returne home well at eaſe and quiet in themſelues, &amp; the féerce and heady motions
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:8318:186"/>
of theyr minds are aſſuaged with ſinging. Pſalmes bring calmneſſe to the minde, &amp; alaying the troubleſome waues of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s thoughts, ſettleth quietneſſe in their barts, méeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſturdineſſe of the mind, reſtreyneth headyneſſe, boweth ment to myldeneſſe and ſoberneſie, procureth fréendſhip, ſetteth folkes at one that were at variaunce, and reconcileth enemies. For who wil take him any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for his foe, with whom he hath with one voyce ſpoken vnto God? therefore ſinging of Pſalmes yeeldeth a moſt ſouereyne benefite namely mutuall loue, in yelding har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie as it were a certeine bande to knit mens mindes togither, and the tune of one queere linketh togither the whole Church. Pſalmes chace a way féendes, procure the help of Angels, driue away feares of the nighte, aſſwage the labours of the day, defend infantes, are an ornament too men, giue comfort to old folke, decke women with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Pſalmes are the common voyce of the Church, they beautify the feaſtfull dayes, and they woorke that ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe which is according vnto God: for they are able to wreſt teares euen out of a ſtony harte. To ſing Pſalmes is an Angelike office, a heauenly miniſtracion, and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual perfume.

                  <p>THis Epiſtle is of the kind of caſes that debate matters. For it is an exhortation that they ſhould beware of falſe teachers, and bée ſtedfaſt, and ſet folks at one that are at ods.</p>

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:8318:192"/>
For it is a common ordinarie in this lyfe, that wée the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſort doo followe the examples of our gouernours and teachers: as theſe verſes admoniſh.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth that the beſt manner of inſtructing is, If the Teacher ſhyne before his héerers by his example, and bée ſéene too doo the ſame things himſelfe which he exhorteth other men vntoo. Therefore muſt teachers vſe much more waryneſſe, héede, and diligence in ruling their behauior, than other men muſt, bycauſe the people muſt looke vppon their examples, according as Paule commaundeth heere, that the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſhould bée followers of him, that is too wit, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, fayth, and other vertues: And that they ſhould haue an eye too ſuch as walk ſo, that is too ſay, as liue ſo, teache ſo, beléeue ſo, and profeſſe ſo, namely that wée obteyne remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes and euerlaſting lyfe, onely for Chryſtes paſſion and death, and not for the woorkes of the Lawe and for our owne vertues. But if the teachers eyther ſpred abroade any falſe doctrine, or bée defiled with heynous offences: their hée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are eaſly infected with their opinions and examples. And concerning the faultie behauiour of the teachers, it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſayd ſawe, he that teacheth well, and liueth amiſſe, reacheth foorth with his one hande, and pulleth backe with the other.

                  <p>1 <hi>In talke and doctrine.</hi> For the true doctrine concerning<note place="margin">In doctrine.</note> GOD, is the ground woork of Gods Churche and of euery mannes welfare. Therefore let the teachers take héede, that firſt they themſelues lerne a right, and then teache a right, orderly, properly, and playnly too their héerers, the true and full doctrine of the Goſpell concerning the true knowledge of Gods being and will, concerning the perſone and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of Chriſte, concerning Iuſtification, faith, inuocation,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:8318:193"/>
good woorks, affliction, and all other articles: and alſo that they learnedly and aptly confute the corruptings of them. They muſt not bée dull in lerning the doctrine, and in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming themſelues too an apt and lerned trade in teaching. They muſt not bée ambitiouſe in deuiſing newe opinions and formes of ſpeaking. They muſt not raſhly alter the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed and profitable manner of teaching, but muſt ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that one true and agréeable ſumme of doctrine may bée deliuered ouer too thoſe that come after: like as Paule in this place willeth the <hi>Philippians</hi> too kéepe the doctrine that he had deliuered them concerning iuſtification, as a pattern, and ſo too conuey it ouer to their poſteritie.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And their glorie is in their shame.</hi> Although falſe teachers bée a whyle in glorie and eſtimation among Noble men, and with the common ſorte, yet dooth this reputation turne too their owne ſhame. <hi>VVhiche are worldly mynded,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Our conuerſation is in heauen, or is heauenly.</hi> Firſt he<note place="margin">The difference of the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of the world, and of Chryſt.</note> ſheweth the difference betwene the miniſtration of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and the Lawe, and the ciuill gouernement. The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Moyſes Lawe was partly heauenly or ſpiritual, and partly earthly or ceremoniall, whiche being bound too a certein policie, conſiſted for the moſt part in ceremonies, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifiſes, circumciſion, differences of dayes and meates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. But the miniſtration of the Goſpell is altogither heauenly or ſpirituall, neyther dooth it appoynt any certeine ſtate of gouernement, or kingdome in this mortall lyfe, according too this ſaying, Iohn. xix. My kingdome is not of this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ij. Cor. iij. The Goſpell is the miniſtration of the Spirite, whereby the true knowledge of God, faith, rightuouſneſſe, and eternall lyfe is begonne in the godly, who after this life ſhall liue in heauen as it were in one Citie with God, and enioy his wiſdome and goodneſſe.

                  <p>Secondly, the lyfe or conuerſation of a Chriſtian is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, that is too ſay, it is not employed about earthly things too the atteynement of authoritie, riches, and pleaſures: but too the compaſſing of heauenly benefites, as remiſſion of ſinnes, rightuouſneſſe, and euerlaſting welfare.</p>

For our aunceters of old tyme termed the four Sundayes next before Chriſtmas,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:8318:205"/>
                     <hi>the Sundayes in Aduent.</hi> And their méening was, that their héerers ſhould bée put in remembrance, and prepared too diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their mindes from all other cares &amp; deſires, and with greater care, watchfulneſſe, ſobretie, reuerence, and héedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, too ſettle them ſelues too conſider this woonderfull pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God concerning the redemption of mankynde by the comming of his ſonne in the fleſh. And our forefathers made foure commings of Chriſt. <hi>Firſt</hi> in the fleſh. <hi>Secondly</hi> in the miniſterie. <hi>Thirdly</hi> too his Paſſion, whereof is ſpoken in the goſpel of this day. <hi>And fourthly</hi> too the laſt iudgement, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wée ſhall héere more this day ſeuennight.</p>
                  <p>Therefore too the intent that men might bée ſtirred vp too the more héedfull conſideration of ſo great matters, at this<note place="margin">Take tyme vvhen it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, for tyme vvill avvay.</note> time which goeth next before the comming or birthe of our Sauior Ieſu Chriſt, the Epiſtle that is red this day, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted very fit for the time. For in it Paul making menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tyme alſo, exhorteth all the godly too wake out of their ſléepe and darkneſſe of ſinnes, ignorance of God, and careleſſeneſſe which neglecteth GOD, and letteth looſe the reynes too all miſdéedes and luſtes: and not too let ſlip the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of atteyning eternall ſaluation by the Goſpell: but too lerne the doctrine of it with ſinguler endeuer, watchfulneſſe and héede, and by al meanes too embrace and hold faſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites that are offered in the ſame. For the lyght of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhyneth not at all tymes among the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles:</hi> But ſometymes the blynd and ſorowfull darkneſſe of not knowing the Goſpell, ouerdreepeth the greateſt part of mankynde, as before the comming of Chryſt many hundred yéeres the <hi>Gentyles</hi> were left in ignorance of the Goſpel. Yea and among the <hi>Iewes</hi> alſo the lyght of the true Doctrine was for the more part quenched quite out. And now alſo the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe and vnthankfulneſſe of men is puniſhed with the blindneſſe and outrages of Mahomet &amp; the Pope. Therefore let vs acknowledge the exceeding great benefit of God, that in this our time (when the world is at the laſt caſt) he hath
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:8318:205"/>
kindled agein ſo cléere and notable a lyght of his goſpell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the office and benefites of Chryſt, &amp; our euerlaſting ſaluation. And let vs not like thankleſſe perſons hold ſkorne of gods ſo great gift, but let vs with ſinguler watchfulneſſe, diligence and héede, endeuer too embrace it, hold it faſte and ſpred it abrode. For doutleſſe as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth of another kynd of Doctrine. There came neuer, neither ſhall there come a greater gift. And if the preſent oportunitie bée neglected and deſpyſed, within a whyle after there will folow new darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and confuſions of opinions. Wherefore ſéeing that the lyght of the true Doctrine ſhyneth now among vs, and that the Goſpell of ſaluation is neerer or better knowne too vs, than too our fathers: let vs with all héede and watchfulneſſe kéepe it. For by the Goſpell are ſuch benefites offered vntoo vs, as no other Doctrine is able too giue vs.</p>
                  <p>Admit that Philoſophie bée the guide of lyfe, admit it bée the ſercher of truth, the expulſer of vyce, the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of lawes, and the miſtreſſe of manners and diſcipline, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith: Admit that Eloquence bée the Quéene of al worldly things: Bée it that a <hi>Troian</hi> is comparable too many other. Yet doo all theſe Artes ſerue only for the darke nyght of this mortal lyfe, neyther can they bring true lyght and eternall ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Prophetes red, herd, and thought vppon by vs, God is effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall in vs in déed, teaching vs, comforting vs, and kindling in vs the beginnings of lyfe and glorie euerlaſting.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then in this ſaying, lette vs conſider it too bée Gods excéeding great benefit, that he hath come foorth of his ſecret dwelling place, and vttered himſelfe too vs, and deliuered vs a certeine doctrine concerning him ſelfe compryſed in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And let vs aſſure our ſelues, that in all thoughtes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, Gods being and will, and our owne eternall ſaluation, it behoueth our myndes too bée tyed too theſe wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophetes and Apoſtles, and that wée may not otherwyſe déeme or ſpeake of God and our owne eternall ſaluation, than as he hath appoynted in the woord reueled to vs by his ſonne. Eſai. viij. for a Lawe and a witneſſe: that if they ſpeake not according too this woord, they ſhall not ſée the morning light. And <hi>Hilarius</hi> very diſcréetly ſayeth: Of God is it too bée lerned, what is too bée thought of GOD, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can not otherwyſe bée knowen than by his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.

Now let vs conſider how great is the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mennes myndes, and how foule bée the errours and outrages of the Heathen wandring without this woord and doctrine written by the Prophetes and Apoſtles, of whome ſome dout whither there bée any God at all, others knowe not what and of what manner GOD is, others ſurmyſe an innumerable number of Gods, others eſtraunge the Gods from all medling with worldly matters, others hold opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that mennes ſoules periſh togither with their bodyes, &amp; other ſome that they remayne ſtil alyue. And vniuerſally al of them being vncertein and doutfull of Gods will towards them, and of their owne ſaluation, doo fall eyther intoo Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiſh contempt of God, or elſe intoo perpetuall deſpayre.

or traunces, and iudge of Gods election, not by the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal promiſe writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes reaſon.</p>
                     <p>With moſt thankfull mynde therefore is this excéeding great benefit of God too bée embraced, that he hath deliuered vs the doctrine written, whereby he will haue our faith and all our thoughts concerning him &amp; our own ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ruled. And therfore let vs reade theſe writings diligently and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, let vs bée in hand with them night and day, as Chryſte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth, Serche y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures. And Paule biddeth vs take héed too reading and doctrine. And for this purpoſe chéefly are the firſt traynements of learning in ſchooles, and the whole maner of ſpelling and reading, too bée lerned, that wée may reade and vnderſtande the booke heretofore written too the church by the prophets and Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> let vs conſider that by theſe writings or by this woord of God which wée héere, reade, and think vpon, God in very déed woorketh mightily in vs, &amp; that by this only meane and not otherwiſe, he teacheth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth, draweth, begetteth a new, and ſaueth men, and kindleth in vs the faith whereby wée receyue theſe benefites, as it is playnly ſayd Roman. x. How ſhall they beléeue onleſſe they héere? Howe ſhall they héere without a preacher? Faith is by héering, and héering by the woord of God. Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. j. The Goſpel is the power of God too ſaluation to euery one that beléeueth. Act. xj. Hée ſhal ſpeake woordes too thée by whiche thou ſhalt bée ſaued, thou and all thy houſhold. ij. Cor. v. Wée are meſſangers in ſted of Chriſt, as though God exhorteth or comforteth by vs. And in this place Paule expreſly ſayeth, that wée may haue hope by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Scripture. His méening is, that in all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, baniſhments, diſeaſes, and death, wée ſhould ſéeke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort out of this woorde which is written before tyme for vs, and that wée ſhould by fayth reſt vppon God knowen by the woord, &amp; beléeue this woord written, as well as if wée ſhould héere God declaring his will with his owne lyuely voyce from heauen. Let vs ſet theſe teſtimonies ageinſt Stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>féeld,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:8318:209"/>
who cryeth out that GOD conuerteth, ſanctifyeth, and<note place="margin">The errour of the Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtes.</note> comforteth vs, not by thinking vppon the woorde written, but immediatly by himſelfe without any meanes. Whiche fantaſticall imagination dooth vtterly put away all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyſes of faith and Chriſten inuocation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whereas Paule fayeth that theſe Bookes of<note place="margin">wherfore ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſerueth.</note> holy writ were written before for oure learning, he the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall counſelleth vs too reade the ſame diligently, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and héedfully. For he hath not ſet foorth theſe holy Bookes, for myſe too knibble in bencheholes, or for flyes too ray in the pulpit, or for mothes and bowds too conſume in corners, but for vs too reade, that wée may ſucke wholeſome inſtruction and comfort out of them. Ageine, this ſelfeſayd parcell dooth vs too wit, that all the promiſes of grace, helpe, deliuerance, and of all Gods benefites, and that all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Gods wrath in puniſhing, and of his mercie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing thoſe that bée falne, perteyne too vs alſo, and are alſo too bée applyed too vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> let vs in this ſaying of Paules co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the foure<note place="margin">The vſes or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of holy writ.</note> chéef ends, vſes, or profites and effectes. Of which the firſt is the doctrine of the moſt high matters, vnknowen too ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes reaſon, and perteyning too the eternall ſaluation of vs all, concerning which things, all other bookes written by men can vtterly teache nothing at al that is ſound and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that is to wit, concerning the true knowledge &amp; calling vpon the true God the father, the ſonne, &amp; the holy Ghoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting: concerning the twoo natures in Chriſt: the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things &amp; of Angels and men: of the cauſe of ſinne, miſerie and death vntoo mankynde: of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes and attonement of man with GOD for the ſonne of God our Lord Ieſus Chryſt ſake, who was crucified &amp; roſe agein for vs: of true comfort too bée ſet ageinſt death and all tribulations: of the aboliſhement of ſinne and death: of the reſtorement of our bodyes: of the euerlaſting puniſhments of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vngodly: &amp; of the eternall lyfe and glorie of the godly.
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:8318:210"/>
Of theſe ſo great matters, and ſpecially of the perſone and benefites of our Lord Ieſus Chryſt the ſonne of God, who hath vanquiſhed ſinne, death, and the Diuell for vs, there are none other bookes eyther in heauen or earth, that inſtruct vs.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is <hi>Patience,</hi> a vertue no leſſe neceſſarie too a<note place="margin">Patience.</note> godly and right chriſten man, than meate and drink is néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful too y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mayntenance of the lyfe of this body. For perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aduerſitie are vnſeparable companions of true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe and chriſten profeſſion, according too Paules ſaying: All that will liue godlily in Chryſt, muſt ſuffer perſecution. Otherwyſe, al the whole lyfe of man were nothing elſe but miſerie, as <hi>Euripides</hi> hath truly ſayd, <hi>This life in good ſooth is not lyfe, but miſerie.</hi> Nowe in theſe miſeries there can no calmneſſe and ioy of mynd bée ſettled in God without diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and repyning, nor yet continue without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of fayth, which the holy ſcripture onely ſheweth. And therefore in this place, vntoo <hi>patience</hi> is foorthwith added, <hi>comfort of the Scriptures.</hi> But patience is a vertue whiche in bearing aduerſities quietly and myldly, dooth reuerently ſubmit it ſelfe too Gods will, &amp; ſéeketh not vnlawful helpes, but aſſureth it ſelf by faith too bée in Gods fauoure, ſéeking &amp; looking for helpe, aſſuagement, and deliuerance at Gods hand, and by this faith and hope alayeth the gréef, and féeleth peace and gladneſſe in harte. All the whole orderly ſetting out of the doctrine of patience, and the difference of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical patience and the Chriſten patience, may bée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed hither out of the Expoſition of the ten commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>The third end of holy writ is, true, certeine and firme<note place="margin">True and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt comfort.</note> comfort, too bée ſette not only ageinſt pouertie, ſickneſſe, and aduerſities, but alſo ageinſt Gods wrath, ſinne, and death: which comfort none other bookes beſydes theſe wrytings of the Prophetes and Apoſtles, doo ſhewe. For onely the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth that our Lord Ieſus Chryſt the ſonne of God,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:8318:210"/>
did by his owne death ouercomme our death and the ſting of death whiche is ſinne, and that all the other troubles of this lyfe are not tokens of Gods wrath, but of his fauoure and fatherly good will toowards vs: who doutleſſe is at hand with vs in our troubles, mitigating and taking them away, and at the length will recompence the lightneſſe of affliction which continueth but a whyle, with an énco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable weight of glorie. By theſe comfortes written in Gods woorde, the ſonne of God woorketh mightily in vs: and when we think vppon them and embrace them by fayth, he kindleth in oure hartes peace, ioy, and tranquillitie, quietly reſting in the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindneſſe of God the father.</p>
                     <p>Now the whole doctrine of the Goſpell is in manner no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">The doctrine of Goſpell.</note> elſe but a comfort of the conſcience that is afflicted with gréefe that ryſeth of the feeling of Gods wrath, ſinne, death, and other miſeries: in which none other refuge of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe or hauen of ſauftie can bée ſhewed or found, ſaue the ſonne of God our Lord Ieſus Chryſt, our lyfe and reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on whom who ſoeuer dooth beléeue ſhall not ſée death for euer. Now although mannes reaſon preferreth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of worldly things before the comfort of the ſcriptures, (like as too a néedye or ſicke perſone, mony, or medcines that reſtore health are a more acceptable comfort, than holeſome woordes) yet notwithſtanding it is the peculiar wiſdome of Gods Churche too reſt vppon the woord and fatherly good will of God, and too hang vppon him alone, who is able too helpe aboue al things, and farre more aboundantly than we can eyther requeſt or vnderſtand. And although he ridde vs not out of our troubles out of hand, yet he aſſuageth them, confirming and ſtrengthening the powers of our hart, that they may bée able too endure out the burthen that is layd vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them.</p>
                     <p>The fourth end is, aſſured hope of deliuerance and of lyfe<note place="margin">Aſſured hope of deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> and glorie euerlaſting, without the ioyning of which to the other comfortes, patience it ſelf will bée turned intoo furie,

and at the length the lyfe in deſpayre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hope of lyfe is as it were the Ancor whereby our faith is cheefly vphold and maynteyned in ſo great miſeries and moſt ſorowfull confuſions of mannes lyfe.

any greater or more ſuperiour than an other. For they are altogither not controllers of the doctrine nor Lordes of the church, but Chryſtes Handſeruants (by whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice Chryſte himſelfe worketh) and Stewardes not of their owne propre goods, but of the Goſpell and benifits of Chryſte. Therefore let no man vaunt himſelfe aboue others in the churche, or ſtirre debate and ſtrife, for the authoritie and power of the teacher or miniſter of whom he receiued the doctrine. Let ſuche ſpéeches as theſe are bée baniſhed the Churche and congregation, I holde of Paul, I of Peter, I of Apollo: and let al men eſteeme them ſelues as the members of one Chryſte, and miniſters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall among themſelues.

But the Miniſterie of the Goſpell forbyddeth the inwarde vncleanneſſe of the harte, and the ſynfull affections of the whole nature, and exacteth a full confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of the whole nature too the will of GOD. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the ciuill Magiſtrate hath worldely defences, treaſure, armor, and degrées of perſones and iudgemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and power too make new lawes, and to execute them.

that he executeth his dutie faythfully, &amp; yet iuſtifieth not himſelfe before God for ſo dooing: but thinketh vpon this that all men muſt abyde the iudgement of God, who at the laſt iudgement ſhall iudge, which of the miniſters doo priuately excell others.</p>

<pb n="430" facs="tcp:8318:219"/>
of the booke of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> concerning the incarnation, &amp; recited them in another place. Firſt it behooued him too be man. For like as the impe that is graffed into a trée, is borne by the trée and taketh ſap and life of it: euen ſo our humane nature ſhuld haue vtterly periſhed &amp; bin brought to nothing (like as the body periſheth that is forſaken of the ſoule,) yf the maſſe of our nature were not vphild and mainteyned by the ſonne of God the woorde. Secondly, foraſmuch as man had ſinned, the order of Iuſtice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that man ſhould aby the penaltie.

                  <p>The matter wherof the ſonne of God our Immanuell<note place="margin">The matter whereof Chriſt tooke fleſh.</note> tooke mans nature, is the virgine Marie according as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay interpreting the firſt promis of the ſéede, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of Iacob concerning Siloh, (that is to ſay) the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins iſſue, ſayeth in this place, behold a Virgin ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue and bring forth a Sonne.</p>
                  <p>For in aſmuch as of the mixture of the ſéede of man and woman is engendred a nature defiled with ſinne, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it is ſayde: In ſinne hath my Mother conceyued mee: it was the will of Chriſt our Immanuell, (whom it behooued to be vndefiled and faultleſſe) to bée borne, not of the ſéede of man, but onely of the Virgins ſéede halowed and clenzed by the holy Ghoſt.</p>

Chriſt is called Immanuell (that is to ſay God with vs,) not only for the taking vppon him of our nature, but alſo bycauſe he is our patrone and aduocate, not accuſing and conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning vs any more, but ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding on our ſide, couering, excuſing, and defending vs, embracing vs with brotherly good will, and receyuing vs to the felowſhip of al heauenly good things, according as is ſayd in theſe verſes.</p>

                  <p>The other name which the Angell Gabriell, (interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Ieſus.</note> this place of Eſay) attributeth too Chriſte, is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, which is as much to ſay as a ſauiour or deliuerer.

Thirdly, it ſignifyeth a teacher rayſed vp by God, and endued with ſingular giftes for the ſetting vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geine of Gods doctrine and ſeruice decayed. Such a one was Iohn Baptiſt who purged the Doctrine concerning Chryſt, (which was defaced with the erroures of the Phariſies,) ſharpely rebuked Idolatrous woorſhippings, repaired the Church of God, and with his finger poynted out Chriſt who was then exhibited.

And this is the common dutie of all miniſters, <hi>too prepare the way of the Lord,</hi> that is too ſay, too prepare the hartes of their héerers by their preaching, that they may embrace Chryſt by faith.

Zacharie in the laſt thrée verſes dooth lernedly comprehend both the definition of our ſaluation or iuſtification, and the chéef cauſes and effects thereof, and alſo the meane whereby wée may atteyne to it. Our ſaluation or rightuouſneſſe is the forgiueneſſe of ſins which is beſtowed vppon them that beléeue, through the frée mercie of God, for and by Ieſus Chryſt. The efficient cauſe of our ſaluation is Gods inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſible mercie, who being led of his owne frée goodneſſe, forgiueth vs our ſinnes. The forcing cauſe or the deſert for whiche wée are receyued, is Chryſt the ſonne of rightuouſneſſe that ryſeth from on high. The formall cauſe of our rightuouſneſſe is the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.

                  <p>God created men to the intent he may gather himſelfe<note place="margin">Why God ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth a church and apoynteth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</note> a churche out of mankynde too acknowledge him and ſet foorth his prayſe: and that God ageyne on the other ſyde may communicate himſelfe too thoſe that acknowledge hym. And too the intent hée myght bee knowne, hee hath of his excéeding greate goodneſſe diſcloſed himſelfe to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by deliuering him a certeyn doctrine of the Law and the Goſpell, concerning his ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt whom he hath ſet foorth too bée a mediator and redéemer, too the ende that men being receyued for his ſake, myghte bée endued with godly lyght, wiſedome, ryghtuouſneſſe, and eternall lyfe. For although God could without mean haue conuerted men vntoo him, and coulde garnyſh them with hys lyghte and glorie: yet notwithſtanding, of his woonderfull wiſedom he hath appointed this order, to the intent that men in this lyfe myght thorough the doctrine of the lawe bée ſtirred vp to acknowledge their ſinnes, and too repent them earneſtly for the ſame: and by the Goſpell conceyue Fayth, wherthrough they may in their extréeme gréefes flée vntoo the ſonne of God our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chryſt, who dyed and roſe ageyne for vs, and for his ſake obteyne forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, ryghtuouſneſſe, and the inheritance of euerlaſting life. Wherefore too the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent this doctrine of the lawe and the goſpell, (by whiche only and not any otherwiſe God hath determined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert men vntoo him, and too gather an euerlaſting church too himſelfe) myght bée continually knowne and ſpread abroade among mankynde: GOD of his vnmeaſurable goodneſſe hath ordeyned the miniſterie of publik teaching and preaching his doctrine, and hath appointed certeyne perſons to teache, partely by him ſelfe without meanes,
