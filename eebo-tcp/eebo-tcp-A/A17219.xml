            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue heard oftentimes many godly men great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire some wryting, in the which ther might bréefely be confuted all the chéefe argumentes of the Popishe prelates. For (saide they) there is muche written very copiously and learnedly against them, but all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue not leisure to reade ouer so great and large woorkes: And furthermore, to those which trauell, and by crueltie of the persecuters of oure religion, are forced to read them priuily, these great volumes are to them very incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: bicause they cannot easily be caried about with them, nor thrust or hidde in their bosome. And remembring that a fewe yéeres agone, the reuerend father in God <hi>Iohn Parkhurst,</hi> did often times desire me, that like as <hi>D. Bullinger</hi> my father in lawe (whome for reuerence sake I name) had bréefely set foorthe the
<pb facs="tcp:13562:7"/>
chéefe poyntes of our religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the same by testimonie of holy scripture, intituling it <hi>the Summe of Christian Religion,</hi> so I in like maner shuld gather togither al the arguments which the papists are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to bring out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures against vs &amp; our doctrin. And he encoraged me héerunto, saying: that this labor wold not be so tedious &amp; harde vnto me, as profitable and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vnto many good men. And it would be the lesse laboure for that many of oure countrymen hadde wrytten very largely in the same matter, so as there remained nothing else vnto me, but to bring them into some bréefe order. And as touching the profite héereof, he sayde it mighte well be perceiued, for that héeretofore there was sette foorthe an Enchiridion of common places by <hi>Iohn Eckius,</hi> a very stoute champion on the Popes behalfe, which being studiously and earnestly read of many Papistes, confirmed them in their erroures: and therefore he had no doubte, but if some like booke were set foorthe by vs, many would willingly reade the same, and
<pb facs="tcp:13562:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereby also take greate profite: which thing he sayd mighte well be gathered, bicause that little Bookes, of all those chéefe poyntes mighte very easily be spredde abrode by the Printers, and so be studiously read of all men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, these &amp; many other things which he was wonte moste grauely and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, according to his custome, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse vnto me, did easily persuade me that suche a booke would be very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and acceptable to many, but that I shoulde attempte or enterprise to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin such a worke I cannot yet persuade my self, not for that there wanteth good will bothe to gratifie my friend priuely as also openly to pleasure others, but bicause I stoode in doubt how to finishe the same. But when the yere last past, there was put into Printe a little boke by the Reuerende father Doctor <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Bullinger,</hi> in whiche he Aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to certaine Articles or Questions wherewith the Inquisitors of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ria,</hi> as they say, examine those whiche are suspected in Religion, I thought with my selfe, that the same would not only
<pb facs="tcp:13562:8"/>
satisfie the minds of diuers godly men, but also the speciall requeste of our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Parkhurst,</hi> and therefore haue I turned the same into Latine, that all menne might reade it. For in this booke are all the chéefe argumentes of the Papistes (and especially those with whome they are wont to pose and trouble the minds of the simple and vnlearned) bréefely confuted and answered. And whereas <hi>Phillip Melancthon</hi> of moste woorthy memorie, father of all the learned men that hither vnto haue liued in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, wrote a Boke answering these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Bauaria, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title of his boke doth testifie: yet of. 61. questions he only answered but. 18. peraduenture suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that by the Answeres made vnto those, the rest also might easily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. But <hi>D. Bullinger</hi> hauing regarde to profite the simple and vnlearned, maketh answere orderly, to eche one of these questions: and therfore though he tooke this matter in hand after that great learned man <hi>D. Melancthon,</hi> yet is it profitable: bicause not only <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> did not answer to them all, but
<pb facs="tcp:13562:8"/>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are almost euery where throughe Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie scattred abrode certayne Questions, written or Printed, and that to the ende the professoures of the gospel, and especially such as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are vnlerned, might by them be troubled, broughte into doute, and as it were quite driuen from the gospel, as from a newe, doubtfull, false and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrine. For some of these Questions are so coloured with scriptures, that at the first sight they seme to haue some shew of truth. But they all shute to this marke, that they may thruste in and plant, not the true church of Christ and his doctrine, but the churche of Rome, her doctrine,

manners, statutes, and other abuses. Whereby it comes to passe by the infirmitie of man, and by reason of persecutions, that many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue an euil opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and lothsomnesse of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and that chiefely when they see there is no man to instructe them, strengthen and comforte them. Wherfore when by some I was requested to make some breefe and plaine answere to the said Questions, and somewhat to open the matter, that bothe they might perceiue how to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande those places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as also see that oure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grounded on the Gospell, is not suche as they slaunder it to be, I toke that matter in hande: And applied my diligence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the true religion (as indede it is the duetie of euerye good

Christian) to comfort the godly and suche as were afflicted, and according to the talent giuen me of God (for without his helpe all mans doing is but vayne) I answered the .lxi. questions, for so many came vnto my hands, &amp; therfore whether there be more or lesse in other places I know not. Wherfore I beseeche thee good Christian Reader to take this my trauell in good parte, and follow the Counsell of S. Paule, who byddeth thee to proue all thinges, and to keepe that which is good.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13562:18"/>
that the Disciples of Chryst (who yet neuerthelesse were the church of christ) did erre, and had their falles. For who is ignoraunt what happened to Dauid, Aaron, Peter, and other the holy Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes and Disciples of Chryst? Yea, wée must note, that the Church is gathered not of Angels, but of men. Wherefore although it be inspired and gouerned by the spirite, yet it is not thereby turned into the spirite: for it keepeth still hir fleshe, and the infirmities thereof, yea euen vnto death. Who is ignoraunte of those writings which Sainte Paule hathe generally vttered touching the battell betwéene the fleshe and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and that not in the vngodly and vnbeléeuers onely, whiche are not of the Churche, but euen in the faythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full also, and members of the Church. And this battell is so vehemente and sharpe, that euen thereby the godly are forced, not to doo that good and iuste thyng whyche they knowe, but to doo that which they ought not to doo: Read S. Paules fifth chapter to the <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> &amp; also the seuenth to the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13562:19"/>

Whereby it is euident that euen these most excellent churches of the Apostles haue erred. But there is an other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection brought againste vs oute of the ballades of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and out of the fifth Chapiter of S.

Wherby we may easily gather and perceiue that the churche is cleane throughe the grace of God in <hi>Christ Iesu,</hi> and yet by hir owne nature, and through the manifold infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the flesh, which shée retaineth euen vntill this temporall deathe, shée hathe néede to be washed and purged.

Wherfore the ancient Bishops, which by lawfull election obtained any of those seats, did preache, defend, publishe, and preserue in the church, the Apostolicall doctrine, and that oute of the wrytings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the blessed Apostles. But where is nowe I pray you the Apostolike seate? Where are the bookes and preachings of the Apostles? Where is theyr ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life? What Doctrine teache they, and in what sorte liue they now, which boast of the Apostolike seate? Teache they and gouerne they not contrarily to the Apostles Doctrine? There is no néede to speake muche of it heere, for all men sée it, and knowe it, yea they finde by experience, that they are so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wandered from the Apostles, that if nowe the sayde Apostles and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bishoppes of the primitiue churche, shoulde come amongste them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the pride and pompe which these Prelates vse in their gouernemente, they woulde not onely disalowe them
<pb facs="tcp:13562:24"/>
for theyr successoures, but also accuse them for their ennimies. And Paule truely speaketh very well, of this kinde of succession of Prelates in the. 20. of the Actes of the Apostles: <hi>For I knovve</hi>
                        <note place="margin">What Paul tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth touching the succession of Byshoppes.</note> (sayth he) <hi>that after my departure, ther vvil come amongste you gredy vvolues not sparing the flocke: Moreouer of your ovvne selues shall men arise spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king peruerse things, to dravv disciples after them.</hi> But when Paule spake these things where (I pray you) was there a more holye congregation than his disciples?

Wherfore it is no wonder to hear that at Rome, &amp; other places, there were in times past holy Bishops, in whose pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now, succéedeth most wicked men, corrupte, bothe of doctrine and lyfe.

Wherfore, we say that sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation<note place="margin">There maye be saluation without the Churche of Rome.</note> and remission of sinnes, may very well be had withoute the churche of Rome. For the faithfull which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue Christes woorde, and féele the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of faith and redemption of Christ, and in the meane while beholde what is done in the church of Rome, wherein Heauen, remission of sinnes, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy things are set out to sale, and are bidde to be redéemed with oure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous riches, as by the shamefull mart of their indulgences it appeareth: doe not long abide in suche a churche, nor studie not to be pertakers of these knackes: but flée with a quiet and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full harte, without money, to the onely grace of God, bicause Esaie in hys. 55.

                     </p>
                     <p>And bicause God, héere by Peter, cursseth all those which are not of an vprighte harte, and pronounceth them to haue no parte or fellowshippe wyth Goddes electe, which make marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of his grace and other giftes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongste whome, saluation and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes are the cheefest: And for that the churche of Rome cannot cléere hir selfe of this fault: therfore the faithfull séeke not saluation or remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of sinnes in her, but flée from her vnto Christe our Lorde, and of him by true faithe, they craue saluation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their sinnes.</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Romish church, but procéede from the holy Apostolike doctrine, and haue remained co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, euen vnto this time, God by his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouidence so gouerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that amongst so many lawes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crées and Ceremonies of the church of Rome, yet these chefe principles might be preserued pure, and vntouched. Yea also God so gaue hys grace vnto the godly, that in most extréeme necessitie, and in the very houre of death, they for the moste parte haue despised and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned all the superstitions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13562:34"/>
bishops, and haue wholely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them selues to the grace of god, and to the death of Christe, and haue so remained, euen vnto deathe in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Articles of the Faithe, and making their petitions onely by the Lords prayer. For although in al ages, men haue bene oppressed with the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and superstitions of the Bishops, yet hath God euen in the very houre of deathe, moste mercifully vouchsafed to bestowe his grace, as we may sée by the théefe on the crosse, and therefore he did not reiect them bicause of the vnhappie state of the papacie. Furthermore, in al ages there hathe euer bene some godly men, which neuer liked wel of the citie of Rome, the Pope, their Priestes, nor manner of life: but haue maruellously complained from time to time, of theyr greuous burthens. Yea furthermore in euery age, and chefely in the extréemest tyrannie, and most pride of the Romish churche, God hath euer stirred vp lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which haue instructed the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and preached oute of the woorde of God the true saluation in Christe, and
<pb facs="tcp:13562:35"/>
haue reuealed the Hipocrisie of those which were called the spiritualtie. And althoughe the moste parte of those god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly menne were put to deathe, euen as Christe, the Prophetes, and Apostles did foreshewe, yet their Doctrine hathe continued to the comforte of the electe: so as thereby God hathe in all times, yea euen in the middest of moste wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Papistrie, had his electe. So euen then, as likewise nowe, it happened as it did in the time of Elyas: For when he thoughte him selfe onely to be lefte alone of all the faithfull, and that the churche was quite ouerthrowne: God answered vnto him, saying: <hi>I haue se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen thousand men vvhich neuer bovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">3.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13562:35"/>
infinite number of menne, to whome these troubles should be nothing hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                     <p>But althoughe many of oure fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, did more earnestly cleane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Papisticall Doctrine, than was méete for their saluation to be done, as I haue saide alreadie, bycause there was Prophesied a greate myserable departure from the Faithe: yet héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it followeth not, that the Churche of Rome shoulde be the onely Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Churche, no more than it shoulde followe that the Churche of Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am shoulde be the true Churche of God, bicause the greatest number of the Israelites did a long time cleaue vnto it.</p>
                     <p>Yea euen in this time there were a greate number in Israell, which were not foorth with condemned, bicause the kingdome was wickedly gouerned by Jeroboam.</p>
                     <p>For God hath his electe in all ages, for whose sakes chéefely he sendeth his Prophettes to detecte the erroures, and teache the truthe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13562:36"/>Furthermore we thinke, they may<note place="margin">What is to breede Scis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies.</note> lawfully be counted for Schismatikes and Heretikes, which with a sette pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose followe their owne minde, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them selues wickedly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly from the holy catholike churche of Christe. To separate him selfe, or to be a Schismatike, or to holde an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, we take to be all one thing. For in the Germane tong, an Heretike is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Kaetzer,</hi> deriued from the Hebrew woorde <hi>Kazar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> which signifieth to cutte or to separate. And therfore in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tong we call a torne clothe or fleshe that is cutte into péeces <hi>Zerkaet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeret,</hi> that is seperate, cutte or torne. Wherefore this woorde Schismatike, which is also an Heretike, signifieth an author of Schismes, factions and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes, and not one that defileth hym selfe with lust, contrary to nature, and is to be punished with fire. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe the Germanes doe name him, that defileth him selfe with luste, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature <hi>Katzer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

testifieth, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wer brought before Adam, there was not one found like vnto him, with whom he might haue companie and be coupled: wherfore God framed the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man out of the side of man, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they shuld be ioyned together in marriage, and so to be made one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.

For the Latines interprete this woorde heresie by the name of sectes: and these woords sectes and sectaries are vsually recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in common spéeche. But bycause they are deriued from the Latine tong, many simple people doe not perfectly vnderstande them. These woords <hi>sectes</hi> and <hi>sectaries,</hi> are deriued from the woorde which signifieth to cut: as when an whole péece of wood is hewen or cut into diuers partes: or when those which were first of one minde, doe nowe disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée, and are deuided into sundry opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so as almost euery one hath a seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinion with him selfe: and so these partes being thus separated, are called sectes: euen as amongste the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were sundry sectes, as of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, Stoickes</hi> and <hi>Peripatetickes,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whome eche secte had his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the fathers doe make some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwéene these words <hi>heresie</hi> and <hi>schisme,</hi> of which difference there is no néede héer to speake, sauing only to note that euery schisme is not heresie. For when the Apostles bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> first to preach and builde the churche, that is to say, to bring a peculiare people bothe of the Jewes and Gentiles vnto Christe, and that they might seeke al things in him, their Doctrine was called heresie, as plainly appeareth.

Now the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and ordinances of the fathers are
<pb facs="tcp:13562:43"/>
offered vnto vs for Golde, and as the true Oracles of God. But sithe them selues were men, and might erre, and did also commaunde their ordinaunces and decrées to be no further beléeued, but as they were proued and allowed by the touchestone of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: they ought therefore to be tryed and proued by the same, as Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. <hi>1.

But althoughe there were no place nor licence giuen to the heretickes in the councell at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem to speake, yet it foloweth not, that we ought not to be heard, or ought not to be admitted into a lawfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, (for as touching other Councelles which are vnlawfull, and fosterers of their factions, we doe not passe) bicause we are not Heretickes as they were, which contended againste Paule: but we defende, preserue, and purely teache the Apostolicke doctrine, which Paule proponed in that councel, whereas our aduersaries defend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of Pauls enemies, and by all violence and force, thrust the same vpon men. The summe of Paules doctrine was this: <hi>That sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners<note place="margin">The some of Paules doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine and of his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> vvere iustified before God, by faith in Christ, &amp; not by circumcision or the deedes of the lavv.</hi> Against this doctrine did the enemies of Paul (who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13562:48"/>
were reckened amongste the faithful, and taught the faith in Christ, but yet not sincerely) set them selues, saying, that they ought to be circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cised, to keepe the law, and to be saued by the workes thereof. And that this was the doctrine and iudgemente of bothe the partes, dothe euidently appeare by the xv. chapter of the Actes, and the Epistle to the Galathians. Wherefore sith yée teache the merite of woorkes, and dare to say that iustification is not of faithe only in Christe, but by good woorkes, consider whether we, or yée with your doctrine, come most neare to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and opinion of Paules aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And althoughe they were suche, yet neuerthelesse, they proponed theyr opinion in the Councell at Jerusalem,<note place="margin">Whither He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a counsell.</note> &amp; were heard: for in the. xv. of the Actes it is written, that there was great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation betwéene Paule and Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas. Wherfore if we were Heretickes (as we are not,) yet ought we by right, to be hard in the councel as they were. And bicause the example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, which yée doe vse, sheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
<pb facs="tcp:13562:49"/>
condemned those which taught contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Paule, and we haue already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that yée teach the same, it foloweth that yée also are condemned in them. But if as you suppose, the aduersaryes of Paule had no place in the councell, then yée which agrée with them in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, shall haue no place by your owne iudgement, in a lawfull councell. But if they which consented to Paules do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, were admitted into the councell, and gaue sentence against Paules eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then oughte we by good righte, to set in the councell, and to giue sentence against you. For we teach like doctrine with Paule, touching Christe, fayth in Christe, and of iustification, to wit, that we be iustified by faith in Christe, and not by workes.

But bicause the doctrine &amp; church which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter planted in Judea, is in this our age, neither to be founde in Rome, or at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and they of Rome are rather founde like vnto those, of whom Peter prophesied in the seconde chapter of his seconde Epistle, we therefore by good right ought to depart from that church: And yet doe we not spoile eyther the churche of Peter, or the aunciente do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their due honoure: for we doe followe the true and aunciente Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and churche of Peter, and séeke to haue all controuersies of Religion, iudged by the doctrine of Peter and the other Apostles.

<pb facs="tcp:13562:55"/>
                        <hi>He vvhich dothe sinne, is the seruaunte of sinne.

And vnto faythe he attributeth a certayne effectuall working, bicause that from hir all good works, yea hope and charitie do spring.

And to hope he attributeth stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and pacience, bicause Paul in the eight to the Romanes sayth: <hi>That wee are made safe throughe hope.

Therefore fayth, hope and charitie are distincted vertues, and haue eche their

Agayne these vertues are so coupled togither, and depende so one of an other, that they can not in any wise be hadde seuerally. For who so rightly beléeueth in God and his word, the same also hopeth to receiue the things he looketh for: Lyke as Paule teacheth out of the Prophet Abacuc in the Epistle to the Hebrues cap. 10. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, who so rightly beléeueth in God, loueth him as his chefe and euerlasting good: and loueth man bicause he is the image of God, redéemed by him, as S. John teacheth in his Epistle. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paule to the Hebrues Cap. 11. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth fayth by hope, saying: <hi>Fayth is the substance or grounde of thynges which are hoped for.</hi> And in hys firste Epistle to Timothe he sheweth that charitie springeth from faythe, saying: <hi>Furthermore the end of the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementis, loue from a pure hart, a good conscience, and fayth vnfayned.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like as there is but one sunne, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13562:58"/>
yet he is not alone: so is there but one fayth, and yet is she not alone. But as from the sunne procéedeth two seuerall things, so that thereby three things are in the sunne, that is, the globe or body of the sunne, from whiche procéedeth brightnesse and heate, and these thrée are so ioyned in one sunne, that by no meanes they can be separated, and yet are they three distincted things, hauing eche their seuerall properties. So lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise these three vertues, faythe, hope, and charitie are so knytte togither, that by no meanes they may bée separated, and yet are they seuerally distincted. Wherefore, euen as from the Globe or substaunce of the sunne, as from one spring, lighte and heate doo flowe, so from faythe also, bothe charitie and hope doo spring. And as the body of the sunne is not the lyghte or the heate, so Fayth is neyther Hope nor Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

And that we shall euery one of vs before the iudgement seate of God be conuicted and founde gyltie of sinne and eternall damnation, Paule in the thirde to the Romanes dothe playnely teache. And agayne that iustification is the taking away and remission of our sinnes, the same aptly also teacheth Acts. 13. Wherfore the remission of the sinne, and the punishement or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is called of him iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Rom. 5. And that to be iustified and adopted in the number of the sonnes and heires of God is all one, wée may gather by that Paule saythe: <hi>VVe are iustified by fayth:</hi> and Sainct John sayth, <hi>But as many as beleeued him, he gaue them<note place="margin">why god chose vs to be his sonnes &amp; heirs.</note> power to be made the sonnes of God.</hi> Secondely, wée muste séeke the cause why God forgiueth our sinnes, dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vs from damnation, and adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs into hys sonnes and heyres.
<pb facs="tcp:13562:60"/>
Truely the proper cause hereof is hys mercy and grace, by the which he gaue vnto vs his onely sonne to take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon him, and to suffer death, and shedde his bloud for our sakes, to the ende that béeing deliuered from our sinnes, eternall death and damnation, frée from all accusations, we might be absolued before the iudgement seate of God: yea and that béeing made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by Chryst (for his righteousnesse is made ours) we might be made heires of eternall life. Wherefore it is onely the grace of God, the bloud and death of Chryst, and his innocencie and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, for whose sake we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but are adopted into his sonnes and heires, and are made partakers of eternall life. Of this doctrine there are diuers proofes in Paul, Rom. 3. 4. and. 5. 2. Corinth. 5. Ephesi. 1. Coloss. 1. and. 2. Tim. 2. &amp;c.</p>

All the good giftes of God are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto vs by the holy Ghoste, as the holy Scripture testifieth almoste euery where, and chiefly our Lorde him selfe saythe: <hi>It is the spirit which quickeneth, &amp;c.</hi> And wée receiue all these things by fayth, yea by fayth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by none other thing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may very well bee sayde, that a man is iustified by saythe onely. For Chryste him selfe in the thirde of John teacheth vs, that wée muste bée saued euen after the same manner as the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites were healed of the deadely stinging of the Serpentes. For as they coulde by none other meanes attayne vnto healthe, than by the beholding of the Brasen Serpent hanged vp in the myddest of their Campe: so wée can by none other meanes bée delyuered from euerlasting deathe and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bée preserued in eternall lyfe, than by the beholding of Chryste Crucifyed. And thys beholding of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Chryste is fayth, yea fayth onely.
<pb facs="tcp:13562:61"/>
For as no Woorkes, no Prayers, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings, Almes, Sacrifices, or any thing else, whatsoeuer coulde helpe the styn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Serpente, but onely the beholdyng of the Brasen Serpente, so is there nothing that can saue vs, but Faythe onely. Wherefore Chryst in the sixthe Chapter of Sainct John, saythe: <hi>Veryly veryly I say vnto you, excepte you eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you haue no lyfe in you.</hi> And to eate, the Lorde hym selfe interpreteth it to beléeue. But if there bee anye that desire to knowe more testimonies, by the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che our Justification in Chryste by Faythe onely is proued, then let him reade the thirde and fourthe Chapters of S. Paule to the Romanes, and also the Epistle to the Galathians, where the Apostle in the second Chapter wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus: <hi>Nowe lyue I no longer, but Chryste lyueth in mee. And the lyfe whiche I nowe lyue in the fleshe, I lyue by the faythe of the sonne of God. &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore when wée say, that Fayth only in Chryst iustifieth, we attribute
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13562:61"/>
not Justification to Faythe, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte that it is any woorke of oures, (for Faythe also is the frée gyfte of GOD) but bycause that Faythe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholdeth or regardeth the grace of God in Chryst, and trusteth only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, &amp; in none other thing. And the grace of God in Chryste iustifieth, as wée haue sayde before. Therefore, when wée stryue and contende aboute thys question, <hi>Faythe onely iustifieth,</hi> wée striue for Chrystes cause and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of GOD, that this iustification may bée attributed to none other than Chryste, to the ende wée may haue one onely true ryghteousnesse.

                        <pb facs="tcp:13562:62"/>

                     <p>Secondely, all good Woorkes are wrought of good men. Wherefore it is of necessitie that the trée bee made good, before she bring foorthe good fruite, and therefore the frute maketh not the trée good, but is rather the signe of a good tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore all men may easily knowe, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouse doo not good Woorks, to the ende they mighte thereby bee ryghteouse, but rather bycause they are righteouse: so that nowe those whiche withoute woorks were firste iustified by grace, bring afterwarde foorthe good workes, euen as the good trée beareth good frute.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the works euen of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13562:62"/>
by reason of the infirmitie of mans nature which remayneth with vs, yea vnto death, are neuer so pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that they durst ascribe therby righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse vnto them selues. Wherfore Job sayth, <hi>Althoughe I were iuste, yet would I not make answere, but intreate<note place="margin">Iob. 9. Psal. 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, if any man should be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his workes, then Abraham and the Apostles should be iustified by the works of their faith: but that they were not iustified by workes is manyfestly taughte, Romanes. 4. Galathians. 2. Wherfore iustification is not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to workes, althoughe liuely workes procéede from sayth.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, nothing ought to be done or suffered in the churche of Chryste, that should obseure or darken the death and merites of Chryste, and frée mercy of God: but if we attribute iustification
<pb facs="tcp:13562:63"/>
to our workes, then they blot out bothe the merites and death of Chryste, and the frée mercy of God, as Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. Galath. 2. and. 5. Therefore we must not ascribe iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to works. Sixtly, wee muste keepe faithfully and purely the Apostles doctrine, and that teacheth that wée are not iustified by works, but through faythe in the froe mercies of God, lyke as it appeareth Acts. 15. and in al the Epistles of Paul: wherefore wée muste faythefully and stedfastly cleaue to this doctrine. But yet amongst many testimonies, I will bring onely one, whereby it shall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfestly appeare that this Answere of ours, to this twentith Question, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the wordes of S. Paule, and therefore in the seconde Chapter to the Ephesians he sayth thus: <hi>By grace are<note place="margin">The summe of this doctrine.</note> yee saued throughe Faythe: and that not of your selues, it is the gifte of God, and not of woorkes, leaste any man should boaste.

And truely I thinke, there is no man could speake this more plainly: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is méete that we beléeue this the Apostles doctrine, and that we be not so miserable and wicked menne (as a great numbre are) to affirme that it is a false and heretical opinion, to beléeus that faith iustifieth before God, and not woorkes.</p>

And as touching the miseries of this worlde, they are onely knowen to God, and to his sonne our Lorde Jesus Chryst, and yet without all manner of gréefe and sorrowe vnto them. But the Sainctes knowe not all things which are done euery where through the worlde, nor are not omnipotent to help, neither are they presente in all places, nor knowe the harts of men, for the secret thoughts are secrete, and hydde from them: and where as they say that the Saincts doo beholde and sée all things in God as in a moste brighte and cleare mirror: this is more foolishe than néedeth confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as touching these thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayde, they are onely proper to the maiestie and wisedome of God. And as touching the Sainctes, they enioy all glory moste perfectly of the heauenly lyfe.

And yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we ought to pray one for an other so long as we liue héere. And there is also (as we haue sayde) an other state of the saynctes in heauen: for they doo not all that there, which they did héere on earth. We are expresly commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to pray one for an other in this life. But let them shewe vs one worde or sentence in the holy Scripture, where the Saincts which now liue in heauen, are commaunded to pray for vs: or else shewe where the Apostles did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund vs to pray vnto the Angels and Saincts to make intercession for vs: or let them bring one example where any of the Apostles dyd pray vnto any Angell or Saincte, to make intercession for him.

But nowe, why<note place="margin">How the saynctes are to be worshipped</note> wée doo not attribute and giue vnto them those honors, which the Papists require, that is, to aske &amp; séeke helpe of them in time of trouble, as from our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessors, &amp; sauiors, I wil héere bréefly render the reasons: and further also shew why we so earnestly teache and affirme that god alone ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, called vppon, and serued, &amp; our lord Jesus Chryst to be acknowledged the onely euerlasting mediator and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor before god the father in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13562:79"/>First, we haue a manyfest comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that in all necessities God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is to be prayed vnto, and called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and that he alone is sufficient for vs, and that he bothe can and will giue vnto vs all things necessarie bothe for our bodies and soules: for he him selfe calleth vs vnto him, and promiseth vs all good things, and is displeased so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as wee seeke vnto others, and not vnto him: and therfore when we come vnto him, we greatly delight him, and thereby worshippe him.</p>
                     <p>Secondely, by the examples of all Sainctes, and in the Psalmes also wée are taughte, that God alone in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is to be called vpon, and to be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for those benefites whiche we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, what so euer they be.</p>
                     <p>Thirdely, that common and holy prayer, called the Lordes prayer, can onely be sayde and offered to God the father, and to no maner of creature. Wherefore if we had no other thing but this prayer of our Lorde, yet might wée thereby sufficiently knowe that none other is to be called vppon but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13562:79"/>
God only. Last of all S. Paule saith, he<note place="margin">Rom. 10. We haue neede of an aduocate for vs to God.</note> ought to be called vppon, on whome we doe beléeue: but we doe beléeue in God only: and therfore we ought to call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him only, as he who alone knoweth, is able and will helpe vs. And yet we do not reiecte the intercession of Christ, neither say we, that we haue néede of no intercessor with God. But like as God alone is to be called vpon, so ought we to vse none other intercession, nor any other aduocate or intercessor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, than Christe Jesus onely, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the father hath appoynted him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to this function, &amp; therefore in him he heareth and receiueth oure prayers, as I haue héeretofore sufficiently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Wherfore if we would doe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<note place="margin">The Angels and saynctes send vs from themselues to Christ.</note> seruice to the Sainctes, then should we content oureselues with God, and Christ our sauioure only. For vnto this marke haue the Sainctes alwayes sent all menne, and would not suffer themselues to be worshipped or called vpon. Wherfore, if they suppose y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the saincts did not send men to Christe alone, but to others also, then let them shewe vs

For we can finde no one letter or title of holy Scripture, where any mention is made of these pilgrymages, but most perfectly know that our Lorde hath taught vs not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéeme one place in this earth better than another, nor to gadde hither and thither for the obtaining of grace. For God is present and mercifull whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the faithful haue néede of his grace and call vppon him with a true fayth: Psalm. 107. and. 145. Amos. 5. Jere. 7. 23.
<pb facs="tcp:13562:82"/>
John. 4. 1. Timothe. 2. and many other places. Againe, sithe in the Questions before going, we haue alreadie shewed that the Sainctes sende vs from them selues to God and to his sonne Jesus Christe, it is euidente that they allowe not of these Pilgrimages, and that they are not profitable nor healthfull for those which take them in hand, and therefore we ought not to doe them.</p>
                     <p>Touching the bones and Relikes of<note place="margin">Of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes.</note> Sainctes, there is thrée sortes of them: Either they are their wrytings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining theyr Doctrine: or some partes or menibers of theyr bodyes: Or some exterioure things which they vsed as their garmentes and suche lyke. Their<note place="margin">2.

                     <p>Againe, the bones and bodyes of the Sainctes, are worthy of their honoure, as hauing parte in the Resurrection of the deade, for the which they looke, and were bisides, the houses of that moste

excellent spirite with which they were fulfilled. But euen as the bodyes of the Patriarkes, of Moses, Aaron, Josua, the Kings, Prophetes, and the holy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christe, of John, Stephen, and other the Apostles, were moste honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably buried: So are the bones of the Sainctes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the earthe, vntill the day of iudgemente, and are not to be digged vppe, nor sette to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of the Christians in their churches, as Athanasius hathe taughte in the life of blessed Anthonie.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore if we haue oughte, which we knowe the Sainctes vsed in the time of theyr life, yet oughte we not to woorshippe it: For as the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente Fathers haue taughte vs, suche woorshipping is superstition, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth bothe God and the Saincts, as before it is said: what thing else may be said touching Relickes I héere omitte, bicause theyr deceites are euidently knowne.

thrée heades, or thrée armes more than any other man. Againe, in the stead of Reliques, fonde and foolishe things are offered vnto men to be woorshipped, by meanes wherof the sainctes are rather dishonoured than honoured: yet in this their marchandise they so shamefully behaue themselues, that those whiche haue in them any sparke of honesty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they delighte in Papisticall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, yet are they dyspleased hereat.

Wherfore we iudge that the christians haue néede of churches to be built to the honor of god, &amp; of our lord Jesus Christ, in the which his word ought to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, publike prayers to be made, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes ministred, &amp; almes to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed.

This also wée finde false with them, for that they say the faythfull, who departe out of this life, are tormented in the life to come, quite contrary to the wordes of Chryst: <hi>Verily verily I say vnto you, he that heareth my worde, and beleueth him that sent me, hath eternall life, and shall not come into iudgement, but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from death to life.

And do they thinke that Lazarus,<note place="margin">Where Lazarus vvas that time he vvas dead.</note> Eutiches and Tabitha were in the fire of purgatorie, and after their death suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered prayers? I suppose they dare not affirme it. And therfore they bring vs such examples as serue not their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but are onely to blere the eyes of the simple. But if they say, they were in Purgatory, then I pray you, howe proue they the same. But some of them

affirme &amp; say. If Lazarus were in hell, then could he not be deliuered, for in hell there is no redemption: but if he were in heauen, then had he wrong to be brought agayne to this earth of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie. And héere therfore they conclude, that there muste néedes bée a thirde or midle place.

Secondly I say that their whole argument is false &amp; vaine. Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus (as the scripture there techeth) was Christes frende, and therfore his soulo was receiued into the bosome of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham after his death, like as we may sée in the other Lazarus, of whome Luke speketh. ca. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Truely I thinke that if these men which are called the Spiritualtie, were compelled tobestow so much money for the dead vpon the laypeople, as they for thys matter doo receyue of them, their fire of Purgatorie woulde not burns so hotte, and their prayers would come downe to a lower pryce.

But if it be true which the churche of Rome teacheth, that the substaunce of bread is not in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only the body of Christ, then surely, the Sacrament is no more a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but onely the thing signified.

And Paule saith, <hi>shevv you the Lordes death vntill he come,</hi> to witte, to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore to this Question we Answere: that the naturall body and true bloude of Christe is in heauen, as touching the substance, and that in the supper, or in the bread and wine (which two retaine their propre substaunces) they are Sacramentally or spiritually present, not substancially or bodily. For the bread and wine are the true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or signes of the bodye and bloud of Christe, which being once offered on the Crosse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are now abiding in heauen, and are spiritullay by faithe receiued of vs vnto eternall life.

And these men we hartely beseeche, that they woulde dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently marke those, which thus so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly holde, that the breade it selfe, or that vnder the breade or formes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the very body of Christe is presente,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13562:103"/>
and corporally to be eaten: for after they haue contentiously tossed them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues and others herein, yet at the last they come to this poynt, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse this not to be done so grosly or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, bicause the whole matter is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, Sacramentall and Spirituall. Wherefore if this be true, why then yéeide they not here vnto, and ceasse hencefoorth to bée contentiouse, and to perswade this thing to bée carnally spirituall, and that the substaunce of bread no longer remayneth. &amp;c.

Let the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctrine of Chrystes Churche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, which alwayes beléeued that Chryste had a true naturall body, and that glorified in hys resurrection, yet still remayning a true naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (euen suche as our bodies shall bée at the last day) and that with this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he ascended into heauen, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth, and shall from thence come to iudge bothe the quicke and the dead.

For whylest he was héere on earth the Apostles and others dyd worship him here: and after he ascended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they worshipped him there.

the Apostles were not onely an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Priestes, but also of all other faythfull.

For neither dothe the Priest receiue or doo more than the lay man, sauing onely that when he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth the Sacrament, he executeth the office of a minister, and deliuereth the same vnto others.

And therefore Christe offered vp him selfe, that is to say, gaue him self vnto death, and so became the one and euerlasting Bishop, after the order of Melchisedech as onely Bishop and sacrifice offered to God by him selfe onely. Yea this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13562:116"/>
which he offered, is but one, that is to say once offered, neither can it any more be offered againe. For that hys one sacrifice is hys deathe once made effectuall, that it onely, and for euer, mighte be sufficiente for all ages, for the reconciliation and remission of sinnes. And bicause Christe hathe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for vs, dyed, was buryed, and arose againe from the deade, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heauen, appearing for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer euen vnto the laste daye as one sufficient sacrifice in the sight of God, for the full and perfecte redemption of all the Faithfull, that is sufficient, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther néedeth there any other Sacrifice to be offered in the Churche for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, if there be any that wil offer a Sacrifice for his sinnes, he dothe manifestly héereby declare, that hée dothe not beléeue that his sinnes are forgiuen him by the onely Sacrifice of Christe. For if he stedfastly beléeue, that they are washed away, why then dothe he séeke a newe Sacrifice to be offered?
<pb facs="tcp:13562:117"/>
And therfore it followeth, that the holy church, euen to the ende of the worlde, doth acknowledge none other sacrifice propitiatorie for sinnes, but the deathe and passion of Christe alone. And that which of this only sacrifice of Christe I haue hither vnto spoken, is most truely and manifestly confirmed by the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t testimony of holy scripture, as Leui. 16. Zach. 3. Hebr. 5. 7. 8. 9. and 10. chapters.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to the Lords supper,<note place="margin">In the Lordes supper ther is onely a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his only sacrifice.</note> it is not in that respecte that we do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister it a propitiatorie Sacrifice, that by the doing and celebrating of it, we should be deliuered from sinne. For the deathe and sacrifice of Christe vpon the crosse (if we haue faithe) hathe deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and purged vs from oure sinnes. Neyther is Christe in his supper cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againe, or his body offered in the same againe, for why, no Priest is able to offer it: but there is onely celebrated a remembraunce of his Sacrifice once perfected, and that not by the Priest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but by the whole churche. For so our sauioure Christ commaunded, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Doc this in the remembraunce of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13562:117"/>
me,</hi> wherefore S. Augustine (very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with the holy scripture) wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againste the <hi>Manachees,</hi> saying: <hi>That before the comming of Christe, the Sacrifice of his body and bloud vvas promised by the figured sacrifices of the olde Testamente: but by his comming and passion it is finished: and that after his ascention, the remembrance thereof is celebrated.</hi> Wherefore the opinion of those which say that the body and bloud of Christe is offered in the Masse for the quicke and the deade vnto the ende of the worlde, can in no wise be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by any testimonies of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And to passe ouer, that the deade haue already receiued their iudgement, as it is already saide in the thirtie foure and thirtie fiue Questions: they besides can not any more be made partakers of the Lords supper: for the Lord saith, <hi>Take and eate,</hi> which thing the deade can not doe. But in that they say the priest eateth for the deade, they doe it contrary to the commaundemente of Christe. To conclude, the supper of the Lorde is onely the remembrance of the
<pb facs="tcp:13562:118"/>
sacrifice of Christ once finished, and not the sacrifice it selfe, and that done only by those which héere doe liue. The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praise and thanks giuing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth<note place="margin">The sacrifice of praise &amp; thanks giuing.</note> first the praise and thankes which they offer to God by a pure faith for all his benefites bestowed on them. And bicause in the Lordes Supper, we chéefely make a remembrance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes death, and our redemption, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore praise God, and geue thankes vnto him, the fathers haue called the same supper a sacrifice: and we also doe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly acknowledge that this sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this sorte, is an acceptable Sacrifice vnto God: and yet not bicause the priest offereth the body and bloud, or prayers for to merite or gaine thereby, but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the whole congregation in theyr prayers offer vnto God praise &amp; thanks geuing for the benefite of Christes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which once offered vp him selfe vppon the crosse.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13562:119"/>
the doctrine of repentaunce is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie<note place="margin">What repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is.</note> and profitable for all Chrysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And this worde <hi>Repentaunce</hi> sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to come of this worde repayring: as when torne, broken, or things rente, are renued and repaired. The Hebrues call repentaunce returning or conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to God. But he which is returned to God, ought first necessarily to know and vnderstande how he fell from him, and to knowe what God is, howe wée fall from him, and howe wée oughte to turne to him agayne. So that he which must repente, ought to know his owne naughtinesse and wickednesse, and also by what meanes the same may bée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended whiche is broken or spoyled. And these things can in no wyse be don of any wretched sinner, onlesse they be drawen herevnto, and therin instructed by the spirite and worde of God, which they must also most stedfastly beléeue. For these things are so necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that onlesse GOD by grace through his spirite open and drawe the heart of the sinner, and by his worde shewe vs the perfect way, gouerne and
<pb facs="tcp:13562:120"/>

Let Judas bée an example héereof, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting for hys sinnes, confessed the same to the Priestes in the Temple, saying: <hi>I haue betrayed the innocente bloud.</hi> Yea and he in this part made sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he threw the vnrighteous price of bloud into the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. But what did this repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance profite him, although it had in it contrition, confession, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction? they holpe him nothing at all: and bicause he lacked true fayth, he dispaired, and hong him selfe. On the other side, the Lorde looking backe vpon Peter, and the Cocke crowing, he remembred the words of the Lord, and beléeuing them departed from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked company, wept for his sinnes, and amended his faults: and this his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was a true and perfecte repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce. And Jeremie the Prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth this doctrine, who in his. 31. chapter prayeth to the Lorde, saying:

therof, as <hi>how, when, who, with whom, how often, and wherfore he hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> is but in vayne, and without all sufficient proofe called the Sacrament of confession. For God alone, as wée haue before shewed, dyd institute the Sacraments, but he ordeyned not this confession to be any of them, neither did he commaunde it as necessarie to our saluation. For the holye Scripture teacheth an other maner of profitable and necessarie kinde of confession, and byddeth vs to confesse our sinnes with a true fayth from our hearts méekely vnto God. For God it is alone whome wée haue offended, who knoweth our hearts, déedes, and determinations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth or punisheth sinnes, and hathe giuen his sonne vnto vs, an high Priest and one eternall sacrifice. Therefore muste wée come to GOD the father through Chryst, and that with the same wordes which he hathe giuen vs, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs to confesse our sinnes, saying: <hi>Forgiue vs our trespasses, as we forgyue them that trespasse agaynst vs.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this sorte may all the faythfull in

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13562:122"/>
our Lorde, haue obteyned full remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the same, and so is there no néede to vse the Auricular confession of the Romishe Churche. Furthermore there<note place="margin">The confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to our neyghboure.</note> is an other kynde of confession com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by our Lorde to all the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to wyt, that euery man should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse eche one to other his faults and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences wherein he hath offended &amp; iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his neighbour, and that ech man doo hartily forgiue euery offence &amp; iniury which he hath suffred, and forgiue hym also which hath don the same, and pray for him. And the Lordes prayer dothe prescribe vnto vs this kinde of confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for we say: <hi>As we forgiue them that trespasse agaynst vs.</hi> And of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is it that Saincte James spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his fifthe Chapter, and not of that which is done vnto the Priestes.<note place="margin">Against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession made to the priest.</note> Furthermore, there is not one worde in the whole Scripture of God spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of any other confession than thys, and therefore their Auricular confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto the Priest is without all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Scripture. Furthermore, the blessed Apostles dydde neuer gyue
<pb facs="tcp:13562:123"/>
them selues to the hearing of confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither gaue them absolution, whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering in the eares of them that were confessed. For the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is that ioyfull tydings, wherin the captiues, and suche as are adiudged to death, are declared to bee made free and delyuered from the falte &amp; the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for the same, and are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into fauour, and into the number of Gods children, and that by the death of Chryste Jesus, as Chryste him selfe teacheth out of Esai the Prophet ca. 61, at Nazareth, as appeareth in Luke. 4. And Paul confirmeth the same. 2. Cor. 5. Wherefore that which the aduersaries obiect, saying: that the priest knoweth not the state or condition of the sinne, excepte the same be opened to him, and therfore knoweth not what to forgiue, or what to leaue vnforgiuen, hathe no maner of ground of truthe. Wherfore if the Priest doo remitte or retayne any sinnes, it behoueth that those be disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and opened to him. But the wordes of Chryst touching the remitting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of sinnes, appertayneth to the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13562:123"/>
preaching of the Gospell, and to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, &amp; not to the priuate power of the Priest, whereof I will speake hereafter. Likewise when Chryst bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Leper shewe him selfe to the Prieste, he commaundeth him not to confesse him selfe vnto him, but that he should offer him selfe to be tryed by the Priest, and so offer his sacrifice. For the iudging or trying of Leprosie appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Priest. Leuit. 13. and. 14. But in that they say, Leprosie did signifye sinne: we answere, that touching spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things and sinne, the Priests and sacrifices were figures of Chryste, and therefore are they to bée sente vnto Chryste, to whome also that Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ane came when he was healed, and not to any Priest. So also we trust that Chryst will delyuer and saue vs, if wée beléeue in him, and to him we confesse our selues, although we come not to the Priest. The auncient Churches, before the birthe of Chryste, and a long tyme after his comming, were altogither ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the confession and absolution of the Priest: and after it began to bée
<pb facs="tcp:13562:124"/>
receiued, yet was there no commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for the same, as appeareth <hi>De pemtent. Distinct. 1.</hi> But in the counsell of <hi>Lataran</hi> vnder <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third Pope, it was commaunded in the yere of our Lorde. 1215. And I will not héere tell howe gréeuously the consciences of the godly were by this Romishe and Papisticall confession troubled, and howe they learned more euill thereby than good, and howe horrible and fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie factes were in this confession com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and howe the same serued to vpholde the power, pryde, errours, and disceiptes of that vnspirituall spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie, as they call them selues. But it is no small fortresse or foundation of their kingdome, and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell thoughe they so earnestly and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely labour to defende and kéepe the same.

And this is confirmed by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sai. 53. the writings of the Euangelists and Apostles, and chiefly of Paul to the Romanes the thirde and fifth chapters, and 1. Cor. 1. &amp;c. If therefore by our workes and penaunce which we suffer, that is to say, if we attribute to our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which consisteth in the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our body, fasting, prayer, almes &amp; other such like workes, the remission of our sinnes, &amp; the punishment due there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or if wée suppose that by this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction we satisfie and requite all those things, for the which we were gilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, then truely this satisfaction is directly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, and striueth agaynst the satisfaction of Chryst.

<pb facs="tcp:13562:127"/>
For our Lord promised them to Peter<note place="margin">The kayes of the kingdome of heauen.</note> and to the rest of the Apostles, Math. 16. with these words: <hi>I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt lose in earth shal be losed in heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt binde on earth shal be bound in heauen:</hi> the same he gaue to all the Disciples. John. 20. saying: <hi>Euen as my father sent me, so sende I you: who soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sinnes you shall remitte, they shall be forgiuen, and whose sinnes you shall retayne, they shall be retayned.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Of binding and loosing.</note> to lose, is to forgiue sinnes: and to binde, is not to forgiue or to retayne sinnes. But bycause no man can remit or forgiue sinnes but God onely, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ministers of God by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement preaching the Gospel, doo declare that god forgiueth their sinnes, and remitteth all punishmente, if they beléeue in Chryst: and that on the other side their sinne remayneth, and that they shall bée punyshed for the same if they beléeue not in Chryst: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this cause dothe the Scripture say, that the Minister doth bind or lose,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13562:127"/>
forgiue or retaine sinnes. And as the minister doth truly preach this, so doth it vndoutedly come to passe both on the faithfull and vnfaithfull. For God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heauen, performeth that which his ministers héere doe promisse on the earthe. By this we may easily gather, that the keyes are nothing else but the preaching of the gospel, and not a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liare iurisdiction or power, as oure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries reache. For euen as a maister of some house, giueth his keyes vnto his seruaunt, to open and shut the house, to let men bothe in &amp; out. So is the church the house of God, in the which who so euer abideth, is an inheritor of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, &amp; those which through infidelitie, are not in the churche, haue no portion in the kingdome of heauen, but are euen as it were in hell: and the ministers receiued the keyes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen from Christe, that is to say, the preaching of the Gospell, that therby they might open &amp; shut. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they open, when they teache true faithe, promisse eternall life, and exhort all men to come vnto Christe, that they

may be saued. And they shutte vp the kingdome of heauen, when they threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eternall damnation against the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beléeuers, wicked men, and suche as do not repente, testifying vnto them, that they are excluded from the kingdome<note place="margin">1.

But the power or effecte to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme, appertaineth onely vnto the Lorde, like as Paule compareth the ministers of the Churche to husbande men, saying: <hi>Neither is he that plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any thing, neither he vvhich vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth: but God vvhich giueth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.

Wherefore, some of the Fathers haue vsed in this case a certaine distinction, saying: that Christe gouerneth in the Churche by his owne proper power, and the ministers as seruauntes onely.</p>

And therfore they are in déede but vaine woordes and no works amongste our vnspirituall spiritualtie, as the whole world knoweth, proueth, and is forced to confesse. For what cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, pouertie, or obedience is in these
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13562:133"/>
dayes in their religious houses and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries? Truely all filthinesse of lutt, whoredome, gluttonie, drunkennesse, and all impudencie, is bothe secrete and manifestly vsed and séene in them for the moste parte. Those which are poore and néedie in this worlde, leauing the same, and entring into these religious houses, are in them made so riche and mighty, that oftentimes they gouerne in the world, and féele no wante of any thing. Yea, whilest they obey their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Lordes, they doe disobey the lawes of God, the Magistrates institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of god, yea, &amp; oftentimes theyr natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral parents. And what may the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full say of these? Or wherein may they praise them, hauing God and his woord to warrante the same? Why then doe they obiecte againste vs, Uowes, and the obseruing thereof? Let them rather shewe vs, that God hathe commaunded these, and that these, which they nowe a dayes do, are acceptable vnto him. For which of the Prophetes or Apostles, at any time made any suche Uowe? And againe, if their Uowes be so good and
<pb facs="tcp:13562:134"/>
holy, why then kéepe they them not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, sith they so straightly vrge them on others? But let vs sée what they do, or what they kéepe, or what they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to kéepe. For if they vowe chastitie, there is none other chastitie but of the body and minde, who so therefore hath not this, may marrie, and the same is also called chastitie. Therefore, if they will obserue chastitie, they must either liue chastly in a single life, or else mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and so liue from whoredome, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, &amp; gluttonie. But if they haue vowed pouertie, and woulde kéepe the same, then let them leaue their mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries and princely palaces, their fatte tithes and yerely rents, let them be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led no more Lordes, and lette them not be called poore in name, but be so in déede. But if they Uowe obedience, and will perfourme the same, let them obey God, the lawfull magistrate, their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, and the holy lawes of God, then truely shall they not long abide in these places, and this kinde of life, in which notwithstanding they séeke nowe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, and that by force, neyther woulde
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13562:134"/>
they do that, which is so directly against theyr Uowes.</p>
                     <p>The sentence whereof they séeme to<note place="margin">Al vowes are not acceptable to god neyther yet to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed.</note> make mention in their Question, is wrytten in the fifth Chapter of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes, thus: <hi>If thou haste vovved any thing vnto God, bee not slacke to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme the same. For a foolishe and an vnfaithfull promisse displeaseth him: euen bicause hee hathe no delite in the vnvvise. And it is muche better not to vovve, than after thy vovve not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme.</hi> Therefore this place whiche oure aduersaries doe vse in this theyr question, doth rather make for vs, than agaynste vs. For Uowes whiche are grounded on Goddes woorde, and are in oure power to be done, vnto the glorye of God, the profitte of others, and oure owne saluation, are not foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe Uowes: But what so euer are not after this sorte, are foolishe, as those are whereof we haue spoken before, being grounded vppon mannes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and tradition: and therfore not acceptable to God.</p>
                     <p>And not being acceptable vnto him,
<pb facs="tcp:13562:135"/>
he will not haue vs to take them in hande. And therefore by this it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that in foolishe Uowes we doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and therfore ought not to procéede in the same, least that we double oure offence. For who so sweareth vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, offendeth, bicause he did it vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly, but if he perfourme the euill which he promised by his vnaduised othe, then is his offence thereby made the greater: like as Herode who not only rashely sware to Herodias, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so performed his othe by the killing of John.</p>
                     <p>One maketh a foolishe Uowe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, or pouertie, but within a whyle after perceyueth him selfe not able to kéepe them, yea that it is a cause of whooredome, lustes, and manye other sinnes: but he dothe well and godly, if he kéepe not that foolishe Uowe: that is, to saye, if he cut off those causes of sinne. And so the Fathers teache, saying: <hi>In euill promisses, breake thy promisse. And that vvhich thou haste vnaduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vovved, doe it not. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

For the iuste God is a reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of all lying and wicked men, that kéepe no promise wyth God or man.

<pb facs="tcp:13562:142"/>
in our age is vsed in the Romish church to the sicke, of whose life we stande in doubte.</p>
                     <p>For in the primitiue Churche, the<note place="margin">Actes. 8. 10. 19.</note> Apostles and their successoures did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynte the sicke with Oyle, and by that meanes they were restored to healthe. And it was a certaine peculiare gifte of God, and done as it were miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for euen as in the primatiue church, was the peculiare gifte of healing, so also was there the gifte of tonges. For the Apostles laide their handes on the sicke, and they receiued health, &amp; spake with diuers tonges. But as the gifte of tonges is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eaffed in the Churche, so also is that of healing by the annoynting with Oyle: and therefore the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of imposition of handes, and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with Oyle, ceaseth. All men know that in the primitiue Churche there were diuers things necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as the gift of healing, and of tongs, with other miracles, which wer signes for the vnbeléeuers, and were done to confirme the religion: but nowe, when by the preaching of the Gospell, faithe,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13562:142"/>
and the religion is published and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, the others haue ceased, and are quite out of vse.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the annoynting vsed in the Churche of Rome, is not by this confirmed that S. James and Marke doe speake of annoynting, for their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting did muche differre from this, and was neuer instituted by Christe or hys Apostles, but deuised by men, and that a long time after.</p>
                     <p>The Apostles vsed to annoynt with Oyle, to the ende they mighte restore suche to health: but the Papistes neuer annoynte any, vntill they be paste hope of all recouerie, neyther vse they this theyr enoyling for the healthe of his bodye, but for the remission of sinnes. Yea, and in this their enoyling they pray vnto diuers Sainctes, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued long since the Apostles time, and diuers suche other Ceremonyes they vse which were neuer knowne to the Apostles, and therefore sufficientlye proue that this their enoyling was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ordained by the Apostles.</p>
                     <p>And what shall I say of that, which
<pb facs="tcp:13562:143"/>
they vse to speake in this their enoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when they say: <hi>In the name of the father, the sonne, and the holy ghoste, I annoynt thee vvith this holy oyle, that thereby thou maiste receiue remission of al thy sinnes?</hi> What ground or forme of institution of this haue yée in all the holy scriptures of Christe, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels? The Apostles taught that ful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes was to be soughte in the bloude of Christe, and not in Oyle. And therefore euen by this one pointe it may euidently appeare to the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that for good consideration we vse not this Ceremonie.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, when wée beléeue that one baptisme which we haue once receiued, wherein we were once Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with water, in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and of the holye Ghoste, is effectuall by the operation of the holy Ghoste, euen all oure life long vnto death, we thinke it not néede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be againe at the pointe of deathe rebaptized of a Baptisme deuised by man: for they call this their annointing the laste Baptisme.

the ciuil power which the Bishops and gouernors of the Churche exercise, hath no grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or authoritie in the word of god, neither hath Chryst at any time commaunded them to vse bothe the swordes.

very true and auucient fayth. On the other side wée are taughte, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion of the Churche of Rome that now is, is not onely a new doctrine, but also deuised by men, and ratified by the Counsels and Decrées of men (with whom Chryst sayth, that he is worshipped in vayne.) Our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and religion giueth all glory to God, and séeketh saluation in Chryste onely. And bycause we haue all fulnesse in him, wée haue no respecte vnto the creatures. And him wée serue not with outwarde pompe and shewes, but in spirite and truth, in prayer and thanks giuing, in righteousnesse, charitie, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, fayth and mercy. And euen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense teacheth all men, that the true seruice of God consisteth in these things, whereas on the other parte all men crye out agaynst the vncertayne doctrine of the Romish Clergie, béeing confirmed by no good authority, yet they cry out agaynst their filthy lyfe, their intollerable oppressions, pride, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.

And therfore we ought not to take any thought for our goodes, frends, body, or life. For we haue great promisses of grace, helpe, and rewarde from God, if we abide stedfast vnto the ende. On the other part our aduersaries are dreadfully threatned, and shall in time fele the same, &amp; that without dout.
