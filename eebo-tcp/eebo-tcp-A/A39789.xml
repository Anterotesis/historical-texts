         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ch is that wonderful and moſt
comely Chain of Beings, which
winds up into <hi>World,</hi> that if
the ſmall and lowermoſt things therein
make ſhift to ſhow themſelves, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
by the leave, or with the help of
the Bigger and the Higher. That rotten
wood may give its glimmerings, the Sun
muſt take away its light: And if the
Flowers will needs be riſing out of their
colder beds, or the Fryes of Wrigglers
and ſwarms of Quicklings or Inſects, peep
out of their Graves and Dungeons, they
<pb facs="tcp:101488:3"/>
muſt wait upon the Sun to bring about
thoſe beams of his that make the Spring;
whence they may have their Priſon doors
unlockt, their fetters taken off, and be
tickled into ſuch a laughing briskneſs,
and judged up into ſuch a smirkiſh liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as may laſt as long as the Summers
warmth holds on to cocker them, and the
days heat to frigge and chafe them. Now
I reckon that I muſt bethink my ſelf in
this Addreſs, how far I am taken in here,
and be well aware how <hi>Woodbridge</hi>
ſtands ſo near to <hi>Grundsborough Hall,</hi>
that if ſuch an <hi>underly Shrub</hi> in <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
and <hi>unthrifty Sucker</hi> in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
as I am, ſhall ſtrive to put forth
this Spring time here, I can do no leſs
than ask the good liking of ſuch a <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Cedar,</hi> under whoſe ſhade I muſt
needs creep up, befann'd from next
Dogs-day ſcorchings, and within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
of whoſe ſhrowdings I muſt be cloakt
from wind and weather. Nor ſhould I
ever aim to blow up any Fire-light of
<pb facs="tcp:101488:3"/>
uſeful Knowlege in this place, were it
not that you have thought meet to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
thoſe Sun-like beams of yours,
that would ſoon bedim its fainter twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and ſhine out all its dying glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Indeed you have purchaſed ſo fair
a Lordſhip of Knowledge in theſe Parts,
that I fear I ſhould wrong your Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and encroach upon your Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
if I ſhould put in any Claims but
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder ones, or own any other Hamlet ſo
near you, but what is a limb of your
Townſhip. Nor is it but meet that I ſhould
hold all my Natural knowledge of your
Mannor, and become Tenant to ſo good
a Landlord in Philoſophy. So that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this acknowledgment, ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but doing my bounden Homage,
and bringing in my Lady Rent-charge;
while the Lord of the Soyl holds nextly
of the King, and does his <hi>devoir</hi> in a
<hi>Regi Sacrum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus however it may be thought by
others, I have miſcarried in the Thing I
<pb facs="tcp:101488:4"/>
treat of; I am ſure I have not miſtook
the Man I addreſs to. And though it
may ſeem but a wooden come off, and
like that of the ſorry numb-skull'd
<hi>Ruſſes,</hi> who when they are pincht with
a hardneſs beyond the learning of Horn-book,
are wont to anſwer, that God and
the <hi>Great Duke</hi> knows all things: Yet
I being bound ſo far by the laws of
Mine and Thine as I have been free
in acknowledging it; muſt ſpring as much
from a rightful mind in me, to deal out
to the Greater Owner his Greater Share,
as it does from a ſhotten brain in any of
them, to tell another, I know not who
can anſwer I know not what.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, if I ever felt my ſelf at all,
'tis in my breaſt to woo <hi>Dame Kind</hi>
with as buſie a warmth and hearty
earneſtneſs as any man; but 'tis not in
my Cheſt to endow her with that <hi>Fulneſs</hi>
that he can, whoſe mind is as Great and
Wealthy as his Love can be ſtrong and
flaming, and whoſe endowments have
<pb facs="tcp:101488:4"/>
made him to be as much ſtared at by the
Yeomen, as indeared to men of skill and
breeding. And I cannot think I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook
my ſelf in Courtſhip, while I waited
upon the youngeſt and moſt Houſewifely
Daughter of Philoſophy, named Workful,
ſo long as I hapned of ſuch a Rival in
the Parlor with her. I do believe, Sir,
that your ſelf as well as I, had ſo much
rather be a Well-willer to a Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer,
than a Philoſopher taking name
from <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Phyſicks, by how much
the more 'tis behoving Mankind, to have
houſes on the earth for ſettled and eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
dwelling, than ſuch capering Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
in the Air, whoſe Groundſils are
laid with Whims, their Overwayes with
Dreams, and rooft with Cream of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I muſt needs ſay, that I do think
my ſelf ſo much more better'd by a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
Tranſaction</hi> of a Moneth, or
<hi>Journal des Scavans</hi> of a Fortnight,
than by a <hi>Mercury Gallant</hi> of half a
Year, by how much the more I like my
<pb facs="tcp:101488:5"/>
ſelf, when I am kindly and ſteadily
knowing, above what I do, when I feel
that I am Gay and Towring. And I
think our <hi>Royal Society</hi> at <hi>London</hi> is
as much before that <hi>Des belles Lettres</hi>
at <hi>Paris,</hi> as the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of that Body of
Worthies outſtrips the <hi>Academy of
Complements.</hi> In that narrow Chat
that I have had with Outlanders, it
has been hugely to my liking, that hard
upon the firſt greeting, I have been plyed
with ſo many good words for our <hi>R. S.</hi> in
the whole, and Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> alone. Nor
can I find, that either your ſelf, or I, or
any man elſe, that has kenn'd the drift
and bounds of that undertaking, have
made leſs reckonings of their growing
worth and works already known, or
abated our hopes for time to come; for
all the <hi>Tee hees</hi> that have been broke by
Men of Droll, or dirt that has been
thrown from Daring ſpight. And it
goes a great way with me, to mark, that
the ſame-kidneyed men, who have either
<pb facs="tcp:101488:5"/>
a ſharp flowt at the end of their tongue,
or a bitter hate in the middle of their
heart, for the <hi>wary Experimenter,</hi> have
another of the ſame in their Budget, for
the <hi>Book</hi> that is named from its Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or indeed for any thing elſe, but
what is fleſh on the one ſide, and air on
the other. Nor can any man gheſs it
ſhould be otherwiſe, but that he who had
a ſneer or grudge for the Book of Gods
Works; the Print that he has given us
of his Almighty Power and houndleſs
leſs Wiſdom: ſhould have no leſs for that
other of his Word; the likeneſs he has
drawn for us of his truth and holineſs.</p>
            <p>Whence I have ſomewhat the more
wondred how it could ever get into the
heads or hearts of Men of inſight or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
that a right knowledge of the
Works which God has done, ſhould lead
from the knowledge of, or leſſen the love
for, that boundleſs Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
who brought thoſe things about.
As if <hi>ſhewing the Coats and garments
<pb facs="tcp:101488:6"/>
which</hi> Dorcas <hi>made,</hi> before the holy
Mourners, had been to wheadle off their
thoughts from the Work-woman to the
Works, and drown their ſorrows for the
jewel that was loſt, in the floudings of
of their joy for the Cabinet that was
left. Can the ſame train of holy ends
which God has fram'd for Mankinds
bliſs, be leſs indearing, for that they are
known to be as skilfully rang'd as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
aim'd? How others may have
been wrought upon by that <hi>doing Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
which now ſpreads amongſt us like
love amongſt the Youth, kindly and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly,
I cannot tell: But if I were now
to die, and knew it ſo, I muſt ſpeak it
from within me, That I have found my
ſelf more warmly ſhined upon by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Lights, and breathing into more
becoming flames, from the reading of
<hi>Malpighius</hi> about the hatching of
an Egg, or Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> about the ſprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Bean, (a thing ſet at nought to
a by-word;) than ever I could do from
<pb facs="tcp:101488:6"/>
the ſhelves full of thoſe Books, that have
ſtruck fire for the Government of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and ſome other things, bearing
their religious weight in their Names,
and their light in their Newneſs, in the
late dayes of Blame, and years of Topſie-turvy.
Wherein, when men had wrought
up all the Woman within them that was
feeble and glowing, into a fine-ſpun
thread, they play'd the Men only, when
they had done, in pelting on't with the
diſtaff. I can eaſily taſt the ſweetneſs of
God through the bitterneſs of wormwood;
but could never feel the ſweetneſs of the
Christian through the bitterneſs of the
Man. And I love the <hi>New Philoſophy</hi>
ſo much the more; For why, It ſets the
hand a working not a ſtriking, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
the noiſe of Talking by the ſtilneſs
of Doing, as the <hi>Italians</hi> clam rowt and
tattle into nodding and beckning. Yet
'tis not to be lookt for, that the Bulk of
men amongſt us, ſhould love that which
they neither know nor care to know. It
<pb facs="tcp:101488:7"/>
will be enough for thoſe that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed
the Way, that many are the
hands heads and hearts of ſuch worthy
and unwearied Gentlemen as are Going
along with them. And I ſhall ever think
with that Great part of the <hi>R. S.</hi> the
Great Mr. <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> that <hi>Sound Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
are each to other ſufficient
Theaters.</hi> The kindneſs and good greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that is of one ſort, is wont to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded
mainly within the rank or ſtock
Guild or kinred of the ſame. And that
man who can find what 'tis to love know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
and beſeemingly, will never feel
himſelf leſs at eaſe for being wedlockt but
to one. Which I do not ſpeak as if I
gheſs'd you had your Philoſophy to
chooſe, any more than your Religion; or
that you could ſhift the former with as
much ſleight as ſome others do the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I believe you deal in Holdfaſts as
well as Truths, and can foretel what you
ſhall be, as well as tell what you are.
But becauſe there are a great many ſo
<pb facs="tcp:101488:7"/>
much upon the ſpur, that they cannot
ſtay ſo long till the writing can be fetcht
which is graven with the finger of God:
but grow ſo hot on't, as to melt down
their thoughts forthwith, and fall a
graving of them into Calviſh likeneſſes,
that may go blazing before them in the
wilderneſs they are got into; that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they miſs wool they may have noiſe,
ſomething loud, though nothing uſeful. I
was ſo forward to chide ſuch a raſh piece
of Will-worſhip, that I ſlipt into ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of while I was ſpeaking <hi>to.</hi> But 'tis
indeed time to remember, that I have
ſpoken enough of one and other. I am
ſure he whom I ſpeak to, is too much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with things to be over fond of words;
and 'tis a misbecomingneſs to have a <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Philoſophy</hi> ſet forth by a <hi>talking
Philoſopher.</hi> That Manly knowledge
that is now in the Chair, is to be trim'd
ſilently. And 'tis well for me that neither
Man nor Thing wants gilding. For I
could never open my mouth Charmwiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:101488:8"/>
nor breath out Spells to bind down men.
I never drew from, nor matcht to the
Houſe of Peacock. Gay and I are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
a kin, nor like to be, but all that
dwells at my home is homely. My brain is
not wont to go big with flower. When ever
I ſpy one 'tis aloof to be ſure: So I leave
both to ſhine for themſelves, and outſhine
others. And I know whatever is a None<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch,
will draw enough as 'tis, without
the Hogow of the ſtifling Haulers. To
be joy'd of praiſe-worthineſs, is more
than to be lifted up by the Hoiſt of breath,
or to be rung with a peal of Hum and
Outcry. It will be more than enough for
me, though I cannot raiſe nor greaten,
the height and ſpreadingneſs of your
Worth, by ſayings that are big and lofty,
if it may not be thought a lowning and
leſſening of it, to take into the Liſt of
your Menials</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I may meaſure others by my
ſelf, 'tis a more tickliſh thing
to pen a Preface, than 'tis
to write a Book. For when
ever I lay hands on a New
piece, as ſoon as I have
once ſpell'd the Great letters of its Name, I
am wont haſtily to take forth to the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeech
for the Reader, as thinking that to
be the handle, that I am to hold the Book
by, which, according as I reliſh or miſlike,
oftentimes ſo fares the whole with me. For
if I find the man has it not in him to erect a
Scheme in the <hi>Say</hi> that he has for me there,
I am ſhrewdly given to miſtruſt, that he will
never conjure much in the Book that comes
after: or when the firſt Greeting me is ſowre
or faint, I am ready to fear the after treat
will be none of the ſweeteſt or the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningeſt.
Whether others conne Books with
theſe kind of reckonings, I can't tell; but
while I can tell my ſelf that I do ſo, it
ſtands me in hand to be a little wary of trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
upon ſuch ſlippery ground. Now to
ſpeak truth, all the tale that I have to tell
the Reader is but this: That finding in my
ſelf a kind of forwardneſs towards Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and mainly to that part of it which
<pb facs="tcp:101488:9"/>
takes knowledge of Bodies; as which, of all
others, I found I could receive moſt helps
and furtherance in, from thoſe ſpreading
lights and wealthy ſtores, with which the
<hi>Royal Society</hi> at home and others abroad,
ſet into the way by their ſhowing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned
to go on by their works, had
both embelliſht and enricht it, I let my
mind alone to take its full ſwing in the
Conning of Bodies, this and that; and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
or ere I could well help it, I fell a
Roving, and plung'd out from what I was
medling with and toſſing of, to another
thing that was earlyer and Bulkier, and to
ſomwhat ſtill that was more betimes and
more of Boak; and being quite loſt in a
wilde and a frightful on and on, I'een took
back again where I was, and fell to unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
the thing that was too big to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom'd,
that I might make it little enough
for my mind to grapple with: but I was as
unluckie at leſſening and narrowing as I
had been before at widening and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
As the one had wrackt and limm'd
my thoughts, with endleſs tenters and
boundleſs retchings out; ſo had the other
nipt in my ſoul and ſhrivell'd up my
thoughts, with reſtleſs gripes and unwearyed
parings off: ſo that I had both loſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing'd
my ſelf in the leſſenings made
<pb facs="tcp:101488:9"/>
within my ſelf, as I had loſt and bewildred
my ſelf in the ſcopes ſtill left without my
ſelf. Nor could I be at reſt in my mind, till I
had tryed, whether I could not cut off Bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs
and endleſsneſs, ſo as at length I
might have eaſe, to find, that <hi>Body,</hi> which I
had to do withal, had both beginning and
end, an inmoſt part and an outmoſt whole,
as I my ſelf had: and ſo the remarks and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
that I was to make, were not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Bodies that carried Boundleſsneſs in their
bellies, &amp; were themſelves a ſwimming in a
boundleſs gulf, ſo that I muſt needs have my
thoughts to dance after them in an endleſs
round, or launch into a boundleſs width;
but that I might ſettle here or pitch down
there, and tell the firſt and ken the laſt, and
cope with the <hi>biggeſt</hi> and the <hi>leaſt:</hi> and as
ſoon as I got to the ſpring head of <hi>Laſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
I ſate me down and drank a health to
ſweet reſt, and bliſst my ſelf that I was
there; and when I came at the <hi>Selvedge</hi> of
<hi>Bulk,</hi> I took heart afreſh to think with my
ſelf, that there was all, and nothing at all
beyond, and I need weary my ſelf with no
more wandrings in a waſt, but might come
home again fair and ſoft, and faſten on this
or that, or little or great, as I thought beſt,
to ſet a mark on or make a Tryal of. For
then I ſaw that all was not wood within a
<pb facs="tcp:101488:10"/>
wood: but me-thought the world was a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Frame of well ſet Bodies, the <hi>beginning</hi> of
which the <hi>leaſt</hi> of which, and the <hi>whole</hi> of
which, might all be come at.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhaken off the things I could
never graſp, and taken Body by the right han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
I found I was freer to think, and better
at eaſe to work: and deeming there were
more in the world that were of my <hi>make,</hi> I
did not know but they might think, and do
ſo too; and it was but a friendly part to ſet
any man into his way, that I thought was out
of it: and therefore what I thought I writ, and
what I writ, the Reader ſees is comen abroad.</p>
            <p>Which if it takes, I ſhall not miſlike it, that
another man has found that which he lookt
for; and if it does not, the worſt on't is but
this, that that which has not yet been made
out by any man, nor has it been by me. And
whatever ill luck betides it, I have no body
elſe to blame for it; for I writ it all at home,
and 'twas given at my ſelf. And to tell troth, I
don't love to ask another man, whether my
Child be not pretty or hopeful; for I think,
that muſt needs be a crotchet piece of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckyneſs,
that is not fit to be Printed if a
friend has it to read over for that end, or
to be prais'd, if another man has it to make a
New ſong upon.</p>
            <p>But if any man ask me what I think on't my
<pb facs="tcp:101488:10"/>
ſelf? I anſwer, The very ſame that I think of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens writings, and that is, that they are
the writings of Man and nothing more, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and miſwriting mingled together. Only
I can ſay the Writer indeed is neither Green
nor Grey. So though the Reader may fear he
ſhall find little that is full ripe, I hope he will
find leſs that is altogether raw. As I think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
from what I did ſome years agoe, ſo
happily I may think otherwiſe from what I
do ſome years hence, even about ſome things
here ſpoken to: and therefore I love to ſpeak
ſoft for my own ſake as well as others. I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
too if I had kept it longer I could have
drawn it up better, but that bare no ſway
with me to do ſo; for then the only day of its
coming into the world muſt have been the
day of my going out of it. Notwithſtanding
though I don't believe 'tis the beſt that can
be done, or the beſt that I could do my ſelf,
yet 'tis rid of as many miſlikes as I could
ſtrike out at twice reading, and I did not
think it worth while to read it again to find
more. As 'tis, I neither reckon it my God nor
my Golden Calf, nor am I fond on't or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamd
on't. Should I ſay I had ſlighty thoughts
of it, I can't tell how it would be wit or good
manners to put it into the hands of my
Betters; and if I give out I ſet highly by
it, I ſhould lacken it as much by making
<pb facs="tcp:101488:11"/>
ſuch a Fondling the Penman of it. However
the management of it may ſeem weak or
low, I am ſure the drift and ſcope was manly
&amp; lofty. There being no lower nor other aims
in it, than that we might not think amiſs of
that Almighty Being which has made us, nor
of the ſundry Beings he has made, that we
may neither dote nor dare, ſtragle nor be loſt:
but may be led by ſuch a clue of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp; ſoftned by ſuch a baſhfulneſs of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that we may be wiſe and awful both in
one; that the knowledg of things may be leſs a
wearineſs to the fleſh, and that thoughts of
things without us may leſs gall that Being
within us; that, as God beholding what he had
made, ſaid with himſelf that all was good, we
may ſee it &amp; ſay it too, &amp; love the ſpring from
whence they came, while we wonder at the
wiſdom by which they are; worſhipping the
ſame with a more becoming dread, a fuller
enlightned mind, freer out-goings of heart,
ſteddyer &amp; cloſer thoughts about things that
he has made more eaſeful to the mind, and
better ſorted in it: that ſo giving to God his
right, we may take to our ſelves our own reſt.</p>
            <p>In the doing of which, the freedom that I
have taken, I give too. <hi>Think and let think,</hi>
are engraven upon my very ſoul. And I ſhall
never think amiſs of the Reader for not being
of my mind, any more than I do of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:101488:11"/>
Learned men which I thought meet ſomwhere
to name. Which I did, not from any itching to
thwart them: but I thought it would ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Breeding, to look full on a Great man
ſtanding in my way, and not to vouchſafe him
worth Doffing to, or to write my ſelf of another
mind from what ſome men of Name are, whoſe
reaſons for what they hold have fallen into a
many good hands, without I ſhould alſo ſay why
I am not of their mind for their reaſon. But as
for any leſſenings of them, who have done huge
well, as I think, elſewhere, and may have done
well enough, as others think, where I take them
to be out; 'tis ſo much againſt my meaning
and the very Grain of me to let any ſuch fall
from my Pen, that if in any thing I ſo much as
but ſeem to do it, 'tis all my unwarineſs, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of my aim. And I do think my ſelf ſo
much the more bound to take heed how I han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the good name of others, by how mnch the
more I ſee, how an ill will'd and frampled waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhneſs
has broken forth, to the royling and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the age wherein we live, and for ought I
can foretel, even thoſe too, that are coming after.</p>
            <p>Indeed, when I read ſuch things as are ſpoken
to, further on, in a late Writer, I can't for my life
but think, <hi>he</hi> may miſtake a little, as you and I
and all men do, and have done &amp; ſhall do. And
that thereupon he would not willingly be call'd
<hi>Names,</hi> ſuch as can't be ſpoken without a ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:101488:12"/>
breath, nor written but with a brazen pen,
nor ſpell'd but with the letters of the Dog and
the Gooſe, the grinning and the hiſſing. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
'tis good Bible, <hi>Do as you would be
done by,</hi> I can eaſily let go my ſelf in ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
wiſhes leading to ſelf love in behalf of ſuch
a one, heartily beſpeaking him, for Gods ſake,
for that of <hi>ſelf,</hi> &amp; the Commonwealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that hereafter we might read writings with
other ſentences beſides thoſe of Condemnation,
with other wit beſides that which lies in the
forehead, and where all the Daſhes of the pen
may not be ſtroaks upon men; as knowing that
ſuch <hi>Doomeſday Books,</hi> may ſooneſt be burnt
themſelves, which are readieſt to enflame others.</p>
            <p>I believe no man wiſhes with more earneſtneſs
than I do, that all men of Learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
were men of kindneſs and ſweetneſs, &amp; that
ſuch as can out do others would outlove them
too; eſpecially while <hi>ſelf</hi> bewhiſpers us, that it
ſtands us all in hand to be forgiven as well as to
forgive. The hardeſt things that I know, had
their beginnings layd in the ſoftneſs and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs
of a kind of dew; and whoever would
have all men ſtand up ſtiffly for what he holds,
will find it beſt at length to lead them in thoſe
eaſier paths of Nature. Sure I am, it would be
more than a wonder to me, ſhould any ones
ſight be better'd by <hi>ſpitting fire</hi> into clay &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmearing
eyes with it. For every mans mind is
<pb facs="tcp:101488:12"/>
his Caſtle; and if it can't be taken by ſtrength of
reaſon, the throwing in Granadoes, will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a ſmutty, ſtinking token to the world,
that ill will would have done more miſchief, but
weak Gear could not. So long as he who has but
a teeming brain, may have leave to lay his eggs
in his own neſt, which is built beyond the reach
of every mans puddering pole, why ſhould the
ears of all the neighborhood be dinn'd &amp; grated
with the Cackle, as if the whole world beſides
were all Weaſils and Poulcats, vermine and Lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers?
I do verily bear my ſelf in hand, that if the
humor of huffing be but a little further cocker'd
&amp; more warmed, the <hi>Leyden</hi> gown muſt needs
take place of the Long robe at <hi>Cambridge</hi> &amp; <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
inſtead of the <hi>ſide thing</hi> the <hi>thing by the ſide,</hi>
and ſnicking and ſneeing will be nothing elſe in
the world but writing of Book <hi>a la mode d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleterre.</hi>
For ſo long as men have but unlike
thinkings, and that will be as long as they have
unlike faces, they muſt look for no better fare
from a world of Bears and Scratchers, than firſt
to be gall'd in the tendereſt part of their good
name, and then to fall under the rods and axes
of a cutting hate, and ill will ſet on fire. Were I
but to whiſper to him of whom ſo many talk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
I ſhould rown him thus much in the ear,
with all the heartineſs of a friend, that the next
time he has left to bleſs us with his Day breaks,
he would chuſe a ſofter quill to make his pen of;
<pb facs="tcp:101488:13"/>
that the Reader at length might be as ready to
have good thoughts for him, as he has been to
have bad words for others.</p>
            <p>As for the way of wording it, I know afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
'tis not trim enough for theſe Gay days
of ours; but dreſſing is none of my buſineſs. When
I look at things, I can afford to overlook words,
and I had rather ſpeak home than fair, nor do I
care how blunt it be, ſo it be ſtrong. Every man
has <hi>his</hi> way of writing and ſpeaking, and I have
<hi>mine;</hi> which as I allow it to others, I may look it
ſhould be allow'd me. Only tis like there is one
thing which I may be blam'd for by many; and
that is a kind of ſhineſs all along of thoſe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
words &amp; gayneſſes, that Engliſhmen have
pickt and cull<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from other Tongues, under the
name of Choyce words and Sparkling ſayings.
To which, after I have markt, how a greater
man than I, in the ſame buſineſs of <hi>Bodies,</hi> has
gone a good way towards it already, I mean the
Learned Sir <hi>Kenhelm Digby,</hi> I have but thus much
more to ſay, That thinking with my ſelf, how I
an Engliſh man would write a Book in Engliſh
tongue, I made it now and than a little of my
care, to bring in ſo many words of that ſpeech,
that the Book might thence be call'd Engliſh,
without miſ-calling it. And indeed however our
ſmoother tongued Neighbours may put in a
claim for thoſe bewitcheries of ſpeech that flow
from Gloſs and Chimingneſs; yet I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb facs="tcp:101488:13"/>
that there is no tongue under heaven, that
goes beyond our Engliſh for ſpeaking manly
ſtrong and full. And if words be more to teach
than tickle, as I reckon they are, our Mother
tongue will get as much by ſpeaking fit and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
kind, as it can looſe by faring rough and
taking up the tongue to utter, and more than
any elſe can gain by kembing better and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
glibber. Beſides where I thought an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh
word would be better taken, I have
often for the Readers ſake ſet it down, as for
my own ſake ſet an Engliſh by it, as thinking
it unmeet to force my <hi>words</hi> upon another, in
ſuch a piece as where I was to leave all free, as
to the <hi>things</hi> I ſpake about. Only I thought it
not amiſs, after I was once in, for the taking off
that charge that ſome have too heedleſly layd
upon our ſpeech, of a patcht up Tongue from
Lands and kinreds round about, to ſhew, that
a Book of thus many ſheets, might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly
and roundly written, in hail and
clear Engliſh, without taking in from abroad,
ſo much as twice ſo many words (and he that
writes it in the moſt unbroken tongue upon
earth, ſhall go near to light upon ſo many), un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
where the ſame thing is fuller and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer
ſpoken by thoſe we have at home, taking
but out the Cant words or terms of art, as they
are call'd, which are rather tallies or ſpells in the
tongue, that is, no bodies, becauſe every bodies,
<pb facs="tcp:101488:14"/>
than the homebred vvords of any vvhatſoever;
and are taken up and forged at will, by the
whole ſtock of learned men in all Lands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to fiſh out one anothers meaning. And as
for a tongue that borrows not nor ſpends, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
'tis no where to be found, or ever will be:
all tongues through time being ſo far blended,
that there are not any of thoſe now in the
world in whole, that were at the great <hi>Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break</hi>
at <hi>Babel,</hi> any more than there would be
the ſame bodies crew of atoms to thoſe Speakers
now that they had then, or the ſame kinreds of
men unmingled with Out-ſetters that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them then, ſhould they have liv'd and
jugg'd together to this day. Yet that ſome
tongues loſe more than others at home, and get
from abroad, is eaſie to be ſeen, and our own is
enough to bring any man to believe it. And in
earneſt, if the knack of borrowing, or robbing
and pilfering rather, gets but a little further
ground amongſt us, at the ſcantling it has done
hitherto, it will in time to come be harder for an
Engliſh-man to ſpeak his own tongue without
mingling others with it, than to ſpeak a medly
of ſundry others without bringing in his own.
But for my part, I am of the mind, that the lard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Latine with <hi>High-Dutch,</hi> in what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to the whole world, as ſome <hi>Germans</hi> in their
Motley Books have already done, is even as
praiſe-worthy, as the haling in of Latine or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:101488:14"/>
tongues, when we are ſpeaking in Engliſh
to <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and the rather, for that the words
thus foiſted in, are of ſuch a ſort moſt an end, that
if you look but to their riſts, and lay their beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenings
to the things whoſe names they bear, I
dare undertake twenty for one, that even the
ſlighted and off-caſt words in the mouths of
Handy-crafts-men and Earth-tillers ſhal be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
drawn and more patly brought in. And inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as that <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> of <hi>Worthies</hi> in <hi>London,</hi>
who are now embodied under the name of <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi>
have given us already ſo many new things,
and are daily ſtarting more, neither named nor
known by thoſe before us; and for the enriching
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue, as well as fulfilling of
<hi>Englands</hi> ſtores, have thought fit their diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ſhould almoſt wholly come abroad in our
own Speech, as they are happily made in our
own Land: I think it will well become thoſe of
us, who have a more hearty love for what is our
own than wanton longings after what is others,
to take light and life from ſuch happy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and either to fetch back ſome of our
own words, that have been juſtled out in wrong
that worſe from elſewhere might be hoiſted in,
or elſe to call in from the fields and waters, ſhops
and work-houſen, from the inbred ſtock of more
homely women and leſs filching Thorps-men,
that well-fraught world of words that anſwers
works, by which all Learners are taught to do,
<pb facs="tcp:101488:15"/>
and not to make a Clatter; And perhaps if we
ſlip this tide, we ſhall never come again at ſuch
a nicking one. For inaſmuch as almoſt the
whole of thoſe words, that we ſpeak in things or
knowledges of things that are not body, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from things that are body, and ſpoken in a
borrowed meaning from thence, either as they
have Beings from God, or a Suchneſs of being
from our handy-work: ſo all the words about
body and hangers on to body that we have to
do with, are either ſuch as flow from or mainly
well fall in with thoſe that are utter'd by Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
for ſuch things as are done by hand-deed.
Now the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of our day and Land being
ſo much workful as the world knows it to be,
methinks this of all times ſhould be <hi>the</hi> time,
wherein, if ever, we ſhould gather up thoſe ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
words of ours that ſpeak works, rather
than to ſuck in thoſe of learned air from beyond
Sea, which are as far off ſometimes from the
things they ſpeak, as they are from us to whom
they are ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it may well be doubted, whether
Latine can now be made ſo fit to ſet forth the
things of a <hi>Working Philoſophy</hi> by, as our own
Speech, or thoſe other of our Neighbours, who
are with us carrying on that way of <hi>Doing.</hi> For
we muſt know, that almoſt all the old pieces of
good Latine that we draw by, have been taken
up by that ſort of learning that is wont to be
<pb facs="tcp:101488:15"/>
worded in the Schools, &amp; ſpent in the ſetting to
ſale of ſuch things as could beſt be glazed with
the froth of ink, by the men of Cloſets. Whence
he that is beſt skill'd in it, is ſo hard put to it, in
the Kitchin, that Shop, and the Ship; and ever will
be, though <hi>Plautus</hi> ſhould be as well underſtood
as <hi>Tully.</hi> For the words that are every day run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to and fro in the Chat of Workers, have
not been gotten into Books and put aboard for
other Lands, until this way of Knowing by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was ſtarted amongſt us. So that we and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the <hi>Handed Philoſophers</hi> may either
find better words among our own Yeomanry,
for ſuch buſineſſes of workmanſhip as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
known by name, or at leaſt coin fitter for
new ones in a likewiſeneſs to the old, than can
be lent us from that Tongue wherein we know
not how the Folks talkt in the Country, nor do
any body elſe or ever ſhall do. Whereby too we
ſhall not only vvith more eaſe and kindlineſs be
underſtood by the <hi>Pains-taking</hi> men amongſt
us, whoſe <hi>Crafts</hi> will be more helpful to an
<hi>hail</hi> Philoſopher, than the <hi>Bookiſhneſs</hi> of others.
But as Learnings being lockt up in the Tongues
of the Schools, or Love's being lickt up in the
more womanly ſimprings of the lips, and the
ſmiling kiſſing ſpeeches of ſome others abroad,
have been enough to enkindle in us a panting
after, and fondneſs for ſome of thoſe Outlandiſh
dynns: So if the works of our own men ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:101488:16"/>
be ſhipt over by words of our own tongue, it may
happily make others who have love enough
for the things, to ſeek as much after our words,
as we upon other ſcores have done after theirs;
the firſt draught being <hi>Engliſh,</hi> name and thing,
doing and ſpeaking. Which while we forbear to
do, and ſnip here and ſnatch there from ſome
of them, being as much beholden to them for
new and handſom words, as they to us for freſh
and uſeful things, the works are not more
greatned by their ſpreading name, than the
workers ſeem leſſened by the unluckineſs of
the ſlur, That <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> can do by their own
Hands, what they can't ſpeak in their own
Tongues.</p>

we ſpeak by, are matcht to time, and can't
ſpeak forth eternity. We are at a loſs for words
in ſome outgoings of the ſoul, and flight of

truckle beneath us. Doctor <hi>Charleton</hi>'s taking

arguments layd down and anſwer'd, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is no outward eternity at all, and if
there were, it would be no better than none at all.
The Doctors objection againſt the <hi>Nowneſs</hi> of
eternity anſwer'd. The matching of it with the
way of the ſouls being in the body. Eternity not
ſuch a Now as that of time is, but is quite wide
of it, all and ſome. Thinking is, and does, to
Ghoſt, as bulk to body. <hi>Second</hi> argument an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,

body, (as we cannot now think beyond it, nor

Whereneſs is too much a kin to place to ſuit

The kind of ſome things, ſtands in their being or

no more be boundleſs, than the world it ſelf. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worldiſh
emptineſs an idle thing. Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſs
would ask Room as well as his All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fillingneſs,
one being as much roomthy as the
other. Room is no where but where body is.
Ghoſt is no more in Room than <hi>thought</hi> is. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>More</hi> for roomthyneſs of Ghoſt, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worldiſh
emptineſs taken off. God muſt as well
be of ſome ſhape as of ſome Bulk. The world may
be bounded without Emptyneſs beyond it. The
foremoſt miſtake, a Dreaming firſt of emptyneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:101488:18"/>
and then of world in the midſt of it: Whereas
room is in the world and not the world in
Room about it; nor ſhould we have thought of
room, till 'twas made, and where 'twas made.
Doctor <hi>More</hi>'s arguments anſwer'd, by ſhewing
an arrow can't be ſhot beyond the worlds Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedge,
nor arm born out of it; the <hi>Frame of
the world</hi> hindring as much as the ſtiffeſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
waylaying: prov'd by the ſtop of falling Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
at the Earths middle. The world no heap,
but a ſet of Bodies lockt faſt together. Ghoſt
can't carry Body beyond the world. The biggeſt
Body can't be fathom'd by place, as the leaſt
can't be cloven. Another world would be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
near this, nor far from it. To Ghoſt the
biggeſt Body and the leaſt, all one. If nothing be
between two worlds or Bodies the Rims would
touch; Anſwer'd, That two Bodies touch, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
muſt needs be between; elſe onlay'd bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and inlay'd would be all one. <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
and Maſter <hi>White</hi> gotten over: they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unſay, or make the world boundleſs. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>More</hi>'s cramp argument, brought off. The
ſides of a veſſel emptyed of Body, would not only
not touch, but be further aſunder, than when full.
A body may ſtand ſtill and yet ſhift place. Things
are ſo near each other, as they can come to be.
Stirring of Bodies, or the room between them,
comes all to a reckoning. If there were bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb facs="tcp:101488:18"/>
room beyond the world, its running would
be ſtanding ſtill, and its ſtanding ſtill running.
Master <hi>Barlow</hi> anſwer'd. Body can't ſtir but in
Body. All Bodies ſtart ſaw wiſe. Sirring of
Ghost is like skipping of thought. God would
be no more by halves in two worlds, than he is in
the two halves of this. <hi>Pag. 54.</hi>

ſtrains, is none of my buſineſs, only I would
beg leave to ſay, that what I have met with
from the pens and tongues of learned men
hereabout, have left me altogether in the
dark, whatever light others may thence have
gathered, and that what I have hit upon as to
this affair, and am now about to ſet down,
has ſet my own mind ſo far at freedom, that I
was not altogether given to miſtruſt, but it
might ſomewayes alſo be helpful, to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
right the thoughts of ſome others. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
then that the <hi>anſwerings</hi> or analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies

right reaſon and a wiſdom above us, had
evened out into ranks and kindreds by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
have been unhappily hudled and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the mind of man; and that other
things wide enough off as to their Births and

brought together by our leſs wary way of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101488:21"/>
thinking, beſides a great many things which
are either begotten by the underſtanding,
working upon the draughts or idea's of
things that ſenſe has to do with, or elſe do

the things of the World bear to the <hi>make</hi> of

things being either lodged in the mind, that

are reckoned as if they were, or things that

               <p>Thus again by the blending of <hi>Ens Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>
with <hi>Ens Morale,</hi> another queſtion about
the thing that ſin is, has been as much rufled
and darkned as any whatſoever; for though
it has been made out, as heretofore, ſo more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
of late, by no mean hands, to be <hi>Ens po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitivum,</hi>
yet moſt well-knowing men have
been wary of ſpeaking it out, for fear they
ſhould allot God Almighty a ſhare in it, he
being the maker of every poſitive being;
whereas, if I do not much miſ-think at leaſt,
though God Almighty be the Maker of every
being that is Phyſically ſo, it follows not that
he is the ſame of each being that is Morally
ſo: 'tis enough that God is the maker of the
power to do evil, (which being good, may
therefore ſpring from him) not of the things
that are ſo done, ſo as from them he ſhould
take name: thus 'tis moſt ſure, that a <hi>non ens
Phyſicum</hi> may be a moral good; a Jews na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<hi>not doing</hi> buſineſs on his Reſt-day, had
as truly <hi>Being</hi> in it, as the <hi>doing</hi> the other
works of the day, for why? as truly <hi>good;</hi> and
if God ſhould will me not to be, my <hi>not being,</hi>
and willingneſs not to be <hi>Phyſically,</hi> would
be as much <hi>Being,</hi> becauſe as much <hi>good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi>
as my very <hi>being</hi> alive and willingneſs
to be ſo, worſhipping God whilſt ſo. A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
being leaves off to be ſo, when it no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101488:23"/>
longer abides in the World; but a moral be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
skills not the world, but is ſuch only
from its cloſing with, or ſwerving from the
Law 'tis laid to; whilſt 'tis, it is indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>in the World,</hi> nor is any thing elſe of it
ſelf, rightly ſpeaking, unleſs it takes up room
there. Had there been as much of the will
of God, as there might be of the will of man,
in thoſe two odd wiſhes, of two holy hearts,
in the holieſt of Books, blotting out of the
Book of God would have been a good, and
accurſedneſs from Chriſt, a bleſſedneſs. For
then a being grows up to its full ripe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
when it fully reaches all that bliſs, which
God aims at, for its utmoſt good; which
whether it abides Phyſically or not, is neither
here nor there, it being a weakneſs of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to ſay, that a made being is more
happy in its natural life, which God wills not,
than in its being nothing when God wills it
ſo: for then either we could never have bin
fully happy, unleſs we were as well from
everlaſting, as to it; or at leaſt, thoſe that go
to heaven at the end of the World, would
not be ſo bliſsful as thoſe that went in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
the former having an happy being,
while the latter had neither happineſs nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
whereas both ſtanding even in the love
of God, they ſhould do ſo too, in their own
bliſs. I think we do reſpect or look towards
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101488:23"/>
Gods glory, and our own happineſs more, by
what we have in us of <hi>Ens morale,</hi> than by
what we have of <hi>Ens Phyſicum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all which there would
follow nothing to make us think that ſin
ſhould be any whit long of God; for why,
all that he does towards it, is, to leave us to
our ſelves to bring it forth if we will; and
inſtead of driving on to it as a fellow helper
or procatarctick cauſe, he draws from it, and
towards the good, with unſpeakable endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of woing, and drives from it, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
the evil, with all that earneſtneſs of
threatning, that may beget in man the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſtneſs
of dread; nor is he any nearer the
Phyſical cauſe of it, than to give that good
power, which is not the cauſe at all, as it looks
towards him, for by giving this power he is
at the ſame time the evil thing is done, as
much the cauſe of the gainſtanding good that
is not done; now if he be no more the cauſe
of it, than he is of that which is not at all,
then he is not the cauſe at all.</p>
               <p>Beſides this power is not only good, but
alſo needful, for though the fulfilledneſs or
perfection of the will in the next life, will not
be in a ſtanding at jar, and wavering alike
towards good and evil, but only in a ſelf-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
to good, yet in this life, I think it
mainly does, and muſt; for this is a life of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101488:24"/>
doing, or believing, as it looks on to reward
in that to come: that, a lie of rewarding, as
it looks back to doing or believing here.
Now if we do but allow God to deal with us,
who are reaſonable beings, in wayes bearing
an evenlineſs with our kind, as he does with
lower beings in wayes agreeable to theirs;
then muſt he needs beſtow upon us this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to ſin that we are ſpeaking of; for it
ſeems not ſo much of right reaſon to reward
that in man, which though he did willingly,
yet he could not for his life do otherwiſe,
leaſt then a ſtock or a ſtone ſhould put in too
for reward, for its deeds of kind, which it
does not unwillingly, but yet muſt needs do.
In like manner Heaven being a life, not of
earning wages, but of taking pay, 'tis enough
there, for the freedom of the will to ſtand
alone <hi>in ſpontaneitate ad bonum,</hi> or ſelf-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
to good.</p>
               <p>Hence likewiſe we are in a fair way to
anſwer that thread-bare Queſtion, which did
ſo much gravel the ungoſpel'd world; to
wit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; For inaſmuch as ſin is a
moral thing, we are well enough on't if we
can but track it up to a ſpring of its kind,
without looking after any other riſte: Now
unbounded wiſdom and goodneſs having laid
out endleſs happineſs as reward for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the ſame wiſdom and rightwiſeneſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101488:24"/>
allotted endleſs wretchedneſs as puniſhment
for ſin; without this obedience there could
be no heaven, without ſin no Hell; and
without a power not to do, in both, there
could be neither. So then, that God may
have leave to make man happy for holineſs,
man muſt needs have power to make himſelf
wretched for ſin. That evil ſhould alwayes
flow from evil in a chain of breeders, is a great
miſ-underſtanding; for as fire ariſes from that
which is no fire, by a ſmart ſtroke upon a
flint, ſo evil ſprings from that which is not
evil, by a croſs blow given the Law.</p>
               <p>If it be gainſaid, Then man may thank him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
too for all the good he does, that being
as much long of him as the other, while the
thing done forbears to be denominated from
God, at the freeneſs of the power in man: and
ſo to make God not the ſpring or Author of
good, would be much at one with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of him the Author of evil.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it follows not; For in the firſt
place, of all the good that man does, God is
ſtill the Moral cauſe, egging on to it by all
thoſe ſweetneſſes of entreaty, that the will
can any way be wrought upon by; and
though mans being free to it, makes it his
deed (at ſecond hand at leaſt) both which,

bulkineſs of the world, the buſineſs of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the emptineſs beyond the world, the all-fillingneſs

and twiſted together, even to the bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

               <p>Beſides our very way of thinking upon bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

               <p>THus then in the firſt place, one of the
readieſt wayes for us to free the mind
from miſtakes about the knowledg of the
world, is, for us to gather remarks of things,
as much in a nearneſs to the Divine idea of
them, or that of ghoſtly beings, as our more
underly way of thinking will give us leave
to reach to; and to uncloath them of, or
make allowance for, all thoſe anſwerings or
analogies, that do ariſe to them upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our animalities or beghoſted body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
For I reckon it will be a good ſtep
towards the knowledg of what the world
ought to be to us, who are body and ghoſt
both together, if we but know what 'tis
to ſuch Being or Beings as are ghoſt altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Now the two firſt and moſt bewildring
things that the mind is likeſt to faſten on, as
the main belongers to the world, are the
room that the world takes up, and the time
that the world laſts: But if we come to lay
theſe to the Divine Being, we ſhall find, that
as Time is to Gods eternity or everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo Bulk is to Gods immenſity or his all-fillingneſs.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101488:26"/>
Our knowing then how the world
behaves it ſelf to one of them, will help us
ſtill to underſtand how 'tis to the other, as
our knowing how 'tis unto both, will give us
ſomewhat better to gueſs how 'tis to us who
have neither.</p>
               <p>Inaſmuch then as the known perfection of
God is to be ſo everlaſting, as not to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
or jogging on and on, the idea or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that he frames of timeſome Beings that
are ſo, muſt not be by ſhrinking up this his
fulneſs, to the narrowneſs of thoſe Beings
which muſt needs be creeping forwards while
they are; for that would be to make himſelf
like them; that is, not to be God: but he
muſt take the ken of theſe beings, after wayes
becomming his boundleſs or infinite being: if
then it will not beſeem God to be at this
time, and at that time, this after that, then
neither will it become him to know things
that are ſo, after that kind of way. Now
becauſe all the things we can gripe in
our minds are ſuch, and the likeneſſes that
God has of them are not ſuch, the words
by which we call them being anſwering to
the things, we are as much at a loſs for
words, as for thoughts, about things ſo
vaſtly beyond us: all that we can do towards
it is, to chooſe out ſuch vvords to ſet forth
Gods ever-beingneſs by, as may be ſure to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101488:27"/>
ſhut out formerneſs and afterneſs, which
Gods everlaſtingneſs has not, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
on the other hand make them take in
what we believe it has. Thus the whole
world almoſt of well enlightned, and right
believing men, have hit upon the way of
calling Gods everlaſtingneſs, a cleaveleſs or
indiviſible <hi>now:</hi> not as if 'twere a moment of
that time which we take up, (time being caſt
out, as well in part as in whole) but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it cannot be brought to our bounded
underſtandings, ſhrowded under any other
word that can like that, cut off all former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and latterneſs, which muſt by no means
be taken in.</p>
               <p>Which way of ſpeaking has as ſure footing
too in holy Writ, as in well-guided reaſon.
<hi>I am hath ſent me, this day have I begotten thee,
before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am;</hi> being as much
ſenſe ſpoken of God, as they would be non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe
of any one elſe. Had <hi>Abraham</hi> been at
the beginning of the World he had not been
ſooner, as to Gods everlaſtingneſs; or had
he not been till the words ſpoken, he had not
been later, becauſe there is neither ſooner
nor later in the thing: that which would be
[was] in Grammar to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is [am] to
God, as that which would be [will be] to us,
is ſtill [am] to him. Gods ſaying, <hi>I am</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Abraham</hi> or the world, and <hi>I am</hi> after
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101488:27"/>
him or it, (anſwering to our <hi>were</hi> and <hi>will be)</hi>
is as well the <hi>fullneſs,</hi> as <hi>truth</hi> of ſpeaking,
for then we have ſpoken all that ought, when
we have ſpoken all that can be; and then all
that can, when there are no more words to
ſpeak more with.</p>
               <p>And that it may not ſeem ſo ſtrange to us
that we are thus word-bound in ſuch kind of
things, we may remember that we are enough
put to it for words about things belonging to
our own ſelves, when we would give forth
thoſe raviſhments of love that we feel, but can
not, (without giving Soul and all) give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to underſtand, our words, it ſeems, being
moſt an end as little ſquared to unbounded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the intention of degrees, or ſcrewing
up high, as 'tis to that in the extenſion of
parts, or letting out wide.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if Gods everlaſtingneſs were to be
ſet out by words, it muſt not ſurely be, by
ſuch vvords as are fitted to the analogy that
is betvveen us, and other timeſome and
boundſome beings, as all thoſe vve yet have
are, but is only to be ſet forth by vvords run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
even vvith the anſvverings betvveen
them and the Divine Being, which we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know, nor can tell whether ever we
ſhall. Thus Logick and Philoſophy cannot
be uttered by the neighing of Horſes, the
barking and howling of Dogs, the hiſſing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101488:28"/>
and gagling of Geeſe, the chirping or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of other Birds, though they ſpeak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that, amongſt themſelves, which we
cannot give them to know by our more full
words; they, it ſeems, being as unfit for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
beneath us, as above us.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Philoſophical Dr. <hi>Charleton,</hi>
(from the Mighty <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> before him, as he
from <hi>Epicurus)</hi> has taken up again, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> ſo learnedly overthrown by
Mr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> that Gods everlaſtingneſs is
boundleſs time, and that his unmeetſomeneſs
is boundleſs width: Both which to me,
(whatever they are to others) ſeem no leſs
then frightful notions: For if <hi>we are exiſtant
in a ſmall part of that duration,</hi> or the world
in a ſmall part of that extenſion <hi>in which God
exists,</hi> and Gods eternity not be an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now, and his immenſity an unbounded
unextendedneſs; it will follow that ſome
part of Gods everlaſtingneſs is yet to come,
and not now; and ſome part of his all-filling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
beyond the world, not in it, vvhich
vvould make ſuch a medly of ſucceſſion and
diviſion in the Attributes of God, vvhich are
God himſelf, as I can't novv underſtand, or

But becauſe it has been undertaken ſince
by a Reverend Divine, who has followed it
as well more cloſely, as more fully, and that
too with a goodly income of Learning, and a
right handſome addreſs of words, and well
air'd periods; it may happily ſeem to the
Reader, that either we want a kindneſs for
the buſineſs we have hitherto owned, while
we let ſuch a rub lye in our way uncared for,
or elſe that we want reſpect enough for the
Author, to think that ſo, which he has
wrought hard to make ſo; eſpecially too,
having done ſo much to awaken us, as, to
reckon all that think otherwiſe than himſelf
does, to be no leſs than fools and laughing-ſtocks;
notwithſtanding yet the whole throng
of thoſe that have been of moſt name for
learning, or of moſt worth for holineſs, have
been of the ſide that he is not of, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World to this day.</p>
               <p>In the doing of this he warns his Reader of <hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tentamina Phyſ. Theol. de Deo. p. 373.</note>
two kinds of abiding, inward or
in groſs, and outward or by it
ſelf: The inward is the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
or exiſtence of the thing, which if, as to
what 'tis made up of, it be daily throwing off
and taking in, (as we and all body-ſome Beings
do) is then ſucceſſive; but if it be alwayes the
ſame, as 'tis with ghoſt and the ſubstance of all
bodies, then 'tis ſhut of ſucceſſion and diviſion,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101488:29"/>
and is ſelf-ſame or permanent, like as God is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Page 376, 377.<hi> The outward has ſo little
reality in it, that the underſtanding cannot get
a draught of it; it has nothing at all of poſitive
reality (though it be not yet a ſheer dream or fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
which is gathered, becauſe it muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
needs be, both unmade by God, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to, or independent on God; if God had
never made any thing, it ſhould for all that have
been; and if he ſhould unmake all things, it
would ſtill be. </hi>Page 378.<hi> The whole of this is
eternity or everlaſtingneſs, the half is </hi>aevum<hi> or

               </p>
               <p>Pag. 398.<hi> Thus Gods inward everbeingneſs,
or </hi>aeternitas concreta,<hi> is the very exiſtence of
God, with an outward badge or denomination
from time by-running; which is permanent and
indiviſible: and 'tis about this </hi>aeternitas, Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius<hi>and others ſhould be underſtood, when
ſpeaking of its being </hi>tota ſimul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gods outward or abſtract is in an endleſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs,
and is unto Gods everlaſtingneſs, as</hi>ſpatium imaginarium<hi> is to his all<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>illingneſs,
which is not an attribute of God, but an unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
retching out together with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To bring off all this fairly, we have two
things to do; Firſt, to ſhew that there is no
ſuch thing at all as this ſame <hi>aeternitas externa.</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101488:29"/>
Secondly, that if there were, it would not yet
do the job for which 'tis brought.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, <hi>A real outward eternity or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
time that has nothing at all of poſitive rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
is not; becauſe 'tis a contradiction <hi>in
adjecto,</hi> that it ſhould be a right down ſelf-cut-throat,
fordoing even its own being.
Eternity, and nothing at all of poſitivity, can
by no means ſtand together; for whatever is
eternal, muſt needs be poſitive of eternity, as
long as eternity is ſomewhat poſitive it ſelf:
and whatever is big with or poſitive of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
cannot go farrow, or be privative of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
entity; for a thing cannot <hi>be everlaſting,</hi>
and <hi>not be at all:</hi> and that this is really ſo, is
clear, in that <hi>'tis not a figment</hi> or whimſie; So
'tis yielded to have a <hi>little reality</hi> in it, and a
little real, is real; eſpecially ſeeing that <hi>little
reality</hi> is enough to make it really lengthen'd
out with Gods moſt real inward everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſo that although God were not,
that would be, and though God had never
been, that ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Beſides he that gives it a <hi>little reality</hi> or
thingſomeneſs, cannot for his heart be ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
as to hold his hand there, and give it no
more: for why, 'tis ſuch a craving Horſleech,
it will ſuck in more whether a man will or
not: Whilſt it muſt for truth's ſake be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that that little ſnip of everlaſting time,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101488:30"/>
which reaches from my Birth-day, or at leaſt,
the Worlds raiſing day, till novv, has a <hi>little
reality</hi> in it; For I have lived, and the World
laſted <hi>really</hi> that <hi>little</hi> while; the <hi>reality</hi> of
time being grafted in its timeiſhneſs, not in its
boundleſneſs; ſo that every <hi>little ſhare</hi> of
time muſt have a <hi>little</hi> of this <hi>little reality,</hi> and
every <hi>little</hi> muſt make a <hi>mickle.</hi> Then ſay I,
if the time that I have lived and the world
laſted, has a <hi>little reality</hi> in it, then that of it,
which is beyond, muſt have more; and that
of it which reaches infinitely beyond it,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis as <hi>reall</hi> as 'tis <hi>infinite,</hi> and as really
<hi>more</hi> as 'tis <hi>real,</hi> (muſt have an <hi>infinite deal of
reality</hi> beyond it; and that which has <hi>more,</hi>
and <hi>infinitely more</hi> than a <hi>little,</hi> cannot ſurely
be ſaid to have <hi>but a little,</hi> or leſs than a great
deal, or any thing ſhort of <hi>infinite reality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Its independency or looſneſs from God,
lies as crotchet every whit, as its being; for
if you ask about it the queſtion that is wont
to be askt all the homeleſs Crew, Whence
comes it? The anſwer muſt fare as if it were a
God; for 'tis to be ſaid, God did not make
it, nor did any thing elſe; and yet 'tis <hi>indeed,</hi>
and was unbeginningly, and will be endleſly;
and that is as much as can be ſaid of God
himſelf, under that head. If it be ſaid that
God has beſides an inward ever-beingneſs,
that is neither cleaveſome, nor on and on; ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101488:30"/>
has this too, by good luck; for the inward
abiding is nothing but <hi>the exiſtence of a thing
alwayes the ſame:</hi> now this outward ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs
has alwaies been the ſame, without
getting or loſing ought, but moments of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
<hi>which the everlaſting God and all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
do.</hi> If it be ſaid that <hi>in</hi> God there is
All-fillingneſs, as well as Everlaſtingneſs; ſo
there is <hi>out</hi> of God too, a boundleſs roomthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſuch as would be though God were not,
nor had been ever; and while he is, is retcht
out together with him; and was, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
without beginning, and without him
too. So we have gotten ſomewhat to chew
upon, that is as everlaſting, and as much eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, as God is, and as unbeholden to
God for being, as God is to any thing elſe for
his; and yet in the upſhot, 'tis ſuch a kind of
ſomewhatkin, as truckles beneath the very
tinyneſs of an half nothing, and is forſooth a
<hi>fierdhalf</hi> nothing; for after the full nice brat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
out of <hi>reality,</hi> into muchneſſes and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſes,
there falls to the ſhare of this, as <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
as may be, to keep it from dwindling into
an altogether nothing, or a middlekin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſomething and nothing, that is neither
of them. Whereas I have thought, that as
time had not been if God had not made time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
beings, nor room if he had not made
roomthy; ſo neither had eternity or immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101488:31"/>
been, if there had not been a God ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
and every where, the maker of all
things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As this new Everlaſtingneſs breaks with
it ſelf, upon the ſcore of being or entity, ſo it
as much undoes it ſelf upon that, of its bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
or infinity; for as before we were told
it was a real eternal, not real poſitive, ſo over
and above, we are done to wit, that 'tis an
infinite not infinite: for 'tis ſuch an infinite as
is cut in a trice into two halves, one paſt and
the other to come. Now it being impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that I ſhould give thus much to be the
half of a thing, without I knew the whole
were as much again, it follows that if I know
how much the whole is, (and that I cannot
but do, becauſe I am told what the half is,)
then is this infinite, finite; for I who am finite
can fathom it, and by my bounded know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of it, bound it; and yet again this finite
is the meaſure to an hair of Gods infinity in
abiding, who is boundleſly far and wide of
me, and of my utmoſt knowledg. All which
being dainties of too high a ſeaſoning, for my
more homely underſtanding, I muſt leave
them, with their Miche-good-do't-ye to the
elder ſons of reliſh and ſhrewd fetches.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, if this ſame cleaving of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in two (that is, into inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)
were yielded, we ſhould be ne're the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101488:31"/>
nearer fadging for all that; for the concrete
or inward everlaſtingneſs is ſaid to be the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
exiſtence or eſſence</hi> (which as they do not
differ to ſpeak of, ſo our Author mingles) <hi>of
God himſelf, with the outward denomination
taken from time gliding by.</hi> Now, though it
ſeems harſh (to me at leaſt) that an outward
denomination, ſhould come into the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an inward being, yet that the inward
eſſence or exiſtence of God muſt no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
underſtood, is clear enough; for the
naked eſſence of God is as much his all-knowingneſs,
his all-fillingneſs, or his one-foldneſs,
as his everlaſtingneſs; and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid to be Gods everlaſtingneſs, which
is as much ſomewhat elſe, as 'tis that. Gods
everlaſtingneſs then is not Gods Being or Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
only, but Gods Eſſence everlaſting, or
everlaſting God, or Gods Eſſence as 'tis to
himſelf, or in himſelf endleſly abiding: as
Gods knowledg is his Eſſence as to, or within
himſelf all-knowing, his all-fillingneſs as to,
or within himſelf filling all things. Now if
all this be cleaveleſs or indiviſible, as is fairly
yielded above; and of, and by it ſelf too, as,
I think, may as fairly be hence gathered, to
wit the <hi>externa aeternitas &amp; immenſitas,</hi> or the
everlaſting time and boundleſs roomthineſs,
being utterly of themſelves without God, it
would be a fooliſh blaſphemy or dirtying of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101488:32"/>
God, not to yield that Gods inward everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs
and boundleſneſs, may as well be
without the outward, as they could be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the inward. Then, ſay I, after all this
wheeling about, we are not a ſtep further
than where we were; for Gods whole eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
rightly taken, and as 'tis to himſelf, is not
ſucceſſive or growing on, but altogether, or
one only everbeing now.</p>
               <p>All that we have gotten by it is, a meaſure
for it that is growing onward, as we have for
his all-fillingneſs, another that may be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
Now ſurely 'tis as hard to imagine,
how that which is ſucceſſive and diviſible, as
the outward are, ſhould be the meaſure of
that which is permanent and indiviſible, as
the inward is; as 'tis that that which is all at
once, ſhould hold way with that which is on
&amp; on, or that that which is altogether ſhould
hold out with that which has part and part;
which is the huge non-ſence that is to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
upon the otherwiſe minded. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
for my ſhare, I cannot ſee why we may not
have a yard or an ell of good-Angell, or a
pound or an ounce of the foul fiend, as well
as a ſucceſſive ſhare of Gods unſucceſſive
everlaſtingneſs, or a diviſible piece of Gods
indiviſible all-fillingneſs: but ſuch it ſeems
may be had, if you knock at the right door;
for meaſures that have fore and aft, and part
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101488:32"/>
and part, are the things, and the only things,
by which 'tis meted out.</p>
               <p>Beſides it carries a train of things after it,
that are as hard to anſwer as eaſie to light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
To name one for all; there being as many
things to be known, as there are dotts or
points in the outward immenſity; and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
new things to be known, as new minutes
to be lived in, in the outward eternity; it
will follow that Gods knowledg as well as
his everlaſtingneſs is both diviſible and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive:
without we ſhould anſwer that God
knows all that ſcope of points without retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out that his eſſence which is his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;
and all that chain of minutes, without
any lengthening out of that his being which
is his everlaſtingneſs; but then the new
knack is quite ſplit, and we are no wiſer, nor
ſpeak no more wonders, than the grey beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, that have gone before us.</p>
               <p>But it being likely that that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke
a kindneſs for this more hazardous by-road,
was, becauſe the open way was lookt
upon as more encumbred and leſs enlightned;
that the charge may be ſhown, as leſs ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
taken up, we ſhall give anſwer as far as
we can, unto what has been laid before us
under that head.</p>
               <p>Among the hard ſayings then that we meet
with, theſe come in chief; to wit, Page 384,<hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:101488:33"/>
The underſtanding cannot take it, how one </hi>now<hi>ſhould hold on with the whole runlong of all
ages, any more than that one </hi>point<hi> ſhould be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out to the utmoſt wideneſs of the whole
World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Page 386.<hi> Again, if everlaſtingneſs were
cleaveleſs, nothing could be in any part of time,
but it would be likewiſe whole everlaſtingneſs;
the whole being in every leaſt of time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Page 388.<hi> And further yet, it cannot be
thought that two abidings or durations, to wit,
time and everlaſtingneſs, ſhould be together and
not be the ſame abiding; when inaſmuch as they
are together they become one, as two rooms can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be within one abutment, unleſs they be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
clapt into one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which being of ſo near a kindred, we
ſhall cramp them with this one inſtance, and
that ſhall be one too, no farther from home
than we our ſelves are from our ſelves: I mean
that oneneſs that is between ſoul and body,
as it makes up the being that is called man.</p>
               <p>The ſoul is as cleaveleſs or indiviſible as a
point of roomthineſs, or a now of time; and
yet 'tis as much in every roomthy part of the
body, all at once and altogether, as in the
very leaſt: and if another mans underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot take it, how a thing that has no
parts, ſhould be every where at once, in a
thing that has, the blame lies at the man, not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101488:33"/>
in the thing, for we are as ſure that 'tis, as he
can be that he don't underſtand it. Thus
again the bone is as hard to pick, how a limb
of the body ſhould not be as big as the whole,
it being as big as the whole of that, which is
full as much as the whole body, and in the
mean time, the whole of the ſame too, is
even with that which is but a limb of it. And
another of the ſame is, that two abidings,
that is to ſay, time and eternity, may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and not be the ſame abiding, as well
as the ſoul may be every where, where the
body is ſtretched out, and yet it ſelf not be
ſtretched out at all. But now either all this
is true, or elſe the ſoul is as bulkie as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and as full of parts as it; or elſe as little
as an atome, and ſo takes up only the leaſt
room in it; both which are ſo eaſie to take
off, that a few words will be enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
them.</p>
               <p>Page 297, &amp; 300. <hi>First then, That the ſoul
is not a Substance, body-like extended, for cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
indiviſible, for thinneſs penetrable,</hi> (which
ſeems to be that draught of a ghoſt which
our Author has ſome kindneſs for, and has
both roundly helpt on and filled up) <hi>is thus
to be made out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis given out that ghoſt, as well as the
ſubſtance of body innerly, is ſuch a thing, as
is alwaies the ſame, as much as God is; ſo that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101488:34"/>
if you ſhift it, you quite and clean undo it.
But now that ghoſtly being which enlivens
the body of man, if it were ſtretched out
with the body, would be as ſurely not the
ſame, but ſhifted and changed, as the body it
ſelf is: therefore we gather rightly it muſt
not be co-extended with it at all. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it in more words ſtands thus: the body
is not only reeking out whole ſteams of little
unſeen off-ſhoots, and taking to it as many
more, but over and above 'tis taking in a
daily minglement of bigger bodies, by what
we eat and drink, which ſplicing in their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſhives, within the croud of pieces that are
clinging cloſe together, at once grow one
with the body, and give further bigneſs to
the body; and alſo, as it may happen, the
body may be almoſt as much leſsned, by lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
off its branches, as 'twas bigned by the
growing of its trunck. Now 'tis ask'd, does
this extended ghoſt within the body biggen
and leſſen with it, or does it not? The ſoul
that I was quickned with at birth day, is the
ſame that I am quickned with at this day, but
the body that I have now is bigger than that
which I had then: Is my ſoul bigned or is it
not? If it be not, it reaches then only the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
ſhare of that body which I now have, the
greater being ſoul-leſs; but if it be bigned,
then 'tis not the ſame it was, any more than
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101488:34"/>
my body; nor to be ſure, is it ſo much the
ſame, as God is, who is ſo the ſame as to be
neither bigger nor leſs. Again, if I have an
arm or a leg cut off, my body is leſsned; but
I ask whether my ſoul be or not? If not, then
have I forſooth ſome pieces of my ſoul jet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of my body, ſome in it; and when
I walk, that aſſignable, but indiviſible part
of my ſoul, which was in my leg, comes ſhove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
after me, and that in my arm is ſwingling
by me, in ſuch a ſhape of air, as takes up that
room, that my leg and arm did, when limbs
of my body; But if my ſoul does not thus
featly ſtick out of my body, then it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
at the off-cut, and ſo my ſoul is not the
ſame that 'twas before, but leſs. Beſides,
when the ſoul draws back ſo, into what does
it draw? Into it ſelf it cannot, for 'tis already
ſo cloſe pack'd that it can be no cloſer; if it
could be cloſer, it muſt be from ſome empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
within, but becauſe it muſt alwaies needs
be brim full, there can be none, and if there
were any ſuch, it might then be cut a pieces
body-like; for, with thoſe that hold this, it
ſeems the reaſon why an atome, as well as
why a ghoſt, cannot be cloven, is nothing but
becauſe it ſticks ſo cloſe together, that no
emptineſs can come between; a thing being
cleaveſome, not from its bulkineſs, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
emptineſs mingled. Again, on the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101488:35"/>
other hand, if the ſoul were as cloſe as it
could be at firſt, (and ſo it muſt be, or elſe
be out of kind,) then what it has put forth
ſince of it ſelf, to keep even with the growth
of the body, has left ſuch little emptineſſes
within, (the body by waxing, having crack'd
a many holes in it,) that 'tis now, at manhood,
as like to be ſhorn in pieces as the body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the Soul be not retched out
with the body, but ſettles in ſome room
whence it may beſt, by unknown reins, ſway
the whole body; then 'tis ask'd, whether
that room be cleaveleſs or not: If it be the
Maw or Stomach, the whirl-pool of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in the blood, the brain, the water of it,
or the <hi>Glandula pinealis</hi> in it, (which ſome or
other have ſet out for it,) they being all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
the buſineſs would be the ſame as if
'twere in the whole body: If it be but in one
atome or leaſting in the body, then a child
would have more ſoul to its body than a
man, and ſhould thence ſeem more a man,
there being more atoms in the bigger than in
the leſs body. Beſides the body being all
over ſpending ſome and getting others, that
atome in which the ſoul firſt lodg'd, may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhift rooms in the body, or quite ſlip out
of it, as well as any others that do ſo; and ſo
for ought I know, my ſoul was whilom in my
head, and ſometime in my toe, and after at
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101488:35"/>
my fingers end, according as that atome in
which it dwelt, chanced to be bounced about
for elbow-room: and I may have been I
know not how many men ſince I was born,
according as that atome hapned to leave me,
and another popped into its ſtead; I being
I, no longer than I have that in me, in which
my ſoul is.</p>
               <p>From the whole then look'd back upon
but wiſtly, it ſeems that Gods everlaſtingneſs
may be <hi>all at once,</hi> or a beginningleſs endleſs
now, and time that is ſucceſſive be together
with it, without making that ſo; as well as
our ſouls which are <hi>all together,</hi> may be every
where, where the body is, without having
parts, as that has: which latter, while we are
fain to yield, it ſeems but unhandſome we
ſhould make a boggle at the former.</p>
               <p>Withall, it were not perhaps amiſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that a main thing which has put a cheat
upon the underſtanding herein is this; When
eternity is ſaid to be an everlaſting now, and
immenſity as an every where cleaveleſneſs,
ſome have been ſo hard with it, as to ſtrain
from it what belongs to a now of time, and a
leaſt of body: whereas both of them ſtanding
off in their <hi>whole kind,</hi> 'tis impoſſible they
ſhould hold together in <hi>ſome part;</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they ſo differ as things infinite and finite,
'tis impoſſible, the agreement that we make
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101488:36"/>
between them in words, ſhould be by making
that which is everlaſting, the leaſt part of
that, which is but a while laſting, and that
which is beyond all bounds the leaſt ſhare of
that little thing, which has bounds. That
eternity therefore is called a <hi>now,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity
a thing <hi>indiviſible,</hi> hence 'tis, and
hence only: to wit, every part of laſtingneſs
beſides a <hi>now,</hi> is <hi>onwardly</hi> as well as <hi>bounded,</hi>
and every part of bulk beſides the <hi>leaſt,</hi> is
<hi>cleaveſome</hi> as well as <hi>bounded;</hi> now 'tis better
to call them by words ſpeaking <hi>finite barely,</hi>
which <hi>one</hi> thing they are not; than by words
ſpeaking <hi>finite and ſucceſſive,</hi> or <hi>finite and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,</hi>
which <hi>two</hi> things we are ſure they are
not; and though a point be the leaſt of
boak, and a now the ſhorteſt of time, yet
they may ſpeak everlaſtingneſs, and allfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs,
upon another ſcore, (as much as we
can, that is, not as much as they ſhould,) for
all their ſhorteſtneſs and leaſtneſs, as well as
the longeſt or the biggeſt, if they could be
brought in without other unfitneſſes; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them would come any nearer to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs,
or everywhereneſs, than the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and the leaſt do; but would, to be ſure,
be further off from them, by taking in more
things which they have not, nor can have.</p>
               <p>Therefore when our Author tells us (page
384.) of a <hi>now</hi> longer than Ages, and a being
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101488:36"/>
unretcht out, that ſhould be more than one
that is, 'tis nothing to the buſineſs: for we
only call Gods Everlaſtingneſs a <hi>now,</hi> to clear
it of as many things as we can that would
make it <hi>on and on,</hi> as things Time-laſting are;
and Gods All-fillingneſs an <hi>altogether,</hi> to
looſen it from any thing of <hi>ſunderſhip,</hi> which
all extended Beings have: not but that one
is boundleſly more than all the Nows of
Time, and the other boundleſly more than
all the Clefts of Body; but foraſmuch
as we want words wherewith to name them
what they are, we take thoſe that have leaſt
to do with Time and Body, which they are
not. In a word, Everlaſtingneſs is no more
All at Once, as a Now of Time is, becauſe
'tis not <hi>thing enough</hi> to be a while, than it is
it ſelf Timeſom; nor is All-fillingneſs any
more unextended, as an Atome is, that is,
becauſe 'tis not <hi>thing enough</hi> to be recht out,
than it is it ſelf extended: but Everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is quite another thing infinitely from
what Time is, and the parts of Time are; and
Every-whereneſs is quite another thing infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
from what Bulk is, and the cleavings
of Bulk are: But becauſe our mind gives us,
that Time ſhould be liker to Eternity, and
Bulk liker to Immenſity, than any other
bounded things are, we chooſe the renableſt
words belonging to the former, wherewith
to ſet forth the latter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:101488:37"/>
Perhaps the underſtanding may draw
ſomewhat nearer the thing as 'tis, by taking
the next thing that ariſes from Soul, which
is <hi>thinking,</hi> together with a next thing that
ſtreams from Body, which is <hi>roomthyneſs;</hi>
thoughtſomneſs ſetting full as cloſe to the
very ſtamp or inmoſtneſs of a thinking Being,
as boak or roomthyneſs does to the Being
that is Bodyſom; ſo that if I would have
bulk or roomthyneſs do any thing, it muſt
be ſuch a thing for all the world as I would
have Body do, <hi>&amp; vice verſa,</hi> or heads and
heels, ſo I may have it become big or little,
ſhow of this or of that ſhape, ſtir or ſtand
ſtill, becauſe theſe are things that I can have
Body do: In like manner, if I would have
Ghoſt do any thing, it muſt for all the
world be ſuch another thing as I would
have thought or thinking do, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand; for if every thing muſt <hi>do</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as <hi>'tis, thought</hi> being as much an inmate
in the very heart of the thinking Being, as
<hi>bulkineſs</hi> is in the very inſide of Body, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, but that that which is ſo much of
Ghoſt in its <hi>Being,</hi> ſhould be very much ſo
too in its <hi>doing;</hi> as <hi>outſtretchedneſs</hi> which <hi>is</hi>
ſo much <hi>of</hi> Body, <hi>does</hi> as much <hi>like</hi> Body. If
then I would have <hi>thought</hi> to be here or
there, in a great thing or in a little, it muſt
do theſe things the neareſt that can be to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101488:37"/>
what a <hi>Ghoſt</hi> would do about them; now I
find my thoughts are here and there, without
moving hither and thither Body-like, and
in a great thing or a ſmall one, without being
great or ſmall themſelves; and thence I think
I may freely gather, that Ghoſt would do
ſo too, which is of all things in the world
the next to it, and the root of it: Inſomuch,
that as there may dwell as many thoughts
upon <hi>Regiomontanuſes</hi> Fly, or <hi>Tredeskins</hi>
chain'd Flea, as upon a Firſt-rate Kings man
of War, or the greateſt Hall-place of the
greateſt <hi>Keiſar,</hi> (while thoughts being off in
their whole kind from the works of Handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts,
they muſt needs be off too from what
befalls them as ſuch); ſo there may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
as much Soul in the ſhaplings or tiny
keeles of the great <hi>Malpighiuſes</hi> eggs within
the ſix hours ſetting, as was in the foul ſtalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lundging body of that <hi>og</hi> of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> at
the utmoſt bulk to which the Rabbins have
beſwoln him: And, to end, as much of Gods
Everlaſtingneſs in the ſhorteſt <hi>now,</hi> as in the
longſomneſs of a thouſand years, and as much
of his All-fillingneſs in the <hi>least</hi> of bodies, as
in the greateſt throng of them: for why,
much and little, ſhort and long are no more
akin to Ghoſt or what holds to it, than think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is to Body or its belongers; it being as
likely to take the ſcantling of a ſtone by a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101488:38"/>
chain made of thought after thought, which
only haunt the ghoſt of a thinking Being, as
to take the meaſure of Gods All-fillingneſs
from bulk or extention, which ſticks as cloſe
to Body.</p>
               <p>But there comes up another Argument by
the by, which may happily at firſt bluſh
ſeem to have more tiew in it than all the
ſtands we have met with hitherto, and that is
in ſhort thus.</p>
               <p>P. 383.<hi> Suppoſe God ten thouſand years ago
to have made a world, and then to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made
it, and after to have made this, or (which
is all one) ſuppoſe this to be benothing'd, and
ſome ten thouſands of years hence another to be
made; Now if there were not time between
them, there would be one upon the nick of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
when yet we have ſuppoſed a long while
betwixt them; And if there would be time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, then we are quite broke, inaſmuch
as time may then be unmade, and of it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
timeſom Beings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which the anſwer is, firſt: If it were
not eaſier to take up things upon truſt, than
to frame Arguments, we had never been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
with this which hangs ſo ill together:
For to ſuppoſe God before any thing elſe was
made to make ſomething, and then to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make
all that he had made, and leave nothing
as he found nothing, and yet to leave ten
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101488:38"/>
thouſand years or ſome ten thouſands; is to
ſuppoſe God to leave nothing, and yet to
leave ſomething: for ten thouſand years, or
ſome ten thouſands, are, in my mind, as much
ſomething as the other were that were made
nothing; and I believe it would hold any
man as many thouſand years as there are
years in the thouſands, to bring it but cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly
off, how ten thouſand years between
ſhould not be time between, or how ten
thouſand years ſhould not be ten thouſand
years.</p>
               <p>But taking it for granted that we ſhall be
bated the ſuppoſition in this unweildy
draught of words, and only be brought to
this ſtreight or dead lift, whether if God
ſhould make a world, and a while after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate
or make it nothing, and again ſhould
make another, and ſometime after benothing
that likewiſe, and laſtly, ſhould over and
above make a third World, would there be
Time between theſe made or unmade
Worlds? and would one be before or after
the other, or would they not?</p>
               <p>To this we anſwer round-dealing-wiſe,
There would be no Time at all between
them, nor would one be before the other or
after the other, nor, in any other meaning
than as they are in Gods Everlaſtingneſs,
would they be together. The reaſon of this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101488:39"/>
ſhort anſwer ſtands thus: There being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but everlaſting God beſides them, in
whom there is nothing of timeſom onward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
nor ground upon which to faſten fore
and aft, there can be no ſuch thing as Time,
or fore, or aft, at all. And we are withal to
know, that the ground why we give after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſome things in the World, is from the
things that were former, ſo as until we come
at a firſt; and formerneſs to other things,
from the things that will be afterward, ſo as
until we come to a laſt; inſomuch as ſome
things, even in this World, may not be fore
<hi>and</hi> aft, but only fore <hi>or</hi> aft: the firſt thing
in the world that was made being <hi>after</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
for why, nothing was before it; and
the laſt thing in the world that ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made,
being <hi>before</hi> nothing, becauſe there
ſhall be nothing after it: as what we gave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
about, and namely, the whole world
now in being, is neither <hi>before</hi> nor <hi>after;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is nothing <hi>beſides</hi> but God, of
whom it cannot be <hi>rightly</hi> ſaid, he was <hi>before</hi>
or will be <hi>after,</hi> but that he alwayes <hi>is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this ſhould come unlookt for to the
Readers underſtanding, it will may-hap ſeem
more kindly further on, when we come to
ſtrengthen it with an anſwer of the ſame ſort,
about its twin-brother, outworldiſh empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:101488:39"/>
The little that is yet behind, is the anſwer
that our Author would fain give to that moſt
unanſwerable Argument againſt a ſucceſſive
and diviſible everlaſtingneſs, and every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whereneſs;
to wit, Whether the parts of it be
finite or infinite?</p>
               <p>Which with him is twofold, 1. Enough or
abundantly, 2. More than enough, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundantly:
Enough, by acknowledging
that <hi>it cannot be anſwered at all,</hi> (p. 402.) And
then over and above, to that hard ſaying, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
put to finite can't make infinite</hi> he ſays,
A ſet number cannot indeed, yet nothing
with-holds, but that from an infinite tale of
finites there may at length ariſe an infinite,
as who ſhould ſay, from an infinite twenty or
twenty one, there ſhould ſtart up an infinite:
<hi>what you will;</hi> for every number being even
or odd as thoſe are, there is not a pin to
chooſe whether you take one of them or
ſome other; that muſt be as even or as odd to
the full as one of them is, and that at the laſt
be ſuch a number as you may put one more
to unto all Eternity, or be a numberleſs num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or a number which is not a number,
which is the very pith, and marrow, and
heart, and ſtrength of a fineneſs. And, as to
the back door that belongs to this, which is,
that The number by which we are to tell the

nothing call'd ſpace or roomthineſs; which,
that 'tis every way infinite, (though made

being as clear to us that 'tis not ſo, but boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

much as they will make for that, ſo much
will they make againſt this.</p>
               <p>Now having thus far unbenighted ourſelvs,
and clear'd our way in the foregoing from
all that lumber that could hitherto be ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
on, 'tis hoped we may have leave to
ſettle Gods whole Everlaſtingneſs, as untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
and altogether unbeclogg'd with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs;
and as for any other of the name
that ſhould be outward, that the ſame is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
nothing but the airineſs of thinking:
and withal, that Time and timeſom Beings,
this time-laſting World, and every while-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101488:40"/>
thing in it, is neither early nor late, as
the ken is taken of it by God Almighty; but
that earlineſs and lateneſs ſticks to the things
made, as made and not being unbeginning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

but all the things that are <hi>early</hi> or

               <p>Which is the firſt undertaking, in the ſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of things, ſo as our underſtandings
might beſt come at them, that is, by laying
them as near as we can to the underſtanding
of that Being, who is ſo all Mind as to be
nothing Body: whence we have ſeen how
the laſtingneſs of the World and made
things, bears it ſelf to ſuch a Being; which
was the uppermoſt thing, the mind was like
to ſtart, in its thoughts about them.</p>

               <p>THe next to this, is the Room that the
World takes up; which body-haunter
of roomthineſs, that we may rightlieſt know,
we ſhall do by it as we did by laſtingneſs;
(time and Room being fellows,) which as
we brought for that end before Gods Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101488:41"/>
ſo we ſhall ſearch what this will
be, as it ſtands towards Gods All-fillingneſs.</p>
               <p>As then the abiding of the World from firſt
to laſt, was nothing but a <hi>now</hi> to Gods <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beingneſs,</hi>
ſo the bulk of the World from leaſt
to greateſt, will, I think, fall out to be but a
<hi>cleavleſs thing</hi> to his <hi>All-fillingneſs:</hi> For as
Gods Eternity is not endleſs longſomneſs, ſo
neither is his Immenſity unbounded out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretchedneſs;
but as his everneſs is all at
once without before and after, ſo his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meetſomneſs
is altogether, without here and
there: and ſo ſtill, as the Worlds abiding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long, makes no length in his Everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but 'tis yet as to that all at once, ſo its
bulk being wide, makes no wideneſs in his
All-fillingneſs, but 'tis nevertheleſs, as to
that, altogether: For, 'tis as impoſſible that
God ſhould be in Room, which is one of the
hangers on to Body, as that he ſhould be in
Time, which is another. When therefore
we ſay that God is every where, it muſt have
the ſame reſpect to Place, that his being paſt,
at hand, and to come, has to Time. As then
God does as <hi>truly</hi> abide, after the way of his
everlaſting nowneſs, as other things do after
the guiſe of their timeſom running on and
on, without being himſelf timeſom, like
them: So God is as <hi>truly</hi> every where, after
wayes becoming his altogetherneſs, as other
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101488:41"/>
things are by the way of their bulkineſs,
without being himſelf extended, like to
them. And as to thoſe other ſtainings of the
word as 'tis given to Body, we are wholly
to forewarn them in this buſineſs; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is a word, which though the Schools
have markt for another thing than locality,
yet betokens too much <hi>ex analogiâ nostri,</hi>
and, as 'tis often made to ſpeak, is almoſt
quite embrew'd in Body if not altogether,
our ſouls in the meaning of it, can hardly be
ſaid to be any where; and I believe, if we
were all Ghoſt, and nothing elſe in the world
were Body, we ſhould not readily know
what to do with it, or ever well reach the
meaning of it; for ſo much does it hang to
motion, which I think is altogether befaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Body, that 'tis thought by thoſe that
can beſt brook the word, that a thing may
move from one <hi>whereneſs</hi> to another, as eaſily
as Body may from one <hi>place</hi> to another. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I can frame in my mind as eaſily as
others, that ten thouſand Angels as well as
one, may be altogether on a needles point,
(they being all throwfareſom alike), yet it
would crack my brain to find ſo many
wherneſſes there, to ſtow each of them in.
Had there never been any bodies, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſouls, made, I cannot yet think there
would ever have been ſuch a queſtion, as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101488:42"/>
where are your thoughts? they being only
ſaid there to have a <hi>whereneſs</hi> where bodies
have a <hi>room.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus a Mathematical point or Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
figure are no where, good and evil are no
where, this Treatiſe, before written here,
was no where; yet it as truly was before the
writing, (and ſo the others before the doing,)
as 'tis now, whilſt written; the words are
only here, the meaning's by them ſet forth,
as much no where as before: ſo true is it,
that whatever is, is ſomewhere, is untrue.</p>
               <p>Now everywhereneſs, which is the word
by which we ſet out Gods All-fillingneſs,
ſounding as if it were a gathering together of
all the rooms that may be taken up in the
World, or in unbounded boak without the
World, ſeems no more fit to mete out Gods
Immenſity by, than a chain of the nows of
Time are, by which to mete out Gods Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
the one ſpeaking as much diviſion, as
the other does ſucceſſion. When therefore
we ſay that God is every where, we muſt
mean that he is not ſo ſomewhere, as not to
be elſewhere; and that there is nothing <hi>there,</hi>
but all things <hi>here</hi> to his unmeteſomneſs, as
there is nothing paſt or to come, but all <hi>now</hi>
to his everlaſtingneſs.</p>
               <p>A thing is only <hi>there,</hi> to me, in behalf of my
being <hi>here,</hi> and not <hi>there;</hi> for when I am
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101488:42"/>
                  <hi>there,</hi> the thing is clothed with <hi>hereneſs:</hi> ſo
becauſe God cannot be now <hi>here</hi> and
not <hi>there,</hi> or now <hi>there</hi> and not <hi>here,</hi> 'tis clear
that the thereneſs or hereneſs was nothing
belonging unto God, but grounded in the
things here or there; for in cloſe ſpeaking
whilſt God is every where, he cannot be
<hi>there,</hi> becauſe <hi>there</hi> would be <hi>here</hi> to him, we
are then ſpeaking of two things, by ſome ſuch
words as are bounded by one of them. And
indeed <hi>whereneſs</hi> is a word of ſo much nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs,
that it does not reach the <hi>All</hi> of
thoſe things which it moſt cleaves to, that is,
of bodies: foraſmuch as it may rightly be
ſaid the <hi>whole world</hi> is no where; for becauſe
we can't ſtep out of the world and becken it
or point to it, as there; nor while we are in
it, ſay, 'tis here, becauſe 'tis as much there or
yonder as here; nor can we ſay 'tis every
where, 'tis as much too little for that as too
big for the other, and God alone is, or can
be ſo; it muſt then be remarkably no where,
if ſo be, that which is neither to be ſhown
here nor there, nor to be underſtood every
where, be aſſignably no where.</p>
               <p>What we gather hence, is not that the
words are not to be uſed, or that 'tis blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
in them that ſpeak ſo, but only that
we remember when we do, that ſuch words
don't anſwer the thing ſpoken of ſo as they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101488:43"/>
do bodies, though we muſt not forſake them,
only becauſe we cannot frame others that
will come nearer; though they be not the
beſt that were to be wiſht, they are for ought
is known, as good as any we can come at.
Thus, if I ſay I love ſuch a thing at my heart,
I do not mean you ſhould underſtand me as
if my love were ſeated any where in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
belly, as my heart is; if you rend out
my heart 'tis not to be found there, becauſe
it was a thing rooted in my manhood, not
placed in my body: ſo do but unſtring my
ſoul and body, though you leave my heart
in the ſame place, the thing is gone, and ſo
gone as to be no where elſe too; and yet I
cannot ſpeak plainer Engliſh, nor be better
underſtood.</p>
               <p>And this way of ſpeaking has ſo good
footing, that in the Book of books it ſelf,
we find not only the ſame oftentimes, but
even a ſtep beyond it ſometimes; whilſt not
only the things of body are given to things
not body, but even bodyhood it ſelf is. Thus
we read of the body of ſin, and the limbs of
it, or members upon earth, as uncleanneſs and
worldly-mindedneſs; which nevertheleſs are
ſuch moral beings, whoſe kind of exiſtence
is not a being any where in the world, but
according to, or ſwerving from a Law, which
when they do they only are, and when they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101488:43"/>
do not are not, vvhich fills up the whole of
their Being, without any further being any
vvhere.</p>
               <p>Our ſouls are indeed ſo far ting'd with bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy,
that as 'tis hard for us to think hovv there
ſhould be an abiding ſo unlike to ours, as we
are creatures, as not to be lengthned out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the rate that vve are; ſo 'tis hard to
think there ſhould be a vvhereneſs ſo unlike
to ours, as we are creatures vvith body, as
not to be boakt out after the vvay that vve
are. Time not being vvrought out into any
outvvard ſhape or roomthineſs, vvherevvith
to ſmite the ſenſe, vve can more eaſily think
it ſvvallovved up in Gods Everlaſtingneſs, in
vvhich vve alſo frame nothing of ſhape or
bulk, than to have the vvorlds vvhole
throng of hard, vvide, and off-ſtanding bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
ingulfed in ſuch an immenſity as has
nothing at all of bulkineſs in it.</p>
               <p>Whereas now, vve ought to mend this
thought, by remembring that the things that
are hard, ſoft, vvide, off, ſtirr'd, and ſuch
like, are only ſo among themſelves; as all
things touching ſenſes, are only ſo to thoſe
that have them: ſo that vvere all ſeeing
things ſightleſs, there vvould be no colours
nor ſhovvs; all hearers deaf, no ſounds nor
dins; all feelers numb, nothing handleſom; all
taſtleſs, nothing reliſhing; all unſmelling, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſcented.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:101488:44"/>
Beſides, were they all Ghoſt who are now
body and ghoſt, there would be to them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
impenetrable, or that could not be
drill<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d through, nothing hard, ſoft, bulkie or
ſtirr'd; as there are no ſuch things now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to God, Angels or Devils, how ſtrong
ſoever it may be rooted in our minds, that a
thick, hard, ſtirr'd Being is ſo in it ſelf, as
well as to ſome other Beings.</p>
               <p>To cloſe up this, we are to witt, that thoſe
things that we get knowledge of by the help
of our ſenſes, we know by ways more off
from their kindly draughts or ideas, than
thoſe we take in, by the workings of reaſon
upon experiments wiſely made, and remarks
heedfully laid: Thus the knowledge of heat
that we have from the <hi>feeling</hi> of it, is far
more off from the right knowledge of it, or
ſuch as may likelieſt become God, than the
notion of it according to the <hi>great Lord Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
in his <hi>forma calidi;</hi> inaſmuch as body,
and the cleavers to it, are further off from
the God-like nature, than the ſoul is, and
its ways of working are.</p>
               <p>Senſe has ſo much to do in the miſ-ſhewing
or diſguiſing of things to us, that if there be
but a great or little change in us, 'tis all one
as if there were ſuch in them. Were we but
ſo long clear of body, as to furniſh an idea
or draught of all the laws of doing, ways,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101488:44"/>
and powers of the Beings, to be ſet awork in
the framing of a Watch, ſuch as we may beſt
think a Ghoſt has; and upon embodying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
ſhould find it of ſome hiew and bulk,
with ſuch and ſuch motions, hard, cold, dry,
ſmooth or rough, and the like; hear it beat,
ſmell to it, and the like; the thing, though
the ſame, would ſurely ſeem much another
thing to us, thus chang'd at home: Or did
we but ſo take in things with the naked eye
only, as we do by the ſundry ground glaſſes,
or Teleſcopes, Microſcopes, Multiplying-glaſſes,
Priſms, or through died glaſſes, the
late Empty Tubes, through the hollow of the
hand, upon a piece of Perſpective, we muſt
then hold, that which is now no bigger than
a mite, to be as big as a ſpider; what is far
off, to be at hand; what of one colour, to
be of another; what is flat, to be hollow;
what is one, to be two or ten; eſpecially if
helpt on by ſuch a ſenſe of feeling as we have,
when, laying one finger upon another, we roll
a pea upon a board; and ſuch an hearing by
ſome inward ſleight, as in an eccho, by an
hollow without: ſo that we muſt needs then
reckon the world another thing from what
'tis, and as rightly too as we reckon it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
now, inaſmuch as we go upon the very
ſame grounds.</p>
               <p>Nor does reaſon miſtake only when it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101488:45"/>
builds upon ſenſe, but when it deals too
with thoſe liſts and cravings that keep the
lower houſe of the ſoul. Thus ſhe that is the
darling of the Lovers heart, be ſhe what ſhe
will, is the beſt in nature; the more he loves,
the better ſhe is and does, and, as long as the
fire burns, holds on to be and do: but as
ſoon as ever it begins to be winter with the
heat, 'tis ſpring with the faults, and as the
one grows on to cold, the other grows up to
great: and all this, not becauſe ſhe is another
ſhe, but becauſe the love is another love.
Now if we may be thus benighted in our pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
likes and diſlikes, notwithſtanding we
have the light of reaſon to ſhine within, and
the whole World beſides to ſet us right with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
who are we that we ſhould take upon
us to ſay, This wide World is that very ſame
thing that ſenſe ſayes 'tis?</p>
               <p>And further, to beget warineſs about
ſenſe; we may find that as 'tis too low and
ſcant to give us the marks of Ghoſt, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
its tools or organs are ſluggiſh, and,
taking up room, can bring home no errands
of moments or atoms, it asking time and
place, it ſeems, for the doing every thing in,
that it does: So on the other ſide, the ſoul
is too high bred to give us any rational ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of the awarings of ſenſe, as heat, cold,
wetneſs, dryneſs, hardneſs, ſoftneſs; which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101488:45"/>
had never been known by us, if we had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had that reaſon which makes us men, and
not thoſe ſenſes that make us animals or
earthly feelers.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things we feel, we don't know, nor
can we by the ſenſe we have of them, give
another to know, unleſs we could alſo make
another to feel them as we do: So that a
blind man may talk as <hi>knowingly</hi> of colours,
and be as well underſtood, as one that can
ſee; for that which I talk of colour is quite
another thing than that which I ſee. A
world of men have ſeen colours ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
but, for ought we know, no man
could ever yet tell another what they were;
till to the brightning of our Iſland, our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
wonder of ingenuity, and beſt broacher
of <hi>new light,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iſa. Newton,</hi> hit upon the
thing that 'tis indeed: and now we do know
(which no man would ever have gheſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,)
that white is a medly mingling of
beams differently breaking or refrangible;
we ſee it no better than we did before. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that I once asked a blind man, who
had been ſo from his Infant-baptiſm (the
ſame water that God in goodneſs allotted to
waſh away ſin, hapning through cold and
careleſneſs to waſh away his eye-ſight,) what
kind of thing he thought whiteneſs to be?
he anſwered warily, That ſure it muſt be a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101488:46"/>
bright lightſom colour: and what blackneſs
was? he ſaid, That muſt be a dark colour;
which two took in all that he had to ſay of
colours, and that little too was utter'd from
the glimmerings of ſight in him; he having ſo
much of the Moles eye, that if he held his
face to the South and lookt up, he would
ſay whether it were day or night. And if all
our eyes had been of that <hi>make,</hi> we ſhould
have known no more than thoſe two, nor
no more of them neither. And what we do
feel of them as we are, ſets ſo cloſe to us as
we are ſuch or ſuch, that whatever wants
the tools that we have ſhall never feel the
things that we feel, the things being wholly
begotten between the organ and the object,
the tool and that it works upon. Now God
having no ſuch bodily organs by which to
take in things <hi>ſecundum habitudines noſtri,</hi> and
ſuch an have-likeneſs being as needful on the
behalf of the organ and object both, for the
begetting of a ſenſation or feeling, as the
make of ſuch a ſcrew is, to wind in to ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
or the mutual fitneſſes and yernings
of kind are, to the begetting of the like in
thoſe that do ſo, 'tis clear he can no more be
brought down to do the one, than to that
other. So that, that which to us is World
(ſeen or unſeen,) to him is Being, life, might,
ſpringſomneſs, ſelf-entwining, law of doing,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101488:46"/>
ſeed, teemingneſs, and ſuch like. Thus day
and night, light and darkneſs, are both alike
to him; 1000 years as one day, 1000 years
to come as yeſterday when it is paſt, paſt and
to come as now, impenetrable or unthrough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fareſom
as penetrable, body as emptineſs,
hot, cold, wet, dry, hard, ſoft, cleaveſom,
and the like nothing at all (no more than
they would be to our own ſouls out of the
body), heaven and earth not far and wide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder
(nor to our own thoughts that can
be now in heaven and the next now on
earth); laſtly, all bodiſhip, with thoſe its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longers
which make it ſenſible unto us, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
not at all into that idea that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
frames of them, any more than his
idea of them comes into our feeling; and his
idea or likeneſs of them being nearer to that
analogy they would bear to us were we
all ghoſt, inaſmuch as he is ſo; it follows that
there are no ſuch things as we may think be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to extended bodies, ſundred from
our gheſſes at them <hi>ſecundum analogiam ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi>
or the buſineſs they have to do one
with another <hi>ſecundum analogiam ſui;</hi> bodies
being one thing to us and themſelves, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to God and Ghoſt. So the wide,
thick, all-to-be deckt heap of viſible beings
may be ſwallowed up in the <hi>altogetherneſs</hi> of
Gods All-fillingneſs, as well as the long chain
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101488:47"/>
of ages from the worlds firſt to its laſt, in the
only one <hi>now</hi> of his Everlaſtingneſs.</p>
               <p>And this ends the ſecond Head, wherein we
were to ſhew, How the Worlds vaſtneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves
it ſelf towards Gods Immenſity. In

vvhich though they are in time are not

vvhat the World is unto our ſelves, vvho

world be boundleſs or bounded? And if
bounded, what 'tis that bounds it; whether
body or emptineſs? And if either, Whether
they be bounded or not? which ſhall be
likewiſe ſet down in ſomewhat a mingled
way, as they may lucken moſt readily to
come into mind.</p>
               <p>Having erewhile ſaid, That manifold
lengths of time coming one after other,
could never make out an Eternity, or a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
boundleſs in abiding, ſo here we ſay,
That the cleaveſom bitlings of body
heapt one upon another, can never make up
an Immenſity, or a being boundleſs in its
bulk ſomneſs: but now the world is all heapt
up of ſuch little bits: therefore we gather
thence, that it cannot be boundleſs in its
bulk. The reaſon of the thing to me is clear
thus. Every thing that may be riven apieces
may have its pieces told, and every tally
by which we tell things muſt be either even
or odd: every one that is even may have
one put to it to make it odd, every one that
is odd may have one put to it to make it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and every one that may have one put
to it is not infinite: It follows then, that if
there be no parts but may be numbred, and
no number but muſt be finite; that whatever
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101488:48"/>
is made up of parts is finite too, its parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
told by a finite tally.</p>
               <p>Now as to a number beyond the numbers
of Arithemetick, I muſt be ſo bold with it,
for once, as to ask, Whether it be even or
odd? if it be either, we have the ſame
choaks for it that we had before; and if it
be neither, then 'tis no number: for <hi>every</hi>
number (whether Arithmetical or Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arithmetical,)
is even or odd, though you
take leave to eke it out beyond the bounds
of Arithmetick, and make it a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
'tis to be underſtood you muſt not pull
out the pluck of it, and make it quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing from number: for that would not
be a <hi>number beyond</hi> Arithmetick, but <hi>a thing
beſides</hi> it; not an <hi>eking out</hi> in <hi>tale,</hi> but a
<hi>change</hi> in <hi>kind:</hi> and ſo you may as well call
it a <hi>ſhooinghorn beyond</hi> the numbers of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,
as a <hi>number beyond</hi> them.</p>
               <p>That the world which is made up of parts
finite ſhould be infinite, is to me as great a
wonder, as that God ſhould be finite: for I
think 'tis as impoſſible that that being which
has nothing in it but parts finite ſhould be
infinite, as 'tis that that being which has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it but what is infinite ſhould be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.
I cannot ſee why there may not as well
be finite things in the infinite Being of God,
as an infinite All from the finite parts of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101488:49"/>
bulk; finite ſtanding off no further from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
than infinite does from finite: 'tis even
as broad as 'tis long.</p>
               <p>But becauſe moſt men are willing to wave
the boundleſneſs of the world, ſo be it, they
may but give it, name and thing, to that ſame
emptineſs that is thought to be beyond it;
we ſhall therefore to our power rumage in
it with our wonted freeneſs, that we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
a little, whether it be ſo boundleſs
as 'tis thought to be, or whether there be
any ſuch thing at all? for having already
cut off its partner, eternal time, from the
abiding of the world, we are not o truſt, if
we can, to pare this ſame immenſe emptineſs
too from about its ſelvedge.</p>
               <p>To me indeed 'tis as likely, that the world
it ſelf ſhould be boundleſs, as that any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worldiſh
emptineſs about it ſhould be ſo; that
roomthineſs being as <hi>really ſomething</hi> beſides
God as the world is. For what is really <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
muſt be really <hi>ſomething,</hi> but that
roomthineſs is as really extended as <hi>'tis at all;</hi>
extenſion or ſpreadingneſs being the very
inwards, and indeed the <hi>very all</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>But the unluckineſs on't is, that if out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worldiſh
boak be yielded at all, it muſt
needs be yielded infinite to boot; For why,
there can be nothing thought on, ſleeping or
waking, to bound it, but that ſame thought
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101488:49"/>
that pitches upon bounds, ſlides on to room<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
beyond the bounds, imaginary <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum,</hi>
or bound and room, bound and
room <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſay the truth of it, Some have been ſo
forward to yield the boundleſneſs of <hi>ſpatium
extramundanum,</hi> that they have given it the
right hand of fellowſhip with God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;
this roomthineſs forſooth being need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the very exiſtence of an immenſe God:
thereby making it at once ſomething, bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
and before God. <hi>Something,</hi> becauſe
needful for God to dwell in, and ſuch need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
cannot be ſpoken of nothing: <hi>Bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
becauſe ſuch is that Being that muſt
dwell in it: and <hi>before God,</hi> becauſe it was
that God might have ſcope to be: and if
God had made it, it muſt have been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly;
for he might as well have liv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it a maker, as no maker: beſides, that a
being ſhould make another that it ſelf might
have room to be, is the very height and
depth of nonſenſe.</p>
               <p>And again, ſhould this dreamt or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſpace anſwer its name, and be no more
<hi>thing</hi> than a dream is, 'tis worſe to think;
how ſomewhat that is the fondling of our
addle brains ſhould be needful to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
of the ever bleſſed God who made us,
and the beſt brains we have to our heads too.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:101488:50"/>
Now I think, that as Gods Everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is in time, and boundleſly before it as to
imaginary years, without before and after,
in an ever-being now; ſo Gods All-filling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is in the world, and boundleſly beyond
it as to imaginary worlds or roomthineſs,
without any roomthy ſpreadingneſs, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible
altogetherneſs.</p>
               <p>For I bethink my ſelf, that God is as bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
in his Almightineſs as in his All-filling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Now Gods Almightineſs is within the
leaſt <hi>punctum phyſicum,</hi> or duſtling of body,
('twas made and is kept in being by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſs).
But Gods Almightineſs being
God himſelf, himſelf is there altogether: and
if the Almighty be there wholly, the All-filling
is there too in like manner; for both
is one, and leſs than <hi>wholly</hi> they cannot <hi>be
there,</hi> becauſe leſs than wholly they cannot
<hi>be.</hi> And we may as well dream of boundleſs
imaginary ſtuff for Almightineſs to work
upon, as boundleſs imaginary roomth for
All-fillingneſs to dwell in; (if it be enough
for his Almightineſs to work inwards upon
his Eſſence, ſo 'tis too for his All-fillingneſs
to dwell inwards in the ſame.) God then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as Almighty in the leaſt brack of the
world as in the whole world, he is as all-fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the ſame too as in the whole: and if
that were gone too, he would be as all-fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101488:50"/>
without it as with it; for he was as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
before there was an atome of body or
room, as he is now when there are both:
and ſo it follows, there needs neither real nor
imaginary ſcope to make way for a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
all-fillingneſs.</p>
               <p>I remember the excellent Dr. <hi>Hen. More,</hi>
whoſe ſoul may have roamed as far into
theſe ſcopes and vaſtneſſes as moſt mens in
the world, has not only (in his <hi>Enchirid.
Metaph.)</hi> made Ghoſt, as ſuch, extended;
but has ſtarted ſuch a boundleſs roomthineſs,
and as needful as God is (if I underſtand
him) as is a kind of ghoſt inwardly drilling
through the <hi>All</hi> of body, and ſuch a one too
as is ſo far a likeneſs of God himſelf, that it
wants nothing of him but only his life and
working; and ſomewhere elſe finds in his
heart to ſay, <hi>That there is a ſpace wherever
God is or any ſelf-ſubſistent Being, is as plain
to him as the</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: but, for my ſhare, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide all humour of thwarting my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
I do as verily believe, as I do any thing
I have not a word of God for, that there is
roomth no where but where body is, and
that ghoſt is ſo far from needing ſpace to be
in, that when 'tis in a world where room is,
'tis as far from taking up room as 'tis from
putting on body: nor can I but wonder,
that one who lives ſo much in the ſoul, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101488:51"/>
ſo little in the body as he ſeems to do, ſhould
find it quite otherwiſe. That worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
I do think, had his reaſons for ſo
ſteady a belief, and of that weight to him,
that his own are wont to be to others; the
ſlighting of which would not ſtrengthen,
nor the valuing of them weaken, thoſe of
ours on the other behalf, which are mainly
the following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſee this roomthineſs in the whole,
muſt as well have unaſſignable parts or ſuch
as cannot be laid out, as body has aſſignable
or ſuch as can; and though they be unlaid
out in themſelves, they may be laid out by
body laid in, as all the parts of that room
in which the world is may now be. Now I
cannot underſtand, how that which is made
up of parts, laid out or unlaid out, which
are <hi>all</hi> finite, ſhould it ſelf be infinite: and
that all are ſo I am ſure, becauſe thoſe I
know, which are altogether like the reſt
which I do not know, are ſo: and as for
parts <hi>more</hi> than <hi>all</hi> thoſe that are all thus fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
they cannot be: and if <hi>all</hi> that a thing
be made up of be finite, I cannot for my
heart think how the whole, which is <hi>no more
than all,</hi> ſhould be <hi>infinite;</hi> every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame with all the parts of it taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That ſuch a kind of thing <hi>muſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101488:51"/>
be,</hi> that God himſelf <hi>may be,</hi> ſtrikes me with
too great an awe to ſpeak it. They who
hold this wild emptineſs, hold alſo (as they
muſt) its independency on, or unbeholden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to, God himſelf: Now who would
think that there were ſuch a thing that God
ſhould be beholden to, for the Being which
he has, and that not beholden to him for
the being which it ſelf has? And to ſay, that
both are eternal as well as boundleſs, and ſo,
one was not before the other, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did ever begin to be, will take off no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the hardneſs: For, (not to ſay, that
if one could have been before the other,
ſpace had been the eldeſt,) though one was
not before the other in <hi>standing,</hi> the one was
<hi>worthy</hi> before the other in <hi>cauſality;</hi> though
God was never the cauſe of room, yet room
was ever the cauſe of God: for that was
that God might have leave to be; and had
not that <hi>ever been,</hi> God had <hi>never been,</hi> had
not that ever been <hi>without him,</hi> he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been <hi>within that; its being</hi> making way
for <hi>his being,</hi> its <hi>being room</hi> making way for
his <hi>being God;</hi> who could not be it ſeems, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he wanted room to <hi>be in,</hi> though that
could be room without his being in it, or
would be if he were out of it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they that beſtow extenſion upon
any thing elſe but body, as emptineſs, ghoſt,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101488:52"/>
and thence upon God himſelf, are not, I fear
me, very well aware of its ill-lookt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
For whoever makes God a boundleſs
extended being, may upon the ſame ſcore
make him a boundleſs extended triangle,
(one figure being as much extenſion faſhion'd
as another, 'tis neither here nor there which:)
ſome figure or other he muſt be (as to kind)
becauſe 'tis as much of the nature of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to be of ſome ſhape; as to be of ſome
roomth, unleſs we ſhould here borrow a
bucket ſomewhere and draw up a figure too
beyond all the figures in Geometry, out of
the ſame depth with the number beyond all
the numbers in Arithmetick. Already, it
ſeems, God muſt have as many ſhapes in his
unaſſignable parts with us, as all the things
of the world have in thoſe that we have
ſenſe of; their ſhape being nothing but their
bulk ſo cantled out: and what there is of
God beyond the world, being of the ſame
piece with that of him which is in it, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
put on ſhape as that does; inaſmuch as
roomthineſs there, can no more be without it
than roomthineſs here. Whence would ariſe
what I am not forward at all to ſpeak of; an
harſhneſs in theſe things not being ſo harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
as the cutting of Cork, whereby, though
you ſaw and wring the ears with the ſharm,
yet ſtill 'tis but a light buſineſs you have to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101488:52"/>
deal with; and I am thinking the unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs
will loſe nothing of its diſtaſtfulneſs
for not being named only out of dread.</p>
               <p>But now one reaſon at leaſt why the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
has been robletted in to theſe
waſtes and wildneſſes is, the forefearing, that
if emptineſs far and wide were not granted,
the world would not be bounded; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rather than make a boundleſs world,
many have choſen to yield a boundleſs ſcope
beyond it. But we are at no ſuch pend, as
we ſhould be fain to fly to either the one or
the other; for the world is not bounded by
any thing beyond, nor ought any ſuch thing,
or <hi>kind of</hi> thing to be imagined: but 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that 'tis bounded by it ſelf; its boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſs,
where 'tis bounded, ariſing as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
from its very kind, as its extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
where 'tis extended.</p>
               <p>The leading miſtake of all, I think, with
freedom to others, is this: We firſt roved in
our minds at an unbounded emptineſs, and
then <hi>thought</hi> put the world in the midſt of
it. Whereas we were alike miſtaken in the
<hi>middle</hi> and in the <hi>thing</hi> too, both which
may thank haſte; for before <hi>any thing</hi> was
<hi>made</hi> there was <hi>nothing,</hi> and therefore we
ſhould have ſtaid and thought of <hi>nothing,</hi>
but only infinite power, wiſdom, goodneſs,
truth, &amp; what other things there are in God,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101488:53"/>
whereby he vouchſafes to make known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to us. Now, for a Being whoſe very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is no other than theſe, roomth or ſpace
is no more needful, than for the dwelling of
the good things of the mind and ſoul under
thoſe names, or than there is for Univerſal, or
boak, as taken in the Mathematicks, ſtript
out of body. You may as well be earneſt for
a finite room for one, as an infinite for the
other, (and perhaps better too, inaſmuch as
one may be had, whatever the other may.)
If it be ſaid theſe are other kind of beings,
(as Moral, Metaphyſical or Mathematical.) I
anſwer, So is God too, and <hi>more other</hi> than
they are, becauſe <hi>boundleſly other.</hi> Beſides, I
think a being, that is the term of Creation,
or a piece of Gods handy-work, may live
without any room, as do the Angels, and
would do if world ſhould be no more. If
we can but get thus far then, as to think
there was no roomthineſs before the world,
(If we think there was, we find at what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril
we muſt;) 'tis eaſie enough to think fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that there is none beyond it. For 'tis
but thinking the world was made and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe beſides it, which ſurely is true,
and the thing is done: for if it <hi>were not</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world was <hi>made,</hi> nor <hi>made with the
world</hi> when the world was made, it never
<hi>was made,</hi> nor never <hi>was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:101488:53"/>
But we are not yet out of the mire, nor
like to be, until we can fairly rid our ſelves
of that load of objections with which the
men of depth and quickneſs have even over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden'd
the thing we hold. All, or all the
weightieſt of which, that we can feel for,
ſhall be diſpatcht in manner following.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1.<hi> Suppoſe we then with the learned
Dr. </hi>More,<hi> that an Archer were ſo ſeated at the
rim of the world, as to level his arrow right
through the ſelvedge of it outwards; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full strength and right aim given it, Would
the arrow fly, or Would it not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It would, and it would not, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
according as you make the ſelvedge. If
you make it as round as a Mathematical cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
it would <hi>not</hi> fly: for arrow ſtanding
in a ſtreight line, from the innermoſt or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
to the ſelvedge; and there being no more
reaſon why it ſhould warp to the right hand
than to the left, why this way rather than
that, it muſt needs ſtir no way; but ſtick
with its head at the ſelvedge, though it has
all the force given it that ſtrong-bow and
arm-ſtrong can make together. But the ſhapes
of nature being of another kind of make
than thoſe of handy-works, 'tis very likely
that the roundneſs of the world (if yet it be
round) is ſomewhat otherwiſe than a true
Geometrick circle. As we ſee the ring of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101488:54"/>
the Earth, a far leſs Ball, ends not in lines
evenly drawn from the centre thither, but is
bounded with hills and dales; and both earth
and water with manifold unevenneſſes: much
more then are we to gheſs ſuch in the bigger
roundle of the world. Whence 'tis, that the
arrow may have, by ſome lucky riſing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a Bias given it this way or that way, as
a Coach may be ſo tickly ſet upon the ſurface
of the earth, as to give it ſelf a trundling, one
way or other. So then, the motion would
be, as touching the world, in a bow or arch
of a circle, upon the very ſelvedge of it; but,
as touching the Marks-man, in a line ſtreight
enough on to the eye. For it flying in a line
as far off as it can, according to the ſteering
that was given it, it would be ſeemingly as
ſtreight as it can be at all; for the nearer the
eye comes to a great thing that is bowing, the
leſs bowing it ſeems. When we firſt make a
Neſs at Land too, it ſeems more a Neſs than
when we are leſs off at Sea; but when we
are juſt at ſhore, it ſeems to lye in a ſtreight
line with the reſt of the Coaſt. And as we
are not aware of that bow, which is made by
all things darted or ſhot in the air, ſuppoſing
the whirle of the earth; becauſe we our
ſelves are running the ſame round (as the
great <hi>Galileo</hi> has altogether made out): ſo
neither do we ken that bow that is made by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101488:54"/>
the wheeling of a Chariot onwards upon the
round ſurface of the earth (whether it ſtirs
or ſtands ſtill); but we ſee it run as much flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
or in <hi>plano,</hi> ſetting aſide the little ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
and fallings of uneven ground, as if the
outſide of the earth were a ſhire flat or level.
Nor could Sir <hi>Fra. Drake</hi> have ever gather'd
from the eye, that he ſail'd otherwiſe than
in a level; when yet he ſail'd in a circle
round about the earth. As then, whatſoever
moves as much in a flat as it can for the
earths rim, we reckon to have moved in a
flat altogether: ſo whatever flies in as
ſtreight a path as the bow of the worlds big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
rim will give leave, we, if there, would
count wholly ſtreight.</p>
               <p>And that ſuch ſeeming ſtreightneſs would
not ſhow ſidewiſe but forwards, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
from hence. If I were to look through
the earth at an enlightned hole or Well,
reaching from me to him that ſets foot to
foot with me on the other ſide, the hole
would ſeem <hi>all downwards</hi> to me, although
in it ſelf it were half downwards half up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
As well then may an arrow gliding
on the ſelvedge of the world, ſeem to me,
there ſtanding, <hi>all upwards</hi> and nothing at
all ſidewiſe.</p>
               <p>But to give the objection all the lifts we can,
Suppoſe we inſtead of this Shooter, a man leauing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101488:55"/>
his ſide againſt the ſelvedge of the world,
with his arm down by it, Could he ſpread
forth his arm or could he not? If he could,
then he did it in that emptineſs which is
gainſay'd: For we will think him to bear
it that way, and for the nonce to hinder all
other wayes: and if it ſhould but upon the
ſhove flie upwards or downwards, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than he aims it, he would quickly be
aware of it, by the change of that poſture
which it would then have to the reſt of his
body. And if it could not, when thus hem'd
in, be put forth into the emptineſs at all,
What hinders it?</p>
               <p>To this we anſwer in the firſt place, 'Tis
hugely queſtionable to me, Whether ſuch a
poſture may be allow'd as ſtanding with the
loadſtoneſhips or magnetiſms of the world,
and the ballancings of a body, ſuch as that of
mans is. For as we ſee 'tis impoſſible to have
the earth, (in this our roundle) otherwiſe
than beneath us; ſo 'tis agreeable, that we
cannot otherwiſe have the heaven, in the
world, than as to ſence above us. The thing
taken up then, grates as much upon the face
of Dame Nature, as to ſuppoſe a man lying
along in the open air at level, or in a line pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to the plane of the Horizon.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Bating the Objection all
this ſeeming roughneſs, We anſwer: If the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101488:55"/>
man were ſo laid at the worlds ſelvedge, as
to have it on the ſide of him, not above his
head, his arm hanging by the ſame ſide; if
by a ſudden ruſh of the ſpirits into it, he
ſhould give it an heave outwards, and from
the ſame inward free ſpring of motion ſhould
keep it from ſlipping awry: then would not
the arm ſtir at all, there being no place left
for it to ſtir into, it being all one as if he
ſhould thruſt it againſt ſome hard body at
reſt, of too ſtout a withſtanding to yield way
or give back. If it be further ſaid, it muſt
ſure flie outwards, becauſe 'tis lifted that
way, and there's <hi>nothing</hi> to forbid its coming
there: 'tis further anſwered, The knack or
contrivance of the <hi>Frame</hi> of the world for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
it; and that is <hi>ſomething,</hi> and ſomething
too as powerful to check or bind motion,
as the way-laying of a groſs unweildy body,
or any thing elſe that we, by ſence and trial,
find enough to ſtop the career of a body in
its ſwifteſt hurry.</p>
               <p>If this anſwer ſeems harſh or ſtretched, we
ſhall eaſily ſlacken and ſoften it by a clearer
Inſtance nearer home. Suppoſe we then a
bore through the heart or centre of the
earth from outſide to outſide, into which let
a man be thought falling down: when he
comes at the centre he falls no further, but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101488:56"/>
is as ſurely ſtopt there, as if the hole were
bored no further, but had the whole pillar
of the earths half-thwart line, or ſemidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of even bore to withſtand it. Now in
this Inſtance it may as well be ſaid, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>nothing</hi> in the Tube to hinder, Why
ſhould not the man fall further, the air of
the Well being all of a make? What could
not ſtop him in one place could not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And indeed, if the air upon any ſcore
could check the downfal, it vvould ſooner
do it at the top of the earth, vvhere the
ſpring of the air belovv vvas ſtronger,
though its vveight aloft lighter; than in the
middlemoſt, vvhere the pent or bear of it
beneath vvas nothing at all, (there being
no <hi>beneath</hi> at all,) though the vveight above
much more, the ſpring of the earth over-ballancing
the vveight of it as to povver:
vvhich perhaps is one reaſon vvhy all dovvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals
haſten their ſpeed, by how much the
nearer they come to the earth. Novv the
anſvver to the <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> is this, That the
reaſon vvhy it ſtops there, is, not the meeting
vvith any body there of force enough to
ſtand againſt the ſhock of its motion, but
only the nice contrivance of the vvorlds
Frame: and more eſpecially the magnetiſms
and poyſes of the earthly <hi>Vortex,</hi> vvhich
vvill not allovv an heavy body left to it ſelf
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101488:56"/>
vvithin a flovvſom one that is lighter, to
buoy up.</p>
               <p>Which buſineſs of deadning the motion of
a ſtirr'd body, not from body, but the law
of body, puts me in mind of bodies or a
mans being ſtirr'd up from reſt, without any
jog from body that we are aware of, but
mainly from ſome of theſe hidden working
laws that round the world. Our ſleep is call'd
reſt, and a waking out of it, a being ſtirring:
now 'tis eaſie to mark that we are thus ſtirr'd
by thoſe wide and unſeen laws that wield
the day, while we for little dream of it.
Thus our time of waking or ſtirring is the
morning, from that even ſhare of refreſhing
ſleep, as one would think, that we are wont
to take the night before: But 'tis ſhrewdly
to be miſtruſted, that ſomething a great deal
further off, and broader ſpread, has ſome
kind of tamperings here. For if you mind it,
you will find, an hundred to one elſe, That
whether you go to bed at 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12
a clock at night, you ſhall wake at your
wonted hour next morning; (little otherwiſe
whether it begin to rain late in the evening,
at midnight, early or late in the morning,
it does likely hold up, as we ſay, by that
time the Shrews have dined): which cannot
be from that meaſure of reſt, and new breed
of quickners that have befallen the body in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101488:57"/>
the night; for why, there has been ſo much
odds in the hours of ſleep. It ſeems then,
that the thing that calls us up is <hi>Morningneſs,</hi>
or that woof and plight that the whole
tickliſh frame of worldly beings are wheel'd
into at ſuch a tide of day. Which we ſhould
never have ſprung by hunting for, had we
not thus been made aware of it, in that we
find there is ſomewhat in it, that firks us more
at ſuch a nick of time to wake and ſtir, than
the wont that we have got of reſting ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hours, can bind us down to bed and
ſleep.</p>
               <p>And here indeed 'tis mainly to be heeded,
That we are by no means to look upon the
world as a great heap of faſt and looſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
hudled up together at ſixes and ſevens
by haſt and careleſneſs, or an hugger-mugger
of meddleſom beings all at jars: but a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
frame of well-ranged bulks ſo featly ſet
together by a boundleſs cunning, that ſhould
but any one pin of it be miſdriven, or the
running of its leaſt wheel ſlipt or joſtled,
you hazard the cracking and ſplitting of the
whole. Whence 'tis, that the leaſt bitling of
it will ſo far club and fall in with the laws
that bind the whole <hi>Set,</hi> that we can ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
force bodies to cloſe with the woof or
tenor of the whole, though it lyes croſs to
thoſe little buſineſſes which they ſeem to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101488:57"/>
have been ſet about in their narrow homes:
as may be made out by inſtances, enough to
fill up a book of bulk, beſtowed upon us
from that wealthy and yet growing ſtore-houſe
wherewith the <hi>Royal Society</hi> have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt
the world, and ſingly from that of the
Noble Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> the glory of it, and <hi>Englands</hi>
too as well as the great wiſh of the whole
world beſides us. He that will but weigh
&amp; ponder in his mind what at firſt ſight puts
forth it ſelf, when looking on a Watch, where
the ſingle ſhove or heave of the ſpring,
which if the pieces of the Watch were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing'd
and born upon by it would only be
puſht forwards or by-wards, puts the Watch
thus fadg'd together and in tilter into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
round, right on, level, ſwingling, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
backwards, upwards, downwards,
and otherwayes, all becauſe 'tis a knack or
engine: and ſhall further mark, (the Watch-wrights
craft being not only the Ape of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but the very Tool, ſtill in her hand,)
that if Nature ſhould but flinch back her
hand, or the world that is round about it
ſhould but be pluckt away from it, our
Watch would without more ado be utterly
unwatcht; its being in the world being as
needful to its being a Watch, as its being
made by the skill of a Watch-maker: the
whole Watch being nothing elſe but a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101488:58"/>
and clever way of laying bodies to the
wheels and ſprings or ballancings of Nature,
as its pieces are put to the ſpring that is ſo
craftily lodg'd in it by the Workman. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs than a world being able to ſtand
upon its own legs, or do any thing after 'tis
made; all our knicknacks are but engines
within an engine, engines of the Craftſman
within the <hi>machina mundi,</hi> or a Cog put into
Natures wheel, which if one did not ſtir the
other vvould not, any more than a mill
vvould be that 'tis made for, if the vvorld
did not help it to vvind or vvater to ſet it a
vvorking, as vvell as ſtuff of vvhich to make
it. He, I ſay, vvho vvill but vveigh and ſcan
theſe things, vvill at length have ſome lovv
and underly rovings at, or at leaſt admirings
of that height and depth of vvorkmanſhip,
that this curious vvorld is vvrought up
to.</p>
               <p>But 'tis further objected from the ſame
learned hand,<hi> Though the arrow ſhoved by bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or the arm yerkt by ſpirit enlivening body,
will not be gotten into this </hi>vacuum extramun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum,<hi>yet an Angel unencumbred with body
may be there, and help either thither. For if
Angels were before the world, and the firſt of</hi>Gen.<hi> ſhould mean only the works that are ſeen
not thoſe too that are not ſeen or were the first
dayes work, and ſo existing before the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101488:58"/>
world was ſuch as 'tis as they ſhall after the
breaking up of the world by fire, or being no
wayes beclam'd with body as to ubiety or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or may be wherever God is, who must be
in outworldiſh waſts, then may we imagine them
there now, and carrying the arm or arrow thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection as faſt as it comes,
comes yet too late: For we have already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reav'd
Ghoſts of place, and tyed up that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
or belonger to bodies only. So that
'tis as impoſſible to ſeat an Angel in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worldiſh
emptineſs, as in the world it ſelf;
and as impoſſible to ſeat or ſtow it in this
world, as to ſeat moral virtue or a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
point here. 'Tis indeed ſuch a great
bellied truth that body only can be in a
room, that it has another truth in the womb
of it, which is, That no body but ſuch as is
lodg'd by with or among other bodies is in
a room: For to be in a room is to be in <hi>ſuch</hi>
a room, or in a <hi>room</hi> that may be <hi>ſhown,</hi> and
ſuch a ſhown room as that wherein another
body is not. So that if there were but one
body, it could not rightly be ſaid to <hi>be in a
room,</hi> but only to be. And in truth of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the <hi>whole</hi> world is in no place or room, as
bearing no ſtowſomneſs to any other body
about it; for want therefore of another bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
near to or far from which it ſhould be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101488:59"/>
placed, it loſes its ſtowſomneſs or location.
Every place of it the mean-while being in a
place, as having nearneſſes or farneſſes betwen
each other within the great verge; while
the whole muſt needs have them from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
or elſe can have none at all. Inaſmuch
as it cannot be ſaid of the world, 'tis in <hi>this</hi>
place, or <hi>that,</hi> or <hi>ſome</hi> other place beſides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this and that, and ſome other, would
be all one, the world taking up no leſs than
<hi>all</hi> that is; nor that 'tis here or there or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
elſe, becauſe <hi>there</hi> would be <hi>here, here
there,</hi> and ſomewhere elſe no where elſe, the
world filling up <hi>all</hi> whereneſſes; all which
would be an ill kind of medly: Therefore it
ſhould ſeem that it cannot but harſhly be ſaid,
that the world has a placeneſs or whereneſs
at all. In ſhort, Room is rather in the world
than the world in room, as thinking is in the
ſoul, not the ſoul in thinking. So that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
we ſhould never have dreamt of ſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing in a room, if our minds had
not firſt given us that the room was bigger
than the thing to be beſtow'd; any more than
we ſhould have thought of putting a thing
into a box, without we had firſt thought the
box was ſo much bigger as to hold it.</p>
               <p>The ſame likewiſe, as to another thing
befals the <hi>Mininium quantum,</hi> or the Leaſt
ſhare of the world. Cleaveſomneſs we know
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101488:59"/>
is the great hanger on to body; but yet the
leaſt brack of body cannot be broken a
pieces, becauſe 'tis already the leaſt: yet 'tis
as really body as that piece which can, and
no whit nearer ghoſt than it was when knit
to more. So place is another thing that
haunts body as much; the whole world in
the mean time not being in a place, and yet
'tis never the nearer being ghoſt: for that
the one has too little bulk to loſe any and
yet be, the other too much to have any
thing bigger wherein to take up room, or
beſides whereby to be plac'd. Yet theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longers
to body are helpful enough, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to ſet forth the nature of the things to
which we bequeath them: For we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that the ends and bounds of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
beings have things ſpoken of them much
otherwiſe than what becomes their whole,
or the bigger parts to which they belong.
Thus ſuppoſing, that as time had a beginning
ſo it ſhould have an end, and only God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be after this world as he was before
it, then the kindlieſt attribute of time, which
is ſucceſſiveneſs in abiding, would not be
true of the beginning and the end of it. For
if the firſt <hi>now</hi> were ſucceſſive, it was not
the firſt: for why, it follow'd a former; and
the laſt now could not abide, for if it did, it
was not the laſt. When therefore we ſay, All
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101488:60"/>
time has fore and aft, we muſt bar the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which had not <hi>fore,</hi> and the end which
had not <hi>aft:</hi> in the mean time it ſtill holding
good enough, that time is a ſucceſſive or
lengthning kind of abiding. The beginning or
end of time being no more time (as we call
it) than the leaſt part is the whole, and the
definition or whatneſs of a thing ought to
to be of a thing as a <hi>thing,</hi> not of the leaſt or
greateſt, firſt or laſt part or a thing, as
ſuch <hi>part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to ſtrain this yet a little further: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
God Almighty to have made another
world beyond, or which is better, beſides
this; which being a gathering of bodies, may
be ſaid to be ſomewhere, and ſomewhere
too where this world is not: and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our world alſo, it may ſtand ſo or ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ours, and ours ſo or ſo unto that, and
thereupon both of them be in a place, and
either near to or far from each other: and all
this farneſs or nearneſs, or way of ſtanding
off, by the bare making of a world over and
above this, vvithout the making any thing
of ſcope or roomth betvveen. Therefore
vvhatever there vvould be of ſuch ſcope or
roomth betvveen tvvo ſuch vvorlds, muſt
needs before the vvorlds ſo made: and, as
it follovvs, muſt be the ſame vvith that <hi>ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
imaginarium</hi> vvhich vve have been ſo
ſhie of ovvning all along.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:101488:60"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To overlook the uncouthneſs of the
thing, We will be ſo kind to the ſuppoſition
of more vvorlds, by Almighty power, as to
let it go for a thing that may be, though it
be a great deal more likely, as we may happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhew beneath, that it may not be than that
it may: And in plain Engliſh anſvver, That
ſuch a vvorld beſides this, vvould neither be
far from it, nor near to it, or any vvays med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
or make vvith it, any more than if this
vvere the only vvorld, or if inſtead of tvvo
vvorlds you ſhould there ſuppoſe two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
For the clearing up of vvhich vve are
to underſtand, That unto a ſtovvſomneſs or
local reſpect betvveen tvvo ſtovved beings,
'tis not only needful they ſhould be both
bulky; upon vvhich foot vve have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay
all ſtovvſom medlings betvveen the
vvorld and God, betvveen the vvorld and
ghoſts, or between God and the vvorld, and
ghoſt and the world, becauſe but one of
them is bulky: but 'tis alſo behoveful there
ſhould be ſomething beſides the things which
are ſtowed, to which roomthineſs ſhould as
much belong; two roomthy beings bearing
no ſtowſomneſs to each other, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their being two or two roomthy
beings, any more than two ghoſts: but alſo
upon the ſcore of roomthineſs put between
them. Now room between theſe two worlds
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101488:61"/>
being that which is denied, the argument
brought to prove it muſt by no means be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to ſuppoſe it. Imagine we now two
Angels point blank over againſt each other,
in the hem or rim of the world, there is room
between, but no roomthy or ſtowſom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect;
becauſe the two things that are there,
are ſuch as cannot be put into a place there,
and all local habitude or behaviour muſt be
between two things or more, in a place ſo or
ſo. Then let us ſuppoſe in the ſtead of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
ſome remarkable body; there is <hi>one</hi> of
the terms, <hi>body plac'd,</hi> and there is roomthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
between that and the other boundary or
term: but becauſe <hi>that other</hi> is not alſo body,
nor can, for want of being ſo, take up room,
the local reſpect is ſhier loſt, for nothing but
becauſe the third thing is no roomthy being.
A ghoſt being in it ſelf not roomthy, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear any roomthy behaviour towards
bodies that are ſo, any more than bodies
that are bulky, can bear immaterial reſpects
or thoughtſom behaviours towards ghoſts
that are ſo; roomthineſs being as much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to a ghoſt, as thinking is to a body.
Think any what they will, the world is what
it is and bodies do what they do: ſo let
roomth be, a ghoſt thinks and does the ſame
as if roomth were not. They are things that
are off in their whole kind, and one does
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101488:61"/>
nothing like the other: So that you may as
well threap one down, that a ghoſt is heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or lighter, colder or hotter, wetter or dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
harder or ſofter, whiter or blacker than
a body, as to ſay 'tis further or nearer to it,
above it or beneath it, a furlong on the
right hand, or a furlong on the left in any
other than in a borrowed meaning. As we
cannot ſay that a body has an inch or an ell
of thinking, an ounce or a pound of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
or willing: for though body and
inch, or ounce agree well enough, yet the
third thing in the bunch, that is thinking,
will not be brought to ſtick to either, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it be in ſuch borrowed meanings as when
we ſay, The love of the world is near the
heart, or the fear of God far from it,
thoughts heavy in grief, light in gladneſs,
ſoftneſs of mind, hard thoughts, and the like.)
As in our former Inſtance, body at one ſide of
the world, and room from thence to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, did cloſe well enough; but then
ghoſt at the end of it will ſtick no more to
it, than birdlime will to a thought.</p>
               <p>Moreover yet, That it cannot be ſaid of
a Ghoſt 'tis further or nearer to a body given,
may hence, I think, be ſeen. The reaſon why
we ſay this is further off than that from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is not only becauſe I cam lay a <hi>longer
line</hi> between them while ſo far aſunder, but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101488:62"/>
that it will alſo take a <hi>longer time</hi> to bring
them cloſe together. Now the motions (if
we may call them ſo) of ghoſts being all in
an inſtant, (as the darting of our thoughts
are through the world,) they can both come
home in the ſame time. If then they come
home neither <hi>ſooner</hi> nor <hi>later,</hi> nor did they
lye off either <hi>nearer</hi> or <hi>further.</hi> If their <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
together</hi> muſt be meaſured by the <hi>ſame
time,</hi> their <hi>lying aſunder</hi> muſt be meted by
the ſame <hi>metwand.</hi> So that which is nearer,
muſt be as far off as that which is further, and
that which was further, as nigh as that which
was nearer; which ſpeaks aloud that near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and farneſs had nothing to do with their
being what they were. To a ghoſt the
whole world and the leaſt bit of it are all
one. A ghoſt at one ſide of the world is as
near the other ſide as if it were in the middle,
and in the middle as near as if it were at the
edge. Now the whole world bearing no
<hi>cleaveſom</hi> behaviour to a ghoſt, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the whole or any part of it ſhould bear a
<hi>local.</hi> If we our ſelves were not body as
well as ſoul, our underſtandings would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have coped with ſuch a thing as place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or ſtowage at all. If then we ſuppoſe a
being that is bulkie, and nothing about it
that is ſo, or two beings that are bulky and
nothing between them that is ſo; though
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101488:62"/>
both theſe taken in themſelves are, after a
ſort, and like nothing but themſelves, in a
place, yet they have no local reſpect to one
another: that being in a place w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they have,
ſpeaking nothing which belongs to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their own bounds or outſides, and is
nothing in the world but their own room<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs,
and all the unlikeneſs between them
and ghoſt as to ſtowage is, that as to <hi>within</hi>
they are roomthy, and ſo in place, or rather
place it ſelf; but as to <hi>without,</hi> there belongs
nothing ſuch to <hi>them</hi> any more than to
<hi>ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If beſides the two worlds we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
manifold ghoſts laid between them
(vvhich may as vvell be as our thoughts are
vvhile vve make the ſuppoſal) ſtill they
vvould bear no place-like reſpect. For as the
placing of body betvveen tvvo ghoſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
vvould not give them a placely beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
ſo the ſtovving of a ghoſtly being as a
middle thing betvveen tvvo bodies, vvould
not give them any ſuch behaviour neither.
If then ghoſts betvveen the tvvo vvorlds
vvould not give it, ſurely nothing at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen
them could not. That cannot do this
<hi>one thing,</hi> that can do <hi>nothing</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>But vve may further be tvvitted vvith
this, If there be nothing betvveen the tvvo
vvorlds as vve have anſvvered, then the rims
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101488:63"/>
of them vvould touch.</p>
               <p>To this vve have tvvo or three things to
give in. And in the firſt place, We ſay, The
catch is ſo unphiloſophical, that that vvhich
gainſays it moſt, is moſt true. If <hi>nothing</hi> were
between them, the ſide of one would <hi>not
butt</hi> upon the other, but be <hi>inlaid</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
That one body ſhould <hi>touch</hi> another,
'tis altogether needful that <hi>ſomething</hi> ſhould
be <hi>betwixt</hi> them. For we are to mark, that
the ſmootheſt body in being has more or few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
unevenneſſes, or ridges and furrows, in its
outerneſs or ſurface. The utmoſt ſmoothneſs
we can come at by tools or otherwiſe, is full
of ſuch little ruggedneſſes, between which
lye as many little holes of air; which holes if
they could be filled up, or the little ridges
and knolls brought down to a level with
them, ſo as the ſurface might not be ſome
airſom body, but all ſuch thick or faſt body,
then this body laid to another, would be ſo
far from touching it, that it would be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than one with it, and the nearer any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
comes to this plight, the nearer it comes
to inlaying or oneneſs. The pieces of a body
do not pierce one another, but are only
clapt together at their little ſmoothneſſes as
cloſe as they can ſnug, and held there by the
poyſings of the world. Thus we ſee two pieces
of flat poliſht marble laid one upon another,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101488:63"/>
are either <hi>inlaid ſecundum quid</hi> or after a
ſort, that is, as to ſuch parting as may be
made by drawing them aſunder upwards or
downward, or elſe they are in a middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
onlaid and inlaid, which is a thing
for which we want a word; for the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth
part of that power that is but enough
to ſunder two ſuch flat <hi>abutting</hi> marbles, is
more than enough to break up the very <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying</hi>
of a ſpunge.</p>
               <p>That ſtounding and ſurprizing <hi>Eſſex
Writer</hi> in his <hi>Dialogues de Mundo,</hi> roundly
bears us down, That two ſuch worlds would
touch without any more ado; there being
no off-ſtanding betwixt them, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all between them. And all bodies
ſtanding off from each other do ſo, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of off-ſtanding or roomth put between
them. And as it follows, Two ſuch worlds
muſt club together and become one; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ground he ſhews A moreneſs of
worlds would be impoſſible.</p>
               <p>But now we are to ſhew, That that which
makes two ſides of two bodies touch, is not
the not having roomthineſs betwixt them.
There lies no roomthineſs between the ſoul
and the body, nor between God and the
world, and yet they do not touch, any more
than two bodies would do that are off
from each other. But 'tis alſo needful there
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101488:64"/>
be no poſſibility of putting a <hi>quantum</hi> or
roomth between them, where indeed they
do touch; as only thoſe things may <hi>touch</hi>
that have a <hi>mayneſs</hi> or poſſibility of having
roomth put between them. To make one
body butt upon another, 'tis not enough
that nothing ſenſible be between them; but
it behoves them alſo, that they be the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
together, that they can be and not be one.
But we have already taken away all ſhew of
nearneſs and farneſs from the two bulks, by
ſhutting out the middleneſs in which ſuch
nearneſs or farneſs muſt needs be pitcht.
Thoſe bodies or beings that cannot have a
<hi>placely</hi> reſpect, cannot have an <hi>abutting</hi> or
touching <hi>reſpect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus on the other hand, the putting of a
bulky middleneſs between two ghoſts, 'tis
not enough to ſet them at ſuch a farneſs
from each other. Suppoſe two Angels to
have been before the world in their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
whereneſſes, after the making of the
world, without any change in their unbody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
way of being ſomewhere, one to be
found in the roundle of the Moon, another
in that of the earth; extended body is now
between them, without the leaſt diſtance or
off-ſtanding ariſen between them. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world there was no off-ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, all extenſion being then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101488:64"/>
and they holding the ſelf-ſame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
muſt alſo have the ſame non-diſtance
after the world made. Every thing while it
holds the ſame whereneſs, keeps alſo the
ſame things to be ſpoken of it as to where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>If thoſe ſides between which nothing is,
do touch and become one, Then if all the
world were unmade but Sun and Moon, they
two ſhould forthwith jump into one; and it
would be hard enough to ſay what it were,
Whether a Sun, or a Moon, or neither? ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that by Almighty power their Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Moonſhip might be kept by them,
without worldſhip.</p>
               <p>Again, If <hi>between which</hi> nothing is put,
the ſides would touch, according to ſound
and right ſpeaking, Then <hi>beyond which</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is put, the ſelvedge is infinite. So it
falls as hard upon the <hi>Carteſians</hi> and the
<hi>Whitings,</hi> for an infinite world, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them dare ſpeak in words, but ſhuffle
it indeed: emptineſs or <hi>ſpatium imaginarium</hi>
with them, being as verily <hi>nothing,</hi> as that
which is imagin'd between the two ſides of
the veſſel emptied of all its body between
them.</p>
               <p>And now by driving thus far, We have
gain'd ground for the anſwering that puzling
argument of the foreſaid Doctor, for diſtance
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101488:65"/>
                  <hi>in vacuo, </hi>in his ingenious<hi> Canto of Infinity of
worlds. Suppoſe the skie all ſwept away from
Saturn to the Sun, the Planets ſtill holding
their rooms, and holding on their roundings
as they did before, let then an Aſtronomer take
their heights: The Queſtion is, Whether their
Parallaxes would be the ſame, or other, or none
at all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer upon the Suppoſition, (which is
wide enough from what is natural, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
from what may be too againſt nature:
for that which claws away world from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, would, 'tis like, wring out their
Planethood from within them.) There
would be no Parallaxes at all, no beams of
light to take Parallaxes by, no throughfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the leaſt ſteams or reekings of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
from one globe to another or from
our earth to any of the globes, nor any power
to ſhoot forth any body from one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by any <hi>impetus</hi> or darting whatſoever.
Though the <hi>kinred</hi> between theſe things
ſhould be ſtill left, yet the <hi>goſſipred</hi> would
be quite taken away. Though all ſhould
jump in this one thing, to wit, in being Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
as before, yet they could neither <hi>ſpeak
with,</hi> nor <hi>make</hi> one another, (if I may word it
ſo much Yeoman-wiſe,) nor have any more
to do with one another than if there had
never been dealings between them; that by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101488:65"/>
which they medled and made each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being taken away. As on the other
ſide, we find ſome bodies amongſt us hold up
a Goſſipred, that ſeem to have little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of kinred; as may be ſeen between jet
and ſtraw, loadſtone and iron, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of that hooking kind: where, ſetting
aſide their angling and groping one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there are as few things cleaving to one,
to be met with in the other, as in moſt twoes
in the whole world. In a word, the buſineſs
here would be much at one with that of two
worlds ſpoken of before; one being as free
from fellowſhip and dealing with the other
as they were, or as would be between our
earth and ſo many Angels, having ſuppoſed
dwellings there, where thoſe Planets have
ſuch place. But as for their motion in ring or
circular, that muſt not be yielded; for that
ſeems as hard to be in <hi>vacuo,</hi> as for a ghoſt to
ſtand ſtill in <hi>pleno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But once more to take off all ſhew of
ſtrength from that way-layer, to wit, the
ſides of the veſſel muſt needs touch between
which nothing is: We will but lay it down
thus. Take we a ſquare body in the world
unevenly ſided, out of the hollow of this
take we then (in our minds) all body what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
leaving nothing at all. The ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> and others tells us, The ſides
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101488:66"/>
for that trick alone would touch. But now
we ſay ſtifly, and will ſtand to it ſo, That the
ſides would not only not touch, but be ſo far,
in part, from touching, that they would, to
rights, be further aſunder. For the off-ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
or diſtance between them being to
be met with only in the body that lyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, and the body ſpace and diſtance
which lay neareſt between them being taken
away, they can only be meted by that which
lyes furtheſt off; thoſe bodies being further
off that are by all meaſure found to be ſo.
Thus the middle point in one of the ſides,
for that it cannot be meted by a ſtreight line
drawn from it to its overthwart, but only
by a crooked line of three ſides and two
corners tracing along the ſurface of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
muſt as needs be further from it than
before, as this crooked line that goes thus
far about to mete it now, is longer than the
overthwart ſtreight one by which it might
have been meted before.</p>
               <p>But it being eaſie for me here to Object it
to my ſelf, I may think 'tis as eaſie for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to do it, That then two bodies keeping
the ſame place in the world, or ſtanding
ſtark ſtill, may yet change place as if they
ſtirr'd out of it: which ſeems to thwart at an
high rate.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer. If the world in which
they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101488:66"/>
are, be changed, 'tis no wonder if their place
in it be changed alſo; or if that by which
their diſtance be meted, be taken away, is it,
that their diſtance ſhould be ſo too: a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that cannot be meaſured being none
at all. But by ſuppoſing this emptineſs, the
world is not what it was, but by ſo much leſs
as our mind took away: as, if the body made
nothing ſhould again be made there, it would
be by ſo much bigger as that was big; the
nearneſs taken away by one deed, would be
brought again by the other; and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
place, or to take away the body plac'd,
comes all to a reckoning. I am in the room
where I now ſtand, about ſixty miles from
<hi>Westminſter Abby,</hi> If you ſtart that ſixty miles
further, though I ſtand ſtill, I am ſo much
further from it as if both had ſtarted three
miles apiece: but if both it and I ſtand ſtill,
and a ſquare cut of earth be digged between
us, from the Eaſtern ſhore as far as to the
Weſtward, I am as near ſtill by water, but ſo
much further by land as I am fain to go about
for the ſake of that cut betwixt: but if you
empty it as well of water as you did of earth,
I am juſt ſo far from it by water as I was by
land, and am only as near to it as ever I was
by air. So if I were of the winged kind, I
might flie to it through the Skie, as well as I
could walk to it by land or row and ſail by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101488:67"/>
water: but if you empty out the air too, and
leave nothing, I am then ſo much further
from it all three wayes: and if I would come
nearer to it, I muſt either have a bridge of
body laid between, or elſe muſt walk, or
row, or flie about. So near one thing is to
another as it can <hi>come to be,</hi> and no nearer:
If then I can <hi>come</hi> no nearer to it, but by the
ways ſpoken of, I think I rightly gather I <hi>am</hi>
no nearer to it. That which is as near to a
thing as ever it can <hi>come,</hi> is as near as it can
<hi>be,</hi> without iffs and ands, or to all intents and
purpoſes. That I be further from another
thing, 'tis all one whether you hitch me off
from it while that ſtand ſtill, or whether you
put that back from me while I ſtand ſtill, or
vvhether you make that betvvixt us further
from both vvhile both ſtand ſtill. As you
ſee 'tis the ſame in making me further off by
land, vvater, or air, ſo I ſee nothing forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it to be the ſame by all other vvayes.
While the taking <hi>ſuch things</hi> from betvveen
makes me further off <hi>as to ſuch things</hi> or ſo
far, the taking <hi>all things</hi> from betvveen
ſhould make me further off <hi>as to all things</hi> or
altogether. A change of the vvorld in the
<hi>ſuchneſs</hi> of the betvveen-lyers, begetting a
change in my nearneſs as anſvvering <hi>that ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>
ſo a change of the vvorld in the <hi>whole</hi>
of the betvveen-lyers, muſt beget a change
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101488:67"/>
in the <hi>whole</hi> of my nearneſs. The more bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
there is between me and another body
the neareſt way that can be gone, the further
are we aſunder: and the more body is pared
away from the neareſt path that can be gone,
the more body is laid between, the neareſt
way that can be gone: the more ſhort paths
you cut away, the longer you leave behind:
and if you cut away ſhort and long, the
things are neither near nor far, but name and
thing are utterly loſt.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that the anſwer may leſs
ſeem to have any thing of trick in it, a like
thing may be done, the world not thus
chang'd, to make way for it. For as the
world now is, a body may glide at full ſpeed,
ſo ſhifting place as to the bodies it glides by,
and yet ſtand ſtill as to the greateſt part of
the world beſides; ſo keeping place, and
ſhifting place as uncouthly as in the thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
Thus we will take upon truſt the
whirling of the earth from Weſt to Eaſt,
(which is held by all a thing that may be, by
moſt a thing that is,) and a ſhip under ſail
driving with the ſame ſpeed from Eaſt to
Weſt, (not being checkt by the earths giving
over its motion to it.) Now this would ſhift
place as to the bodies making up the earths
ball, and hold the ſame place as to all the
reſt of the world beſides. So we reckon St.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101488:68"/>
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in <hi>London</hi> to ſtand ſo ſtone ſtill,
that it never ſtirr'd ground ſince the days of
<hi>Sebert</hi> King of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> yet ſuppoſing
the earths motion, it only keeps its place in
reſpect of the earth, or that ſteamſcope or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere
that wheels the ſame round with
it, and ſhifts room every day with all the
world beſides, that by which its off-ſtanding
thereto ſhould be taken, being ſo oft length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and ſhortned by the whirl of the earth.
And in the thing before us, by taking all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
out of the ſquare and leaving juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
ſuch pieces of the world would be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from others, whoſe neareſt roads for
meaſure ſhould lie through ſuch room taken
away, keeping ſtill the ſame off-ſtanding to
all the reſt of the world beſides.</p>
               <p>So true is it, that we name and bound
things according to what they ofteneſt or
eaſilieſt <hi>do</hi> ſeem to us to be, and not as to
thoſe narrow and leſs heeded by-ways,
wherein ſomtimes they <hi>may</hi> be.</p>
               <p>At the foot of this we ſhall yet ſet one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
more, and that is this. That of all men,
he that holds a boundleſs roomthineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the world, muſt beware how he hits us
in the teeth with this, That we make a body
ſtir and ſtand ſtill both together. For if the
foreſtroke give us but a little tick, the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroke
will be ſure to give him a knocker.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101488:68"/>
We ſay, a body may keep place as to ſome
things, and ſhift it as to ſome others: But he
muſt ſay, a body muſt ſtand ſtill and run both
together, and as to all things. For we will
take but this o'truſt, That the world may
have been ſinking down, or flying up, or
ſtarting aſide ever ſince it was made; He
that made it, could as eaſily make it ſtir as
ſtand ſtill; and he that we are ſpeaking with,
holds it as eaſie to ſtir in emptineſs as in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
Then ſay, we That this utmoſt ſpeed
of about 5675 years, is no other than ſtark
ſtanding ſtill. For while it ſtands ſtill, it has
but boundleſs room evenly about it, ſo as to
be, to our thinking, in the midſt of it: but for
all it runs, and has done, thus much, and thus
long, it has the very ſame boundleſs room
every way about it (nor more, nor leſs) than
it ſhould have had, it it had ſtood ſtill:
therefore it has ſtood ſtill all the while it has
run ſo faſt. For, if that body which is in the
midſt of a bounded ring, ſo running 5675
years as to be ſtill as much in the midſt as
ever, does ſo run as to ſtand ſtil all the while
it runs, then in like manner, That body
which has unbounded room ſo every way
about it, that if by running never ſo long,
and never ſo faſt one way, it would neither
lengthen the room behind it, nor ſhorten
the room before it, then it ſo runs as to ſtand
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101488:69"/>
ſtill all the while it runs; and then if by
making it ſtand ſtill, it can have no more
than the ſame unbounded room round about
it, that it would have had if ſcouring all the
while one way or other, its ſtanding ſtill is
as much running as its running was ſtanding
ſtill, and each as much the other as it ſelf:
Which falls ſo pat upon the head of him that
owns an emptineſs beyond the world, that I
dare be bold to ſay, 'Tis ſuch a flail as there
can ne're be fence for.</p>
               <p>The quick-ſighted Mr.<hi> Barlow </hi>coping
with<hi> Nazarius, </hi>who had rightly laid down
body and ſpace to be the ſame, and that the
worlds being in room is being in its own ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedge,
has thence rais'd this further Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
to wit,<hi> That the world being thus in its
own ſelvedge, may by God Almighty be thruſt
into another room; and, as it follows, the
room in which now 'tis, is another thing from
it; and that room into which it is thrust, muſt
be the ſame outworldiſh ſcope that we have been
all this while falling out with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What anſwer <hi>Nazarius</hi> would give to it, I
cannot tell; but from the grounds laid down
by us, 'tis as eaſie to anſwer as to name. For
as the Argument ſays, the world <hi>may be</hi> thruſt
out of the room in which 'tis into another,
our Anſwer ſays it <hi>may not be:</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God ſhould alſo make another room for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101488:69"/>
it to be thruſt into. And though the <hi>may be</hi>
in the Argument came ſtarveling alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing of proof to back it, yet the
<hi>may not be</hi> in the Anſwer ſhall be thus ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
up. Unto motion 'tis not only behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that the thing ſtirr'd be <hi>bulkie,</hi> but that
the thing through which 'tis ſtirr'd be alſo
<hi>roomthy.</hi> Thus as a ghoſt, becauſe no bulky Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
cannot move through the world, though
a bulky throughfare or <hi>medium:</hi> ſo the world
or whole clutter of bodies, though a bulky
Being, cannot ſtir any way; for why, it has
no bulky throughfare to ſtir in: Whatever
ſtirs muſt ſtir in ſomewhat. And if it ſeems
odd, that motion, which is an all-reaching
affection or belonger to each bit of the
world, ſhould yet be denied to the whole,
'tis full as odd, that cleaveſomneſs, which is
as all-reaching a belonger to body, ſhould
be with-held from a leaſt piece, which is as
truly body as the greateſt. But as that would
partake of <hi>ſundering,</hi> if it were not the <hi>leaſt
that can be:</hi> ſo would the world of <hi>ſtirring,</hi>
if it were not <hi>the greatest that could be.</hi> From
the <hi>leaſtneſs</hi> and <hi>moſtneſs,</hi> not from the <hi>things
themſelves,</hi> it is, that this befals them. The
world is made as much for ſtirring in its kind,
as any ſhare of it, if it had but a <hi>wherein</hi> to
ſtir: and a leaſt bitling is made as much for
cleaving, if it had but a <hi>wherewith</hi> to be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101488:70"/>
its <hi>leaſtneſs,</hi> not its <hi>bodineſs</hi> forbidding
it.</p>
               <p>But it would not be out of the way, it may
be, to put one thing more to this Anſwer
before we go from it, and that is this, That
when I ſay, God muſt alſo make another
room for the world to be thruſt into, if it
ſtarts at all, I would not be underſtood, as
if I meant a room without body; which is
the thing I have been ſo much blaming. For,
to me, room and body are all one, that is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together;
as ghoſt and thinking are: And I
can no more underſtand how room can be by
it ſelf without body, than I can how a
thought may dwell by it ſelf without a
thinking Being. But the room that I mean,
is a roomthy yielding body, big enough to
ſhift places with the world. For to me the
very life and ſoul of motion is ſhuffle or ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all ſtirrings one and other are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but go-byes or ſhiftings of bodies. So
that if one body had not another body to
ſlide by and make a ſawing with, that it
might be, out one, in another, that way one,
this way t'other, it would ne're ſtir while 'tis
a body. Whence, that one world may ſtir,
another muſt be made for it to ſtir in. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
moves, muſt do it ſomewhere, or in
ſomewhat, beſides it ſelf too. For nothing
can ſtir its whole ſelf within it ſelf: All ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101488:70"/>
being out of, into. And 'tis eaſier to
think, how, if this world were all marble,
that piece in the middlemoſt might ſlide it
ſelf to the outſide, than how a world, which
has no room about it, ſhould ſtir any whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
'Tis eaſier crowding into a full room,
than into none at all. The middle piece here
has body about it, but only 'tis too ſtiff and
ſturdy to yield or ſhift rooms with it: but the
world we ſpeak of, wants both <hi>yielding bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
and <hi>body</hi> too; and cannot ſtir into a <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,</hi>
becauſe all beſides it ſelf is a <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe ghoſt cannot hand the ſaw
thus with body ſo as its ſliding into the
room of body, ſhould make body ſlip into
the room of it, Thence 'tis, as I make reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that ghoſt cannot rightly be ſaid to
move. For it cannot be, out body, in ghoſt,
as 'tis in motion, out one body, in another;
but body in, or body out, 'tis all one to ghoſt.
A bodies ſtanding in the way, cannot ſlacken
its ſpeed; nor a bodies making way, quicken
it. And all motion, being either ſpeedier or
ſlower, that which ſtirs neither the one way
nor the other, ſtirs not at all. We find that
all ſtirring is as the thing ſtirr'd is withſtood;
if more, 'tis eaſily, if leſs, 'tis faſt. But becauſe
a ghoſt can't be withſtood at all by body,
(every body, but where 'tis enſouled, being
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101488:71"/>
alike throughfareſom to it,) it does that in
one now, at once, that body does in ſome
time, by ſteps. For want of which ſtepping
or gradation, it cannot well be call'd motion,
(any more than its being out of this plight,
can be call'd placing in ſome room, or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill.) But 'tis ſomewhat elſe that we have
no right name for, (unleſs skipping or cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may in a low ſort ſpeak it;) as we have
none neither for thoſe odd wights, (to name
one of a thouſand more,) that ran down a
ſteep place into the Sea, with our Lords good
leave. For they were neither Hogs nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
no devilliſh Hogs, nor hoggiſh Devils;
but a meſling of two, that we have no more
name for than we had of yore for that med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of three which we now call Gun-powder:
their being call'd Swine, is ſuch a vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafement
for the Folks ſake, as calling the
Devil in a Crawler, a Serpent.</p>
               <p>The laſt Argument we ſhall need to name,
for width or room beyond the world, is
from the ſame worthy Gentleman, and ſtands
thus.<hi> If God be in very deed in it, then ſuch
a thing is: But, that God is indeed in it, may
thus be made out; that is to ſay, Becauſe he
may frame another world ſtanding off from
this, and then be in both of them as in
this, otherwiſe he ſhould not be every-where.
And if he be in both, the muſt be in the room al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101488:71"/>
that lyes between both, otherwiſe he ſhould be
two in both, not one, this croſſing his one-fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as much as the other did his all-fillingneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Had theſe Bugbears comen in the
Van, they might have put on the ſhew of a
forlorn of Bravoes: But having grapled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
with ſo many Battalioes, and wrought
our way through ſuch ſtrong faſtneſſes, we
are not to be worſted by the reermoſt and
very leavings. We ſay then in ſhort, That all
this waſt ariſes from a miſtake, that God is
every-where in the world ſo as to be coex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with the world: Whereas the truth
is, Were there no ſpace at all, neither real
nor counterfeit, (as none was, before he who
made all things, made that,) God ſhould be
as immenſe as he is for all that: As if there
had never been any time, (nor was there, till
God made timeſom Beings,) he had been as
eternal as he is. As God by making of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and real ſpace with it, every-where in
which he really is, is thereby no more really
in ſpace himſelf than he vvas before, or no
more roomthily there than he vvas before;
(What he really is, he vvas from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:)
So by not making of a body, he is not
leſs really in ſpace, or in imaginary ſcope:
But let ſpace be vvhat it vvill, his every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayneſs
or immenſity is the ſame, one not
medling at all vvith the other.</p>

I ſay then, That God vvould be in thoſe
tvvo vvorlds as he is in this. As he is not here
by halves, ſo neither vvould he be there. As
he is not partly in one piece of this vvorld
and partly in another; but vvholly in all,
and vvholly in each, vvholly in Eaſt ſide, and
vvholly in Weſt ſide, vvithout having
any part of him in the parts betvveen: So he
vvould not be partly in one vvorld and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in another, but vvholly in both, and
vvholly in each. And as for taking up the
room betvveen them, either vvith vvhole or
vvith part, the care is taken: for vve have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made it out, That there vvould be no
room at all; and that vvhich <hi>is not</hi> at all,
God <hi>is not in</hi> at all. While God is ſo in tvvo
vvorlds, that though they do not touch or
abut, yet there lyes nothing betvveen them;
'tis all one as to the one-foldneſs of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as if they tvvo did touch, or vvere both
made one: for there can be no more than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
betvveen tvvo vvorlds that touch, or
betvveen the very parts themſelves of one
vvorld; in any of vvhich, and in every of
vvhich, 'tis yet eaſily yielded God may <hi>be,</hi>
and <hi>be one</hi> too.</p>

               <p>HAving hitherto treated of Bulk, How
far it may be bigned? it follows next,
that ſomewhat ſhould be ſpoken to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hard Queſtion, How far it may be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened?
And the rather, becauſe, if we have
been lucky in making it out, That body by
putting to it cannot be bigned beyond a
certain bulk, it ſeems to follow by the laws
of Analogies, That the ſame by taking from
it cannot be leſſened beneath a certain ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And we have from thence this ground
to ſet foot upon, That that which is not
boundleſs one way, cannot be ſo another;
or that that which is not infinite in its whole,
cannot be ſo in its little part. We muſt then
put an end to that puzling Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a bulky Being be made up of a throng
of cleaveleſs ſhreadlings? by bearing the
Reader in hand, flatly, that ſo 'tis indeed.
And that upon this ſcore too as well as any
other; becauſe 'tis impoſſible to put ſo much
as one jot or duſt unto bulk, beyond a ſet or
bounded number: this finite world being the
All of quantity, and nothing of outſtretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
being beyond it or beſides it, ſo, at leaſt,
as to have any thing to do with it: that it
ſhould be likewiſe impoſſible to take from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101488:73"/>
bulk, ſo much as one jot or duſt beneath a

               <p>Which while we are beginning to take in

               <p>But 'tis to be wondred, that having ſhaken
off <hi>Ariaga</hi>'s Mathematical points, and <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezes</hi>
way of making up bodies of parts and
Mathematical points jumbled together, he
could not feel himſelf, whilſt playing aloof

ſnare: For he ſays, <hi>Neither by no means:
but a natural body is made up of Phyſical
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101488:73"/>
points, made up of Mathematical meaſures.</hi>
That is, 'tis not made of Mathematical points,
but made of thoſe things that are made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Mathematical points. A ſlie kind of
body indeed, that is Mathematical at ſecond
hand, or linſey Phyſical woolſey Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we are about to ſay, That our
atome <hi>punctum</hi> or leaſting, is made only of
body. And although it may be meteſom by
Mathematical meaſures of the minds ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
yet it is not made up thereof, any more
than the greater parts are, or the whole is.
But as to Phyſical meaſures, it has neither
Eaſt ſide nor Weſt ſide, North ſide nor South
ſide, top nor bottom, this nor that, nor any
thing that ſpeaks twinſhip to any thing elſe,
but is <hi>it ſelf</hi> all that 'tis: and when you have
ſaid that, you have ſaid all. So that if you
ask, when it abuts upon another, Whether
it touches <hi>ſecundum ſe totum,</hi> or not? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholewiſe or piecewiſe? 'Tis anſwer'd,
There is no ſuch name belongs to it. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
maintain'd it to be a leaſt part, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
it ſhould have parts in it; which, if
any, muſt be leſs than leaſt. And 'tis alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
that that Phyſical body which has
not parts, ſhould rightly be a whole, or a
thing made up of that which it has not. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Phyſical whole being made up of parts,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101488:74"/>
that which has no parts, but is it ſelf the leaſt
of parts, can no more be an whole, than the
whole nakedly taken can be a part. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
whole being greater than its parts, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſunderly, it would follow, that our
leaſting were greater than ſomewhat elſe, or
greater than it ſelf: Which would be a
thwacker as unſpeakably big as that is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
               <p>We are therefore in good ſooth to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
That having pared off from body all
its parts, we have alſo bereaved it of all
thoſe bedightings or affections that belong
to it, as having parts; of which the <hi>whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
laid in our diſh was one. And though
we cannot thereby make it ghoſt or not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
becauſe we cannot tear from it pierceleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or impenetrability, which is the cloſeſt
ſticker to a body, as a body leſſen'd; yet it
comes ſo much the nearer to ghoſt, by how
much the more it has thrown off the things
belonging to a body, which ghoſt had not
neither. As we found a now of time to ſpeak
out Gods Eternity better than any other
ſhare of laſtingneſs; becauſe it threw off more
of thoſe things that time had, and that had
not: ſo here, we can no more betemme whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the one, than to the other: It being as
good ſpeech to talk of the head or foot, right
half or left half of a ghoſt, as of an atome. For
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101488:74"/>
as in a ghoſt there are none of them, becauſe
there is <hi>nothing of body</hi> to faſten them to: So
neither are they in a leaſting: For why, there
is <hi>ſo little body,</hi> that one would be the other.</p>
               <p>What we have hitherto ſpoken, will ſeem
to have leſs of auk in it, if we do but pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
our leaſting of body with a now of
time, which has no more fore and aft, than
we ſay this has ſide and ſide; though it goes
to the making up of that which has the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
as this does to the making up of that
which has the latter.</p>
               <p>And again, if we be but ſo good as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.
That we have lifted our leaſting
out of the kingdom of the world, and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in the kingdom of the mind. For an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
by it ſelf, unlinkt from the chain of all
other bulks to which it hangs, is no where to
be found but in that of our thoughts, any
more than a now of time is, ſo ſingled out
from time paſt and time to come.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak more home or right down to
the thing in hand, Whether a leaſting tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
another in its whole, or by its parts? Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only in the firſt place, That the word
<hi>Touch</hi> is none of the fitteſt that can be to
come in here. For why, many things may
cloſe that do not touch, as the ſoul, for one,
does with the body. We anſwer, That as we
have ſaid already, it touches according to
neither.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101488:75"/>
For why, 'tis not the one, nor has the other.
So we ſay flatly, it touches according to its
<hi>pierceleſneſs, ſecundum impenetrabilitatem;</hi> it
ſo ſnugs <hi>to</hi> another, as not to be <hi>in</hi> another;
and according to its <hi>ſeedſom length, ſecundum
longitudinem ſeminalem,</hi> ſo as with another
to make a line of two points. For not being
a ſtretchling or <hi>quid quantum,</hi> any more than
a now is an onwardling or <hi>quid ſucceſſivum,</hi>
but only <hi>quid impenetrabile,</hi> ſomewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through
fareſom; and having nothing in it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſeed of bulkineſs, which, ſo as 'tis
knit to more leaſtings, ſprings up; we muſt
not look that it ſhould touch after what it
has not, but after what it has. So put we but
an atome to it, the ſeed of bulkſomneſs is
ſo far quickned, that length is begotten;
cloſe but as many more ſidewiſe, up ſtarts
breadth; ſo again, as many clapt to, upwards
or downwards, and forth comes deepneſs. So
that to the three meteings or dimenſions of
a body, 'tis fit that eight leaſtings ſhould be
clapt together: as it takes at leaſt two nows
of time to make fore and aft, and three to
make was, is, and is to come. Whence we
gather, 'tis altogether from the buſineſs to
hale any of theſe things in, when we are
ſpeaking of one only: And nothing better is
it, than pumping of two out of one, or taking
the greater number out of the reſt, in Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
or Arithmetick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:101488:75"/>
Not much unlike is the cloſing or union
between ſoul and body, which two together
make up one man. The ſoul not being bulky,
cannot be ſtretched out with the body; and
not being unthroughfareſom, cannot cloſe ſo
with it, as to be ſhut out from being in it.
As it had not the latter by it ſelf, ſo neither
had it the former in booty beme, or a power
in ſeed, (or half ſeed,) to biggen the bulk of
the body, or make it more as to any of the
meaſures. The cloſe or oneneſs therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ghoſt and body, muſt be according to
thoſe <hi>powers</hi> the ſoul or ghoſt <hi>has,</hi> whereby
'tis ſquar'd for the laying hold on or laying
in with body, and not according to thoſe it
<hi>has not.</hi> Now the ſoul has the trick or power
in the ſeed to quicken body, when by ſuch
and ſuch laws kept down to it, without
flinching from it, neither taking up room it
ſelf in the body, or eking out the body, by
making over to it, ſeedwiſe, from it ſelf, any
thing that is bulky or unthroughfareſom; and
can withal beſtead it with a faſhioning or
plaſtick ſpring of lifeſomneſs or animality,
whence it grows, works, and begets its like
from an inbred power; and has another feat
to move the body: Which it does not by
ſhoving or driving of it forwards, as a ſlouch
does a crowd-barrow, ſtepping into the
room which that leaves behind it; but, as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101488:76"/>
the Ingenious <hi>Mounſieur de Cordemoy</hi> has it,
By having ſuch ſtirrings of
the body to anſwer ſuch
workings of the thoughts.<note place="margin">Le diſcernement du corps &amp; de l'ame.</note>
Every thing muſt do as it ſelf is, and as it
tools are: And certain workings of thoughts
are to a ſoul, what certain ſtirrings of parts
are to a body, in the which the ſoul is
hous'd: only the ſoul not agreeing with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
ſo much as in that one belonger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throughfareneſs,
when bewedded thereunto
it cannot make it bigger; being loſt in it, not
lodg'd by it; but only better or nobler, as
to its being or working. But now our leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
being, while ſuch, of a lower houſe, and
made for the nonce to be knit unto more of
its kind without piercing or being pierc'd,
gathers thereby to it ſelf a freſh train of
hangers on in the body kind, or in <hi>genere
Phyſico,</hi> which it would never reach to, but
only in fellowſhip with them, as making up a
bulk of ſuch a name; no more than a part can
take upon it thoſe names or things which are
ſuited to its whole, all together, as an whole:
it ſelf being an unthroughfareſom whatkin,
having in it the ſeed of an half length, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
breadth, and eighth of depth. Little o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
one ſex, though compleat in it ſelf
taken, cannot by it ſelf beget its like; but is,
as to that, the half ſeed of it, and enkindles
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101488:76"/>
it as clubbing with another like power, from
which two only that one muſt ſpring; each
of which by themſelves have but the half or
unlike ſeeds of quickning, as lock and key
has of opening.</p>
               <p>This kind of touching of things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſome one thing that is in them, and
not according to others, puts me in mind of
what is done of that ſort, not only between
part and part barely taken <hi>as abutting,</hi> but
between draught and draught or ſcheme
and ſcheme as <hi>medling.</hi> Thus a certain ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together of bracks or atoms, make
that ſcheme in the ſtomack that we call hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or thirſt; and another unlike one, makes
that there, which we call a fulneſs, or loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſpewing. Now wormwood has ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
draught in it, that touches or cloſes with
thir latter, ſo as to make up the former; but
it neither touches according to the draught
of its root ſtalk, branches, leaves, flowrings,
ſeed, juice, powder, water, maſh or conſerve,
ſyrup, ſteepings, boylings, ſetlings or extract,
ſalt, oyl or ſpirit: for each of theſe will do
it, only becauſe this touching draught is
more broken in ſome, and more tight in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
ſome do it more, ſome leſs. Now if it
does not touch or meddle according to any
of the fore-named, it muſt do it, as to that
we have no name for, unleſs we call it a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101488:77"/>
                  <hi>Wormwoodneſs;</hi> it being a wormwoody ſtamp
more or leſs printed upon each of them, and
like wards for ſuch a lock, will perhaps clap
in with nothing in the world elſe, but that
<hi>Set</hi> of atoms which is ſometimes found in the
maw of a feeder. On the other hand, <hi>Aſarum</hi>
holds a ſcheme of an unlike make from
wormwood, which ſhall put the ſtomack,
when in good plight, into loathings and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings,
as ſurely as wormwood ſhall ſtill and
heal ſuch roilings; and this either in its raw
juice or powder dryed in an oven: but do but
boyl it, and then break up the ſcheme of it,
and then if it changes or empties the body
'tis by ſweat, (ſayes <hi>Rulandus:)</hi> this then
ſeems not ſo much to be done by its Rabac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caneſs,
unleſs that of it may be boyl'd away,
which cannot be bak'd away, as by ſome nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
draught that lies in juice and powder,
made to lock with that other which lies in
the juices of the ſtomack.</p>
               <p>And now becauſe the reaſon why ſo many
great underſtandings have leaned to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, holding the cleaveſomneſs of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
unboundedly, is from a willingneſs to be
rid of thoſe gallers that twinge the brain of
the ſtiff maintainer of this, it ſhall in the
next place be tryed, Whether we can afford
any reſt or good liking to the mind, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Objections with ſuch Anſwers as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101488:77"/>
the grounds we have laid down will allow us
to build upon. And they will fall, not unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
under a threefold Head.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Such as hold to figure mainly.</item>
                  <item>2. Such as meddle with figure and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
together. And</item>
                  <item>3. Such as have to do with motion rather
than figure.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Under the firſt of which, we are born in
hand with this, That then a <hi>Scalenum</hi> and
<hi>Iſoſceles</hi> would be all one: Thus.
<figure>
                     <figDesc>triangle</figDesc>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>A. B. C. is a <hi>Scalenum.</hi> The ſame muſt alſo,
from the Doctrine of leaſtings, be an <hi>Iſoſceles,</hi>
or even-ſided Triangle: For fill but the Area
with lines parallel to A. C. there muſt be then
as many pricks or points in B. A. as in B. C.
there being as many lines drawn from the
one as to the other; and ſo B. A. would be
equal to B. C. that is, the <hi>Scalenum</hi> would
become an <hi>Iſoſceles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It would not be ſo Phyſically, but
only Mathematically: Thus namely, The
lines drawn to the ſide B. C. do not touch it
in <hi>one</hi> point, but the line B. C. bends ſo much
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101488:78"/>
to a parallel with the lines drawn from B. A.
to C. that they make the angles to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a parallel with at leaſt the <hi>two laſt</hi>
points of the lines A. C. ſo that it may fairly
hold as many points again, or be as long
again.</p>
               <p>The ſame Anſwer undoes the knot, That
every triangle would be an <hi>Iſopleuron,</hi> That
the diagonial lines of a <hi>Rhomboides</hi> would be
equal, That the diameter of a Quadrangle
would be equal to its ſides, That a Semicircle
would not be greater than its diameter, As
alſo, That of divers concentrick circles, the
outermoſt would not be greater than the
inmoſt; inaſmuch as all lines drawn from all
points of it towards the Centre, muſt paſs
through as many points of the other: With
ſo many more of the ſame kind, as are not
readily ſo much as to be named. All which,
however done in Geometry, are much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
or not at all done in Phyſicks.</p>
               <p>Again, 'tis ſaid, A line of unequal atoms
could not then be cut into halves; when
yet 'tis as ſure as any thing in Geometry, that
any line whatſoever may be ſo.</p>
               <p>To which 'tis anſwered, That 'tis as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
in Phyſicks, as 'tis true in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
But becauſe a Phyſical leaſting comes
not under the ken of ſenſe, according to the
ſmarteſt reckoning that we can make with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101488:78"/>
body, Nevertheleſs, we may hold ſuch a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be even with another, if ſenſe can find
no unevenneſs between them, whether they
be ſo indeed or not. That is to be reckon'd
even, that cannot be found otherwiſe than
even.</p>
               <p>But thoſe which are harder to take off,
are ſuch as come with figure and motion
hand in hand, being a kind of mingled Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks.</p>
               <p>Thus it may be objected, That a wheel
of manifold rims whirl'd upon its axletree,
would make out uneven bows of circles, in
even ſhares of time, the whole wheel being
evenly turned, and the circles being ſome
bigger than others: whence it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
That one atome in the inner rims, would
be even to more than one in the outermore.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſing the rims of the wheel to
be brought from their bow into a ſtreight
line, the ſame whirling force reſting in each,
the Objection would fall in with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(figure only changed;) to wit, That all
bodies would then be moved with a like
ſwiftneſs; the ſwifteſt running but through a
leaſting of room in a now of time, and the
ſloweſt creeping on even, ſo much in ſo
much.</p>
               <p>To this killing one, there have been a
great many Anſwers forged by the men of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101488:79"/>
brains, and fine-ſpun thoughts. The cunning
<hi>Magnenus</hi> takes his flight to Mathematical
parts in a Phyſical leaſting, <hi>Ariaga</hi> to reſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled
with ſtirrings. But we having
ſhut out Mathematical parts as to the making
up of body, it cannot but be thought huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miſdone, to tow them in here for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out of motion; there being the ſame
parts and no more in a body <hi>mov'd,</hi> that
there are in the ſame <hi>made.</hi> And as for reſts,
there being yet no reaſon ſhewn, why ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſhould begin after ſuch reſts, than why
a body at full reſt altogether, ſhould of it ſelf
ſtir, without a quickning joſtle from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Being, or a freſh ſwing or poyſing from
its lodging in the world; both the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
will even miſs of giving the mind that
eaſe and reſt which the wittineſs of them
might ſeem to have been worthy of.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer then that we have been think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of is this, That ſlower motions are made
up of <hi>ſtarts</hi> and <hi>bearings,</hi> or ſpringſomneſs,
(progreſſion and elaſticity): and that the
ſwifteſt are either all <hi>outſtart,</hi> without bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
or made up of ſpeed and <hi>ſprightfulneſs,</hi>
(pernicity and <hi>impetus.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better making out of which, we
are to bethink our ſelves, That as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of time had not fore and aft, nor the
leaſt deal of body here a piece and there a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101488:79"/>
piece, or <hi>partem extra partem:</hi> ſo neither
has the <hi>firſt ſpring</hi> of motion any thing of
<hi>onwardneſs</hi> or ſtirring, but only a pend or
earneſt ſtrift fromwards, which we call
<hi>ſpringſomneſs</hi> or <hi>bearing.</hi> A thing though not
motion, yet as much the beginning or ſeed
of it and made for the nonce for it, as a now
is of or for time, and a leaſting of or for bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
And again, motion being <hi>quid non ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriale,</hi>
ſomewhat bodileſs, may-hap it ought
not altogether to be ſcan'd and ſifted by the
laws that ſay bulkineſs as ſuch alone: As
time in which all motion is, and with which
it began, has got ſome things belonging to
it, that body cannot lay claim to.</p>
               <p>Thus then, ſuppoſe a body ſlowly mov'd
to begin at the bear or heave, and for one
now of time to ſtart one leaſting of room,
the next now neither to ſtart nor reſt, but to
be in the bearing or elater, till the bearing be
wrought up ſo high as to burſt forth into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
ſtart of another atome, in another mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute;
ſo holding on bearing and ſtarting,
till it comes to a full reſt, after the laſt ſtart
and bear: For as motion begins in a bearing
or <hi>conatus,</hi> ſo it ends in the ſame; and as the
bearing took riſt from reſt, ſo it dies and
falls into the ſame again.</p>
               <p>Now although this Anſwer may at firſt
ſeem chargeable, with the ſame hardneſſes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101488:80"/>
with that of girds and reſts; yet upon a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
ſearch, it will be clearly found to be
far and wide from it in the making out. For
we having warily held, the ſtirr'd body not
to be at reſt, or in a ſtound or pauſe at all, but
alwayes to be either <hi>ſtirring</hi> or <hi>bearing,</hi>
which <hi>bearing</hi> is no more <hi>rest</hi> than 'tis <hi>ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi>
as a leaſting, though it be not <hi>quantum,</hi>
yet 'tis far enough off from being <hi>ghoſt,</hi> and
wants nothing but <hi>more</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> to make
it <hi>quantum;</hi> or a now of time to make it fore
and aft. We cannot then be charged with
the uncouthneſs of bodies recovering mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it ſelf, after the dying or breaking
off of that vvhich ſtirred it. For how can
that be ſaid to be <hi>recovered</hi> which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>loſt?</hi> Now motion is not <hi>loſt,</hi> but only
<hi>lockt up</hi> in the <hi>bearing</hi> or elater: Foraſmuch
as the <hi>bear</hi> is the <hi>well-ſpring</hi> of motion, as
motion is the <hi>off-ſpring</hi> of bearing. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the darting power in the hand or ſoul
is not motion, but the riſt or ſpring of all
that ſwiftneſs that is given to outcaſts. Now
when motion is ſhifted or begotten in the
thing mov'd or forthcaſt, this darting force
or rally of ſtirring ſprings, is ſhotten or
propagated alſo, and that firſtly and nextly
too; it being the breeder, motion the child
of it; the hand giving a kind of teemingneſs
to the ſpring, which in its ſeaſon is brought
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101488:80"/>
to bed of ſtartings. Whence 'tis, that until
this loſes its enkindling or leavening
ſtrength, the motion into which it breaks
when ſwell'd up to an height, cannot be loſt
neither; only it asks ſome time to heave or
pend in, before it actually ſtarts; Whence
'tis that one body is ſlower than another in
its motion.</p>
               <p>Becauſe I find the meaning of the words
do not ſquare ſo evenly with the notion, as I
think that may do with the truth of the
thing, (thoughts being eaſier to come by
than words,) We ſhall ſtrive to imprint it
on the Readers underſtanding, by ſuch like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
as either Handicrafts or Nature it ſelf
ſhall afford us.</p>
               <p>Thus then the ſtirring of the hand or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex
on the Dial-plate of a Watch, is as ſlow
as any that we need to treat of; 'tis notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
or ought to be, on and on, without
ſtops or ſtands; and yet 'tis an hour creeping
from hour-ſtroke to hour-ſtroke. Now when
we ſee what a long thread of ſand paſſes
the neck-hole of an hour-glaſs in that ſame
time; four mile long, in likelihood at leaſt,
ſuppoſing the running but as faſt again as the
walk of a midling kind of foot-man, (when
yet to the eye it ſeems far ſpeedier;) 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
beyond the reach thoughts, that the
hand ſhould find ſo many atoms or leaſtings
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101488:81"/>
of body to ſtep over one after other, without
the leaſt ſtopping between the two ſtreaks,
not above the ſixth or eighth part of an inch
aſunder, as to be even with the time that the
aforeſaid thread of ſand is poſting through
the neck-plate of the hour-glaſs. But
'tis eaſie enough to underſtand, that the
ſpring of the Watch, which is the ſpring
alſo of the hands ſtirring, ſhould by its bear
or elaſticity hitch it forwards, not ſo as to be
alwayes ſtirring, or at any time reſting, but
<hi>creeper-like,</hi> to be ſometimes <hi>ſtarting</hi> one
point, and oftner <hi>bearing</hi> towards the next;
the ſpring asking ſome minutes time to gather
ſtrength enough, (as the arm does by fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about) to give a ſtart or leaſt ſtirring, and
ſome minute or minutes more to bear on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a ſecond hitch: In the mean time that
which bequeaths it this ſlow pace, and
the wheels and ballance a pretty tight one,
is a thing that is not ſo fitly ſaid to be ſtirr'd
or in motion it ſelf, as lodg'd or lockt up in a
bearing or preſſing poſture. So agreeable is
the notion that we have been advancing,
that the beſt key-keeper of motion is an ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or bear, where one would at firſt think
it would likelieſt be loſt.</p>
               <p>But it may indeed be ſaid, That this comes
not home to the buſineſs of forthcaſt things;
the ſpring or principle of motion being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101488:81"/>
or cloſe by the thing ſtirr'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the hand is ſunder'd from that body
which is thrown forth by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis but ſuppoſing that the ſpring
of motion or an elater or elaters, as well as
the motion flowing from thence, is alſo
thrown off, (which ought in dartings forth
to be ſuppoſed,) and then the buſineſs is much
at one; unleſs it be that in things thrown,
the ſtirring is ſwifter for the moſt part, and
ſpends it ſelf ſooner: it being impoſſible to
make over motion that may be laſting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſpring of ſwiftneſs; and as impoſſible
to hold on a ſwiftneſs, without the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſuch a ſpring. So the greateſt unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
between crowding and throwing is,
That in the firſt it skills not whether there
be above one ſpring, or few ſprings of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
handed over at one time; for why, as
ſoon as that one is, or thoſe few are ſpent, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
is, or more are hard by to follow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any let to the going on: whence 'tis,
that I can crowd a bigger body than I can
throw, as I can give one or few ſprings,
where I cannot give more or many: But as
to the other, I cannot put a body off, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
I bequeath it either ſuch a ſpring as has
another ſpring, or more ſprings in the belly
of it, or elſe give it ſo many ſprings to keep
at its breaking off from my hand, as it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101488:82"/>
had when in it, and carried by it: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it would fall down, as ſoon as
the crowding or gird of the hand left it;
or elſe go on but a little way, with a ſudden
breaking off, from the nimbleneſs of ſtirring
which it had before it parted from the arm
that threw it.</p>
               <p>A little further help may be gain'd, I
think, by quoting a likeneſs of Natures own,
wherein the ſtirring power is taken aſide
from the thing ſtirr'd or quicknesd, and that
ſtirring or ſprightfulneſs only lockt up in the
<hi>ſpring</hi> or <hi>ſtrift</hi> to ſtir, which afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the taking off all clogs and ſtops, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
up to thoſe bounds that Dame Kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had pitcht upon. The Inſtance is that
of an egg, which we will take as a thing that
ſprang from the <hi>impetus</hi> of the tread, the
Harveyan tang, or contagion and egg-fry of
Kerckring and <hi>de Graaf,</hi> to be what 'tis, after
laid by the Hen. That which 'tis in motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as faſt as it can, (the little ſcar I mean,
or <hi>Cicatricula)</hi> is a Chicken: But that there
is no more of this ſtirring but what is hem'd
and coopt up in the ſpring, while the body
that imprinted it is broken from it, is clear
from hence: For why, an egg that has been
kept many dayes, and ſet under a breeding
Hen, ſhall be hatcht no ſooner than one that
has been laid fewer; and the oftner they cool
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101488:82"/>
by the Hens being long off her neſt, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
are they in hatching; which is Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough that ſome ſtop or other was
met with by the way; and yet upon a bare
warmth or brooding ſhrowd, which only
removes way-layers or bruſhes the paſſages,
ſo giving ſcope for the ſprings of the ſcarr to
leap forth into nimble freaks and briskneſſes,
the <hi>makings</hi> towards animality are taken up
a freſh, and carried on, after all rubs in the
way, to that bulk and quickneſs, which
Dame Nature had caſt with her ſelf to bring
about.</p>
               <p>That this is done, as I ſay, by only paring
off encumbrances, and ſcouring the paſſages,
or at leaſt not from any new ſprings or ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
that are begotten, by the hoppings
and friskings about of ſuch warm and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſteams, as may be thought to have
ſwarm'd from the brooding hen, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
into the brooded egge; as a Watch or a
Jack, by being only wown up, without thrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the balance or flyer, fa<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l to work again:
may, I think, even hence, ſeem more than a
little likely,</p>
               <p>In that a Snayl or Dodman, which is not
only not warm, but to our feeling, very
cold, is fain to brood its as cold ſweatty
eggs, neſted upon a cold wet earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiewing
them about with the fuzze of a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101488:83"/>
cold clammy froth, in coldiſh raughty wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and all making way to a kind and
timely hatching of them: And ſo needful is a
kind of cold and ſultryneſs to the doing of
this, that as far as ever I could find by houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and turning of them, (when I have not
only miſs'd of the brood, but, for want of
feeding their earth and froath, with cold and
raughtineſs, as it ſhould be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have
ſoon loſt ſight of the very eggs too;) that I
ſay, I dare undertake to light ſooner of that
warmth and reek and air, that will hatch an
hens egge, than that cold and dew and
clammineſs, that goes to the hatching of a
ſnails.</p>
               <p>And to ſay there may be warmth, though
no body living could ever feel it, is as bad a
put off as to ſay, that ſuch a thing is ſence,
though all men in the world have ever taken
it for non ſence.</p>
               <p>'Tis therefore ſomewhat likely, that a hens
ſetting upon her eggs for hatching, is much
what, with her brooding her chickens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her wings when they are hatcht; the
one being to ward off quellers from the air,
the other to ſhrowd them from thoſe birds
of prey that are ſcouting &amp; ſharking up and
down in it. Whence a ſnail, whoſeeggs
have other kind of foes, beſets them with
other kind of ſhield and buckler. Their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101488:83"/>
being the caſing or houſing ſuch a
tickleiſh piece of workmanſhip, that wind
and weather may not ruffle and ſnarle it,
or any ſtragling bodies clutter up its rooms
and ſtifle it.</p>
               <p>From which I think, without ſtraining,
we may gather, that, if ſuch a ſpring as this
is, may be tickled and rous'd up again, in
which is bound up a whole ſet or draught
of ſprings, ſome ſhaping or plaſtick, ſome
bigning or growing, others barely ſtirring or
twitching, and after all ſo long ſtinted and ſo
often checkt; Well may one motion, of one
ſort, after ſinking into its ſpring, or being
wown up in it, be, by its inhidden power,
when unfetter'd, brought on again to a kind
of quickneſs.</p>
               <p>Little otherwiſe a hoop brought to a ſtiff
bough, and kept in it by ſuch a ſtrength as
can cope with it, upon ſome after chance
the hoop getting ground of its holdfaſt ſlips
or ſtarts, by fits and girds, keeping ſtill its
inward ſpringſomneſs, though in a leſſening
way, that is in a ſcantling to what is ſpent or
thrown off at every ſlip, until at length lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all its ſpringineſs, it falls of it ſelf into
the ſtillneſs of a reſt.</p>
               <p>This to me alſo ſeems to be the main, if
not the whole of Vegetative motion, or the
waxings and ſproutings forth, which are
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101488:84"/>
found in all growers. For I take the ſeed
(till ſome further experiment teach me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
to be a cluſter of bubbles wryed up
ſnug, or a bottome of hoops or ſprings
cloſely girt or knit together, which being a
little looſned when ſown a while, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewings
of the raughty mold ſoaking in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
its crevices, the ſprings ſwell and
grow roomthy, and which follows thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the boſomes or hollows are made wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
vvhence nevv moiſture or foggineſs
preſſes in, not at random, but moulded by
the hollovvs into bovvs for the nonce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dighted
or impregnated alſo, vvith a ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs
altogether fit, both to eke out that
of the vvidned hoops, and alſo by a kind
fermentation or buſtle of the vvorking or
leavening particles, beget nevv ſprings, and
then biggen the ſame, till the ſeed heaves up
from a ſprouting or ſhrubble, to the ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of height, bulk and grovvth, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has cut out for it, as a plant or as a
tree.</p>
               <p>But as in ſprings made by the hand of the
vvorkman, if they lie too long bent, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the ſvvarms of inſenſibles, drilling
through their pores or ſpungholes, they may
be ſo faſt ſtuck by ſuch as jump in die vviſe
or cubically, as to have their ſprings choakt
or benumm'd (as a piece of Iron by lying
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101488:84"/>
long in an odde poſture, may by the ſame
chance light upon a magnetiſm): ſo the
ſeeds of moſt or all grovvths, kept beyond
their full time, upon the ſame ſcore ſhed or
looſe their ſpringineſſes, and vvhen ſown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
barren or unſproutful.</p>
               <p>Only herein the motion that nature gives,
is unlike to that which we bequeath to
forthcaſts. For why, ſhe not only bedights
them with many ſprings at firſt, but lays in
ſpawn alſo for the begetting of more, and
ſtuff for the greatning of one and other.
Whereas when we give a dartingneſs to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts,
we betemme them but one or a few
ſprings, which by often ſturts and flaſhes of
motion, cracker-like, weaken themſelves,
till at length all ends in the calmneſs of a
reſt.</p>
               <p>Again, if we go up to the ſtock of
breathers, a ſtep above theſe as they are a
ſtep beneath us, we ſhall find that <hi>begetting
the like,</hi> is making over of ſprings; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the begetter is hotter and ſmirker,
or colder and liſtleſſer, the bows are ſooner
or later bent and ſhot off. So while the lively
eager Creatures do the buſineſs of their
kind, in the while that we are ſpeaking of
it, a Toad (to name one of the cold and
clammy kind) may-hap takes days to do the
ſame. Thus I remember that towards the end
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101488:85"/>
of <hi>March</hi> at high noon day, I was ſhewn a
he and ſhe Toad engendring, which to be
ſure had lyen ſo from noon the day before,
how much ſoever longer they might or
would have done, (unleſs the ſpring of the
year being backward, and the mouth'd and
vents of their bodies not yet opened, might
happily lengthen out the time ſomewhat
longer than otherwiſe.) And as it took ſo
much time to ſet the <hi>bowie frame,</hi> ſo it ſeems
he could not break off where he was very
ſuddenly; for we had not only ſlit open the
body of the ſhe, but were taking out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
before he could frame to get looſe of
her, and yet, at that time, he hugg'd her
only with his two forefeet, which he had
thruſt ſo into the ſoft of her ſides, as to make
two deep doaks there. So we ſee that man
or beaſt fetching their runns with earneſtneſs,
they can't ſtrike ſail, or notch the wheels,
and crooſe the ſprings, at work within them,
in a trice. And this alſo may be one cauſe
why earthworms are limed ſo much to the
headward, and hold ſo for an whole night.
And why Slugs or Dodmans ingender in the
neck, and are ſo many hours, if not days, in
the limeing, to wit, that ſo the workhouſe
for the ſprings may be nearer ſeated to the
ſtorehouſe of the tools and ſtuff for that end,
which is the brain and ſpirits. And why both
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101488:85"/>
of them too play the hees part in the deeds
of their kind, each crowding into the other
a roping, tough, ſilver-like thread of ſeed:
(That both do the ſhees work alſo, I cannot
yet find, but miſtruſt that Doctor <hi>Swam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merdam</hi>
might rather gheſs ſo aforehand than
know ſo.)</p>
               <p>Becauſe the quickening power of one, was
not enough to rally together all thoſe ſparks
of life, that lay aſunder in a clammy dew,
and were to be enkindled and hatcht up into
a ſpringineſs of ſuch a <hi>ſet,</hi> and ſo thrown off,
but both of them muſt go hand in hand, in
blowing of the bellows.</p>
               <p>Nor is it altogether without remark, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe of our own kind, that the man,
upon the account of his being ſtronger and
ſpringier does more, (as 'tis like will be
found) towards the bequeathing of that hord
of ſprightfulneſs to the little one that is to
be, than does the woman. (It ſeems not to
be in the firſt bleſſing of growing manifold,
for that was given <hi>evenly</hi> to both.) I know
ſomebody, who knows a woman of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
enough to make the remark, and of
faithfulneſs enough to be believed about it,
who took with child in the very fit of a
Third Ague, (not to name many that have
done ſo, out of the fit;) the latter being loſt
too, until brought to bed, for the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101488:86"/>
got: when yet I have not found hitherto,
(I know not what I may do, or others have
done,) that a man under that diſeaſe, either
in the fit or out of it, could be ſo much a
man as at other times; though I have made
the obſervation, where the man has had the
bleſſing of off-ſpring all the years of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
before and after, and the ground that
was to be ſown that year in as good tilt as
in the other, only the husbandman ſo much
out of plight. Whence it ſhould ſeem that
the life that is made over to the off-ſpring,
is but a frame or draught of-ſprings, leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a breedingneſs, and ſtampt upon this
or that which is beginning, and is either
ſtronger or weaker, in more or in leſs time
made over, as it happens that the Being
which does it, can fetch them up, or ſlip
them off. As unto the things thrown out by
the hand, there is given forth a clue of
ſprings, or ſtarts, and bearings, without
any ſuch draught of them or breed in them,
or plaſtick might in the thrower, ſo to frame
or rank them.</p>
               <p>But I would not here be underſtood ſo
much at warfare with my ſelf, as if I took
the ſoul of man to be a thing, that might
body-like be ſome ways mov'd or thrown
off; For having all along been driving at this,
that motion or going on by ſteps, is ſuch a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101488:86"/>
ſticker unto body, that it can no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Ghoſt, than thinking can to that, I
ſhould wonder at my ſelf, if I ſhould yield
that to the ſoul as 'tis beginning to be from
another, which it muſt by no means have to
do with, when it is it ſelf and does like it
ſelf.</p>
               <p>That which I mean therefore is that The
ſoul may be ſo one with a breeding frame
or bud of body, as, for ought I know, to
be <hi>made over</hi> together with it, when that is
made over, and yet not be <hi>mov'd</hi> as that
then is mov'd, any more than the thoughts
of the heart walk when the body walks.
And as a ſtrong breath'd and well ſet man
for wayfaring, ſhall foot it with greater
ſleight and more ſpeed, than one who is not
ſo made; in like manner, another man
whoſe plaſtick, ſhaping, or enkindling
powers, are fraught with more of manhood,
and quickued with a kindlyer ſprightfulneſs,
may make over the beginnings of manli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the beginning birth, with a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
no ways unanſwerable. Life and Soul
being two things with me, as are Spirits and
Spirit; the firſt being the ſpringineſs of the
body, in ſuch a well ſet frame, the other
that which ſets all in man a going: both
which as they are together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the <hi>being</hi> of
man, ſo are they, I think, in the <hi>beginning</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:101488:87"/>
of man; <hi>man</hi> being the <hi>ſon of man,</hi> as <hi>firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was <hi>the Son of God;</hi> the ſoul coming
from God, nextly, to the firſt man, and from
God through man, to every one elſe.
Whole mans ſpringing from whole man,
ſeeming, to me at leaſt, a main Doctrine in
that Text, <hi>Abraham begat Iſaac.</hi> But, that the
ſoul, which way ſoever we come by it, ſhould
be any thing of that body which we are, I
bleſs God, I never dreamt ſo much of Maſter
<hi>Hobbes</hi> in all my life as to think it. And if
any man elſe has had his brain ſo far blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
with that Writers Ink as to think, that
body may be thoughtful too, and any ways
aware, I believe he may have it pretty well
wip'd off for him, with ſome papers from
the hand of the Learned and Ingenious
Maſter <hi>Thomas Teniſon,</hi> in a
<note n="*" place="margin">The Creed of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Hobbes</hi> examined.</note> Book, where 'tis hard to
ſay, whether the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the whole be more ſtrong, or the
way of bringing them in more handſome,
onely becauſe both of them are moſt of
all ſo.</p>
               <p>Having thus far endeavour'd to reckon
with the ſlow paced motion, and found, to
our thinking, that 'tis a kind of thing that
has got the fidget; and that bodies ſo ſtirr'd,
do not gain for every minute of time, a point
of room, but jogging on in a jiffling way,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101488:87"/>
they lag behind at every bearing, as they
come up more or leſs at every jetting: We
ſhall go on to find out, whether there be not
alſo ſomewhat of likelyhood, that in the
ſwifteſt hurryes, and moſt glancing gobyes of
the world, ſuch bodies do not glide through
more than one leaſting of room, in one now
of time.</p>
               <p>That which has put me upon the gheſs is
this, Time is ſuch a thing as neither mends its
pace nor ſlacks it, but is always plodding on
at the ſame rate, but motion is a thing that
may be either hugely ſlow, or hugely ſwift,
or elſe in the middle between both: Now 'tis
but odde to think how ſuch a flicketing
skipjackly thing as that is, which is always
ſo much upon the ſnatches, that no body
knows where to have it, ſhould be bound to
the behaviour of ſuch a grave ſtayd thing as
time is. Eſpecially having ſeen already that
motion in its loyterings or ſluggiſhneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
walk times pace, but is caſt back much or
little as the ſtrifts are.</p>
               <p>Now that the mind may cope with this ſo
much the better, we muſt look back to ſome
hints before treated of, to wit, That what is
body and what is not body, ought not to be
meaſured by the ſame laws of worldiſhneſs,
or natural affections, any more than thoſe
reaſonleſs breathers that live under us, are to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101488:88"/>
to be weilded by thoſe laws Divine or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that are to ſway and bind the whole
ſtock of mankind.</p>
               <p>But now of things not-body there are two
ſorts, Either ſuch as are bodileſs and no more,
<hi>non materialia,</hi> or <hi>non corporea,</hi> ſuch as you
may fancy time to be; or elſe ſuch as are not
only bodileſs, but over and above ghoſtly,
<hi>immaterialia</hi> or <hi>ſpiritualia;</hi> either of which
may yet have to do with body, and in and
through that, give tokens to us, of its being
and power of doing.</p>
               <p>Thus we find the ſoul of man to have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
laid out for it in the body of man, by
way of oneneſs with it. In which, beſides a
ſort of mechanical or engine-like twitchings,
and animal ſprightneſſes which are there ſet
on foot, either by its power, or at its beck
and good liking, it alſo cleaves to it in the
advance to certain workings, of ſo lofty and
refined an alloy, as to ſtamp man with the
likeneſs and ſhew of him that made him, and
withal trim up and faſhion him for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhings
of a world after this, where it ſhall
be his bliſs to live with God, or his woe to
be baniſht from him, world without end.</p>
               <p>Then again, Motion, which is another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodily
thing, though it does not carry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
into any ſuch lofts as ſhould raiſe it above
its meanneſs when at reſt: yet in its med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlings
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101488:88"/>
with it, 'tis whisking about riding and
of the ſo manifold pieces of the world, that
it gripes within the bounds of its wide
verge all the reſtleſneſs that we are either
juſtling with, or other things bang'd about
by, within the whole ſcope which bodies
have to play in.</p>
               <p>Now this in its kind lying between ghoſt
and body, partaking of neither, is rais'd up
by both. Thus the ſoul of man and other
ghoſts, holding upon the hand of the firſt
Being, beget it daily; as he of himſelf, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by none, did at the firſt ſtir and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
other beings to do ſo and body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
(if I miſtake not,) without ghoſt, give
birth to it, in the rank of Beings next below
man, or at leaſt beneath that of breathers;
and this, according to the tickleneſs of its
lodging in the <hi>machina mundi,</hi> it does ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in it ſelf or in another body. For I am
ſo much of the mind, that matter or body
moves it ſelf under God, as poys'd or poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the frame of bulkineſs, that I wonder
all or moſt men, that have lookt much into
it, are not of the ſame mind too, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(or may be) more bodies mov'd by body
than by ghoſt, in the world. I ſee a body as
ſluggiſh as iron, may be ſo clapt in with the
knack of a Craftſman, as both to ſtir it ſelf,
and conne its heavy neighbour a ſhare too.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101488:89"/>
And I can't find in my heart to deny that
skill to a World-maker, that I muſt needs
give to a Watch-maker, not to ſay to that
child, who has but ſtrength enough to wind
that up, that he had skill enough to let ſo
down.</p>
               <p>And as it may be begotten by both, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd
another from both, ſo it may it
ſelf belong unto both, though in a way ſo
much unlike, that one word cannot well
take in the meaning of it as it reaches both.
For body being a ſtour unweildſom thing, or
at leaſt a boaky unthroughfareſom thing, it
cannot ſtir without asking another bodies
leave to crowd by; whence 'tis, that this
Motion, as ſuch, is ever onwardly or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
But a ghoſt being never in the leaſt
ſtinted in its way by body, is here, or there,
or yonder, forthwith or in an inſtant. For
if when 'tis here at <hi>this now,</hi> there be nothing
to hinder it from being there or yonder, <hi>next
now,</hi> it may be there or yonder then: And
if there be nothing but body to hinder, there
is nothing at all to hinder, all body being as
throughfareſom to ghoſt, as 'tis ſtopping to
body. But now this kind of leaping not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſucceſſive, but all together, 'tis but even
a leſſening and underly way of ſpeaking to
call it <hi>Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To apply this then, we are to lay down,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101488:89"/>
That this hord of reſtleſneſs is evenly dealt
out amongſt the ſundry Clubs and Cantreds
of bodies, while time is one and the ſame to
all and every one; inſomuch that it may fall
to the ſhare of ſome body or other, to be
more quickned or leavened with <hi>degrees</hi> of
<hi>motion,</hi> than 'tis beſteaded with <hi>pieces</hi> of
<hi>bulk;</hi> and thereupon behave it ſelf in the
world, more after the laws of unbodily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
than of thoſe that own body: things
working according to that which they have
moſt of within them. Now we having ſetled
this, That ſpirits change their Beings here or
there, in the <hi>All</hi> of bodies, far otherwiſe than
bodies do when they flit places, as being
now here, next now in the furtheſt corner
of the world, without taking point by point
the room that lyes between; and this power
they have too, as being <hi>not body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſay then again, That motion, a thing
as truly <hi>not body</hi> as ghoſt is, may happily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ſcore be ſo far quickned, by ghoſt at
leaſt, or ſo high wrought up in <hi>its own kind,</hi>
as to hale the thing ſtirr'd in the utmoſt
ſpeed, beyond the ſteppings of atome by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
after its kind.</p>
               <p>So a body having bequeath'd it one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ſturt or yerk, in one now of time,
and hitching thereupon one atome of room
may upon taking in ten or twenty degrees
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101488:90"/>
of the ſame, in the next, ſturt to many atoms
in length. Now it being as eaſie for a body
to take in ten or twenty degrees of ſtarting
in one now, as to take in one, (Start or ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
not being body in it ſelf, cannot be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
as intended in degrees, by that which
meaſures body as extended in parts;) it ſeems
not to bear very hard upon reaſon, that it
ſhould alſo undergo the brunt of them as of
one. As then the effect of one taken in in one
now, was a ſtart of one atome of room in
one now of time, the taking in of twenty
ſuch degrees in ſuch one now, ſhould alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
a skip of twenty ſuch atoms in one ſuch
now.</p>
               <p>Though the foul ſeems to have much the
better of it, as to the body, while in it, as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things often againſt the grain of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and more like it ſelf, when the body
cannot do many things againſt the ſouls
will, nor any againſt its kind, though the
things be never ſo friendly to body as body:
Yet this ſway that the ſoul has over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
will not help us out in the ſhewing, how
body may be carried out to the doing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it ſelf, as ſuch, when rous'd up by a
thing, not body, which has gotten the maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it. For the ſouls buſineſs in the wagon
or vehicle of the body, is not to ride it full
ſpeed, but to breath it fair and ſoft, rather
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101488:90"/>
to ride in ſtate than to ride poſt, ennobling
the body by its curious draughts and trails
of enlivening ſprightlineſſes, not jading it in
the great road of bare motion, which other
ſtirr'd bodies are wayfaring in.</p>
               <p>That therefore, whence I think a little
light will dawn towards us in theſe miſts, is
this, to wit, Some inſtance of Gods impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ghoſt, either by bare leave, or by bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to boot, to run body ſo far off its legs,
as to hurry it on nearer the pace of ghoſt,
than that of it ſelf, yet without inſouling or
inlivening of it. Thus, if any faith may be
had to ſtory, we have tales enough to make
a <hi>Thomas</hi> believe, that ſpirits have brought
bodies into a room, in the twinkling of an
eye, and by as clever a ſlight wafted them
away in another; and that they have in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
ſhape told ſome, as at this <hi>now,</hi> what is
done at a place, ſcores or hundreds of miles
off, which upon ſearch have been found to
have been <hi>done there,</hi> as near as could be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but the moment before it was <hi>ſpoken
yonder:</hi> Of which, (to name one) the <hi>Devil
of Maſcon</hi> falls not much ſhort, whether you
look upon the feats done, or the witneſs of
the ſtory that ſpeaks them ſo.</p>
               <p>But to be ſure, one who could never mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
himſelf, nor miſtel us, has ſaid flatly,
that our Bleſſed Lord was ſo ſuddenly waft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101488:91"/>
into the midſt of his Diſciples, <hi>(Luke 24.
36.)</hi> that of above 22 eyes none could ſee
him <hi>coming thither,</hi> till they beheld him
<hi>ſtanding there.</hi> And though they might well
believe their eyes, while he ſtood, that it
was, a body by <hi>ſtanding there;</hi> yet 'tis ſaid
they were frighted to think, that it muſt be a
ſpirit in its <hi>coming thither:</hi> they being no
more able to ken the body through the
glancing of the ſpirit that brought it, than
they could the ſpeed of a ſpirits glancing,
even without body. And as his coming was
thus over-quick, to be ſeen by thoſe eyes that
can ſee from earth to heaven in a moment, ſo
his going away from two, a little before,
was of the ſame kind, (v. 31,) <hi>He vaniſht out
of their ſight:</hi> not that the body turn'd to a
nothingneſs, but to an unſeenneſs, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.)
And ſuch, to end, was his farewel,
<hi>While he bleſſed them</hi> he parted, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>in</hi> the very bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
he was carried. It was ſo ſoon upon it,
that the Spirit of God did not think meet to
ſay it was after it. Though indeed we read
from one Goſpeller, That <hi>after the Lord had
ſpoken he was received up;</hi> yet he does not ſay
it was after theſe words of bleſſing, but might
be only after what he was ſpeaking of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going:
Or if he did take in this, he does not
ſay <hi>after</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which <hi>may be at, among,</hi> or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101488:91"/>
                  <hi>about, there,</hi> as well as it <hi>muſt be elſewhere,
Luk. 24. 5.</hi> And if it be ſaid that our Lords
Body was a ſpiritual body, we muſt alſo ſay,
that if it was not <hi>true body,</hi> as well as <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi>
it could not be truly a <hi>ſpiritual body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What we would gather hence is this, That
if a body, whilſt a body, may be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway'd
by ghoſt within it, as to bruſh
through many atoms of room in fewer nows
of time, it may happily be that that unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
thing call'd motion without ghoſt, may
be ſo far <hi>intended</hi> beyond what the body in
which 'tis is <hi>extended,</hi> as to bring it to a
like ſwiftneſs. So that if all the motion with
which God at firſt quickned the world, were
made over to one ſmall body, juſt holding
way with time in its motion, and all the reſt
at a dead ſtilneſs, time all the while holding
on its even by-run, 'tis not methinks altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unlikely, but that this body which ran
even a breaſt with time, from the motion
which it had before, ſhould now give time
the go-by, with what it has gotten ſince, and
is over-glutted with. But, to break off from
this ſo great a ſtamme to the mind, rather
wiſhing we could give more light in it, than
bliſſing our ſelves in that already given, We
go on to the following, which may ſeem to
have beſet the mind as narrowly with wrack
and night, as any of the foregoing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:101488:92"/>
We have it, with the former, father'd upon
<hi>Empiricus,</hi> thus. Take a line of nine points,
and imagine two leaſt bodies pacing with
even ſpeed from the two ends to the middle,
that they may meet there, 'tis needful that
the fifth or middle point ſhould be halv'd
between them, there being no reaſon why
one ſhould engroſs the whole more than the
other; when yet the places and bodies mov'd
in them, are for-taken to be altogether
without parts.</p>
               <p>To which by way of fore-runner, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwer,
That if the Argument be of any
force at all, it will hold as ſtrongly againſt
time's being made up of <hi>nows,</hi> as body's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made up of <hi>leaſtings.</hi> For ſuppoſe we
theſe nine atoms of room to be run over by
theſe leaſtings, in nine <hi>nows</hi> of time; each of
them then muſt needs have run as well four
inſtances and an half of time, as four atoms
and an half of room, time being a thing to
be halv'd as well as room: Notwithſtanding
which, we hold time to be made out of nows
or inſtances, and ſo may likewiſe for all that,
hold body to be made up of leaſtings or
points; Only we have a divine witneſs to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
us, that time had a <hi>firſt now,</hi> but have
only reaſon to beſpeak us, that bulk has a
<hi>leaſt part:</hi> Whence we are not ſo ready to
drive one <hi>back</hi> to infinity, as we are to drive
the other <hi>on</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:101488:92"/>
But then to ſpeak more home, we anſwer,
That the middle point is not to be halv'd or
ſhared between both, nor taken up by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but the race of both ſhall end at the
fourth leaſting. If it be askt, What ſtops
them there, when there is another leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of room between them ere they can
touch? I anſwer again, The laws of motion,
in the round All of bodies ſtop them there,
by virtue whereof 'tis impoſſible for a body
to move through leſs than a leaſt of room, or
to ſtrive to do it: Now the whole, or all that
lyes between them being the leaſt that can
be, if both ſhould crowd nearer, (and one
muſt do it as well as the other) motion would
be made in leſs than a leaſting of room: which
is but a kind of more than the moſt of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe.</p>
               <p>That they do not touch comes to nothing:
for having taken them up as Indiviſibles, ſuch
as can't be ſhread, we have thereupon made
them Inviſibles, ſuch as can't be ſeen; and
thoſe things that cannot be <hi>ſeen at all,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſeen <hi>to touch</hi> or <hi>not to touch at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you make two ſuch bodies as may
be ſeen, ſo to run a tilt upon ſuch a line of
odd leaſtings, we ſay they would meet and
touch, and yet leave the odd atome of room
between them too: For there are not two
bodies in nature or handy-works ſo ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101488:93"/>
outſided, but that being clapt together,
would leave as many leaſtings of room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, as thoſe they touch at indeed,
and in the mean time ſhould ſeemingly touch
or abutt at all, and by us be ſaid and thought
ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we are to reckon here, That 'tis
no unwonted thing in nature, for motions to
be checkt, from a bare truckling to the laws
of the world, or ſymbolizing with the ſcheme
of the great All, without the leaſt hit or ſtop
from other bodies that thwart them; as we
have before ſhewn they would do, at the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedge
of the World, and centre of the
Earth. Nor is this <hi>Show</hi> or <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to be underſtood, than that of two atoms
falling from the two ends of the Earths
throughfare line or diameter in even pace,
and both ceaſing to ſtir further, with the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
or <hi>inmoſt</hi> point between them, as here
with the <hi>middlemoſt.</hi> It being demonſtrable,
that neither of the two ſhould thruſt into
it, and ſhut out the other, for this reaſon,
Becauſe 'tis alike impoſſible, that both ſhould
have the whole, (two leaſtings of body
crowding into one of room;) or that each of
them ſhould have half, the breaking that
aſunder which is the leaſt that can be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
being only a breach of ſenſe, and nothing
at all beſides.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:101488:93"/>
Which laws too, are ſo far ſpread as to
take in ghoſt as well as body. For though
we are ſure that body cannot ſtop the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings
of a ghoſt, the hardeſt or the ſtiffeſt
matter being as throughfareſom unto that, as
the ſofteſt or the yieldingeſt: Yet, to go no
further than our own ſouls, we ſee them
bound, by theſe wide reaching laws we are
ſpeaking of, to the narrow cloſet of a mans
body; which that the body do not lock up
there for the ſake of its hardfaſtneſs or
cloſeneſs, we are enſured. For why, the body
is as faſt and unthroughfareſom when a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
as when enlivened: but when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
becomes a carcaſe by timely or untimely
death, we ſee then the ſoul can do after the
needings of its own kind, and fairly take
leave of the body for all its cloggiſhneſs;
not that it has ſprung any new leaks or ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-holes
to flie out at, but only that law
which bad it ſtay till then, bids it go now. If
you ask me then, What 'tis that keeps the
ſoul ſo faſt within the quickned body? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
Becauſe the great law of its kind has
ſet it no buſineſs to do any where elſe in the
world; and for the ſoul to be, and be for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or be againſt the law of its kind, which
is as bad, would too ill tax, and too much
ſhame the wiſdom of its maker. 'Tis a truth
with a witneſs, That every thing in the world
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101488:94"/>
is as much ſtakt down to its work (freedoms
in free beings ſet aſide) by the law of its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
as the Groundſil of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s was by the
tools of the Workmen. Yielding therefore
but this, That the ſoul was once put into the
body by God Almighty, to begin or carry on
a ſhaping or plaſtick work of life, in ſuch
bounds, of ſuch ſtuff, for ſuch a time; which
muſt be ſo, or elſe, that the hairs of our head
are told, or our time's in Gods hand, not ſo:
It will as ſurely hold to that ſpot of the
world, for that work, all that while, as all
other ghoſts may do within the ſelvedge of
it, or as the body would reſt where 'tis, if
begirt in a mould of marble, to the bigneſs
of the whole earths globe; the laws of the
All of bodies taking like place in both. The
reaſon of the latter being, not, that the body
of man cannot drill through marble at all:
For if God likes to impower it, it may, for
ought I know, do ſo, as well as our Bleſſed
Lord's could come in to ſuch a room, as
where the doors were ſhut. But the main,
if not the only thing in the way, is, That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
a narrower law be made for it, there is
a wider already made againſt it. And ſure, to
think of any other and thicker way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the body the ſouls inholder, as if any
ſtrings of it could bind it down there or
the cloſeſt coat of it wrap it up there, would
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101488:94"/>
be all one with hedging in the Cuckoe, or
laying of lime-twigs to catch the flying
thoughts of it.</p>
               <p>And that this law is not a law like that of
right reaſon, and ſetled within, but ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
one, far above and wide of it, may be
gather'd from hence; in that though we
think it never ſo meet and wiſh it never ſo
earneſtly, (if it be our mind and will only
and not Gods) that we may go out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in life, or ſtay in it at death, neither will
come to paſs, any more than willing to be
rich will make ſo; our bounded wills not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſtrength enough to unhinge Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
power: Who hath withſtood his
will, that is, of power or forecaſt?</p>
               <p>If I agree with a Workman to build me on
ſuch a plot of ground, an houſe of ſuch a
ſize, in ſuch a time, with ſuch ſtuff as ſhall
be laid him in, he not ſtirring out of it until
he has ended it; though the doors or wayes
be open, he cannot any wayes get out within
that time, <hi>morally</hi> or <hi>in right:</hi> For why, I
have ſo hem'd in that of him which is moral
by the bargain, that that <hi>cannot be done</hi> by
him that <hi>cannot lawfully be done</hi> by him,
though he has ſtill the ſame <hi>kindly</hi> power of
going out at doors or openings that other
men have. And could I now as well bind
him by laws of <hi>nature,</hi> as I have done by
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101488:95"/>
thoſe of <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi> (which God can do
both alike,) I ſhould then graſp <hi>all of him,</hi>
as well as before I laid hold of <hi>ſome of him;</hi>
and it would then be as well beyond his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to ſtir abroad <hi>altogether,</hi> as 'tis now to
do it <hi>lawfully;</hi> and he would more ſurely,
than with chains and bullwarks, be charm'd
within that circle all that time. If God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
had ſaid it with himſelf, That I ſhall
ne're ſet foot in <hi>Rome;</hi> though my ſoul has
the ſame power to do that for my body that
another mans ſoul does for him going from
hence thither, or that it ſhould do for me if
I went thither; yet I ſhall be as ſure not to
come there, as if I were way-laid with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but walls and ſconces gulfs and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.
So much does each thing after its
kind, bow to the laws of him that made it.</p>
               <p>Much of this may be ſeen to in the Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
below us, of which a bird, one of the
moſt quick and flitting kind, is one. At a
known time of the year, one of the laws we
are ſpeaking of, binds her to the ſluggiſh
trade of ſetting in a neſt upon eggs, on which
ſcore alone it does it, in the open lightſom
air too, and with more ſtilneſs than if tyed
with ſtrings, or born down with weights,
and notwithſtanding too, the kindly cravings
of hunger and thirſt, as ſeems from its lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
at that ſeaſon, and all this from as certain
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101488:95"/>
a cauſe as is that, by which the runner in a
Mill does not ſink through the Lyingſtone,
that is, a wide law of the Almighties. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſame law, that for the ſake of the
eggs hatching, had tyed down the brisk and
eager fowl ſo long, fore-caſting alſo for the
young ones a coming, bids it ariſe; for though
its fatneſs might be ſpared, yet its life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.
And now, though the Coethy bird
ſhould be as much bent upon ſetting and
ſtarving, as it was before upon riſing and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
yet, as then the ſtrength of the law
overbound it to ſet ſtill and hatch, ſo now
the force of the ſame overſwayes it to flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and eat: All this while ſhe plotting no
more, (without wiſer than we) than the
ſhruff, moſs and hair, that the neſt was
thwackt together of. In a word, 'tis ſo clear
that the Shows or <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the world
are weilded by unſeen laws, even the worſt
of its ſhocks and jumbles, and not after thoſe
thick roughneſſes that ſence beholds them
with, that he cannot be any thing of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Philoſopher (nor can he be now adayes
the latter, to ſpeak of, who is not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,)
that does not ſee, that even the Beings
beneath us are led to do all their tricks, by
a wiſdom far overtopping that by which we
manage the moſt weighty and crafty of our
own affairs.</p>

The birds we have been ſpeaking of, build
neſts with ſuch an auk tool, their beak vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too after the manifoldneſs of their ſorts
and kinds, without either being ſhown or
having tryed, more neatly than ſome men
would do, holding the Apprenticeſhip to the
craft of a Neſtwright and making it
their daily work, with the meeteſt of tools.
The Spider drives on the great buſineſs of
catching flies, by netting in corners within
doors, and darting in the open air abroad,
from the beginning to the end, with far
more layers of plots and traps than the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningeſt
Huntſman follows his game. If the
Commonwealth of Bees were but as narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

home, we find we could ſuch better at a week
old, without ſhowing or trying, than we
can do when grown up, by the help of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and ſight of the thing done: for when
we did it as ſucklings, we were ſteer'd by a
wiſdom in its ripeneſs, too far outgoing what
we laid claim to in the ſeeds and ſparklings
to be named with it. Nay, to end, we may

higher ſcantlings of wiſdom than when we
put forth the loftieſt powers of will and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:
elſe we can give no reaſon why
a Fool ſhould riſe more Mathematically
from a ſeat, than the wiſeſt man can fully
reckon for; inaſmuch as the remark is as old
as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That no man can riſe off a ſeat
without either bowing the body forwards, or
drawing the legs backwards: but the ground
of the thing has been ſo much in the dark,
that it was but lately (that I know) hit upon
by that great Light of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and the World,
(now with the Father of Lights,) the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Biſhop <hi>Wilkins;</hi> who has brought it ſo
to the lever of the thigh, as to make the
middle of it the prop or thiller, the body
the weight, and the leg the power; either of
which being brought by a ſharp angle to a
downright or perpendicular or more, with
the thiller, will by ſo much leſſen the weight,
from the yielded aſſumption in that mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick

by a perpendicular from the centre of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs,
is one of the terms: Which kind of
way made out to a fool, as an help to him to

he can do the thing without ſhowing, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101488:97"/>
as moſt wiſe men do too, without ſo much as
thinking how. So far do the laws we have
hitherto been upon, bind and overſway the

               <p>HAving thus ſeen how far body or the
world of bodies may be bigned, how
far a piece of it may be leſſen'd, and how
ſlowly or how ſwiftly bodies may be ſtirr'd,
The next thing to be handled is, Of what
ſtanding the world may be, or might have
been? Whether it might not have been ſo
far of old, as to have had no beginning; or
may not be ſuch a while to come, as to have
no end?</p>
               <p>To this we muſt ſay, That as we learn from
holy Writ, that the world had a beginning,
ſo from the grounds by us laid down, it could
not chooſe but have ſo; It being as eaſie for
God, who is without beginning, to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
as for the world which had it, to
have had none. God who is every way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded,
may as well be brought down to
the timeſomneſs of that which is bounded,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101488:97"/>
as that which is every way bounded, may be
lifted up to the alwayneſs of him who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded;
the farneſs being the ſame, 'tis all
one, for this to come to that or that to this,
the Hill to come to <hi>Mahomet</hi> or <hi>Mahomet</hi> to
the Hill. If it be ſaid, That Gods coming
down to the world would ungod him, but
not the worlds coming up to ſomewhat that
he is. I ſay, the worlds driving up to any
thing of Gods being, would as much ungod
him, and over and above unworld it ſelf.
For it does as much ungod him who is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
to make another ſo, as it does to make
him not ſo; for why, if he be not only ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
he is not everlaſting at all. Two
times may as well drive on by each others
ſide, and not be one, as two everlaſtingneſſes;
and two things unbounded in bulk, may as
well dwell together in the ſame unbounded
room, and not be the ſame bulk, as two
things unbounded in laſting, may dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the ſame abiding, and not be the
ſelf-ſame abiding.</p>
               <p>If God has the <hi>whole perfection</hi> or fulneſs
of everlaſtingneſs, then cannot the world
go ſhares with him, without he ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god
himſelf, by making himſelf leſs perfect;
and if he has it ſo wholly, as that whole
thing to be himſelf wholly, then cannot he
make it over to another, without making
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101488:98"/>
that to be no other but himſelf. Inſomuch
that I do think the begetting and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtepping
of the Son and Holy Ghoſt could
nere have been, had they not been Very God
of very God.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall ſay as ſome have done already,
that the world is ſomewhat <hi>beſides God</hi> for
all his boundleſsneſs, and has a bounded ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or perfection, over and above his bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
perfection, and ſo why may there not
be <hi>infinitely more</hi> than gods infinite <hi>whole
perfection</hi> as well as <hi>finitely more?</hi> I anſwer,
Methinks whoever ſays it, ſpeaks thick, in
both meanings, as taken for haſty and groſs
too. For though the world be ſomewhat
that is <hi>not God,</hi> yet 'tis not ſomewhat that
is <hi>not Gods;</hi> 'tis not <hi>he</hi> but 'tis <hi>his; 'its</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is <hi>his</hi> perfection, and ſo his, as that
it had never <hi>been his</hi> nor never <hi>been,</hi> if he
had not <hi>been Infinite</hi> or Almighty. Had the
world or any thing elſe perfection or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
though in never ſo low and ſcant a
way, and not ſpringing from God, I could
not tell how to think God an infinite maker;
ſomething <hi>being made,</hi> or <hi>being,</hi> that he did <hi>not
make:</hi> but that Gods making a boundedly
perfect world, from his unboundedly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
power, ſhould be a taking up of, or
leſſening to, that his whole perfection, I no
more conne, than that a mans doing a thing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101488:98"/>
wiſely, ſhould make him not to have the
whole of that wiſdom which he had. Indeed
if God were ſuch a kind of Being, as ſome
have made him, by ekeing him out with
boundleſs ſcopes, nothing could then be
roomthy beſides him, without carving a
piece out of him. Which he that ſtickles ſo
much for ſhould do well to mind a little
the twitchings of; For ſure he muſt be
ſtockt with forehead, as well as brains, to
hold it.</p>
               <p>As that Bayard muſt ever be as bold as
blind, that comes hobling with his blundring
houghs, on Hallowed be thy name. God is
an infinite maker as well as an infinite God,
infinite in doing, as well as in being; when
therefore he does or makes, he does or
makes <hi>ſomewhat:</hi> but that the <hi>ſomewhat,</hi>
ſhould end in a thing that is not God, falls
out by <hi>luck,</hi> and is not a thing that <hi>muſt
be;</hi> for Gods making of ſomething <hi>into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
is as much an Almighty work, as making
of ſomething <hi>out of nothing.</hi> Whence I think,
that God by making any things, does not make
any <hi>new perfection</hi> beſides, or out of, his
own, which is the whole infinitely; but
gives a <hi>new ſhow</hi> of it, in that, which ſtill
lives, or moves, or has its being <hi>in him,</hi> not
<hi>out of,</hi> or <hi>beſides</hi> him, as when he be nothings
a thing that is, he does not benothing any
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101488:99"/>
perfection, it being too hard to think how
that can be an infinitely perfect deed, as all
his are, but only ſhift the <hi>ſhow</hi> or <hi>ſight</hi> of
his own infinite whole perfection, which is
not more by doing this, nor leſs by doing
that; (or gives the ſame in another dreſs).</p>
               <p>The way to drive the world up to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs,
is not to give it a being ſooner
and ſooner, on and on: For when you have
driven it as far as you can that way, you are
as far off from Gods everlaſtingneſs as when
you firſt ſet out; and 'tis no better than if
you ſhould go about to make a man as wiſe
as God, by making him every day a little
wiſer than other. We have ſaid it and muſt
ſtand to it, that Gods everlaſtingneſs is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginningleſs,
endleſs <hi>now;</hi> and if you mean,
to get the world to go ſhare in it, you muſt
turn its way of being one <hi>now</hi> of time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, into that of being all at once, or
you do nothing; any more than you ſhall
make it all filling, unleſs you can put it out
of its wont of having here a piece and
there a piece, into the way of being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>If otherwiſe, look for brain-breaks from
ſuch kind of killing things as theſe; As an
infinite tale of years to have run before the
time in which the world, as 'tis, began; and
that is ſuch a <hi>cannot be,</hi> that we need ſay no
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101488:99"/>
more againſt it, becauſe we have ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
already: and then a more than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
tale now, becauſe more have run by
now, than had then: and a more than that
more, becauſe more are to come to the end
of the world, than have already been: and
then a moſt behind that after more, for why
there is to come an unknown tale of years
after the worlds end: and after that after as
endleſly as ever were before. Thus ſhall we
ſort out eternity into as many kinds and
lengths, as the <hi>Darbyſhire</hi> huſwife does her
puddings, when ſhe makes whitings and
blackings, and liverings and hackings:
and 'tis pitty for fooling ſake that we
cannot tye a ſtring at the ends of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
But ſtill that which kills after all this
death is, that in this infinite tale of years,
more than infinite, more than that more, and
moſt at the end of it, there muſt yet have
been a more infinite than all thoſe infinites of
moneths, and in that a more than that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
of weeks, and in that a more than that
infinite of days; in that, a more of hours,
in that, of halves quarters and moments:
and yet the firſt infinite tale, as much as all of
them together, neither more nor leſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 400. 402.</hi> And if any man think to
come flouriſhing off with this, <hi>That 'tis not
the infinite ſucceſſion but the infinity of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101488:100"/>
ſucceſſion that thus wracks the mind, and that
it would bear as hard upon any other infinite
but Gods, that is.</hi> I think ſo my ſelf and
would have others think ſo too, that a things
infinity in whole, which is finite in parts, is
enough to crack all the ſtrings in the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.
Therefore all the hurt I wiſh men, is
That as they love their eaſe, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
crack their brains nor rend their ſouls,
with thinking that there are any ſuch things,
while they live, but only in the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
where ſuch <hi>are ſuppoſed,</hi> but <hi>are not,</hi>
nor ever were ſaid to be. And then, as for
Gods ever bleſſed and only infinity, to a

of good cheer and heart taking, as the other
comes empty of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 413, 414.</hi> Our Author indeed is
clearly of the mind, the world might have
been from everlaſting, and that for ought I
can ſee for theſe reaſons only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis clear, ſays he, the world might have been
made ſooner than it was made; and if there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was a time in which the world could not be
made, it follows that it might have been made
from eternal ages?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Before <hi>world</hi> was, there was no
<hi>ſoonerneſs</hi> at all: and therefore the <hi>world</hi>
could not have been <hi>ſooner</hi> made than it was.
And the reaſon why there never was a time
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101488:100"/>
in which the world could not be made, is
only this; Becauſe there never was any <hi>time
at all,</hi> till the world that was the firſt time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
thing, was made, and by it time was. Nor
does it follow from thence, That it might
have been from eternal ages; For why, there
were no ages at all, until that which began at
the beginning of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Pag. 415.<hi> Could not God </hi>then<hi>make the world, </hi>when<hi> he ſet with himſelf that
he would do it? What bound him up, that he

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The words having a twofold mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
one true, the other untrue, I ſay he
could, and he could not; he could in one
meaning, and he could not in another. The
<hi>when</hi> has two faces, one with which it looks
<hi>inwards</hi> into the decree, the other with
which it looks <hi>onwards</hi> unto the world. As
to the firſt, 'tis not true; as to the latter, 'tis.
God could bring forth the world at that
<hi>then, wherein</hi> or <hi>when</hi> he had caſt with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the world could afterwards be made, and
that was <hi>when</hi> it was made: But God could
not do it <hi>then, when</hi> he was ſetting with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to do it <hi>afterward,</hi> (if I may word it ſo
to be better underſtood;) and that <hi>when</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was from everlaſting; for he had decreed
from everlaſting, that he would do it in time,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:101488:101"/>
and it could be done no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>That forecaſt or decree by the power of
which the world was, was nothing but God
forecaſting or decreeing; and if the world
had been of as long ſtanding as that was,
that had been God too. That everlaſtingneſs
that made one to be God, would have made
the other ſo. Inſomuch that the Argument is
nothing but this, God was from everlaſting,
therefore the world might have been ſo too.
And that is indeed a pretty little brat, that
has been ſo lovingly dandled by <hi>old Father
Hobbes,</hi> that it will never call other man
Daddy while the world laſts.</p>
               <p>Methinks decreeing is ſo much <hi>forecaſting</hi>
or <hi>foredooming</hi> that which is to be, and is
not, till ſo foredoom'd, that do but once
yield that the world was, becauſe God from
everlaſting did decree it ſhould be, and for
the ſake of that alone it cannot be from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.
The world being <hi>no world</hi> but as it
was a <hi>decreed world,</hi> and the decree by which
it was ſuch, being from everlaſting <hi>decreed,</hi>
and never a <hi>decreeing,</hi> then I ſay, The world
muſt be after the decree, not in the <hi>paſſing</hi>
of it; for it was ever <hi>paſſed,</hi> never <hi>paſſing.</hi> So
the decree <hi>paſſed,</hi> was the cauſe of the world
<hi>made.</hi> Now the decree which was <hi>paſs'd</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, being <hi>from everlaſting,</hi> it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>from everlasting before it.</hi> So that by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101488:101"/>
making the world as much as you can of old,
you can make it no more everlaſting than
'tis; for it would alwayes be alike <hi>after</hi> the
decree, which was <hi>from everlaſting before it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you ſay the world was juſt as everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the decree, rather made in it than by
it, or upon it: Not to ſay, How can that be
made, that was never a making? I ſay then,
The world muſt needs be before ever God
was aware of it, or could ever decree it;
and ſo as much the cauſe of the decree, as
the decree of that; and the decree as much
a <hi>worlded decree,</hi> as the world a <hi>decreed
world;</hi> and that decree being God himſelf,
he muſt be alſo a worlded God, or a begoded
world.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſtill a truth, and owned ſuch, That
what binds up God from doing, binds him
alſo from willing: But as God had not a
power from everlaſting, to make the world
from everlaſting; ſo neither did he ever will
it ſhould be ſo: but his will from everlaſting
was, That it ſhould be in time. Accordingly
his power holding an evenneſs with this his
will, brought forth the world at that time
and no other, than we read it took begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. </hi>There is yet another Argument much
befriended by the ſame hand, as alſo to be
met with good broadly ſomewhere in the<hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:101488:102"/>
Morean </hi>Philoſophy, and that is,<hi> Why could
not God as well make the world everlaſting </hi>a
parte ante,<hi> on the behalf of formerneſs, as he
did the ſoul of man </hi>a parte poſt,<hi> on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of latterneſs? Why could not the one as
well have no beginning, as the other no end?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This all flows from a very great
miſtake about the very being of that thing
which we call <hi>Everlaſtingneſs.</hi> Gods everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs,
and that of the ſoul, are two things
under one name; and ſo wide aſunder too,
that they lye infinitely off each other, as to
their very kind. As Gods everlaſtingneſs
was always without ſucceſſion, ſo 'tis now,
and ever ſhall be. And as the everlaſting ſoul
of <hi>Adam</hi> has liv'd as ſucceſſively ſince his
death, as the world it ſelf, that we ſee holds
on to do ſo ſtill; ſo ſhall it abide for what is
to come, as it has for that which is paſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it ſhall never wear otherwiſe than it has
or does. And it ſhall never be ſaid, That
his, or any mans ſoul, has liv'd to an infinite
number of minutes; but whatever minute
you pitch upon, in the boundleſs laſting of
the ſoul, it will have a bounded tale of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
behind it; and it ſhall never live in
other to come, than ſuch as are already paſt;
the ſoul being rather indefinite than infinite
in its abiding, rather of an unmarkt laſting
than everlaſting; and that everlaſtingneſs
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:101488:102"/>
or endleſneſs which it has, (ſo call'd,) ſhall
come no nearer Gods everlaſtingneſs or end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs,
than if it laſted only for a while, and
then ended: For ſtill it ſhall be rightly ſaid,
That God is every way infinitely beyond the
ſoul, in his way of abiding. Gods everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs
is without beginning and without
end; and theſe two are ſo together, and
bound up in one, that you can no wayes
halve them, and ſay, This half is unbegin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly,
and that unendingly; this unlike
the ſouls abiding, and that like it: For that
is this, and this is that in God, and both are
one, and one God too, and you can no more
ſunder them than cut a <hi>now</hi> in two. From e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
to everlaſting is God's whole eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and nothing leſs can be it, or any thing
of it; If it be otherwiſe dealt out, we muſt
remember, 'tis for our ſakes only.</p>
               <p>But now the alwayneſs of the ſoul is ſuch
a thing, as of which it may be ſaid, it ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
was not, as well as it evermore will be.
Now as that which evermore was, ſtands off
infinitely from that which evermore was not,
ſo does Gods everlaſtingneſs, which was the
former, from that of the ſoul which is the
latter. And as for that which is to come, the
ſoul muſt creep on to it ſtep by ſtep, now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
now: Whereas to Gods everlaſtingneſs,
as there was nothing before it, ſo there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101488:103"/>
to come after it; nothing to come, nor
nothing paſt in reſpect of it; but all to him
is <hi>now,</hi> and he is ſhier out of the length of
our line, from everlaſting before it, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
beyond it.</p>
               <p>Should it be otherwiſe than we have ſaid,
this unbecomingneſs would tread upon the
heels of it, to wit, That the world might as
well get up with Gods all-fillingneſs by
growing bigger, as with his everlaſtingneſs
by growing older. For let us but ſuppoſe the
world every week it laſts, to wax as big a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
(he that made this in ſix dayes, can
make it as much more in ſix more,) and to
have the ſame everlaſtingneſs the ſoul has, or
might have had; if by its <hi>ever</hi> growing older
it would reach or hold up with Gods ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs,
then by its <hi>ever</hi> growing bigger
it would reach or hold out with Gods all-fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs:
ever to ever, or infinite to infinite
being the ſame.</p>
               <p>Why could not God make the world
boundleſs in its bigneſs one way, as the ſoul
in its laſting another way? As ſuppoſe an
infinite line to cut the infinite roomthineſs
in the midſt, (as ſomebody will ſhew you
how,) might not God have made in one half,
a Being boundleſs in bulk one way, ſo as we
might ſay, that God were infinitely beyond
the bound of its infinity one way, as well as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101488:103"/>
ſay, God was everlaſtingly before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of our everlaſtingneſs one way. Its
immenſity might as well have a firſt part as
to outſtretchedneſs, and no laſt, as our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs
have a firſt now of its abiding, and
no laſt. Extenſion that is infinite as to bulk
one way, is no more uncouth than an abiding
that is everlaſting as to length one way.</p>
               <p>But now ſhould there ever be ſuch a thing
as this, it muſt needs ſhare in the half of
Gods all-fillingneſs; but ſeeing that Gods
all-fillingneſs cannot be halv'd, but is what it
is wholly, and this is what it is halfly, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
That becauſe this Being cannot reach
half of it, or all of it, it can reach none at all
of it. In like manner, Gods everlaſtingneſs
not being to be halv'd, any more than his
all-fillingneſs, the everlaſtingneſs that the
ſoul has, muſt reach the whole of it, or none
of it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the thing would be too ill matcht
with it ſelf, ever to be at all. If that which is
once infinite can never be finite, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that even while 'tis infinite it ſhould be
finite too, infinite one way and finite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whether it be ſo in its laſting or in its
roomthineſs. Finite one way and infinite
another, is worſe than man one way and
horſe another, or woman one way and fiſh
another, which yet is that Centaur and Mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101488:104"/>
that never were but in the wildeſt
thoughts of him that ſometimes roved at
them.</p>
               <p>But indeed the ſelf-ſame Writer has
told us roundly, (p. 399.)<hi> That Gods being
everlaſting, is nothing but his having the root
of it ſo in him, as to be call'd everlaſting in the
ſelf-ſame meaning that the ſoul of man is; not
that it has been together with that which is to
be, but that 'tis put into ſuch a way that it
muſt needs ever abide, and be </hi>together with<hi>every </hi>now,<hi> when once it comes. But that
God ſhould be </hi>in actu,<hi> or already, together with
thoſe moments that are to come, is both </hi>abſurd<hi>and </hi>impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Now I muſt beg leave to ſay, That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this everlaſtingneſs may ſet well enough
upon the thing that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> has made a
God of, that he might play with him: yet I
am ſure it would full ill become that God
who has made us, that we might worſhip
him. For I will be bold to ſay, 'tis prov'd,
the ſoul ſhall never have liv'd everlaſtingly,
and that that everlaſtingneſs which the ſoul
has in the root, and is to come, is of the ſame
kind with that abiding which it has already
grown up to, and is paſt: Nor is it any thing
elſe but time eked out, now after now, a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs
that is indefinite, but not finite; for
why, a thing that is finite backwards, cannot
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101488:104"/>
be infinite forwards, any more than a thing
may be boundleſs in bulk one way and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
another. Now, that God Almighty
ſhould have an everlaſtingneſs that is as
much finite as infinite, growing as grown, or
be only indefinite, is a thing that I will not
call by its right name: but be it as it can
be, it lights full upon the head of him that
ſays, Gods everlaſtingneſs is ſo ſtrainedly
ſuch as that of our ſouls is. If it be allayed
with this, That only that part of Gods ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs
which is to come, is akin to ours;
he that ſhall do it, is himſelf more akin to
<hi>Waltham</hi>'s Calf, that was to ſuck part of that
Bulls milk that had none at all. He that
breaks aſunder Gods everlaſtingneſs, breaks
the Godhead; for why, his everlaſtingneſs
is no leſs than his very Being: and he that
makes part of it like to ours, makes the
whole ſo; for whatſoever part you pitch on
fore or aft, it is the whole, and <hi>now for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground we go upon here is this, That
whatſoever God is, or is in God, is <hi>actualiter</hi>
or in a readineſs, and that he is not towards
any thing which now he is not, or in <hi>potentia
ad aliquid.</hi> That the bare Eſſence or Being of
God is ſo in <hi>actu</hi> or forthwith, that 'tis as
impoſſible he ſhould be in <hi>potentia,</hi> as that
he ſhould be leſs perfect, is owned as well by
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101488:105"/>
our Author as any man. But I ſay then, That
Gods everlaſtingneſs muſt needs be as much
in a readineſs, becauſe Gods <hi>Being,</hi> as 'tis
everlaſting, is as far from <hi>not being,</hi> and as
every way <hi>perfect</hi> as his Being barely taken.
And if that be reaſon enough to make one
actually or forthwith, 'tis ſo too to make the
other; the latter being bound in the former,
and Gods <hi>being alone</hi> without <hi>being everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
not being at all, but as we think it, by
it ſelf. If then Gods Eſſence or Being, taken
<hi>only</hi> as ſuch, cannot be made up of being and
not being, neither can that his Being, <hi>taken
as everlaſting;</hi> the <hi>everlastingneſs</hi> of it being
as much of the Eſſence as the <hi>nakedneſs,</hi> and
rather too, inaſmuch as one is, the other lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is but thought. If then Gods being as
ſuch, ſhut out as well the may be, <hi>poſſe eſſe,</hi>
as the may not be, the <hi>poſſe non eſſe,</hi> Gods Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as ever being, ſhuts out both too; elſe
God ſhould be more perfect in the being
which he has <hi>ſunderly</hi> in our thoughts, than
in that being which he has <hi>truly</hi> in himſelf.
If that of Gods <hi>everlaſtingneſs</hi> which is to
come <hi>may be,</hi> but <hi>is not;</hi> then that of Gods
<hi>Eſſence</hi> which <hi>it</hi> is, <hi>may be</hi> alſo, but as yet
<hi>is not.</hi> He then that ſayes that Gods <hi>bare Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
muſt be <hi>forthwith</hi> or <hi>actu,</hi> but his <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Eſſence,</hi> or his everlaſtingneſs which is
all one, muſt be <hi>forth-coming</hi> or in <hi>potentia,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:101488:105"/>
muſt either ſay he does not know what, or he
does not care what; it being true blew <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi>
or <hi>Hobbes</hi> ingrain'd, one of the two.</p>
               <p>To make it yet out, that Gods everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
muſt be like that of the ſoul, growing
ſtill more and more, our Author goes on,
by ſhewing the aukneſs or great abſurdity
on the other ſide, which is, <hi>That all that which
is to come ſhould already be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That that which is ſo unto us ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
be with us, I acknowledge is auk e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
but that that which is ſo to us, but
not to God, (to whom nothing can be to
come or paſt) ſhould be <hi>now</hi> together with
him, is no more odd, than that that which is
a great way off in place from us, ſhould be at
hand to God-ward. As for what we read in
Holy Writ, that God was, and is, and is to
come, 'tis a coming down to our meanneſs:
As when he ſaid, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was I am,</hi>
and <hi>This day have I begotten thee,</hi> who was
begotten from everlaſting, he kept as near
to the thing that he was, as he kept off from
the Grammar that we ſpeak by. And if we
ſhould but reaſon from the likeneſſes that
God has given us of himſelf to other things,
as 'tis here done from the likeneſs given to
time, unto his being ſuch indeed, we might
eaſily make as odd a thing of the Godhead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as ſomebody elſe has done of his everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:101488:106"/>
Beſides, 'tis owned too, That all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are to come ſhall never be,
[p. 399.] and therefore God ſhall never be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
together with them. Not to ſay how hard
'tis, that that which is not at all, nor ever will
be, nor can be at all, nor can come nearer at
all, ſhould yet be a coming; I muſt yet mark,
that this onward everlaſtingneſs which is
faſtned upon God Almighty, is all along
made up of things which before were not,
afterwards are not, and leaves ſtill beyond
it things that never ſhall be: So that Gods
everlaſtingneſs, or everlaſting God, is made
up of ſomething that now is, and ſomething
that was and is not, and ſomething that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, nor ever was, nor ever will be: And
that is a ſomething that never was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor is now ſomething, nor ever will
be ſomething: but a ſomething that is now
nothing, and alwayes was nothing, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
will be nothing; unleſs the Reader
will let it be ſomething that is now awake, and
alwayes was awke, and alwayes will be
awke.</p>
               <p>But we are not only to be burden'd with<hi>awke, </hi>but knockt down with a<hi> Can't be </hi>too.
For ſo we read,<hi> If there be nothing to come
of Gods infinite ſucceſſion, then 'tis come to
an end: but 'tis a Contradiction that what is
unbounded ſhould ever be ended: 'tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:101488:106"/>
impoſſible<hi> that God ſhould be </hi>in actu<hi> or
at hand with that, which is not ſo yet, but
will be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed ſmells pretty ſtrong of quirk,
but reliſhes as faintly as may be of reaſon.
For it has no crutches to lean its crippled
burden on, but what we have already pluckt
from under it, to wit, a ſucceſſion in Gods
everlaſtingneſs; whence 'tis thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
things are to come to us, who are
growing onwards, they muſt be ſo to God
likewiſe, who is not, but calls the things that
are not as though they were: and I think
enough has been ſaid to ſhew, that neither is
extendednes the meaſure of Gods immenſity,
nor is ſucceſſive laſtingneſs the meaſure of his
eternity. But if the man who is ſo all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted,
will needs be ſetting up a <hi>Will in
the wiſp,</hi> no wonder if the glare of it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
roblet him into bogs and marlpits.</p>
               <p>But if another gates anſwer muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
I do ſay, that when ever any man dogs
me with this, If there be <hi>nothing to come</hi> of
Gods eternity <hi>tis at an end?</hi> Then will I
ſay too, If there be nothing to come of <hi>half</hi>
of it, that <hi>half is at an end.</hi> So at the very
time of my writing this, <hi>Half</hi> Gods ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs
ſhould be fairly tript off; and
though God Almighty were <hi>whole God</hi> from
everlaſting, yet he is to be but <hi>half-God</hi> to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101488:107"/>
everlaſting; his everlaſtingneſs being of his
very Godhead, and this halving of it being
a knack of our Authors owning long ſince.
Again I muſt ſay, If there be no <hi>part</hi> of
Gods immenſity <hi>beyond</hi> the room where I
now am, then tis wholly here, and if
wholly here tis wholly finite; for ſuch is
the whole room that is here: But tis a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
that boundleſs being ſhould be
bounded. For the rightning of all which
there is nothing in the world to be brought
forth but this, that He that talks of one or
other, talks idle, and jumbles holy Ghoſt
and body, laſtingneſs and everlaſtingneſs
both together, which ſhould always be kept
wide aſunder. <hi>Something to come,</hi> and <hi>part
beyond,</hi> have nothing to do, with Gods
everlaſtingneſs or alfillingneſs, but are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken up by body and time. And becauſe
we ſee that every body has a middle and
that our laſtingneſs has an onwardneſs, we
are haſty to make over theſe to God and his
everlaſtingneſs: Whereas nothing has a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
that has not two ends, between which
the middle muſt evenly be, nor is any thing
growing older that was not ſometimes
young, or young that was not ſometimes
nothing: If then Gods Eternity has neither
beginning or end, he muſt be hugely out,
that talks of the middle of it; and if God
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101488:107"/>
were never younger than he is, he is but a
brainſick wight that dreams of his growing
older. If nothing of his everlaſtingneſs be
paſt, nothing of it is to come, and if any
be paſt then ſomething of Gods being, was,
but is not; and if any be to come, then
ſomething of Gods being is not yet, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
ſhall be, and yet his own ſelf ſtiffly
and rightly holds, that Gods being <hi>as ſuch</hi>
is altogether in a readineſs or <hi>actualiter.</hi>
Now do but put theſe two together, and ſee
how huge luckily and unluckily they ſpell
<hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>impoſsible,</hi> which yet are the two
hard things that are caſt into the Folks diſh
for them to gnaw upon: Sometimes he that is
buſie in hurling ſtones at random to pelt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens Geeſe, may unluckily brain ſome of
his own Swans.</p>
               <p>Though the thing we are upon be ſo a
<hi>Noneſuch,</hi> that there is no other thing in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or can be, to which we may fully liken it,
yet ſome things there are by our looking
unto which, the underſtanding, I think, will a
little the better cope with this. One is the
way of the ſouls being in the body, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with it. Let us then with <hi>Michaelius</hi>
(a late <hi>Hoorns</hi> man) take eternity to be as it
were the ſoul of time as then the ſoul takes
in all the body, without being partable as
that is, but being as cleaveleſs as if it were
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101488:108"/>
but the leaſt point of it; So eternity hems in all
time, without creeping on &amp; on as that does,
but being as free from all ſucceſſion as the
leaſt now of it. Little otherwiſe Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or knowing differs from ours, as ſealing
or printing does from limning and drawing,
one asking time, and the more done the more
time; the other is done in a moment, and
much may be done in that moment as eaſily
as a little.</p>
               <p>Another likeneſs may be that of the
wheel, beſet with a row of cogs or pegs,
in the whirling about of which, to an eye
that is plac't within, the ſtirring of each cog
comes into ſight, one after other, all on a
row; ſo that the firſt look't on, muſt turn
about to the point at which its ſtart began,
before all of them can come to be ſeen; but
to an eye that is ſeated without the wheel,
the running of the wheel is taken in the
twinkling of an eye. Now God is beyond
the wheel or line of our time; for why, he is
beyond the ſelvedge of this our timeſome
world, by way of perfection, that is, not
ſtowage, to him then the whole wheeling
about or revolution of times, is as much in
an inſtant, as the leaſt now of it is to us.</p>
               <p>Nor is it right down trifling to mark how
time has a great deal of its length or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
from the plight that our ſouls or bodies
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:101488:108"/>
are in: for when we are ill at eaſe, the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time is alwayes long, and the wheel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
drives on heavily; but when we are blith
and happy, the wheel is laid aſide for wings,
and that which could ſcarce go of late, now
flies, and overſwiftly too for us to mark its
ſpeed. Now God who is infinitely more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
than we are, muſt needs drive on the ſpeed
of this wheel to an infinite height, beyond
what we can; ſo that it muſt do no leſs than
wind up into it ſelf, even in a very moment.
If it can take the <hi>ſlowneſs</hi> of one <hi>now</hi> after
another, from us, why may it not take the
<hi>ſwiftneſs</hi> of all its <hi>nows together</hi> from God?
And though indeed many things <hi>are to us</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than they <hi>are,</hi> yet ſo as all things
<hi>are to him,</hi> even ſo they <hi>are indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to make ſhort with our Author, to
whom it ſeems the world might have been
from everlaſting, we ſhall only mark what
an ugly train this carries after it. His news is,
That the world might have been as unbegin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
as God himſelf, and then to be ſure it
may be as endleſly as he is; for the ſoul which
is one thing that God had made, being ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
the world which is another, may be
ſo too, if God will: So God may give away
his whole everlaſtingneſs, to a world that is
as much as he can be from everlaſting to
everlaſting: And when he is thus on the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101488:109"/>
hand, he may give away his immenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
too. And this indeed our Author is ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to yield, that he has taken it up for a
thing that all men elſe have done; for ſo he
lanches out, (p. 391.) <hi>Our laſtingneſs cannot
be of another kind from Gods everlaſtingneſs;
for then if God ſhould make a body of an all-filling,
outstretchedneſs, it would not be all-fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
becauſe it would have dimenſions of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind from what God has.</hi> So he does not
only take it for a truth, That ſuch a thing
may be, but a more owned truth than that
which this is brought to ſtrengthen. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
whether <hi>he will</hi> hold ſo or not, <hi>he muſt,</hi>
or elſe break with himſelf. For if the reaſon
why the world might be from everlaſting,
was, (as p. 414. is ſaid,) Becauſe there was
no part of that laſtingneſs which was before
the world, in which it began to have a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to be, but ſtill it might have been ſooner
and ſooner unbeginningly, then the ſame
gives the world leave to have been all-filling
as to bulk: For why, there is no ſcantling of
that roomthineſs beyond the world, beyond
which the world had no power to be, but
ſtill it might have been bigger and bigger
boundleſly. Beſides, for fail, he has found
out another way to make the world as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
as God is, though it were made boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from everlaſting; and that is by growing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101488:109"/>
every day bigger and bigger endleſly: ſo
having laſted an <hi>infinite while,</hi> it muſt needs
have grown up to an <hi>infinite bulk,</hi> though
made otherwiſe at firſt; for ſo he ſays, God
is call'd <hi>everlaſting,</hi> not that he is gotten up
to all the nows of time that are to come, but
that he is hieing thither as faſt as he can, in
the ſame road with our ſouls. Which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a moſt curious, pretty, dainty thing if
you mind it narrowly: For, in likeneſs, Gods
immenſity may be call'd ſo, not that he has
fill'd all roomthineſs from all eternity, or was
everlaſtingly every where; but from his
growing ever more and more in bulk, he may
be ſaid to be immenſe, as from his growing
ever older and older in time, he may be ſaid
to be eternal: ſo have we gotten a world as
everlaſting and as immenſe as God himſelf.
Now he that will but cut out ſuch a God for
me and make it thus far, Ile undertake to
make it up for him with ſtuff of the own;
for now Gods Almightineſs, All-wiſdom, and
whatever elſe comes under the name of <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributum
incommunicabile</hi> in the <hi>Dutch Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
ſetting no cloſer to the Godhead than
his everlaſtingneſs and all-fillingneſs, he
might from everlaſting have thrown them in
too after the other: or however, if he gave
them but a bounded mightineſs and wiſdom,
yet inaſmuch as there might be a growing
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:101488:110"/>
every day more mighty and more wiſe from
everlaſting, that Being muſt needs be as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in wiſdom and mightineſs as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
becauſe as infinite in thoſe two as he is
in his everlaſtingneſs, in which he is no leſs
infinite than in them.</p>
               <p>All that we want now of making the
world a God <hi>Cap-a-pe,</hi> or up to the Brim, is
only this, That ſuch a world would be made
by God ſtill, and not from everlaſting of it
ſelf, as he is. But do but put it next into that
ſame boundleſs roomthineſs and abiding,
whereupon 'tis ſaid, <hi>they would jump into
one roomthineſs and abiding;</hi> and, <hi>which are
as much of themſelves as God himſelf is, and
were and will be for all him from everlaſting
to everlasting;</hi> and then I think he will have
ſet before us ſuch a <hi>Hoghen moghen</hi> Leviathan,
that that of Holy <hi>Job</hi> would be but a kind
of Spratkin to it ward, and the bigger one of
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> would never be enough to make
Anchovy-ſauce for it. Though indeed I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think he meant no better, yet weighing
theſe things, I muſt needs ſay, <hi>He ſeems to be
a ſetter forth of ſtrange gods,</hi> and looks as if
he had given us <hi>Tentamina de Deo</hi> for the
nonce. And for my part, if I did but think
there were or could be any ſuch thing as
ſprings thus kindly from the ſeed which he
has ſown, it would give me for ever frolick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101488:110"/>
on't again, and I ſhould go in fear of my
life on't every day I riſe, and dream full
dradly on't every night I went to bed. For
I being at no agreement vvith this ſame <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
Roomster,</hi> as to the vvay hovv I ſhould
behave my ſelf tovvards it vvhile in it, hovv
to beſpeak its forgiveneſs after doing amiſs,
or how to know when I have done ſo; it
may be, while I am thinking how all is well,
and a coaks a coming, I may, for ought I
know, be ramping on the ſnout of it, and ſo
have my harmleſs miſtake paid home by a
vile miſchance and a ſudden too, with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs than the dreadfulneſs of a grim
nip, and a dead-doing gripe.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall be enough to have ſpoken
to the firſt part of our fourth Head, How
far of old, the world or body, has or might
have been: The other part is, How long it
ſhall or may laſt. The Anſwer to which muſt
be twofold, according to the twofold ſtate
of the world; to wit, That in which 'tis, and
that in which it ſhall be. As to the latter,
There ſticks nothing with me, but that the
world or body may be as everlaſting as the
ſoul: For I think 'tis as impoſſible, that that
which is ſomething ſhould make it ſelf no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as that that which is nothing ſhould
make it ſelf ſomething. And when we ſay,
the body is dying or timeſom, the ſoul death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101488:111"/>
or endleſs, we do not mean the body
ſhould thereby loſe its bodyhood, but only
its ſuchneſs: It ſhall be or may be alwayes
body, but it never ſhall be, or at leaſt never
was it body unſhifted; but after its kind,
ſending forth and taking in of ſteams and
reeks, even all along.</p>
               <p>But as to that plight in which the world
now is, the <hi>May be</hi> of its laſtingneſs is not to
be gathered from the <hi>inwardneſs</hi> of the
thing; for, for ought we know, body as now
'tis, may laſt as long as body renewed and
cleanſed by fire, as hereafter it ſhall be: But
we are altogether to look <hi>outward</hi> to the will
of God, who, as he hath ſaid to the Sea, Thus
far ſhalt thou go and no further <hi>in room,</hi> ſo
has he ſaid to the World, Thus far ſhalt thou
go and no further <hi>in time:</hi> The laſt day and
hour of which, though no man knows, yet
I think 'tis not much harder to pitch a time
beyond which it ſhall not be, than 'tis to find
out a ſcantling beyond which the roundle or
globe of the earth is not, as now.</p>
               <p>For whether we hold, That the ſame body
which ſlept ſhall riſe again, that very fleſh,
blood and bones which it lay down, as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Church ſeems all along to have believ'd;
or whether we will have it, That the ſame
body, becauſe the ſame Man with body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſted,
riſes, as ſome of the uppermoſt ſeat
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101488:111"/>
of Philoſophers at this day have themſelves
thought, and wonne upon others to think
ſo too; Inaſmuch as both of them are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be made of ſtuff already in
being, it comes all to one: As ſure as we are
that the body ſhall riſe again either way, ſo
ſure are we that this world ſhall hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
than till all the ſtuff that is now in the
world be wrought up into bodies riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>But then we are not only ſure that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſhall riſe again, but we have the ſame
Word of God for it, That it ſhall do ſo in the
world <hi>in which</hi> now 'tis, though not in the
world as now 'tis, but chang'd in its kind of
worldhood, as that ſhall be in its kind of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyhood;
the new heavens and the new earth
being (as we think,) but old bodies new
dreſt. So that we are ſure too, that at the
ending of the world there muſt be ſtuff e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
left, unmade up into Maniſh bodies,
wherewith to frame a new heaven and new
earth, without making more of nothing;
and that this world ſhall hold no longer than
till then.</p>
               <p>Now though the heavens and the earth
have dealings with one another, yet they do
not make over to each other any thing that
is bulky or weighty, that we can find ſo:
whence we may make bold to ſay, over and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101488:112"/>
above, That all bodies that are to riſe again,
are made of the ſame mold or ground that
the firſt was; that is, taken out of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
world, not out of the heavenly bodies.
Whence the world is to laſt no longer than
till the <hi>earthly ſtuff</hi> for rifing bodies be ſpent,
with leaving enough for an earthly world
beſides.</p>
               <p>If then we do but know how the earths
globe, or that of it that lyes fleſhward, bears
it ſelf to the throng of mens bodies made
out of it, we may at length come at ſuch a
bound of time or term of years, beyond
which we may be ſure the world ſhall not
hold out. And if we were but well aware,
how much the innermoſt bodies enwomb'd
in the earth, had to do with the making of
ours, we might come a great deal nearer the
buſineſs, than otherwiſe we are like to do.
But, ſetting aſide the Excellent Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> and
<hi>Kircher,</hi> almoſt all men that have delved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the bowels of the earth to fetch us any
tales of under-ground bodies, have done it
rather to make themſelves more rich and
wealthy, than either themſelves or any body
elſe more wiſe or knowing. So that we are
much at a loſs as to the kind of thoſe things
that are hidden there, and whether accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws that God has ſet to himſelf,
in drawing one thing out of another, in thoſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101488:112"/>
Workhouſen which we find he has ſet up,
the fleſhly body of man may at length be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of them, or Whether there be any
little ſpungholes or crannies by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> one may
ſoak through to the other? Again, What we
do find at our utmoſt depths or bores, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarries
of ſtone, Mines of metal, or layers
and veins of barren earths and ſapleſs med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
we can't tell how far they may be tiew'd,
and dreſt, and mingled, ſo as at length to be
be made fit for the food of body, to make it
wax when well, as we ſee they may for the
health of the body, to make it well when
ſick. And yet again, The ſundry unevenneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in the depth of thoſe layers, that are made
of ſapful and growthſom earths, lead us into
another Wilderneſs and leave us there. For
like as ſometimes we find Gold (a thing that
changes us much, but feeds us little) as fleet
as the roots of ſhrubs in <hi>Peru</hi> or the <hi>Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
ſometimes among the ſhallow waters
that drill between the pebbles in the Falls of
<hi>Guiny</hi> or <hi>Africa:</hi> whilſt the Gold Mine at
<hi>Chremnitz</hi> is no leſs than 160 fathoms deep,
(as we have it from a good Hand upon the
place:) So in like manner, thoſe things that
feed and biggen us, lye in the earths globe
at full us uneven depths. For while ſalt, a
thing that helps as much to live, and get life
for others too, ſometimes floats on the top
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101488:113"/>
of the Sea, and is thickned in the open Beds,
at the ſalt-making Marſhes of the <hi>Iſle of Rhe</hi>
and <hi>Xantoign, Provence</hi> and <hi>Meſſina,</hi> or digg'd
in the <hi>Iſle of May,</hi> and fetcht up at the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in <hi>England</hi> from eaſie depths. We have
it for truth, That near <hi>Eperies</hi> is a Salt-Mine
180 fathoms deep, and a <hi>Sal gemma</hi>
Mine in <hi>Poland</hi> no leſs than 200. Though
for the moſt part it will hold good, that you
cannot dig many ſpades in mold or growth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
earth, before you come at a dead ſoyl.
Suppoſing then (to make ſhort of a thing
that may more eaſily be made long) That the
wet and dry ſurface of the earths roundle,
to the depth of mans height, one place with
another, may be made up into the bodies of
mankind, and with the well-skill'd <hi>F. Taquet,</hi>
That at Dooms-day a leſs cantling of it than
<hi>England,</hi> which we reckon above the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth
part of the Globe, will be enough to
hold all the dwellers of it and their children,
that ever have been, or in likelihood may be
hereafter till then, though the world ſhould
laſt 10000 years, Then are we ſure this
world ſhall never laſt beyond a thouſand
times ten thouſand years, how much ſoever
it may be gueſt to fall ſhort of it. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole that we think needful to ſpeak,
under an Head that has ſo much room to
ſpread upon, and ſo little of boundedneſs to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101488:113"/>
winde up in, we ſhall take forth to our

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A moreneſs of worlds, and a ſooner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this world, may alwayes be, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
are, grounded upon a like way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that is, the boundleſs and everlaſting
power and goodneſs of the Almighty Maker:
for ſo pleads the avoucher, God being all way
boundleſs in power and goodneſs, and every
where withal, wherever and whenever he is,
he may give ſhew of his power and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
there being nothing to hinder his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
worlds elſewhere than where this was
pitcht, or other-while than when this was
begun, but only time and room imaginary
which are nothing; and it being good in it
ſelf for a world to be, the more of them there
were, or the ſooner they began, ſo much the
better. Now if all this makes any thing for
a moreneſs or more earlineſs of worlds, by
the ſelf-ſame Argument we may hold, That
this world began ſooner than we are told it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101488:114"/>
did begin. Which is both impoſſible to be,
and wicked to think: For the Maker Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
being everlaſting as well as all-filling,
and ever as well as then, boundleſly powerful
and good; and it being good in it ſelf for
this world, as much as for any former or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world to be, Why might he not 10000
ages before the world was, give it its bidding
to ſtep forth, whilſt the ſooner it was the
better? But we muſt alſo note, That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
drawn from Gods unbounded power
and goodneſs, as looking towards the behoof
of the Creature will ever fall ſhort upon this
ſcore: For why, there is not a full reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of thoſe attributes of his that have to
do in the work; boundleſs wiſdom and good
liking being left out. For we are to know,
That then only infinite power and goodneſs
could make the world, when infinite wiſdom
and good-liking thought it meet, that ſuch a
being ſhould begin to be. Now that was when
we read in <hi>Moſes</hi> it did begin to be. Whence
I think it follows. That it could begin no
ſooner. For infinite wiſdom pitching upon
that time for its beginning, choſe out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beſt time that could be lighted on for its
beginning: Had it then begun ſooner, it had
been better for it not to have begun ſo ſoon.
But to miſtruſt boundleſs wiſdom, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
ſo, that it might have better been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101488:114"/>
is to unmake its boundleſneſs. And to
pitch upon two or more beſt times, for a
thing to begin in, is to pitch upon one of the
worſer kinds of awkwardneſs.</p>
               <p>Hence then we gather thus much, That as
boundleſs wiſdom took in with a moment,
wherein it was deem'd moſt meet, that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſhould begin, ſo are we to think again
it ſettled upon a certain number of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which it was beſt of all, ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
have beginning. For if there were no
more reaſon, why God ſhould make the
world, <hi>then</hi> when he did make it, than
why he ſhould make it ſooner or later than
he did, it had nere been made at all, any
more than it was made ſooner or later than
it was: and if there were no more reaſon
why he made ſo many beings in the world,
than why he ſhould make more or fewer, he
had never made ſo many at all, any more
than he made fewer or more than he did
make. Now the ſame <hi>moſt truſtful</hi> witneſs that
tells us when the world began, telling us alſo
that it was, in the beginning; that is, (if I
underſtand the firſt word in the Bible
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) in the beginning of thoſe things
that were ever made, or before all worlds,
or the firſt made bodies were the heaven and
the earth which now are: and when he tells
us what things were then made; tells us alſo
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101488:115"/>
that they were made up into a world that was
<hi>one.</hi> And the ſame argument that makes for
worlds more or ſooner, proves alſo with the
ſame ſtrength that <hi>our own</hi> world was more
or ſooner, or might have been. We have
the ſame reaſon to deny its force for <hi>more</hi> or
<hi>earlier</hi> worlds <hi>at all,</hi> that we have to deny it
for the forebeing or morebeing of this.</p>
               <p>Beſides, To gather that God has or may
have, <hi>more</hi> or <hi>earlyer</hi> worlds, becauſe he can
do the <hi>moſt</hi> that can be done, and the <hi>ſooneſt</hi>
that could be done, is no leſs than the very
ſcum of emptineſs. For God being as bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
in his goodneſs as he is his mightineſs,
at this rate, would be forc't to reach out
that love to all mankind at leaſt, that we
read he has bounded only to ſome choſen
ones: ſo not only the <hi>few names</hi> in <hi>Sardis</hi>
and the <hi>remnant</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the <hi>All</hi> of
thoſe Churches and mankind too, ſhould at
length arrive at everlaſting bliſs. But as we
find his goodneſs as boundleſs in the making
<hi>ſome</hi> happy for ever, as it would be in the
making all ſo; and that God has thought
meet that his infinite goodneſs ſhould have
<hi>enough</hi> to do, to ſave ſome, without ſaving
<hi>all</hi> or <hi>moſt:</hi> ſurely we are to think too, that
his boundleſs power has <hi>enough</hi> to do, and
begins <hi>ſoon enough</hi> to do, or did as much as
it <hi>needed</hi> to do, and began as ſoon as it <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:101488:115"/>
to begin, in making <hi>one</hi> world <hi>as</hi> he did,
and beginning it, <hi>when</hi> he did. If then
boundleſs good will and ruthfulneſs in ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſome from everlaſting burnings, has
ſpared as many as it <hi>needs</hi> to ſpare, for the
ſake of <hi>its</hi> boundleſneſs; in like manner
boundleſs mightineſs in making the world or
this whole Crowd of beings, as late as tis,
and as little as tis, has made it as ſoon and
as big, as a world or number of beings <hi>needs</hi>
to be made, for the ſake of <hi>its</hi> boundleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo as if more or ſooner worlds ſhould
be made, it would not better become, or
more fully ſpeak forth its boundleſſneſs.
And if ſo, then had God made, ſooner or
bigger or more worlds, he had done that
which was altogether <hi>needleſs</hi> to be done,
and what not ſo well done, as that which
he has already done; becauſe what is done
is the beſt that can be done: And that would
be an unbeſeemingneſs, which would as
much <hi>take from</hi> the boundleſsneſs of his
<hi>wiſdom,</hi> as it would <hi>put to</hi> the boundleſsneſs
of his <hi>power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, This ill weighed reaſoning would
put God upon the doing of things, with a
meaner forecaſt than we do things our
ſelves. For ſhould God have made worlds,
before or beſides this, that ſo his works
might hold ſome fuller proportion or meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101488:116"/>
with his everlaſting and Almighty
power; it would be a making of God to do
things, for ſuch ends as he ſhould never be
able to reach, nor in the leaſt draw nearer
to. For ſhould God have made any worlds
ſome thouſands of years before this, there
would have been the ſame everlaſting
power, before all ſuch worlds, as is before
this, and no leſs: as there is now the ſame
everlaſting power before our world, that
would be before ſuch worlds, and no more.
And ſhould God make other worlds toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with, or wide off this world, there
would be the ſame Almighty power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them, and taken up in the making of
them, that is beyond, and in the making of
this, and no more, as there is in this, and no
leſs. Upon the ſame account that God may
make or might have made, one world
more than this, he may make or might have
made 10000, and upon the ſame ſcore he
may or might 10000, he may or might
100000, and when he has made all of them,
be yet no nearer doing any thing like his
boundleſs ſelf than he was in the making
this one; for his whole boundleſs power was
ſet a work or taken up, in the making of
this, and no more than the whole could be,
in the making of never ſo many more
worlds, or never ſo many more early worlds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:101488:116"/>
God did not make the world or worldly
beings, that the bigneſs or manifoldneſs of
them ſhould ſet forth to us his alfillingneſs,
or that the earlineſs of them ſhould give
us the likeneſs of his everlaſtingneſs, but
that the unutterable curiouſneſs of its
frame and workmanſhip, the unthinkable
care and forecaſt in all its evenneſſes and
entwinings, ſhould beget in us as well an
awfulneſs of, as wonder for, a greatneſs
and wiſdom ſo unbounded. As alſo that the
thoughts of thoſe manifold layers of hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
drifts, and everlaſting well wiſhes for
the happineſs of worthleſs ſinful man, ſhould
enkindle in us the flames of holy love and
hearty worſhippings, of a boundleſs good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo boundleſly endearing. All which
are to be done well enough, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the time before, the room beyond, or
the while taken up, in the doing of the
things we ſo much wonder at, and bow
down while we think upon. Elſe ſhould we
have lower thoughts of Almighty Power
and Wiſdom making the world in ſix days,
than if the ſame had been done in one, or
leſs than one. <hi>Iſaac Habrechtus</hi> that cunning
Handywright who made the Clock at <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
is as much talkt of, and wondred at,
far and wide, for the bare framing of it at
ſuch a bigneſs, ſometime in his life, once, in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101488:117"/>
ſo long while as he thought fit, as if he had
made it bigger or earlier, and had made more
beſides it, and in a ſhorter time: for, for its
<hi>workmanſhip alone,</hi> tis matchleſs, <hi>as to mans
skill,</hi> and it would have been no more than
ſo, by reaſon of <hi>the reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God Almighty by making this one world
in ſix days, beginning it when he did, and
bounding it where he did, has made it a
<hi>Noneſuch altogether;</hi> and had he by making it
more, or quicker, or ſooner, or bigger, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd
the mindes of ſuch as would have it ſo,
it had been no more ſtill than a <hi>Noneſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together.</hi>
He that cannot enough praiſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
wiſdom, and love everlaſting good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
for the making one world of nothing
when he did, would never find in his heart
to do it, for his making more, or quicker, or
ſooner or bigger: Boundleſs wiſdom, love
and power brought about the firſt, and no
more than boundleſs could the latter.</p>
               <p>The worthy Doctor <hi>More</hi> has ſuprizingly
effay'd the infinity or boundleſs manifold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of worlds from the Head of lightſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
For ſo he pleads, Either there muſt be
infinite Suns and Worlds or elſe, (which is
frightful to think), there muſt be infinite
darkneſs, for nothing bounded could ever
enlighten it?</p>
               <p>To which we ſay firſt, that having taken
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101488:117"/>
away altogether that boundleſs waſtfulneſs
beyond the world, we are no whit careful,
about the light or darkneſs of it; that which
is <hi>nothing at all,</hi> being neither <hi>light</hi> nor
<hi>dark at all:</hi> let them ſay, which of the two
it had beſt to be, who hold it. And again we
cannot but mark here, how hard a thing 'tis
for us, to lay aſide the things which befal
bodies, while we are ſpeaking of things,
which are not ſo. For the outworldiſh emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs
before the income of lightſome worlds
is owned to be no body, and yet it ſeems,
muſt needs be dark, if unenlightned, body-like:
according to which that Learned
Gentleman might as well have proved the
ſoul it ſelf to have been dark, no Sun ſhining
into it, as that emptineſs, a thing as much
<hi>not body</hi> (a <hi>ſort</hi> of which alone are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with ſunbeams), would have been ſo:
not to ſay that even God himſelf before the
making of the Sun, muſt thus have been in
ſtate of darkneſs too; for God, who, whilſt
no body, is yet <hi>ſomthing,</hi> ſtands fairer for
being an <hi>enlightned ſomthing,</hi> than that
does, which, whilſt no body, is alſo <hi>nothing at
all,</hi> and muſt therefore firſt become <hi>ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
before it can get up to be an <hi>enlightned
ſomthing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, to ſay nothing how light may
otherwiſe ariſe than from ſuns, (as may be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101488:118"/>
ſeen by Mr. <hi>Clayton</hi>'s Diamond, the <hi>Bononian</hi>
Stone, ſtale Sprats, the ſouce drink of Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krel,
the off-ſcourings of an Oyſter-ſhell,
&amp;c,) 'tis clear that darkneſs or Sun-light,
are ſuch narrow betiders of body, that they
are too ſcant to cover all that are bound up
under that name, unleſs any will be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
as to ſay, that a Mill-ſtone is inwardly
dark; which he that does, muſt ſee further
into than I can, or any man elſe that I know;
or that a ſhining piece of rotten wood, has
leſs of its lightſomneſs in the dark than in the
day.</p>
               <p>As for the lights that have been ſeen in
Mr. <hi>Boyles</hi> Air pump, When it once be made
clear, as the lights we are ſpeaking of, that
all body is indeed and indeed ſuckt out of it,
that light cannot beam in that thinneſs where
a breather can't live nor a bladder be blown,
that the hollow ſide of the glaſs throws in
no rayes or ſteams, nor the outſide of the
ſhining body any at all or any but thoſe of
light, or that none of thoſe rayes of other
atoms that are ſhacking all over the worlds
waſts come riding or drilling through both;
it will behove us to bethink our ſelves of
ſome kind of Anſwer for it: But until that
be done, we ſhall think that the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
at all, or at leaſt by man, be crowded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a leſs room than God at firſt allow'd it,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101488:118"/>
(and that it muſt be, if the empty Receiver
has nothing of the world in it); and that all
the light that we ſee is body in body, (the
world, as we think, being all over glutted
with body). So that he who at the ſelvedge
of the world does but ſee light as far as he
can ſee any thing, he needs not take thought
for that darkneſs beyond which neither his
eyes ſee, nor underſtanding kens. Which
might be enough wherewith to cloſe the laſt
thing we laid down, that is, the moreneſs or
more earlineſs of worlds.</p>
               <p>Unleſs that we may put to the reſt one
Objection more for the plurality of worlds,
or infinity of this, from ſuch ſayings in the
Engliſh tongue, as ſeem to ſpeak it a truth
with us, time out of mind: Some whereof
having room either in the daily offices of the
Liturgy, or in the Creed it ſelf, the over-looking
of them without any remark, may
ſeem ſo like a ſlight that Book, or thoſe
things which holy and wiſe men have had
both good thoughts of, and much love for,
that I hope we may be forgiven, while we go
on to ſhew, that their right meanings do as
much befriend theſe our thinkings, as their
miſtaken ones may ſeem to lye croſs to them.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that which comes, as other-where,
ſo ofteneſt in the <hi>Gloria patri,—World
without end;</hi> which may ſeem to ſpeak the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101488:119"/>
world everlaſting or boundleſs. The other
is moſt remarkably in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed—<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all worlds;</hi> which ſeems too to be well
enough bottom'd upon Holy Writ it ſelf; For
ſo we read, <hi>Heb. 1. 2, By whom alſo he made
the worlds.</hi> And 11. 3, <hi>Through faith we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the worlds were framed.</hi> Whence one
would think, that we do believe in good
earneſt, that there were worlds before this,
or are beſides it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we had but that inſight into the
happy ſpeech of our fore-fathers that were
to be wiſht for, the words could never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us the leaſt of a ſtumbling-block. But
ſo few men having thought good to meddle
with it of late, and ſcarce any but Mr. <hi>Somner</hi>
at this day, we ſhall take upon us, as ſhortly
as we can, to give the meaning of thoſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſo as no man who has not ſo much as
lookt back to old <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhould at any time
be miſled by them.</p>
               <p>We are then to underſtand, That the word
<hi>[World]</hi> though we now take it for that
bulk of bodily beings we ſee, yet of old it
was as well, and oftner too, taken for ages
and laſtingneſs time out of mind. And the
word with our <hi>Saxon</hi> Fore-fathers, for what
we now call the <hi>World,</hi> was moſtly <hi>
                     <hi>Middan
eard,</hi> Middle earth.</hi> The old word <hi>
                     <hi>World</hi>
                  </hi>
anſwering to the <hi>Seculum</hi> of the Latines, as
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101488:119"/>
the fore-named did to their <hi>Mundus.</hi> Which
they have ſtuck ſo cloſely to in their Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Latine, that not only <hi>Aelfrick</hi> in his
<hi>Gloſſary,</hi> (ſet forth by the Learned and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Mr. <hi>Somner,)</hi> turns <hi>ſeculum, World,</hi> (as he
does <hi>aevum <hi>yld</hi>
                  </hi> &amp; <hi>
                     <hi>ece</hi>).</hi> But the word <hi>ſeculum</hi>
being to be met with 70 times and upwards
in the Pſalms, according to the vulgar Lat.
the <hi>Saxon</hi> tranſlations, (printed by the Great
<hi>Spelman,)</hi> have alwayes turn'd it <hi>world;</hi> and
as often as it happens in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Goſpels
'tis the ſame too. And whereas <hi>Mundus</hi> comes
in in the Goſpels about 20 times, 'tis alſo read
<hi>
                     <hi>Middan eard:</hi>
                  </hi> As alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Aelfrick</hi>'s
<hi>Gloſſary.</hi> And though <hi>Orbis terrarum</hi> be the
ſame in ſence with both, that is Engliſhed by
neither word, but evermore, (if I miſtake
not,) in the Pſalms and Goſpels by <hi>
                     <hi>ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bhwyrft
eorthena,</hi>
                  </hi> or all the round-about
of earthly beings. And laſtly, Though <hi>in
aeternum, in perpetuum,</hi> and <hi>in ſempiternum,</hi>
mean the ſame with <hi>in ſeculum,</hi> yet are they
ever turn'd <hi>
                     <hi>on ecnyſſe,</hi>
                  </hi> unto endleſneſs.</p>
               <p>But how little they thought them to differ
in ſence, will be ſhown by an Inſtance or two
among many. <hi>Pſal. 135,</hi> His mercy endureth
<hi>for ever;</hi> It being <hi>in aeternum,</hi> 'tis made <hi>
                     <hi>on
ecnyſſe:</hi>
                  </hi> But the very ſame thing, <hi>Pſal. 117,</hi>
being ſpoken by <hi>in ſeculum,</hi> 'tis Engliſht <hi>
                     <hi>on
worulde,</hi>
                  </hi> to or for world. <hi>Pſal. 9. 5, in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:101488:120"/>
and <hi>in ſeculum ſeculi</hi> being together,
'tis <hi>
                     <hi>on ecnyſſe and on worulde a worulde,</hi>
                  </hi>
for ever and ever. And <hi>Pſal. 27.</hi> the laſt—
life them up for ever, being <hi>in aeternum,</hi> the
Trin. Coll. MSS. reads <hi>
                     <hi>oth on worulde and
on ecnyſſe,</hi>
                  </hi> for ever and ever as we ſay.
Whence 'tis clear, that with our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>World</hi> and <hi>Evermore</hi> were often the
ſame.</p>
               <p>And they were ſo ready to make <hi>World</hi>
ſpeak <hi>ſeculum,</hi> that where we give a much
unlike meaning, they ſtill hold to it. So <hi>Pſal.

<hi>judicium ſeculare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, We are to know that <hi>World,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be in the ſingular number or plural,
may betoken plurally or indefinitely, and as
much adverbially as nominally. So where
we read, <hi>Pſal. 54. 21,</hi> Abideth of old, <hi>ante ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:101488:120"/>
plurally, 'tis <hi>
                     <hi>atforan worulde,</hi>
                  </hi> ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.
And in St. <hi>Luke, in ſecula</hi> is <hi>
                     <hi>on worulde,</hi>
                  </hi>
as <hi>in ſeculum</hi> is ſometimes <hi>
                     <hi>on a worulda,</hi> Pſal.
132. 4.</hi> and ſometimes one ſometimes
the other, <hi>Pſal. 117.</hi> So that <hi>world</hi> needs not
be one age only, but ages time out of mind,
and hereafterward.</p>
               <p>Again, If we compare a few Doxologies
of the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, with the ſayings we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſpake of, it will yet further be ſeen.</p>
               <p>Thus in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Sermon in Mr. <hi>Liſle</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> we read <hi>
                     <hi>on ealra worulda
woruld,</hi>
                  </hi> unto all ages of ages. And in the
pieces of <hi>Saxon</hi> Homilies by Mr. <hi>Wheelock,
<hi>on ealra woruld,</hi>
                  </hi> unto all ages; <hi>
                     <hi>yeond ealra
worulda woruld,</hi>
                  </hi> beyond all ages of ages,
or times of times; <hi>

                  </hi> aye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <hi>on ealra worulde woruld a butan

                  </hi> unto all ages of ages, aye without end;
<hi>
                     <hi>a a on ecnyſſe,</hi>
                  </hi> for aye, to eternity; <hi>
                     <hi>a to
woruld,</hi>
                  </hi> aye for ever, or for ever and for aye.
And <hi>K. Canute</hi> ſhuts up his Church-Laws
with <hi>
                     <hi>ſymble efre to woruld</hi>
                  </hi> Amen, alwayes,

               <p>And ſince we were over-run by the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
this way of ſpeaking has been kept up.

               </p>
               <p>From all which 'tis as clear, that we meant
in the dayes of yore by the word <hi>World,
time, ages,</hi> all the while that has been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
or is to be hereafter boundleſly, as
that we mean by it now adayes, that frame
of bodies in which we live and ſpeak it.</p>
               <p>And indeed 'tis eaſie enough to be aware,
that we ſtill take <hi>World</hi> for that which is
vaſt in bulk, boundleſs in tale or laſtingneſs,
or any wayes elſe that we can think of. In
