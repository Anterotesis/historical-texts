            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And in our dayes, honorable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who refreshes the barren soules of ignorant people in this land with examples of humilitie, modestie, godlinesse and all other Christian vertues, many generations after vs shall call them blessed. The Lord in mercie aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the number of honorable persons who rejoyce to goe vnto the house of the Lord. These are the toppes of the mountaines, which beeing once free and not couered with ouerflowing waters it is a comfortable presage that the great flood that drowned the world shall be abated. These <note place="margin">Genes. 85</note> are the Minerals of gold and siluer, which are not easily found out, but after they are discouered, they replenish the land with infinit treasures of riches. The Prophet <hi>ZACHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE</hi> when he saw in that celestiall vision <hi>IEHOSHVA</hi> his <note place="margin">Zach. 3.</note> body honoured with change of apparell, wished also the Diademe to be set vpon his heade: but if he had seene the Diademe set vpon his head, and the body lapped vp with ragges of vile apparel, hee had wished the body also to be honoured with ornaments proportionallie agreeing to the heade. It hath pleased the wisedome of our God in this part of the countrie, whereinto I dwell, first to decke with glorious ornaments the head: the Lord in mercie cloth the body also with change of rayment, to the end that Satan that vigilant enemie who delighteth in the filthie ragges of our beggerly apparel may be grieued for our change from worse to better. I speake the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witnesse, that it is lawfull to

me, toreuerence the image of Christ, where euer I see it clearely shining, either in rich or in poore. And so much the more, because it was my lot to conferre with many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of a contrarie religion, whom I found to be like repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat siluer, fra who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the drosse could not be separated. What is next? If they will harden their heartes against the truth of God, then let the dead burie their dead, but let the noble house of <hi>Mar</hi> follow Christ. Receiue from my hands Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam this short co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pend of the ten first &amp; great persecutions, with certaine treatises added to the compend of the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and be not afraid to follow the religion, and faith of the Apostles and Euangelists: because their eares heard the words of the great shepheard of our soules, their eyes saw God manifested in the flesh, they were chosen to be faithful witnesses to the world of the doings, sufferings and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ: the holy Ghost was sent to teach them in all trueth. Here we may rest vpon a sure foundation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the which the gates of hell cannot preuaile. Next to the Apostles, their true successours are to be had in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent regard, who sealed vp that faith, which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the Apostles with riuers of blood for the space of three hundreth yeeres. To this antiquitie of Apostolicke doctrine, let vs firmely adhere. This is the clearest mirrour whereinto the precepts of wholesome doctrine are contained. After the holy Apostles had finished their course, the disciples of the Apostles were worthie men, yet not like vnto the Apostles who had bene both called &amp; taught im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly by Christ. If any dou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g was in their sacrifices, it was couered by the glory of their sufferings: the fire wherwith they were burnt, the water wherinto they were drouned, the aire wherinto their bodies were hanged vp, the mountaines &amp; wildernes through which they wandered, the darke pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whereinto they were enclosed as people vnworthie of libertie, whom notwithstanding the Son of God had made

In the treatises that I haue subjoyned after euery Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I had regard to discouer the fountaines of errours, that began to spring vp in the first three hundreth yeeres after our Lordes ascension to heauen. Howe ancient so cuer the small beginnings of errours doe seeme, yet are they posterior vnto that wholesome summe of true doctrine deliuered to the worlde by Christe and his Apostles.

VALERIVS GRATVS for loue of gaine remooued the Priests of the Iewes from their offices at his owne pleasure. ANANVS, ISMAEL, ELEAZARVS, SIMON the sonne of CAMITHVS, all these were denuded of their priestly dignitie, when as two of them, viz. ELEAZARVS and SIMON had continued scarse one yeere in office. In end IOSEPHVS CAIAPHAS is aduanced to the priesthood. This is the cause wherefore the Euangelist Iohn calleth CAIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHAS the high Priest of that same yeere, Iohn 18. ver. 13. Matters of religion were now come to an horrible abuse, and were not ordered according to Gods holy ordinance, but according to the appetite of the Romaine Deputies Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph. antiq. lib. 18. cap. 3.

He disauthorized CAIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHAS, following (as appeareth) the example of VALERIVS GRATVS, and gaue his office to IONATHAN the sonne of ANANVS sometime high Priest, Ioseph. antiq. lib. 18. cap, 6.

                        <p>CAIVS CALIGVLA successour to TIBERIVS reigned three yeeres and nine months, Euseb. lib 2. cap. 8. He was a proud tyrant, enemie to all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the verie childe of the deuill. I insist only v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Church matters. Hee was an hatefull enemie to the Iewes dwelling at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For one and <note place="margin">Caius would be counted a god.</note> the selfe-same cause were they both despised and hated of CAIVS, because they would not giue vnto him diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours by building Temples, and altars, and offering sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to new IVPITER CAIVS, and swearing by his name. First concerning <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he had sent PETRONIVS to be Deputie in <hi>Judea,</hi> with commandement to dedicat the Temple of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> to IVPITER CAIVS, and to set vp his image in the Temple, Euseb eccles. hist. lib. 2. cap. 6. Ioseph. antiq. lib. 18. cap. 11. The Iewes were more willing to die, then to see the Temple of their God polluted. PETRONIVS aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Emperour of the grevance of the Iewes, but before <note place="margin">The Iewes abhorred the vpsetting of the image of Caius in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> his letters came into the hands of CAIVS somewhat inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueened that both disappointed the purpose of CAIVS, and also incensed his heart with furie and rage against his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie PETRONIVS. At that time HEROD AGRIPPA was at <hi>Rome</hi> whome afterward the Angell of God smote at <hi>Casarea,</hi> so that he was consumed with wormes, Acts 12. he was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly beloued of CAIVS, because in the daies of TIBERIVS he had bene cast in prison, and bound with bands for the loue he caried to CAIVS, in so farre that CAIVS inuited A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRIPPA vpon a certaine time to a banquet, and bade him <note place="margin">The petition of Agrippa.</note> aske what he pleased, and it should be granted. AGRIPPAES petition was this, that CAIVS would suffer the nation of the Iewes to liue according to their own law. CAIVS was moued somewhat with this vnexspected petition; yet part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his excessiue loue toward AGRIPPA: also, lest he should seeme to them which sate at table to be a promise-breaker the petition is granted. But the venome of his indignation against the Iewes he poured out against PETRONIVS, because
<pb facs="tcp:18670:10"/>
that by lingring in executing his commandement occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was offered to AGRIPPA to present this foresaide peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The letter of CAIVS sent to his Deputie was cruel and bloodie, the like whereof was seldome heard: because hee <note place="margin">The bloodie letter of Caius written to Petronius his Deputie.</note> fulfilled not the Emperours desire, hee is commaunded to giue out a sentence of death against his owne life, and to be both judge &amp; burrio to himselfe, Ioseph. antiq. lib. 18 cap. 11 Such mercie was in this new IVPITER CAIVS. Before I writ anything of his crueltie against the Iewes that dwelt in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> it is a meete place to admonish the reader of the hypocrisie &amp; counterfaitholines of HEROD AGRIPPA who seemed both in the dayes of CAIVS, and also in the dayes of the Emperour CLAVDIVS to be a paterne of godlinesse, preferring at the banquet of CAIVS the libertie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God &amp; the inviolable obseruation of the law of God to all the riches that the liberalitie of an affectioned Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour could be able to afford. In CLAVDIVS dayes he sailed from <hi>Italie</hi> to <hi>Judea,</hi> he acknowledged God to be the author <note place="margin">The hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa.</note> of his deliuerance from prison &amp; bands, &amp; offered a chaine of gold to be hung vp in the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ple of <hi>Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,</hi> in testimonie that he receiued that benefit with a thankfull minde out of Lords hands, Ioseph, antiq. lib 19. cap. <hi>5.</hi> In outward things he was a builder of the wals of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> vntill the emulous enuy of MARSVS, or enuyous emulation the hinderer of all good workes, compelled him to desist &amp; to leaue the worke imperfited, Ioseph. antiq. lib. <hi>19.</hi> cap <hi>7.</hi> For all this outward shew of holines, the lessons of CAIVS whom he loued beyond all things, neuer left him till his last breath CAIVS desired to be counted a god so did AGRIPPA in <hi>Caesarea</hi> delite when his oration was called the voyce of God &amp; not of man. Acts 12. CAIVS persecuted the Iewes without a cause, so did HEROD AGRIPPA the Christians, Acts 12. CAIVS the higher hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced himselfe, the greater was his fall, the like also hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to AGRIPPA.

<pb facs="tcp:18670:11"/>
a very prudent and learned man. APPiON with flattering words insinuated himselfe in the fauour of the Emperour CAIVS, and accused the Iewes, that they neither builded temples, nor offered sacrifices to the honour of CAIVS, as the <hi>Grecians</hi> did. PHILO was readie to answere, but CAIVS ruled with affection rather then with reason caused PHILO to be thrust out of his palace, and would not hearken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Ioseph. antiq. lib. 18. cap. 10. Euseb. lib. 2. ecles. hist. cap 5. In these two mirrours we may see the cruell dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of this Emperour, whose dependers were persecuters of Christians, like as hee himselfe was a persecuter of the Iewes. If any good turne fell into his hand, it was rather by accident then of purpose to glorifie God, or to punish sinne: hee banished HEROD ANTIPAS, who beheaded IOHN the Baptist, and his wife HERODIAS that incestuous harlot, who ended their lifes in penuritie and miserie in <hi>Lyons</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Euseb. eccles. hist. lib. 2. cap 4. But all this was done for fauour of AGRIPPA, Ioseph. antiq: lib. 18. cap 9. but not for detestation of murther and incest. In ende CAIVS was slaine by his owne seruants, CHEREAS and LVPVS, whom the Emperour CLAVDIVS afterward punished vnto the death, Ioseph. antiq. lib. 19, cap. 3. This new IVPITER I count him to haue bene in worse case then old IVPITER the sonne of SATVRN, albeit both of them died, yet the one after his <note place="margin">New Iupiter in worse case then old Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter.</note> death, was counted a god, but the other after his death was counted a deuill.</p>

This conquest that Christ made by the ministerie of 12. poore and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men is more worthy to be called a conquest, then all the valiant exploites of CYRVS, ALEXANDER, CAESAR, and other conquerours. For he made this conquest by a small handfull of poore and infirme disciples: also he conquessed not only the bodies of men, but also their hearts to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, &amp; finally hee made this conquest not by shedding of peoples blood, but by preaching of his owne death and blood shed for the redemption of many. Neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quessed hee free men to make them slaues, as other conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had done but they who were slaues indeede to Satan, vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he gaue the libertie of the sons of God. Now these 12. Apostles the more faithfully they laboured in the worke of their ministery, the worse were they intreated by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull world, according as Christ had forctold, Iohn 16. The most part of them were put to death, the rest were not free of many painfull sufferings &amp; rebukes which they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglysustained for the Name of Christ. PETER &amp; PAVL are supponed to haue beene martyred at <hi>Rome,</hi> ANDRO to haue beene crucified in <hi>Achaia,</hi> MATTHEW beheaded in <hi>Ethiopta,</hi> IAMES the brother of IOHN was beheaded by HEROD in <hi>Iudea,</hi> Acts 12.

But he who obtaineth a faithfull Pastors chaire, and teacheth a doctrine contrarie to that which a faithfull Pastor hath taught, is to be counted a grieuous Wolfe step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp into his roome, Acts 20. And NAZIANZENVS cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth such a man an aduersarie standing vp into the place of a faithfull Pastor, darkenesse succeeding to light, a tempest succeeding to calme weather, &amp; madnesse obteining place where right reason was wont to bee, Nazian. <hi>in orat. in laudem Athanasu.</hi> And therefore those Bishops and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours following, who keepe inviolably that forme of wholesome doctrine which they receiued from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, these, I say, alanerly are to be counted true successours of the Apostles.

After him succeded ANACLETVS, and gouerned <hi>9.</hi> yeeres 3 months, 10. dayes, and after him CLEMENS, ruled 11. yeeres, EVSEBIVS also thinketh this is that CLEMENS of whom the Apostle PAVL writeth to the Philip. cap. 4, ver. 3. <hi>Yea</hi> I <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee faithfull yoke-fellow helpe those women which laboured with me in the Gospell, with Clement also and with other my fellow-labourers, whose names are in the booke of life.</hi> IGNATIVS Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <note place="margin">Ignatius.</note> of <hi>Antioch</hi> had his heart so inflammed with the loue of Christ, that when his dissolution was neere approaching, he saide to the <hi>Romaines:</hi> nowe doe I begin to be the disciple of Christ, I couet for no thing that can be seene with bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eyes, to the ende that I may enjoy Iesus Christ: let the fire, the crosse, the beasts, the breaking of bones, convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of members, and bruising of the whole body, and the torments of the deuill sease vpon me, prouiding I may bee partaker of Iesus Christ. He was deuoured with beasts in the dayes of TRAIANVS, and so patiently indured death for the Name of Iesus, that he allured the deuouring beasts to approach neere vnto his body, that it beeing ground with the teeth of beastes, he might be found as fine flowre in the house of his father, Euseb. eccles. hist. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>36.</hi> About the same time also flourished PAPIAS Bishop of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi>

                     <p>BEcause it is the accustomed dealing of Satan to <note place="margin">Heretiques.</note> peruert men from the simplicitie of Gods trueth, also it standeth well with the justice of God to giue ouer men to strong delusions who
<pb facs="tcp:18670:19"/>
will not beleeue the trueth of God. Therefore in the third head wee are to speake of the Heretiques that sprang vp in this age. Heresie I count to be an opinion repugnant to the grounds of our Christian faith, obstinately maintained by those that professe the Name of Christ. As touching them who leade an euill life, yea and in effect denie the Son of God by a prophane conuersation, but maintaine not an opinion that it is lawfull so to doe, they may be counted A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists and not Heretiques. Iewes and Turkes also who denie the diuinitie of Christ, because they doe not professe the Name of Christ, wee call them infidels but not Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. And the <hi>Corinthians</hi> who erred in some foundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points of the Christian faith, yet seeing they maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not their errour with obstinate mindes, but yeelded to the wholesome doctrine of PAVL, no man doth count the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Heretiques, but infirme and weake Christians. And the Apostle himselfe writing to them calleth them Gods building, and Gods husbandrie, 1. Cor. 3. ver. 9. But when these three things concurre together, that men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the Name of Christ, and yet they maintaine opinions repugnant to the very grounds of true faith, and will not receiue instruction, but obstinatly perseuere in their errour, they are to be counted Heretiques. Of this number was SIMON MAGVS the father of Heretiques, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded <note place="margin">Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</note> in <hi>Samaria</hi> by the great power of God which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the ministerie of PHILIP and of PETER, Acts 8. he fled from the East to the West, and came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he preuailed so far in short time that he was counted a god, and an image was set vp for him with this superscription, <hi>Simoni deo sancto,</hi> that is, to SIMON an holy god. Thus the <hi>Romaines</hi> who in the dayes of TIBERIVS refused to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the diuinitie of Christ, in the dayes of CLAVDIVS they honoured a sorcerer, and a seducing Heretique with diuine honours. He taught them who followed him to fal downe before pictures and images, and in speciall to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship his owne image, and the image of HELENA a certaine woman, who accompanied him in his journey from <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> Euseb. eccl. hist. lib. 2. cap. 13 &amp; 14.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:18670:20"/>
After SIMON sprang vp another suppost of Satan called MENANDER like to his master SIMON in many things, for he was both a <hi>Samaritane,</hi> and a sorcerer, but in absurditie of monstrous opinions hee was far beyond SIMON: for hee <note place="margin">Menander.</note> said that the world was created by Angels, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was sent from aboue to saue the worlde, and by vertue of his Baptisme men should bee made immortall, euen in this world, in such sort, that they should neither waxe olde, nor taste of death, Euseb, eccles. hist. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>26.</hi> This he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie EPIPHANIVS compareth to <hi>Aspido-gorgon</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> a great serpent inclosed into a vessel of lame with many other serpents, after he hath deuoured all the rest of the serpents, he beginneth to gnaw his owne taile for hunger, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye himselfe, Epiph. <hi>contrahareses:</hi> so did this heresie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe it selfe by promising great things, which MENANDER could not performe, neither in himselfe nor in others.</p>
                     <p>In this age also sprang vp EBION who denied the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie <note place="margin">Ebion.</note> of Christ, and saide hee was onely a man begotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene IOSEPH and MARIE, and that the obseruation of MOSES Law was necessarie to eternall life: his followers were called <hi>Ebionites</hi> either by the name of their master E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BION, or else, as EVSEBIVS thinketh, for their poore &amp; beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly opinion they had of Christ, supponing him onely to be a man: for EBION in the Hebrewe language signifieth one that is poore, Euseb. eccles. hist lib. <hi>3</hi> cap. 27. These <hi>Ebionites</hi> damne all the epistles of PAVL, and count him an Apostat from the law, and they admit no part of the Newe Testament for canonicke Scripture, except the Gospell of MATTHEW.</p>
                     <p>CERINTHVS about the same time was the author of <note place="margin">Cerinthus.</note> strange reuelations which he said he had receiued from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that after the resurrection from the dead Christ should haue an earthly kingdome in this world, and that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectes of Christes Kingdome should eate, and drinke, and marie, and keepe holy dayes, and offer sacrifices, for hee himselfe was a man giuen to fleshly lustes, and he imagined that the pleasures of Christs Kingdome shuld consistin fulfilling the concupiscence of the flesh, Euseb. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.

                     <p>Likewise in this age sprang vp the errour of the <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> vpon this occasion, as CLEMENS ALEXANDRINVS doth write, Strom. 3.

To purge himselfe of all suspition of that fault, hee brought his wife into the mids of his brethren, and said he was content that any man should marrie her. Of which wordes many tooke occasion to liue promiscuously like beastes, no man hauing his owne proper wife, but making them common. Howbeit NICOLAVS is said to haue liued himselfe in matrimoniall chastitie, contenting himselfe with his own wife alanerly, Euseb. eccles. hist. lib. 3. cap. 29. Noght the lesse his foolish and vnaduised speaches were the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a most wicked &amp; damnable errour of the <hi>Nicolaitanes,</hi> whereof the Lord speaketh in the Reuelation of IOHN that he hated it, Apoc. 2. This is that heresie which GREGORIE the seuenth imputed to all married priestes: but with what equitie marriage ordeined by God, and honorable among all men can be called an heresie hated of the Lord, let the Christian reader judge.</p>

                        <p>TO the historie I haue adjoyned certaine Treatises containing contrauerted questions in our time, for <note place="margin">A Treatise of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> decision whereof it is necessarie to haue recourse to the writings of the Apostles, &amp; the custome of the Primitiue Church, adhering to the Apostolicke doctrine firmely euen vnto the death.

Antiquitie of errour, is an adding, pairing, altering, or <note place="margin">Antiquitie of errour.</note> contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to the ancient way pointed out into this word of God, and of this Christ speaketh in the Gospell of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew. <hi>Ye haue heard it said of old, Thou shalt not slay, &amp;c. but I say vnto you, he who is angrie with his brother without a cause is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of iudgement.</hi> Mat. 5. ver. 21. and 22.

be sought as PSAMMETICHVS King of <hi>Egypt</hi> sought it from new wained babes keeping them in in secret custodie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing any articulate voyce, or intelligible speech, whereby he might discerne what people and language was most ancient, HERODOT.

are commanded to rise and to honour their countenance, but greater reuerence is to be caried toward the hoare-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded veritie: for the commandement giuen concerning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men sustaineth some exceptions. The soueraigne King of a nation and his honourable counsellers for the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of their places will not arise to honour ancient men, but ancient men rather arise to honour them, as IACOB arose &amp; sat in the bed, because his infirmitie could not permit him to rise and stand on his feete to doe honour vnto IOSEPH, Gen. 48. ver. 2, But as concerning the ancient veritie of God it should be honoured of al men without exception. EGLON King of <hi>Moab</hi> arose out of his chaire when EHVD said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that he had a message vnto him from God, Iudg. 3. ver. 20. and BALAAM vttering his propheticall reuelation saith, <hi>Rise Balak and heare, and take heede vnto me thou sonne of Zippor.</hi> Numb. 23. ver. 22.</p>
                        <p>With reuerence should be joyned an ardent loue, and <note place="margin">The more the veritie is despised in the world, the more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently it should be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> constant following of the ancient trueth vnto the end, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the worthy example of godly IOSIAS, who despised not the holy booke of the Couenant of God, because it had beene long misregarded, despised, vnreade, and far lesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto the people in the dayes of his father AMON, and of his goodsire MANASSE: for the booke of the Lordes Couenant all this while lay in an obscure corner of the Temple, neglected and couered with dust, yet when it was drawen out of the dust, and presented vnto the King, hee receiued it reuerently, hee loued it ardently and followed this holy Couenant euen vnto the daye of his death: so ought wee to loue the ancient veritie of God at all times, but specially when it is despised and misregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by men, as IOSIAS did, 2.

The loue of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural mother when she pleaded before SALOMON for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing child, was not abated, but rather inflammed, &amp; increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the apparent danger of her child, 1.

<pb facs="tcp:18670:22"/>
from heauen witnessed the falsh oode of the worship of BA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AL, and the couenant made betweene HELIAS and the priestes of BAAL with aduise of the King and whole body of the people, whereinto the priestes of BAAL with shame, skaith, and vnspeakable disgrace succumbed, 1. King. 18. Yet all this I say quenched not the fond loue that IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABEL caried to that idolatrous worship as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, 1. King. 19. where shee bindeth her selfe with an oath to pursue HELIAS to the death. Should we not then be ashamed to carie lesse loue to the veritie of God, which bringeth rest vnto our soules, then this woman did to a false worship, which led her soule headlong to perdition?</p>
                        <p>As touching Antiquitie of errour it is to be marked that whatsoeuer honour antiquitie addeth vnto the veritie, the <note place="margin">Antiquitie is no honoar to errour.</note> like dishonour, rebuke and shame it heapeth vpon the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. For Satan himselfe, who is the author of all errours when he is called metaphorically a serpent, hee is thereby rebuked, but when hee is called an olde serpent, Apocal. 12. ver. 9: hee is more mightily rebuked, euen so when anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie is joyned with errour, then errour is not graced but utterly disgraced, as who would say, this woman is an olde harlot, or this man is an olde foole, or this canker or rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennesse in the flesh is an old feaster: all these are reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful speeches pointing out the maladie of an vnsupportable euil.

But the Papists will confidently affirme that the Masse that PAVL said at <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>propitiatorium sacrificium,</hi> and <hi>incruenta hostia,</hi> that is to say, a propitiatorie &amp; vnbloodie sacrifice, which is vnpossible and repugnant vnto his owne doctrine. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I demand of them another question anent the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man described 12. Apocal. she was clothed with the sunne, and had the Moone vnder her feete: she had a diademe of twelue starres vpon her heade, which vndoubtedly was the celestial light of Apostolicke doctrine she trauailed in birth to bring foorth children to God: she was persecuted by the Dragon: to her was furnished wings of an Eagle, and shee fled vnto the wildernesse, where she had a place prepared of God, that they should feede her there a thousand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and threescore dayes. Now (I say) I demand of the Papistes what wildernesse was this, whereinto the woman lurked so long time? for no man dare deny but this woman representeth the true Church of Christ the mother of vs all. Lurked she in the wildernesse of <hi>Nitria</hi> or <hi>Schethis?</hi> Or lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked she in the wildernesse of <hi>Arabia</hi> or <hi>Lybia?</hi> Or lurked she in the wildernesse of <hi>Persia,</hi> where IVLIAN the Apostat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his wretched life? Or in what other wildernes of the world did she lurke? When they haue giuen me an answere to this second question, let them thinke in their own mind that they haue answered the question proponed against vs. If they can giue no answere to this question, neither doe I tell them where our Church was sixe hundreth yeeres ago: but let them demand this question at him who furnished

                        <p>Now errour in religion consisting in adding or pairing or altering, or contradicting the trueth contained in the <note place="margin">Errour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable thing</note> word of God. It is euident, I say, that errour in religion is a cursed and execrable thing.

The like condemnation no doubt abideth them who dare presume to alter the truth and change the right sense or meaning of it, or to make a flat opposition and contradiction thereto. And truely all these curses which God commanded to bee pronounced out of mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> Deut. 27 euery Christian is commanded to say Amen vnto them, a part whereof may justly be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against maintainers and forgers of errour in religion.

Vnto all these curses openly pronounced we are bound by the commandement to say Amen.</p>
                        <p>And like as errour in religion is a thing accursed of God, so in like maner it is in itselfe an absurd thing, and full of <note place="margin">Errour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> horrible confusion, not onely repugning vnto the trueth, but also to it selfe, much like vnto IONAS gourd, which had into it a worme that smote it, so that it withered, Ionas 4. 7
<pb facs="tcp:18670:24"/>
euen so there lurketh into the bowels ofancient errours a worme consuming them vntill they vtterly wither and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish. The errour of EVTYCHES may serue for example, He thought that the immensitie of the diuine nature of Christ did so swallow vp his humane nature, that in Christ there is no more two natures, but one alanerly, namely his diuine nature. Nowe if so be, howe are we saued by the death of Christ? Can the diuinitie die? Which absurditie of EVTY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHES errour was well marked by ALAMVNDARVS prince of <hi>Saracens,</hi> as writeth THEODORVS lector. lib. 2. More ouer the ancient errours which sprang vp euen in the Apostles owne dayes, and immediatly after, had some portrate and shape of that absurditie that should continue in all errours that were to spring vp afterward, euer pairing the glorie that was due vnto the most High, and aduancing creatures out of measure. EBION and CERINTHVS denied Christes diuinitie, and on the other parte MENANDER thought that the world was created by Angels. Here we see Christs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour impaired, but the honour of Angels infinitly augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <note place="margin">Both ancient and late er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie creatures With the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the glory of the Creator.</note> In like maner afterwarde ARRIVS denied that the Sonne of God was consubstantiall with the Father, dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing and pairing the honour due to Christ. But PFLAGIVS another Heretique magnified the power of mans corrupt nature, as if in it there were an abilitie to performe all the commandements of God. Thus we see that the very shape and similitude after the which Satan fashioned the errour of EBION, CERINTHS and MENANDER continueth in ARRIVS and PELAGIVS. And in our dayes, the Papistes will not goe out of the byas of old Heretiques: for Christ must not be the onely Mediator both of redemption and intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but some thing must bee paired from the honour of Christ, to the ende that the Sainctes may be enriched with the spoyle of Christ, and be made vp mediators of interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <note place="margin">The trueth is not to be judged by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</note>

Heere we see that the multitude judgeth that religion to bee best, the professours whereof injoyes greatest ease, wealth, and worldly prosperitie. But in the booke of the Psalmes, we receiue a better instruction to judge of the trueth of God, and professours thereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the hearing of faith, and not according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things: <hi>There are glorious things spoken of thee Ã´ citie of our God.</hi> Psal 87. ver. 3. And these who judge according to outwarde appearance, they erre in two things: first, they know not the right cause of the prosperitie of Idolaters, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly they knowe not the right cause of the penuritie of those who apparently haue forsaken idolatrie. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith that God ouerlooked the time of ignorance, Acts 17. ver. 30. but in time oflight when the candle of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell clearely shineth, and pointeth out vnto vs the way of ancient veritie, the Lord will not spare them who haue hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically professed his veritie, but in their heart they loue the deceit of errour and lies, as the people in IEREMIAS dayes did. <hi>This is the condemnation</hi> (saith theEuangelist IOHN) <hi>that light is come into the worlde, and men loued darkenesse rather then light.</hi> Iohn 3. ver. 19. <note place="margin">Antiquitie of custome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from antiquitie of commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>

                        <p>Antiquitie of custome which we haue before described, lacketh many things that areto bee found in antiquitie of veritie. For it is not authorized by any Apostolicke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, wherupon 3. things do follow. First there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie vrging vs to keep things that are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>manded by Apostolick precept in matters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerning religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.

Thirdly, where it is gone out of custome or vse, there is no necessity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it again, as the feasts called <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> in the Apostlesown time, &amp; the 3. dippings in Baptisme after the Apostles time.
<pb facs="tcp:18670:25"/>
Of these ancient customes we may boldly say foure things. 1. That the Apostles gaue no commandement to obserue them, 2. that there is no necessitie to keepe &amp; obserue these customes. 3. there was no just cause of feare to the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, where these customes were pretermitted or neglected. 4. experience declareth that since vse and custome which brought in these exercises hath also obliterat and worne them away, the Church in our time hath taken no regard of renewing these ancient customes againe. Now anent the examples which I haue alreadie brought foorth there are many who will make no contradiction, but as touching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancient customes obserued of old in the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any written commandement, if those bee touched, and the like be saide of them also, more sturre and greater adoe will be made. Yet if I proue by ancient writers that the observation of <hi>Pasche</hi> day, and the obseruation of <hi>Lent</hi> were rites introduced in the Church without warrand of any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicke commandement, it will followe that there is neither necessitie in keeping, nor leauing these things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeped: wherefore consider what SOCRATES saith in his ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical history, lib. 5. cap. 22. <hi>Nusquam igitur Apostolus, nec ipsa Evangelia jugum ser vitutis illis imponunt, qui ad praedicatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem accedunt: sed Paschatis festum, &amp; alios dies festos ipsi homines suis quique locis propter remissionem laborum &amp; memoriam salutife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae passionis, sicuti voluerunt, ex consuetudine quadam celebrÃ¢runt, neque Servator hoc, aut Apostoli nobis lege aliqua observandum esse mandÃ¢runt. Neque poenam nobis aut supplicium Evangelia vel A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postoli, sicut Iudaeis Lex Mosi, comminantur, sed historico tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tÃ¹m modo ad reprehensionem Iudaeorum, quÃ²d homicidium diebus festis exercuerint, &amp; quÃ²d Christus tempore Azymorum passus sit, conscriptum est in Evangeliis.</hi> That is, Therfore no where doth the Apostle or the Euangell lay vpon them the yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, who come to the preached worde, but the feast of <hi>Pasche</hi> day, &amp; other festiuall dayes men euery one in their owne places, for intermission of labour, &amp; for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the salutiferous passion they kept as liked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues best, these said feastes by a certaine custome. Neither did our Sauiour or his Apostles by any law command vs to
<pb facs="tcp:18670:25"/>
doe this thing, neither did the Apostles or Gospel threaten a punishment against vs (to wit if we leaue these things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done) according as the Lawe of MOSES doth against the Iewes, but the historie onely for reprehension of the Iewes in the Gospell setteth downe in write, that the Iewes vpon festiuall dayes practised murther, and that Christ suffered in the dayes of vnleauened bread. Here all that I haue spoken, is clearely declared concerning the obseruation of the feast of <hi>Pasche</hi> day. 1. no precept or commandement proceeding from Christ &amp; his Apostles to keepe it. 2. no threatning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> who kept it not. 3. that it was brought in into the Church by custome, but not by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mandement. 4. that when men endeuoure to authorize by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mandements such ancient customes, then they bring a yoke &amp; bondage vpon the consciences of men. The like &amp; more also is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that same chapter by SOCRATES concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of <hi>Lent</hi> before the feast of <hi>Pasche</hi> day, that it was obserued with such diuersitie of customes, both in number of dayes, and also in diuersitie of meates, from which men abstained in <hi>Lent</hi> as easily declared that the Apostles inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned no commandement in such matters, but left such customes free &amp; indifferent to the discretion of Christians.</p>
                        <p>In the head of antiquitie of customes, because I like not to be contentious in my judgement, two extremities would be eschewed. I. that we should not equall ancient customes to ancient commandements, for the causes aboue-written, which caueat SOZOMEN an ecclesiasticall writer not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, did affirme all these who are not thrise dipped in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to haue departed this life without the sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, Sozom lib. 6, cap. 26. In which opinion he equalled an ancient custome to an olde commandement. And yet this same SOZOMEN, who is so precise in obseruation of an ancient custome of 3. dippings in Baptisme, is not so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in another ancient custome of abstaining from eating of flesh in <hi>Lent,</hi> but commendeth SPIRIDION who gaue vnto a wearie stranger in time of <hi>Lent</hi> swines flesh to eate, &amp; eated himself of it also, affirming that to the cleane al things were cleane, Sozom. lib. 1. cap. 1 1. Tit. cap. 1. ver. 15. Thus we seee
<pb facs="tcp:18670:26"/>
howe SOZOMEN confuteth himselfe at sometimes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that ancient customes are not equall to ancient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements (as abstinence from flesh in <hi>Lent)</hi> and in other things forgetting himselfe, &amp; making the ancient custome of thrise dipping in Baptisme absolutly necessarie. 2. anci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>nt customes not directly repugnant to the worde, if they be kept free of commandement, necessitie and feare (as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue specified) should not be so hatefully impugned, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient errours are impugned, but if abuses fall into them, these abuses should be timously reprehended as the Apostle PAVL reprooueth the abuses ofthe feastes ofloue in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. But aboue all things beware that we rent not for matters of no great moment the vnitie of the Church of God, as VICTOR Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to haue done, if he had not bene timously stayed by the prudent aduise of IRENEVS Bishop of <hi>Lions</hi> Socrat. lib. 5. cap. 22. Now to conclude this short treatise of antiquitie of custome, if a wise man would send a tongue to it to speake for it selfe, it would be so far from matching and equalling itselfe with the ancient commandements, that it would speake modestly and humbly to them, as ELIZABETH the mother of IOHN Baptist spake to the blessed virgine the mother of our Lord. <hi>Andwhence commeth this to me</hi> (saith she) <hi>that the mother of my Lord should come vnto me?</hi> Luc 1, ver. 43. So might old customes speake to olde commandements. WhÃ©ce co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth this to me that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mandement my mistresse &amp; Lady wil tolerat me to be within the doores of the house of God, wherein she hath such soueraignitie and swey? <note place="margin">How ancient truth may be discerned from ancient lies.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the fourth heade we are to intreate by what meanes ancient errours may be distinguished from ancient veritie. And first, veritie is not in all pointes like vnto an olde man whose strength is dayly abated by debilitie and weaknesse, till at length the old man die, &amp; goe to the graue: yea rather veritie the older it be, the vertue, strength, and vigour of it is the better knowne: but errours when they waxe old they become weake, they die and euanish, and are vile as a filthy and stinking carion, so as if any man in our dayes should open the graue of ARRIVS, and renue his vngodly opinion,
<pb facs="tcp:18670:26"/>
he should see all Christians shake their heades, &amp; stop their eares, and grip after a maner their noses with their handes, that the abominable flewer of that filthie carion should not be felt: but by the contrarie, the sweete smell of the ancient Veritie of Christ is like a precious oyntment powred out, filling the house of God with no lesse delite now then it did of old when it was first preached by the Apostles in <hi>Ierusale,</hi> Acts 2. And as the house of DAVID dayly waxed stronger, &amp; the house of ISHBOSHETH dayly waxed weaker, 2. Sam. 3. 1. such like is the estate of the Veritie and the lie.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, veritie and errour are best distinguished when they are riped vp into the very ground, and frivolous &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall trialls are laide aside, As NEHEMIA did when hee tried after the captiuitie who had a right of Priesthood to stand at the altar, &amp; to offer sacrifices, he commanded them to produce their writes and genealogies, and make good their lineal descent from the loynes of AARON, which right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                           </gap>ey who could not find out were put from the Priesthood, Nehem. 7. ver. 64 Euen so they who pretend veritie of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent doctrine, let them verifie clearely by the written word, that this their doctrine came from the mouth of Christ &amp; his holy Apostles: For as the procreation of AARON gaue a right to stand at the altar, so also the doctrine that came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the mouth of Christ and his Apostles, hath an vndoubted right to be sounded in the Church of God. Remember now that wise NEHEMIAH was not superficiall in his triall. The sons of HABAIAH, the sons of HAKKOZ, the sons of BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZILLAI could haue shewed in write that they were come of the descent of LEVI, and of the familie of COAH, but that which was of greatest moment of all, that they were descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from that branche of the familie of COAH which was separated to the scruice of the altar, to wit, from AARON, Numb. 16. ver. 40. that they could not proue. So the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes of our time can prooue that their doctrine hath had place sixe, seuen, or eight hundreth yeeres, and more also before our dayes, but that which is of greatest weight, to wit, that their doctrine came from the mouth of Christ and his holy Apostles, in that probation they succumbe.</p>

as AVGVSTVS CAESAR discerned him who falsly called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ALEXANDER the sonne of HEROD, and the sonne in law of ARCHELAVS King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and husband of GLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHYRA, Ioseph. antiq lib. 17. cap, 14. This ALEXANDER son of HEROD the great with his brother ARISTOBVLVS were both executed to the death, by the commandement of their father. But after the death of ALEXANDER, an artificer bearing that same name, and in stature, beauty, lineaments, and all agreeing proportion, so neerely resembled the very similitude of ALEXANDER the sonne of HEROD, that they who best knew HERODS son, did most confidently affirme, that this same artificer was he indeede, and he himselfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that he was HERODS sonne, and had escaped death by the fauour of the executioner: Alwayes when he was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Emperour, AVGVSTVS would not be deceiued with the liklyhood of his face, but groped his hand, and found it to be hard like to the hand of an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and discerned him to be a deceiuing fellow and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed him. This I grant may be applyed more properly to Christ then to vs. For albeit we be easily deceiued &amp; seduced with lies, yet the great King of heauen Christ Iesus cannot be deceiued, hee will not regard the brasen face of the lie calling it selfe trueth, but he will wisely grope the hand of the lie, &amp; examine what operations it hath wrought among the people, it hath blinded mens vnderstanding it hath har dened their heartes, it hath learned them to be proud ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinat, &amp; contemners of the trueth of God, &amp; finally it hath learned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to honour creatures with impairing of the glory of the Creator. Then wil the great King say, O full of al de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit thy hand and thy operations that thou hast wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men testifieth that thou art not of God. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the members of Christ also, in some meane measure, may be groping the hand of the lie, &amp; finding it to be hard &amp; dric, &amp; voyde of all sap &amp; moysture of spirituall grace, we may say in our harts, O doctrine of lies, barren &amp; withered within thy selfe, and communicating no grace vnto thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, the Lord separat vs from thee, &amp; thee from vs, that we may adhere firmly vnto our Lord and Sauiour Christ Iesus vnto the end.</p>

Finally, when wee haue done all that we can doe to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the lie from the veritie, yet let vs not liue in securitie as though wee could neuer be deceiued. IOSVA that holy man of God was deceiued with old garments, old bottels of wine, old bread and shoes, because he consulted not with the mouth of God, Ios. 9. ver. 14. Then aboue all things we should seeke counsell at the mouth of God by earnest pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, diligent reading of the written word, attentiue hearing of godly sermons, and if we seeke, we shall finde, and if wee knocke, it shall be opened vnto vs. And the Lorde direct vs both in seeking and finding with the gratious conduct of his holy Spirit.</p>

I dare not imagine that either the holy Apostles, or yet CLEMENT one of the Apostles faithfull successours did euer light such a candle. The allowance which these Canons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles got in the sixt generall Councill Anno 681. whereof GREGORIVS HOLOANDER the conuerter of them out of Greeke into Latin, glorieth so much, was vpon an occasion whereof the <hi>Romaine</hi> Church hath cause to blush and to be ashamed rather then to glorie much. First, because in that generall Councill HONORIVS 1. sometime Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was condemned of heresie. Secondly, because in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was ordained to be in equall authoritie with the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And thirdly because the constitutions of the Latin Church forbidding men who were in ecclesiasticall offices to marie, these constitutions (I say) were vtterly disallowed, and the 5. chapter of the Canons of the Apostles gote better allowance, because in it, it was statute and ordained that the Bishop, Elder or Deacon, who repudiateth his own wife vnder pretence of religion, shall be excommunicat, and if he continue so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he should be deposed. Now this generall Councill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in so many principall points against them, and onely gracing the supposititious booke of the Canons of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles of purpose to disgrace the constitutions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Church, if HOLOANDER had remembred what he had bene doing, he had bene more sparing in alledging the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie therof.

Pastour, because he should be a man of knowledge, and able to convict those that gainsay the trueth, Tit. 1. the Pastour should conferre with the Heretique, &amp; admonish him once or twise to returne to the soundnesse of faith, Tit. 3. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is to be noted, that the worde in the Greeke language betokening admonition is <gap reason="foreign">

                              <desc>â¢â¦</desc>

                           </gap>. And it is a very hard matter to reduce a mad man to his right wit againe: therefore let a preacher take it to hart that to conuert a Heretique is a difficill worke, for he is dealing with a man possessed with a strong deuill, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cast out by Christs disciples, except Christ himselfe put hand to the worke, Mat. 17. This the Apostle writeth, not to make Pastours to despaire and giue ouer the care of conquessing of Heretiques, but to doe this worke circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly and warily, with humilitie and reuerent feare, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that our Lord and master Christ Iesus would kyth his strength in our weakenesse, otherwise this turne can not be done.

                           </gap> difficultie of the worke, two things are to be considered: first, the Apostolicke commandement warning vs to admonish him once or twise, which warning, seing it is not giuen in vaine, it should be obeyed Secondly, God hath blessed the trauailes of some of his seruants, &amp; by them some Heretiques haue bene reclaimed to the right faith: as namely BERYLLVS Bishop in <hi>Bostra</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> who denied that Christ was existent before he tooke flesh of the virgine, yet by the painfull trauailes of ORIGEN hee was conuerted to the true faith againe, Euseb. eccles. hist. lib. 6. cap. 33. And this is the cause wherfore I separat BERYLLVS
<pb facs="tcp:18670:33"/>
from ARTEMON in the subsequent historie. In like maner God blessed the trauailes of DIONYSIVS Bishop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> by whome in a place of <hi>Egypt</hi> called <hi>Arseno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore let not the faithful Pastours despaire, because the worke is difficil, but obey Gods commandement, and commit the issue to God himselfe.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Magistrats, like as they prescribe to all men their duties, so in like maner, God who is their onely supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, <note place="margin">HAV the magistrate should deale with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</note> prescribes their dutie to them in all things, and in this mater also: for the Lord commanded the false prophet, who allured the people to follow other gods, to be slaine, Deut. 13. ver. 5.

Hee is worse then a murtherer who killeth a mans body, for there may bee some valuation of the harme and skaith that a murtherer hath done, but who can value and ponder the harme that an Heretique doeth, who by false doctrine murthereth the soules of infinite numbers of people, hee is worse then an infidell, forasmuch as hee hath obtained a more abominable name then an infidell. For an infidell as S. AVGVSTINE speaketh cannot be called <hi>desertor fidei &amp; oppugnator <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                              </gap>ius,</hi> that is, a forsaker and impugner of the faith, because hee neuer embraced it, but an Heretike is a backslider from the faith which sometime he professed, and an hatefull impugner of the same. Finally he is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious then a Schismatike who laboureth to cut the band of loue wherwith we are coupled with our brethren, but an Heretike endeuoureth to cut the very throate of faith, wherewith we are coupled with our God. Also a schisme hath many times beene found without an heresie, but an
<pb facs="tcp:18670:34"/>
heresie was neuer founde without a Schisme. Then this question may be conceiued in these tearmes. What shall be done with a man who is worse then a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, worse then an infidell, worse then CORE, DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAN and ABIRAM, who by a pernicious schisme, rent the vnitie of the holy people? yea, what shall be done with them who like vnto Foxes sucke out the blood of Christ out of the soules of the poore sheepe of Christ? Now let God answere from his Sanctuarie. <hi>Let such a false prophet be slaine.</hi> Deut 13.</p>
                        <p>True it is indeede that the doubtsome judgements of ancient and learned fathers haue made this question more debatable then otherwise it needed to haue beene. For S.

But in another Epistle written to GLORIVS and ELEVSIVS he thinketh that Schismatikes and Heretiques (such as the <hi>Donatists</hi> were) deserued greater punishment then I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters themselues, for hee saith, <hi>Qui fecerunt idolum, usi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tata gladii morte perempti sunt, qui verÃ² s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When <hi>Nilus</hi> and <hi>Danube</hi> haue wandred long, in end they powre their waters <note place="margin">Similitude.</note> into the sea, and when AVGVSTINE hath beene sometimes in one opinion, and sometimes in another, in ende hee is compelled to say Amen to that which God hath said in his worde, that is, that a false prophet should be slaine, Deut. 13. I speake of deceiuing teachers, but not of deceiued people. As touching the people, the weaker they are, the wiser they should bee, not exponing their weakenesse to the hazard of strong tentations, but following the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell <note place="margin">How the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should deale with Heretiques.</note> of the Apostle writing to the elect Lady, ver. 10. 11. <hi>If there come any vnto you, and bring not this doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him not to house, neither bidde him God speede: for he that biddeth him, God speede, is partaker of his euill deedes.</hi> But seeing a blinde man may bee shoueled out of the way, and poore simple people may bee soone bewitched, Galat. 3. therefore it is expedient for the people to acquaint themselues well with the 12. Articles of their faith, and so firmly to adhere to them that in no case they sufferthem selues to be miscaried from that short summe of Christian faith. For EPIPHANIVS when he had written a Catalogue of heresies that sprang vp before his own time, he thought it expedient also to write another booke called <hi>Anchoratus,</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:18670:35"/>
which booke containeth a declaration of the true and right faith according to the writings of holy Scripture, which faith if it bee firmely kept, it shall bee like vnto an ancre that stablisheth a ship, that it bee not drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the tempest of the raging sea: euen so the fast gripping to the heades of our faith, and right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of them saueth vs, that wee bee not miscaried with the tempest of hereticall doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Also the counsell of AVGVSTINE is not to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded. In reading of Scripture if wee can not take vp the very genuine sense and meaning of the place, at least let vs not expone that place of Scripture in a sense repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the analogie of faith. So shall we be like to a man who hath aberred from the direct way, yet he wandereth in the fieldes leading to the towne whereat he would be, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin <hi>de doctrina Christiana.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 37.</p>
                        <p>Aboue all things let not the people hearken to those teachers who would inforce the wordes of Scripture, and wrest them to a sense flatly repugnant to the principall purpose intreated in that passage of Scripture: for wordes are inuented for to expresse the purpose, but the purpose is not deuised for the wordes. A cleare example we haue in the sixt of IOHN his Gospell. Our master Christ is spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in that Chapter to a carnall &amp; fleshly hearted people, who were offended at his doctrine: for remedie wherof our Lorde teacheth them, that his doctrine was spirituall, and consequently was not to be receiued with fleshly eares and heartes saying vnto them, <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>The comparison of Christ to a stone is so frequently vsed in Scripture that the very prophecie of Christs natiuitie, death and latter comming to judge the world are illustrate <note place="margin">The similt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a stone frequently v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedin Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> by this similitude.

                        <p>The second comfort contained in this description is this, that Christ is a precious stone, a corner stone &amp; a sure foundation. Wherefore Christ is called an elect or tried stone, we shall heare Godwilling hereafter in the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Apostle PETER maketh of this same stone. Now Christ is not like vnto the stones of other buildings more different one from another in place then in nature: for the stone in the foundation is but a senslesse stone as wel as the stone of the wall that is builded vpon it. And it is possible that if the house &amp; building be casten downe, that some of the stones that were in the wall, be laide in the foundation, and some againe that were in the foundation be laide in the wall, whereupon ariseth this vicissitude, that the stone sometime sustained, nowe sustaineth, and by the contrarie. the stone now sustaining sometime was sustained. But Christ Iesus is a precious stone sustaining vs at al times, and neuer sustained by vs, partaker of our nature, but not of our sinnes, in many things like, but in infinit things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vnto vs: <hi>holy, blamelesse, vndefiled, separat from sinners, and made higher then the heauens.</hi> Heb. 7. And in this also that he is a corner stone, hee hath a prerogatiue aboue all other corner stones for other corner stones joyne wals together, that are not far distant one from another, such as the side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall and the gauell of an house: but Christ hath joyned <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> together so infinitly separate one from another, that none could vnite them but Christ alanerly. For who could cast downe the partition wall, and abolish the lawe of ceremonies, which made infinite alienation of the mindes of the <hi>Iewes</hi> from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but onely Christ?

The Prophets continued not long aliue Zach. 1. ver. 5. but their doctrine continued, because it was after a maner a foundation. The like may be saide of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
                        <p>In like maner faith in some sense may be called a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Epist.

And the Apostle IVDE calleth it our most holy faith no doubt opponing faith to infidelitie: for infidelitie vtterly polluteth the soule, and maketh it prophaneHeb, 3 ver. 12. And in another place. <hi>Let there be no fornicatour or prophane person like Esau, who for one mease of meat sold his birthright,</hi> Heb 12. 16, Thus wee see if infidelitie once take roote in the heart it will make it so prophane, that the Couenant of God, the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the blessing, yea and heauen it selfe will be set at light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. But on the other parte, when the heart is coupled by faith to Christ, then is faith like vnto a whippe in Christs hande scourging out infinite abuses out of our soules, Iohn 2.</p>

What is the life of a man without the true knowledge of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him in Christ but spirituall deadnes? yea dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse more miserable then the deadnesse of dogges killed in <note place="margin">Similitude</note> their mothers belly, miserable for this that they neuer sawe the light, and more miserable, because the light neuer saw them. And these who haue not seene by the eyes of faith God reconciled to them in Christ, they are double misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, neither haue they seene the true light, neither hath the true light euer looked vpon them but in anger and wrath.</p>
                        <p>This liuing foundation (saith the Apostle) was disallowed of men, but chosen of God and precious. But I pray you <note place="margin">The contempt of men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not impaire the glory of Christ.</note> wherefore did men disallow him? Because hee appeared in the similitude of a servant: because he was like vnto a root in a dry ground: because he was a man ful of sorowes &amp; had experience of infirmities: because hee was wounded for our transgressions, &amp; broken for our iniquities, and because of his chastisments and his stripes, Ifa. 53. So miserably is our corrupt nature disposed, that not onely we erre anent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, despising them whome we ought to reuerence, but in despising them for the selfe-same cause, for the which they should most reuerently be regarded. Christ is to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of vs for many causes, chiefly for this that hee humbled himselfe to the end he might exalt vs, and hee was content to be wounded to the end we might be cured by his stripes, Ifa. 53.

This errour EPIPHANIVS ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth for many great absurdities. First (saith he) did Christ build vp againe that Tabernacle which men destroyed to the end that he himselfe in continent after the building of it should destroy it againe by a dissolution of it into the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Secondly if Christ dissolued his owne body, why would he not let his disciples see at least the reliques of his body resolued into elements, to the ende they might haue honoured the reliques of his dissolued body, as the women came to the sepulchre with precious oyntments to haue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his dead body. Thirdly (saith he) APELLES speaketh of Christes body after his resurrection that which neither Christ, nor his Apostles euer spake of that blessed body. This is the right way to vndoe heresies, to bring them to the right balance of the mouth of Christ, and writings of his holy Apostles, and then heresies cannot consist and stand.</p>

Psal. 119. ver. 105. and a very diademe to the heade of the woman that trauaileth in birth to bring forth children to God, Apoc. 12. The holy Scriptures are like vnto the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of holy Scriptures, of whome MOSES saith, that God is fearefull in praises, Exod <hi>15.</hi> ver <hi>11</hi> When wee prayse a mortall man, it is to be feared lest wee giue too much honour vnto him: but when wee praise the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall God it is to bee feared lest wee holde backe a part of his due honour. And truely the worde of God in this point is like vnto God himselfe. When a man entreth into a commendation of the Scriptures of God, he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to feare but this one thing, that he speake not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently of it as becommeth him to doe. It is the witnesse <note place="margin">Similitude.</note> of Christ, Iohn 5. It is the candle of God shining in a darke place, 2. Pet, 1. It is the sword that the spirit furnisheth vs to fight against spiritual wickednesse, Ephes. 6. ver. 17. In a word let vs be wise like men who finde precious stones, they goe to the Lapidars to trie the value &amp; vertue of the stones that are found, for euery man hath not skill to judge of such precious things: so let vs consider diligently what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, the very pen-men of the holy Ghoste haue spoken anent the written Worde of God and wee shall finde it a pearle of infinite value, Matt. <note place="margin">It is peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat the booke of the worde from the booke of the workes.</note> 13.</p>
                        <p>This volume of the booke of the Worde is one of the two principall bookes wherein wee learne to knowe God, as the Prophet declareth, Psal. <hi>19.</hi> In the booke of the workes we know the power &amp; diuinitie of God, Rom. <hi>1.</hi> but in the booke of the written worde of God we know the will
<pb facs="tcp:18670:51"/>
of God and his fauour toward vs in Christ lesus: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet saith, that the statutes of the Lord rejoyce the heart, Psal. 19 ver: 8. Satan knowing what profitc com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to men by joyning these two volumes together, hath laboured to separat them, to the ende, that men seeing the beautie of the creature, should worship it in stead of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. And like as a ship that is spoiled of a prudent Pilot or <note place="margin">Similitude.</note> shipmaster, it is drowned in the sea: euen so the worde of God, when it directeth not the knowledge that men haue by the looking vpon the creature, then men mal e ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of their saluation, and worshippe the creature in place of God the Creator of all things.</p>
                        <p>Another artifice of Satan is to separat the word and the Spirit which God hath joyned together as two vnseparable meanes to set vp the Kingdome of God in our hearts, as the <note place="margin">The spirit &amp; the word are not to be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</note> Prophet ISAIAS saith. <hi>And I will make this my couenant With you saith the Lord, my Spirit which is vpon thee, and my wordes which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seede, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for euer,</hi> Isa. 59. ver. 21, But the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in our dayes brag of the reuelations of the spirit, which reuelations notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing agree not with the written word of God and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is certaine that their reuelations are but fantasies and toyes of brain-sicke men.</p>
                        <p>This written word of God is to be read in the bookes of MOSES and the Prophets, of whome Christ said, <hi>Search the</hi>

                        <p>The word of God written by MOSES was so perfitly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>Many false imputations against sacred Scriptures are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">False accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture.</note> by Papistes to transport the hearts of people from the perfite reuerence of scripture, calling it imperfite &amp; vnsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and that it is obscure, and that it is perillous to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icke people to reade it, lest they fall into errour. The first accusation of Scripture is the vnsufficiencie of it. The Bishop of <hi>Enereux</hi> that blasphemous man was bold to write <note place="margin">Vnsufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> a booke of the vnsufficiencie of Scripture, and the greatest argument hee vseth if it were granted, yet prooueth it not his purpose: for he thinketh that wee haue not sufficiently by Scripture conuicted the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who deny that children should be baptized till they be of perfite yeeres to giue a confession of their owne faith. Wee suppone that all this were true yet it prooueth not vnsufficiencie in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but rather insufficiencie in vs to whome the mysteries of the booke of God are not sufficiently knowne. There is a place of Scripture, Exod 3. I <hi>am the God of Abraham, Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac and Jacob.</hi> In this place (I say) is an argument secretly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and prooning the resurrection, as Christ clearely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, disputing against the Sadduces, Mat. 22, ver. 31. 32. yet no man before the manifestation of Christ himselfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer perceiued that this argument was lurking in these words: shall it be saide, this argument was not in scripture, because it was not perceiued by weake men to bee in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Truely it were good for this Bishop to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Iudges that are in this Isle of <hi>Britaine,</hi> when an act of Parliament is made and ratified, the Iudges of our countrie decerne all causes according to the Acts, but giue not out rash sentence against the Actes: but when the Couenant of God is made and ratified by the bloode of Christe, it were better to judge according
<pb facs="tcp:18670:52"/>
to it, then to giue out rash sentence against it.</p>
                        <p>Let vs consider what is written of the three bookes that shall be opened at the day of Iudgement, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the worlde shall be judged. One of the three bookes is expresly nominat, to wit, the booke of life, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal chap. 20. ver. 10 the other two no man can denie to bee the Booke of the Lawe, and the booke of the conscience, because the Booke of the Lawe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth all that wee should haue done, and the booke of the conscience beeing opened, manifesteth all that wee haue done: whereupon the righteous Iudge of the worlde groundeth a just sentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against vngodly men in this maner. The booke of the Lawe manifesteth what yee should haue done, the booke of your owne conscience manifesteth that yee haue done the contrarie, and moreouer also your names are not found written in the Booke of life. Therefore departe from mee into the fire prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and his angels. Nowe I demaund of Papistes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these three bookes that shall bee opened, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them imperfite? Is there any elect person whose name is not written in the booke of life? Is there any euill that wee haue done that is not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a penne of Yron, and with the point of a Diamond in the booke of the conscience, Ierem. 17. ver. I? These two bookes are perfite. Ho, but the thirde booke of the Lawe and written Worde of God is not perfite. In the day of the Lordes blessed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance wee shall finde it perfite, containing all that wee should haue either done or beleeued.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they say that the Scriptures are difficill to be vnderstand, and therefore should not bee reade by common people. And indeede the Apostle PETER granteth that some places of the Epistles of PAVL <note place="margin">Difficultie.</note> are hard to bee vnderstood, <hi>2.</hi> Pet. 3. but hee bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no man for this abstaine from the reading of PAVLS Epistles. To ouercome difficulties there are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remedies.
<pb facs="tcp:18670:53"/>
The blessed virgine the mother of our Lord, when she vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not Christes wordes, she kept and pondered them in her heart, Luc. 2. IVSTINVS MARTYR was admonished by an ancient and reuerent Christian to joyne prayer with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that God would please to open the ports of light and vnderstanding, that he might conceiue the true sense &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that he read. Iustin, <hi>dialog Tryphen,</hi> CHRYSOSTOM in his preface vpon the Epist. to the <hi>Romanes</hi> declareth, that if a man would acquaint himself familiarly with the scriptur by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall exercise of reading, he should the more easily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Scripture as he who is familiarly acquainted with his friend, wil know by his nod or becken what is his meaning. AVGVSTINE likewise saith, that as there is difficill places in Scripture, to exercise the vnderstanding of the strong: so likewise there is plaine and easie passages of Scripture, as pleasant medowes whereinto babes may securely walke. August. Aboue all the rest our master Christ Iesus hath taught vs by his owne example to confer Scripture with Scripture, Math. 4. to the end we be not deceiued by Satans false glosses and commentaries vpon Scripture. This is better then vpon occasion of difficultie to reject and cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs a thing so necessarie.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly they say that the reading of Scriptures is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to simple people, because they may easily fall into <note place="margin">Perill.</note> an errour for fault of vnderstanding the right meaning of that which is reade. I might answere compendiously, that by this argument no man should reade sacred scripture, neither learned nor vnlearned men. For many learned men by reading Scripture, and not vnderstanding it aright haue beene patrons of heresie, such as ARRIVS, MACEDONIVS, NESTORIVS, EVTHICHES and diuers others. Also the very Monkes, whose solitarie life and continuall exercise in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and praying might seeme to exeeme them more then others from errour and heresie, yet by mistaking the places of Scripture that spake of the eyes, the nostrels, the face of God, the breath of God, the arme of God, they supponed God to bee fashioned according to the likenesse of a man. And so both learned and vnlearned, Priestes and people,
<pb facs="tcp:18670:53"/>
men liuing in townes, and lurking in cottages of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes haue erred through misvnderstanding of Scriptures, Yet Scriptures must be reade by all true Christians, and our meditation night and day must be vpon the Lawe of God. Psal. 1. ver. 2.</p>
                        <p>Let vs here consider that some things are not necessarie vnto eternall life, and when they are abused, it is not amisse <note place="margin">Things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarte are to be kept al-beit they be abused.</note> that they bee remooued, and put out of the way: such as the brasen serpent which HEZEKIAS brake in pieces, and called it <hi>Nebustan,</hi> 2 Reg. cap. 18. ver. 4. But other things are so necessarie vnto eternall life, that albeit they were a thousand times abused, yet they cannot be forsaken, such as is that foode that feedeth our soules vnto eternall life, Ioh: 6. for the which we are commanded continually to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And like as when many thousands are poysoned in <note place="margin">Similitude,</note> meate or drinke, as it fell out in the armie of CONRADVS 3. yet necessitie compelleth men to cate and drinke: cuen so we must reade and meditate vpon the written worde, albeit infinit numbers of people haue beene miscatied by not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp the right sense and meaning of Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Now the cause wherefore so many accusations are forged <note place="margin">Why Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques doe hate the Scripture. Similitude,</note> against Scripture is this, because it is the powerfull instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, whereby teachers of lying doctrine are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted and confounded. Places of holy Scripture are like vnto the smooth stones that DAVID tooke out of the brooke, and fastened one of them into the head of GOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AH, 1 Sam. 17. ver. 49. Euen so Heretiques are so confounded by the testimonies of Scripture, that aboue all things they hate Scripture. This IRENEVS toucheth shortly spealing of Heretiques in these words: <hi>CÃ¹m ex Scripturis arguuntur, in accusationem convertuntur ipsarum Scripturarum,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 2. that is, When they (to wit. Heretiques) are argued by Scriptures they turne themselues to the accusation of Scrip tures. Thieues do hate the light, and traitours the face of a ludge and Heretiques hate Scripture, the very axe that is laid to the root of their tree, that it may be hewed down, cast into the fire, and vtterly abolished.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding of all these false accusations, let vs fast
<pb facs="tcp:18670:54"/>
adhere to the written Word. The fathers that liued in the <note place="margin">The care of Christians of olde to keepe the scripture from bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> time of these ten persecutions counted the volume of holy Scripture so precious a treasure, that they could willingly offer their bodies to bee burned with fire for the faith of Christ, but they would not giue one page of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be burned: and if any man did it, he was called <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,</hi> that is, a betrayer, and was counted a companion to the traitour IVDAS who betrayed his master, which custome was the ground of that great and long-lasting controuersie betwene CECILIANVS B. of <hi>Carthage,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Donatists.</hi> For the <hi>Donatists</hi> alledged that he had admitted to an ecclesiasti cke office a man, who in time of persecution had bene <hi>proditor,</hi> &amp; had deliuered a volume of holy Scripture to be burned.</p>
                        <p>If we will not followe the zeale of ancient Christians, I will set downe a more familiar example of an ancient and <note place="margin">A remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble speech of an old hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lady.</note> honourable Lady of blessed memorie. My eares heard her call the Scripture the charter of our heauenly inheritance, because we haue no right to heauen but only by the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses contained in the Scriptures of God. No man wil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to haue their charter rest out of their hande. If any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficil question arise by reading of it, they will send for a wise Lawier, and seeke resolution at him, but they will assuredly keepe and reade their owne charter. Euen so (saith the foresaid nobleLady) Gods people should not haue bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from reading the holy Scriptures of God, the very true charter of their heauenly inheritance.</p>
                        <p>This written word is the shepherds staffe of Christ, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are comforted in our life &amp; vpholden euen when wee <note place="margin">Scriptures belong to the sheepe of Christ as their proper treasure.</note> walke through the shadowe of death, Psal. 23. ver. 4. Which staffe Christe holdeth in his hande, not for his owne sake as other shepherdes doe, to rest vpon it, and to relieue their owne infirmitie, but onely for our sake who are sheepe of the sheepfold of Christe to guide vs by it, to correct our wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wayes, and to holde vs in decent order. Therefore of all things in the worlde, let vs count Scripture a thing most pertinent to vs, according to the saying of MOSES, the secret thinges belong vnto the Lorde our God, but the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled belong to vs and our children for euer, that wee may doe all the wordes of this Lawe, Deut. 29. ver. 29. to wit, the
<pb facs="tcp:18670:54"/>
Lawe written, as is clearely declared, Deut. 27. ver, 2: and 3. <hi>When thou shalt passe ouer Iorden into the lande which the Lord thy God giueth thee, thou shtli set up great stones and plaster them with plaster, and Shelt witte upon them all the wordes of this Lawe.</hi> &amp;c. Now if the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> word be that very portion that belonged properly to our fathers, to vs, &amp; to our children, we should sticke as fast to it as euer NABOTH did to his vineyarde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>bring euer these words of MOSES. Things that are reuei led (to wit in writ) pertaine to vs, &amp; to our children for euer.</p>
                        <p>According to the patterne of this written word were al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations <note place="margin">Reformation of religion made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Written word</note> of religion made, &amp; not according to the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine report of traditions. IOSIAS made reformation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the booke of the couenant that was founde in the house of the Lord, 2. Reg. cap. 23. ver. 2. And therefore this worde of God ought diligently to be kept as the very patterne of all true reformation in religion, if any abuse fall out at any time. In our natiue countrie men are not so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by diligent custodie to keep other measures as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure whereby all other measures in the lande are measured, one towne hath the weightes, another hath the jug, the third hath the furlot, another hath the el-wand: these are diligently kept, because that bythem all faulty measures are corrected and reformed: so aboue all things in this worlde, the holy Scriptures should be most diligently kept.</p>
                        <p>Now before I speake of humane traditions the very end wherefore the Apostles committed to write the summe of <note place="margin">The cause wherfore the Apostles put in write the summe of their doctrin.</note> their wholesome doctrine is a sore prejudice to tradition. For some persons who hearde the Apostles preach went from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Antiochia,</hi> and troubled the hearts of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> saying, that they behooued to be circumcised, and keepe the <hi>Law</hi> of MOSES, to whome the Apostles gaue no such commandement, Actes 15. Therefore the Apostles tooke occasion to put in write the summe of their doctrine Nowe if tradition was not a faithfull keeper of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke doctrine in the very dayes of the Apostles and in the <note place="margin">Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the word traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> mouthes of them who heard the Apostles preach with their owne eares, howe shall wee leane vnto the vncertaintie of traditions after the issue of sixteene hundreth yeeres.</p>
                        <p>The generalitie of the worde tradition is an occasion of
<pb facs="tcp:18670:55"/>
errour to many: for so soone as this word soundeth in their eares, incontinent they thinke that all things necessarie vnto eternall life is not contained in Scripture, but the want of Scripture must be supplied by traditions, yet the Apostle calleth the very articles of our faith traditions, namely that Christ died for our sinnes, that he was buried and that he rose the third day againe, 1.

Iren. lib. 3. cap. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; cap. 3. Yet was it not IRENEVS purpose to prooue any thing repugnant to scripture.</p>
                        <p>The traditions which they reade of in other fathers, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be bound to keepe them, it is they themselues who <note place="margin">Papists will not binde themselues in all points to old traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> leane vnto them as a necessarie supplement of the want that is in scripture, but they themselues will not be bound to the obseruation of them all, but haue let many of them goe out of vse, such as praying betweene <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsonday</hi> not vpon their knees, but standing on their feete to put them in remembrance of Christes resurrection: such like, three dippings in water, whereof wee spake in the heade of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.

                        <p>To drawe vnto an ende of this treatise.

For answere vnto this question, we shall distinguish the worlde into three ages, and speake of the force of tradition in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery age Godwilling. In the first age of the world from ADAM to the flood of NOE tradition had the greater place, because the Worde' of God was not as yet written, but God spake by Oracles to ADAM, and that which the Lorde spake to him hee deliuered it by faithfull tradition to his poste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ritie.

First they were indued with the spirite of prophecie, for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAM prophecied of secret things that were done when hee was sleeping, Gen. 2 ver. 23 And HENOCH the seuinth from ADAM prophecied in the first age of the world of things that are to be done in the last age of the world, Epist. Iud ver. 14. 15. And LAMECH prophecied of his sonne NOAH, Gen. 5. Beside this, God bestowed vpon these fathers long life, so that ADAM liued vntill he deliuered the Oracle of God spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto him to HENOCH, and HENOCH liued till he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the same to LAMECH, and LAMECH to NOE, so that NOE needed not to bee in doubte whether the reporte of his fathers concerning the Oracle spoken to ADAM was true or not, because it was conueied to him by the handes of faithfull witnesses of vnsuspect credite, yea, holie Prophets deliuered the holie Oracle of GOD to NOE and holie Prophct of GOD also as they were. <note place="margin">In the Second age,</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the second age of the world, it pleased God to register
<pb facs="tcp:18670:57"/>
his blessed will in write in the dayes of MOSES, and then tradition was nothing else but a page and handmaide to the written worde of God. For true it is that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded fathers to tell their posteritie the wonderful works of God in slaying the first borne of <hi>Egypt</hi> and sparing the first borne of the <hi>I ewes,</hi> Exod. 13. ver. 8. yet this tradition of fathers to their children was agreable to the word of God written by MOSES, in so far that the posteritie beleeued not the writings of MOSES, because they were agreable to the report of their fathers, but rather the reporte of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, because it was agreable to the worde of God written by MOSES: and so tradition in this age was a page and handmaide to the written worde of God, neither doe wee reade after the worde was written that God commanded fathers to tell anything to their children that was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly contained in the written word of God.</p>
                        <p>In the last age of the world we should be more attentiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">In the last age.</note> addicted to the written worde, and lesse to tradition, in regard the Apostles were moued to put the summe of their most wholesome doctrine in write, because their doctrine was not rightly reported, euen by those who heard the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles teach as said is. And if the writing of the summe of their wholesome doctrine was a remedie deuised by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselues against false traditions &amp; wrong reports of Apostolicke doctrine, what injurie doe we to the <hi>Romaine</hi> Church when we examine al their traditions by the rule of the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> word, &amp; that which is not agreable to the written word, wee reject it, as a doctrine neither catholicke nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicke, because that it is found light when it is weighed in the just balance of the written word of God. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider howe damnable an inclination is in this our corrupt nature. When God reueiled his blessed will by tradition men were not attentiue to it, but preferred their lust vnto the will of God reueiled by tradition: for the sonnes of God saw the daughters of men that they were faire, and tooke wiues vnto themselues whome they liked, Gen 6. ver 2. And on the other parte when God will needes reueile his blessed will by the written word, then will wee flie to vn

Beside this, wee are to consider what great detriment hath ensued vpon those who leauing the certaintie of the written worde, leaned vpon the vncertaintie of Apostolicke traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Now to the ende that the poore handful of the sheepe of Christ may be saued from the deceite of the Antichrist, hee exhorteth them to adhere fast vnto the Apostolicke doctrine which they had receiued both by word and write.

(as a learned Pastor said) it is so farre from arming him against the cold, that it encreaseth his shuddering and grwing, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so this excuse vtterly vndoeth their cause: they say God would not haue suffered his visible Church to haue erred so many yeeres, but the Apostle PAVL saith otherwise, that <hi>the Spirit speak th euidently that in the latter times some shal depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the faith:</hi> so that it is not a wonderfull thing to see apostasie fall out in the bowels of the visible Church, and the golden calfe to be worshipped by carnal <hi>israclites,</hi> Exod. 32. But it is a wonderful thing indeede to see sinceritie of doctrine and puritie of maners to continue long among the very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Church: so prone and bent is the world to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that sometime the ordinarie watchmen cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare where Christ is, whom the soule of the Church loueth, Cant. 3. ver. 3.</p>
                        <p>Secondly consider that the doctrine of prohibition of meates and mariage is called a defection from the faith &amp; a doctrine of deuils.

To this I answere that the fathers are not to be balanced with the Papistes of our dayes in the opinion of meates and mariage: for many causes: first, because the fathers of the first 300. yeeres made no lawes and constitutions to astrict the consciences of men in matters of meate and mariage as the Papists of late dayes haue done. The Councill of <hi>Ancyra</hi> (which is a towne in <hi>Galatia)</hi> clearely manifesteth vnto vs what was the custom of the ancient Church, in admitting men to ecclesiasticke offices, namely this. If a man in time of his ordination did protest that he had not the gift of continencie, but that hee was purposed to marrie, and after his ordination, hee <hi>maried a wife,</hi> hee remained still in his ministetie. But so many as in time of imposition of handes did professe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie &amp; abstinence from mariage, if afterward they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried they were debarred from their ministrie, Tom. 1.

                           <p>These two doctrines of the prohibition of meates and mariage are called an apostasie from the faith, and endited by the spirit of errour.

How then is that thing to be counted an apostasie from the faith wherein no matter is touched that pertaineth to the Kingdome of God? To this I answere, that there is a great difference betweene abstinence from meates, and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of meates: for these whose conscience is weake will abstaine from many meates, and content themselues with hearbes, Rom. 14 ver. 2. as it were contenting themselues with the foode of the beastes rather then that their mouth should eat that thing that should perturbe their conscience: but such men as take vpon them authoritie to forbid to eate meates that are created by God to the vse of men, they vsurpe authoritie ouer the conscience of men, binding where God hath loosed, &amp; loosing where God hath bound, and mixing heauen and earth through other, as if men on earth should haue such absolute soueraignitie ouer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, euen as the God ofheauen hath. This is called an apostasie from the faith, not because all defection is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in this, but because all defection is grounded in this one point, to set a mortal man in the chaire of God, &amp; to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribut vnto him such absolut souerainitie ouer ourco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>science as God had ouer the conscience of ADAM, Gen. 3. as mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable experience hath clearely manifested in the Popedom.

yea, in other heades of their doctrine concerning the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie and death of Christ, they were so blasphemous that in the worde <hi>putativÃ© natus, mamfestatus, mortuus,</hi> they were the very aduocats of the deuill, lren. lib 3. <hi>advÃ©rsus Valent.</hi> cap. 20. &amp; 39. But in the Popish church the lawes forbidding mariage to some men, and meates at sometimes are so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured with appearance of holynes, that the forgers of such lawes in hypocrisie had neede to be pointed out by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God in his worde, to the ende that no maske nor visard put vpon vngodlinesse should peruert the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of men.

No doubt but the Apostle here setteth downe as two opposit things God &amp; man, God creating, blessing &amp; permitting the vse of created &amp; blessed creatures to man with thanksgiuing. And on the other part arrogant fellowes starting vp &amp; correcting the wisdome of God, &amp; saying, albeit God hath giuen liberty to eate of such &amp; such meates with thanksgiuing, yet for many causes such libertie must be restrained, &amp; eating of flesh on <hi>Fryday</hi> must be as great a sin as the eating of the forbidden tree.

                           <p>Next it is to be marked in the wordes of the Apostle to <note place="margin">Arrogancie mixed with foolishnesse.</note> whom belongeth the vse of the creatures of God namely to the belceuers only.

It is not eating of flesh that will defile vs, but rather fleshly affections of an heart that is not renued by faith, that defileth a man, as our master Christ speaketh. <hi>That thing that entreth into the mouth defileth not the man, but that which commeth out of the heart.</hi> Marke 7. ver. 18.

As if a corpulent foole sweating and blowing into an hote sommer day should take vp his staffe, and beate his owne <note place="margin">Similitude.</note> shadow, yet is not his shadow the cause of his grieuance, but the fatnesse of his owne belly: euen so foolish men are afraid to be polluted with meates, but indeede it is the foolishnes of an vnbeleeuing heart that polluteth a man.

                           <p>Now consider whether or not the spirit hath spoken eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and giuen a cleare warning to the last age to beware <note place="margin">The last age of the worlde more senslesse then the first.</note> of false teachers: yet is the last age more senslesse then the first age of the world that was drowned with a flood of waters. God spake not in secret but openly to NOE the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous preacher, Gen. 6. and God spake not onely by word, but also in deede by the building of the Arke, Heb. 11. ver. 7. yet would not the first age take warning, but liued in deepe securitie, and was drowned with waters. But the last age of the world is more benummed then the first age was. In the last age the spirit speaketh euidently, but men will not heare: the spirit ordaineth this prediction to be written, but men will not reade nor ponder, nor vnderstand the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of the spirit: the spirit pointeth out by the finger of his word who are the deceiuers of whome we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, to wit, men who teach a doctrine of deuils, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mariage and meates which God hath created for the vse of man with thanksgiuing. For all this threefold war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in worde, in write, and in particular demonstration, yet the last age cannot hearken to the warnings of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath determined to destroy the most part of them, as he did the vncorrigible sonnes of ELI, who would not hearken to the counsell of their father, 1.

                           <p>It may nowe bee objected, hath the Apostle PAVL sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde onely the hypocrisie of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Antichrist in the <note place="margin">Both blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie and hypocrisie in the matter of mariage and meats is condemned by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.</note> matter of mariage and meates? and is there nothing fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told anent these ancient Heretiques, specially <hi>Encratitae</hi> &amp; <hi>Manichaei,</hi> who vttered and dispersed in the world a doctrine of deuils, that it was a sinne to eate flesh, that wine was the gall of the Prince of darkenesse, that mariage was an euill thing, and a meane to bring in captiuitie a parte of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the good God, namely the soule, within the bands of the substance of the prince of darkenesse, that is, within the body, hath the Spirit of God (I say) foretolde nothing of these vile heresies in this prediction?

And this commeth to passe whensoeuer the heauie hande of God is laide vpon a familie, vpon a towne, or vpon a countrie, in the very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie hinging ouer their heades, there is a secret voyce of God calling them to humiliation and repentance with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and abstinence from all lawfull pleasures: &amp; when the Priest bloweth the trumpet in <hi>Sion,</hi> and sanctifieth a fast vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, he layeth not the yocke of mens commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon the consciences of men, but the yocke of God's commandements.

                        <p>IT hath bene the custome of godly men in all ages, who were descended from the loynes of godly fathers, not to brag of their parentage, but to be so much the more ashamed of sinne, that the vnreproouable liues of their predecessors were a great testimony cÃ³uicting them of some piece of defection. Therefore the Prophet ISAIAH bringeth in the Lordes penitent people, in humble maner acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that they were not worthy that ABRAHAM and IS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAEL should once knowe them to be their posteritie: but they entreat the Lord by a free forgiuenesse of sinnes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their father, Isa. 63.. 16. But on the other part a wicked generation descended from godly parents could boast of their parentage,' and say to Christ himselfe, ABRAHAM is our father, Iohn 8. ver. 39. and againe. We are not borne of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, wee haue one father, which is God, ibid. ver. 41. Notwithstanding of all this confident bragging of their parents, the Lorde Iesus who judgeth righteously, saith to carnall Iewes. <hi>Yee are of your father the deuill, and the lusts of your father ye will doe. He hath bene a murtherer from the beginning &amp; abode not in the trueth, because there is no trueth in him When he speaketh a lie, then speaketh hee of his owne: for hee is a lyar, and the father thereof,</hi> Iohn 8. ver. 44. This place of scripture will clearely prooue that God will nothing regard the vaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation and vaunting speeches of men who brag of their descent from godly parents, and their succession to godly preachers: yet the dissimilitude of their faith and maners from the faith and maners of their predecessours declareth that they are the very children of the deuill.</p>
                        <p>In this age I find succession whereof the <hi>Romanes</hi> bragge so much to be in some reuerent regard. For IRENEVS Bishop of <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France</hi> reasoning against VALENTINVS &amp; MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CION, whose errours haue beene before declared, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute these Heretiques, hee bringeth in the succession of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Bishops. After PETER (saith he) were LINVS and ANACLETVS, and CLEMENS, and EVARISTVS, and ALEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANDER, and SIXTVS, and TELESPHORVS, and HYGINVS, &amp; PIVS, and ANICETVS, and ELEVTHERIVS the twelfth from the Apostles. Now, saith IRENEVS, these receiued the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb facs="tcp:18670:66"/>
doctrine from the Apostles, and deliuered it faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to others, yea &amp; some of them also sealed it vp withtheir blood. Yet none of them spake such things concerning God the father &amp; his sonne Christ Iesus, as VALENTINVS, MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CION and BASILIDES haue spoken. Therefore he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their doctrine to be false and hereticall, Iren lib. 3. cap. 3. <hi>contra Valent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the followers of the <hi>Romaine</hi> church demand why we do not as reuerently esteeme of the succession of <hi>Romane</hi> Bishops now, as IRENEVS did of old, &amp; why do we not count them to be Heretiques who bring in a new doctrine not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with the doctrine of the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> as IRENEVS counted VALENTINVS, MARCION, and BASILIDES Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, because they vttered a strange doctrine which the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> had not receiued from the handes of the Apostles? To this I answere, that we count reuerently of al the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> who kept faithfully that forme of wholesome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they receiued from the Apostles. Yea and we count them Heretiques also who departe from that veritie which LINVS, ANACLETVS, CLEMENS, and the rest receiued from the Apostles. But the question standeth in this, whether these holy fathers, of whom JRENEVS maketh such reuerent record, receiued from the mouthes of the Apostles, &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the world such heades of doctrine, as are now soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Romaine</hi> church, that is, inuocation of Saints, worshipping of images, pluralitie of mediators, of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, purgatorie and infinite other things. As concerning the Apostles, the summe of their doctrine is contained in their writings, &amp; they taught not LINVS, ANACLETVS, CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENS, otherwise then they taught the rest of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> the <hi>Corinthtans, Galatians, Ephesians,</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Pontus, Cappadocia. Asia, Bithynia,</hi> 1, Pet. 1. And in all their writings <note place="margin">The cause wherefore the successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Romam Bishops was magnified of old.</note> there is no mention of inuocation of Saintes, worshipping of images, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The cause wherefore godly fathers rejoyced in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> was this, because they were nearest to the danger of persecuting tyrants, and kept the faith of Christ most inviolablie. Many of them were martyres: such as ALEXANDER, SIXTVS, TE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESPHORVS,
<pb facs="tcp:18670:66"/>
and ANICETVS. Others were Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, who suffered prisonment, pouertie, and diuerse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rebukes, albeit they were not put to death for the Name of Christ. And what marucll was it, that these who loued Christe had their hearts inflamed with a loue of this holy succession, whose commendation was puritie of wholesome doctrine receiued from the Apostles, whose glory was sufferings, and whose preeminence was exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of constant continuance in the true faith. And like as the dayes of MOSES and IOSVA were happie dayes: they had among them the Tabernacle of God, and therewith also the Arke and propitiatorie, which was the glorious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the Tabernacle: so were the dayes of these holy fathers happie dayes, hauing personall succession from the Apostles, and therewith succession of true doctrine, the glorious ornament of personall succession. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the decretall Epistles falsly ascribed to them, wee shall speake hereafter in the heade of suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie Godwilling. But when all these things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacking for which the succession of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Bishoppes was regarded in this Centurie, and men erring in the true faith of a long time possessed the chaire of <hi>Rome,</hi> what auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it to glorie of that olde commended succession, when the glory of true doctrine, patient suffering, constant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance in the Apostolicke doctrine is vtterly lost among them? so that the succession whereof the <hi>Romaine</hi> Church now glorieth, is not vnlike their transubstantiation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are accidents without a subject: &amp; in their succession are persons of men succeeding one to another without puritie of doctrine.</p>
                        <p>In Scripture we finde succession to be counted of accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatnes of the promises annexed to the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <note place="margin">

And that which was more then all the rest, this succession of DAVID was a line leading to the great King Christ Iesus, who should sit in the throne of his father DAVID, &amp; of his kingdome there should be none end, Luc. 1. for all these causes the succession of DAVID was greatly regarded. Yet it is to be marked that all the promises, othes, testimonies, &amp; honors did not carie with them a necessity, that euery successour of DAVID should be in faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion like vnto DAVID, but rather God foreseeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, faith, <hi>If his ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I suppone that no successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euer had more glorious and ample promises then the succession of DAVID, yet these promises inferred no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie that euery king sitting on the throne of DAVID should bee heire also of the religion and faith of DAVID as well as of his kingdome. And therfore to inferre vpon this ground, that ample promises are made to the Apostles &amp; their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, that euery one who succeedeth to the Apostolick chaire, shall keepe the true faith of the Apostles, it is but a foolish and impertinent conclusion.

yet these two witnesses being Prophets of God doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly prooue, that promises made to LEVI and AARON do not exeeme their succession from error in religion.</p>
                        <p>But marke another circumstance in the ground of this errour of AARONS succession, which was this. God made a promise conditionall, which they supposing to be absolute, tooke libertie to doe what they lifted. The conditions are <note place="margin">

If they feared God &amp; conuerted others from their wicked waies, &amp; kept the key of knowledge, then they should be counted the Ambassadours of the Lord of hostes, but these conditions being broken, &amp; they hauing gone out of the way, &amp; hauing caused many to fall by the law, &amp; hauing broken the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of LEVI, they were so far from being counted the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours of God, that God made them vile before al the people, ver. 9 Yea &amp; the Lord cursed them, &amp; cast doung v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their faces, euen the doung of their solemne feastes, &amp; made them like vnto it, ibid. ver. 3. This was the tragicall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of AARONS successours, who opened one of their eares to heare the promise of God, but closed the other eare from hearing and marking the conditions that were required of them to whom the promise was made.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18670:70"/>
Seeing this promise was not made to PETER onely, but also to all the rest of the Apostles and their successours, then as none of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Bishops can erre in religion, because they are the successours of PETER as they alledge: so in like maner the Bishops of <hi>Ierusalem, Alexandria, Antiochia, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, Philippi, Thessalonica, Corinth,</hi> &amp; diuerse other places are all exeemed from errour, because the Apostles and Euangelists preached and constitute Churches in all-these places, &amp; they are successours to the Apostles in that same sense that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> are successours to PETER. And if none of all these can erre, what priuiledge hath the church of <hi>Rome</hi> aboue all other Churches? Or how can that be performed which was foretolde by the Apostle concerning apostasie that should fall out, &amp; the reuelation of the man of sinne. &amp; childe of perdition, 2. Thess. 2? For all the successours of the Apostles beeing exeemed from error, what place could be giuen to the Antichrist, or what doore could haue bene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to MAHOMET, by whose delusions the Orientall Church hath bene so miserably abused?</p>

They had power by imposition of hands to conferre to others the gift of the holy Spirit, Act, 8 With these extraordinarie giftes they had also extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie prerogatiues, that in teaching the doctrine receiued from Christ, they should not erre. Now these who cal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues successors to the Apostles, they dare not clame to the Apostles immediat calling, nor yet to their extraordinarie gifts, but that which of all the rest was most extraordinarie to the Apostles, viz. to be exeemed from errour in teaching and writing, that is so fast adhered vnto, that it is one of the principal grounds of the <hi>Romaine</hi> faith in our dayes, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot erre in faith and religion. Yea so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate are the Bishoppes of <hi>Rome</hi> of late dayes, that they would climme vp to the highest top and preeminence of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicke dignitie to be exeemed from errour, when as in

                        <p>This proud conceit of Apostolick succession with power of binding and loosing, &amp; exemption from errour, made some of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> so high minded, so vaine and ridiculous, that learned fathers conueened together in Councils, thought their pride more worthie to be receiued with scoffing wordes, then with prolixe refutations.

Euen so if a man set his face toward heauenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he shal finde a number of holy successors of the Apostles in puritie of doctrine, honestie of conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; patience in suffering that shall leade him to Christ, &amp; to heauenly <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> but againe, it is as certaine if a man will set his face Northward to defection, to backsliding and to preferre the traditions of men to the ordinances of God, there shall not inlacke a number of guiders in the roll of personall successours (as they call it) to the Apostles, who shall lead him from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> &amp; from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of God to the valley of <hi>Benhinnon.</hi> Therefore while we are in the way take heed what way our faces are set, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and if they be set to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> let vs followe these sure guides who were true succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours to the Apostles, and they shall indeede leade vs to Christ, to heauenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and to the glory which in heart and minde we waite for, whereunto God lead vs for his Christs sake,</p>

The rest whose names are not expressed, enjoy the crownes of incorruptible glory, as wel as those doe whose names are in all mens mouths. It is the comfort of our hearts to remember that the Apostles and Euangelists sealed vp with their blood the doctrine which they taught, and committed to writ, and no other doctrine, and the holy martyres immediatly after the Apostles dayes sealed vp with the glorious testimonie of their blood that same faith, which we now professe, &amp; which they receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the hands of the Apostles, but they were not so prodigall of their liues to giue their blood for the doctrine of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of images, inuocation of Saints, plurality of mediators, of intercession, the sacrifice of the Masse both propitiatory and vnbloody, expresly against the wordes of the Apostle, Heb. 9. ver. 22. and such other heades of doctrine vnknown to antiquitie.

The fauour that this Emperour shewed to Christians against whom the very sloobering cookes did contend challenging vnto themselues the right of a place whereinto Christians were accustomed to conueene for exercise of diuine seruice, this fauour, I say, seemeth to haue proceeded from the coun sell of MAMMEA his Christian mother, rather then from the counseli of VLPIANVS that renowmed lawyer an hatefull aduersarie to Christians.

A man of base parentage, of an huge stature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to honours by ALEXANDER, who nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished a serpent in his owne bosome (as the prouerbe spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) when he aduanced MAXIMINVS an ingrate foster to great dignities and honours. For by his meanes the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie killed ALEXANDER, and his mother MAMMEA, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him and his sonne Emperours without aduise of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Senat: a man hated of all good men, beloued of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill men, more grieuous to the citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> then to their enemies, Bucolc. Index Chron. who for hatred of the house of ALEXANDER (as EVSEBIVS recordeth) raised vp the sixt persecution against Christians, specially against the teachers and leaders of the Church, thinking the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to vanquish the rest if the Captaines and guiders of them were made out of the way, Euseb. eccl. hist. lib 6. cap. 28.</p>
                        <p>ORIGEN at this time wrote a booke <hi>de martyrio,</hi> and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to AMBROSIVS &amp; PROTECTETVS a preaching elder of the Church of <hi>Casarea:</hi> because these two vnder this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution <note place="margin">Origen <hi>wrote a booke</hi> de marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</note> had susteined great afflictions, and constantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuered in the true faith, Eusebilib 6. cap. 28. No persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was more violent, no persecution endured shorter time. In no persecution are the names of suffering mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs so obscured and couered with silence possibly because the booke of Origen <hi>de martyrio</hi> through injurie of time is not to be found, therefore some learned men do referre the martyrdome of such as wee haue spoken of in the dayes of ALEXANDER to this time, or to the persecution of DECIVS. I will not dispute of such doubtsome things. Three other things that are more necessarie to the edification of the Church I will touch. First the malice of the deuill, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb facs="tcp:18670:74"/>
the welfare of the sheepfolde of Christ, and laboureth <note place="margin">The malice of Satan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst true 'Pastors.</note> either to spoyle it of true Pastours, or to send in among the poore sheepe hyrelings, and men not regarding the well of the flocke, but their owne gaine: or clse, if they haue true pastours, to mooue the flocke to be disobedient to faithfull and vigilant Pastors. The flocke that can eschew all these three snares of the deuill, and all these three wofull calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties so oft seasing vpon the poore sheepesolde, they are in good estate. Reade CHRYSOSTOME writing vpon the 13. chap Heb. ver. 17. Another thing is worthie to be marked, that in three great persecutions, in the fift, sixt and seuenth, ORIGEN a man more renowmed in his lifetime then after his death, God vouchsafed vpon him two great honours, but not the third, whereof he was most of all desirous. He encouraged his father LEONIDES, and his disciples, PLVTAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHVS, two SERENI, HERON &amp; HERACLIDES patiently to fuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer martyrdome in the dayes of SEVERVS. Next he wrote a booke <hi>de martyrio</hi> in the daies of MAXIMINVS the sixt perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter, whereby doubtlesse many were incouraged patienly <note place="margin">Origen <hi>got not the honor of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
                           </note> to suffer euill for Christs sake. What remaineth now but the third &amp; principal honour of martyrdom it selfe, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he had a bent desire in the daies of DECIVS the 7 perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but then he fainted, as shall be declared hereafter God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing? When we call to minde this weaknes of ORIGEN, let all the cogitations of our heartes stoupe, and thinke that wee are not meete for great things, but if the Lorde call vs to suffer great things for his Names sake, the Lorde perfite his strength in our infirmitie and weakenesse. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let vs marke the great difference that is betweene the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the booke of holy canonicke &amp; sacred Scripture, &amp; all other bookes whatsoeuer. In Scripture the ouerpassing of maters of great importance and moment is not for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, misknowledge or doubting of those things that are ouerslidden, but for mysterie and representation of things <note place="margin">Difference betwixt holy scripture and other bookes.</note> more necessarie to be knowne, as namely when MOSES a most accurat writer of the life, death &amp; genealogies of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Patriarches, yet hee ouerpasseth the description of the genealogie, death &amp; beginning of the life MELCHISEDECK this was done of purpose to bring in MELCHISEDECK:
<pb facs="tcp:18670:75"/>
as a type and figure of the true king of peace Christ Icsus, as the Apostle declareth, Heb. 7. but among ecclesiasticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I finde a preterition of the names of these worthy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours who were martyred for the cause of Christ in the sixt persecution, and this ouerpassing with silence so weightie a matter, is a secret confession of ignorance in this part of the historie, together with a doubting, whether VRBANVS the first, VALERIANVS, TIBVRTIVS, CECILIA, and MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINA suffered vnder ALEXANDER, or vnder MAXIMINVS, or vnder DECIVS. Yea PLATINA writeth it was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of some men that VRBANVS 1. was martyred in the persecution of DIOCLETIAN. I haue insisted at greater length in this purpose to the end that euery man may giue vnto sacred scripture that reuerence that is due vnto it, but other writings let vs reade them with judgement, for assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly there is palpable weakenes into them.

NEMESION was accused in <hi>Alexandria</hi> as a companion of brigants, and was punished with stripes and fire vnto the death with greater seueritie then any brigant, albeit his innocencie was sufficiently knowne. AMMON, ZENON, PTOLEMEVS, INGENVVS, THEOPHILVS warriours and knights standing by the tribunall seate beckened with their hands to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine weake Christian, who for feare was readie to incline and fall, that hee should continue constant, and stepped to the bench, and professed themselues to be Christians. This dayly increasing courage of Christians, who were emboldened by the multitude of sufferings astonished and terrified the Iudges, Euseb, lib. 6. cap. 41. ISCHYRION was slaine by his owne master. The number of martyres in <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> of whome DIONYSIVS in his epistle written to FABIVS Bishop of <hi>Antiochia</hi> maketh mention, clearely testifieth that if the names of all those who suffered martyrdome in the townes of <hi>Rome, Carthage, Antiochia, Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> were particularly set down, ouer and beside others who suffered in other townes of <hi>Asia, Africke</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> subject to the dominion of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Emperour, it were not possible in the volume of a litle booke to comprehend them all. For mine owne part I presume not to do it, but I reuerence the painfull trauelles of learned men who haue dipped deepely into such a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full subject, specially the writer of the booke of martyres. Onely I find somethings in this seuenth persecution, which the principall purpose wherefore I haue collected this compend will not permit mee to passe ouer with silence. Namely these: first, let no man thinke that the veritie is weake, and hath neede to bee strengthened by a <note place="margin">The veritie hath no neede to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped with lies,</note> lie, as NICEPHORVS is accustomed to doe.

But NICEPHORVS the father of many other fables also saith, that they fell on sleepe, in which they continued till the time of THEODOSIVS, that is, from the 250 vntill the 379. yeere of our Lord, and then they did awake out of their sleepe saith NICEPHORVS, lib. 5. cap. 27. But he who will giue hastie credite to NICEPHORVS fables, writing of the 7. martyres, who lurked in a caue of mount <hi>Caelius</hi> and to EVAGRIVS description of BARSANVPHIVS an <hi>Egyptian</hi> monke, who enclosed himselfe in a cottage beside <hi>Gaza</hi> for the space of 50. yeeres, and vsed no kinde of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreshment to sustaine his earthly tabernacle, he may be easily led to all kinde of errour. The second thing worthy to be marked, is, that many persecuted preachers had wiues and children, as the historie clearely recordeth. CHERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON B. of a citie in <hi>Egypt</hi> called <hi>Nilus</hi> fled to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of <hi>Arabia,</hi> accompanied with his wife, and returned not againe to <hi>Egypt,</hi> neither was hee seene of those who sought him in the wildernesse, Euseb. lib. 6. cap, 42, DIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NYSIVS <note place="margin">Maried Bishops.</note> B. of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who miraculously escaped the crueltie of persecuters, maketh expresse mention of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Deo mthi ut migrarem praecipiente, viÃ¡nque mirabiliter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periente, ego &amp; liberi, &amp; multi fratres egressi sumus,</hi> that is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that God had commanded me to remooue, and had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously opened a passage vnto mee, I and my children, and brethren went forth, Euseb. lib. 6. cap. 40. If antiquitie be regarded, Bishops who doe marie, are not <hi>Nicolaitan</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, but rather such as forbid to marie teach a doctrine of deuils, 1, Tim cap. 4. ver. 3.

The great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations that were made in the worlde about this time by the plague of pestilence the Hethnickes imputed the cause of them to the Christians.

ASTYRIVS a noble Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour caried the body of this holy martyr MARINVS vpon his own shoulders and buried it honourably. Euseb. ibid. cap. 16.

                        <p>This fearful captiuity of VALERIAN had into it a notable testimony of the wrath of God against persecuters. For like as he trampled vnder his feet the Church of Christ: so
<pb facs="tcp:18670:78"/>
in like manner the Lord gaue his necke and backe to bee trampledvpon by the feete of his enemies. This example of Gods heauie indignation somewhat terrified GALLIENVS his son, and hee gaue out an edict, for the fafe returning of such as were banished, to their own dwelling p aces, and for staying the rage of persecution. Euseb. lib. 7. cap. 13.

                        <p>The good cariage of Christians at this time is worthie to be marked, who were full of charitie &amp; loue, and visited the sicke, &amp; did all offices of humanitie to those, who were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased or dead: whereas the <hi>Pagans</hi> by the contrarie forsooke their dearest friends, left them comfortlesse, and thrust out such as were halfe deade vnto the streetes, &amp; left them there vuburied, &amp; to be eaten with dogs. This is written in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of DIONYSIVS insert in the historie of Euseb. lib. 7. cap. 21 &amp; 22. so great difference is betweene Christians trained vp in the schoole of Christ, &amp; others, who haue not bene fed with the sincere milke of the worde.

DIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLETIAN and MAXIMIANVS HERCVLEVS abstained from persecuting of Christians vntill the 19 yeere of their reigne. Before I touch the historie of the tenth persecution three things are to be premitted. First, that after the persecution of VALERIAN the 8. persecuter, the Church enjoyed great peace, which albeit it was like to be cut off by the altered minde of AVRELIAN, yet the wise dispensation of the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God prouided that all his cruell enterprises were disappointed. <hi>The righteous Lord cutted the cords of the wicked,</hi> Psal. 129. ver. 4. Secondly Christians were in great fauour and credite with Emperours, and to them was committed the gouernement of Prouinces and nations, as clearely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the preferment of DOROTHEVS and GORGONIVS. Thirdly they had libertie to builde oratories and temples, large and ample in euery citie, Euseb eccl. hist. lib. 8. cap. <note place="margin">

All this came to passe in the fourtie yeeres peace that interueened betweene the reigning of VALERIAN, and the nineteenth yeere of the reigne of DIOCLETIAN. Yet the Church of Christ in this shorte time beganne to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered with the corrupt maners of carnall and fleshly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so that contentions abounded, but charitie waxed cold in the Church of God. Euseb. ibid.

DIOCLETIAN was puft vp in pride for his manifolde victories and triumphes, and would bee counted a God, &amp; adorned his shoes with gold &amp; precious stones, &amp; commanded the people to kisse his feet. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution continued 10 yeeres, euen vntill the seuenth yeere of the reigne of CONSTANTINE the great.

Crnell edicts and proclamations were set foorth in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this persecution, commanding to ouerthrow &amp; cast to the ground the temples of Christians, to burne the bookes of holy scripture, to displace all such as were magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats and were in office, and to cast Christian Bishops into prison, and to compell them with sundrie kinds of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to offer vnto Idoles. Also common people, who would not renounce the profession of Christianitie to bee spoyled of their libertie, Euseb. lib. 8 cap 3. These edicts were hastely put in execution. Many Christians were scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, racked, &amp; cruciated with intollerable torments. Some were violently drawne to impure sacrifice, and as though they had sacrificed, when indeede they did not, were let go: some were cast downe vpon the ground, and drawne by the legges a great space, and the people was made to beleeue, that they had sacrificed: some stoutly withstood them, and denied with a loude voice that they had bene, or euer would be partakers of idolatrie.

The said two Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours set foorth edictes in fauour of the Christians: and MAXIMINVS rather fearing CONSTANTINE then louing God, began in his bounds also to stay the rage of cruell persecution, as the letter written to his Deputie SABINVS clearely declareth, Euseb. lib. 9. cap. 9. But incontinent after hee altered his minde and set foorth <note place="margin">Maximinus <hi>was ouercome in battel by</hi> Licinius.</note> newe commandements to persecute the Christians.

After this he killed and put to death those enchanters and deceiuers who had bewitched him all his dayes, and had put him in esperance of victorie in his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell foughten against LICINIVS, and shortly after op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with a certaine disease, glorified the God of the Christians, and made a most absolute lawe for the safetie and preseruation of them.

Which lamentable fact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reported to him, hee was nothing mooued therewith, neither abstained hee any white from his wonted sinnes. The people of <hi>Rome</hi> beeing wearie of his villanie sent to CONSTANTINE for aide, who gathered an armie in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Brittaine</hi> to represse this Tyrant: to whome when hee approched, hee feared MAXENTIVS charmes (wherewith hee was supponed to haue vanquished SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERVS, whome GALERIVS MAXIMINVS had sent against him before) and stood in doubt what to <note place="margin">Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>seeth the similitud of a bright crosse inhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>

But LICINIVS failing of his purpose conuerted his rage against the Christians, notwithstanding he had set out edicts before to procure their peace.

But nowe to performe a part of that which I promised in the end of my treatise of Antiquitie, and to let euery man see what vnlearned Asses they haue bene who haue set foorth the fained decretall epistles of the fathers of this age. In the epistle written by CAIVS to the Bishop FE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIX aboue-mentioned he saith, <hi>If any man, of what dignitie so. euer he be, delate such persons</hi> (viz. Bishops, Elders, Deacons) <hi>for faultes that cannot bee prooued, let him vnderstand that by the authoritie of this constitution he shall be counted infamous.</hi> This constitution hath three partes: First: that no ecclesiasticall person should be accused before a secular Iudge. Secondly if any accusation be intended against Bishop, Elder of Deacon it should be qualified by sufficient probation. Thirdly if the accuser succumbe in probation, he should be counted infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous how eminent so euer his dignitie and estate shall be. The compiler of this supposititious decretall epistle had no consideration of the time whereinto CAIVS liued. It was a time of persecution, Christian Bishops were continually drawne before seculare Iudges, &amp; accused of odious crimes wherof they were most innocent: &amp; CAIVS himself was compelled to lurke a long time in a subterraneal caue.

Func. in Chron. lib. 6. Likewise he was present at the Councill in <hi>Arabia</hi> gathered against BERYLLVS B. of <hi>Bostra,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that Christ was existent before his manifestation in the flesh, and by the trauelles of ORIGEN BERYLLVS was reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and reduced to the true faith: therefore I reckone him not into the roll of Heretiques, Euseb lib. 6. cap. 33. FIRMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIANVS B. of <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> inuited ORIGEN to come to <hi>Cappadocia</hi> where he deteined him a long time. Likewise MAMMEA, the mother of ALEXANDER the Emperour, sent for him to come to <hi>Antiochia,</hi> and had him in reuerent regarde. Likewise hee wrote to the Emperour PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIP, and to his mother who was the first Emperour that

professed the Name of Christ, Ierom. <hi>catal. script. eccl.</hi> He stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to be acquainted with the Hebrew language, farre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the custome of his own nation: &amp; he conferred the Hebrewe text with the Greeke translations, not onely the <hi>Septuagints,</hi> but also the translations of AQVILA, THEOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION and SYMMACHVS, and hee found out the fift, sixt and seuenth editions, Euseb. lib. 6. cap. 17. Ierom <hi>catal. scrip. eccles.</hi> Notwithstanding of all these excellent gifts and renoumed fame of ORIGEN, he wanted not his owne grosse errours &amp; foolish facts. In expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ding of scripturs he became a curious searcher out of allegories.

No learned man hath commended this fact of ORIGEN so far as my reading can extend, for if a man might lawfully dismember his own body, to the end that he might liue chastly, why might not a man in like maner cut off his owne hand, to the ende hee should not in hastie motion of anger kil his neighbour? But the obedience of the commandements of God is seated in the heart, and more commended for voluntarie subjection, then for necessity of abstinence of committing euil, because there is not an instrument in the body able to commit transgression. Finally by seeking of diuinitie without the bounds of the holy scriptures of God, in stead of true diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie he was intangled with foolish errours, anent the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many worlds, one succeeding to another, anent the paines of deuils and wicked men after long torments to be finished, and anent the possibilitie of mans nature to keepe the whole law of God.

In <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was NAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISSVS, against whome wicked men banded themselues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with forged accusations and false testimonies sealed vp with othes and imprecations to grieue the heart of NAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISSVS, in so much that he left his calling, and fledde to the wildernesse where he Iurked a long time. But the false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses who bare testimony against him escaped not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of God: One of them and his whole familie and substance was burned with sudden fire: another of them was stricken with an heauie disease, such as hee himselfe in his imprecation had wished vnto himselfe: the third was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the sight of the judgements of God that lighted vpon the other two, and hee repented and powred out the griefe of his dolorous heart in such aboundance of teares that hee became blinde. All these false witnesses were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, Euseb. lib 6. cap 9. and hee who was penitent, albeit the Lorde pardoned his sinne, yet hee chastised him with temporal punishments.

For the two great wheeles of the cart of the deuill, whereby hee carieth men headlong to hell are presumption and desperation: &amp; mercilesse NOVATVS taching a doctrine that strengthened not the knees of the weake, he did what in him lay to moue sinners to despare.

I reade of no heresie preceeding the heresie of ARRIVS and EVTYCHES that continued longer time in the Church of God then the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of NOVATVS, partly because it crept in vnder pretence of zeale to the glory of God, and vnder pretence of a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of sin: partly also, because the <hi>Novatian</hi> Heretiques in the question concerning the diuinitie of Christ were comformable to the opinion of the true Church, Sozom. lib. 7. cap. 12.

No man dare presume to say that in God there are three distinct substances, therefore SABELLIVS and his adherents saide that there were not three distinct subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences or persons in the Godhead, but the three names of Father, Sonne and holy Ghost were giuen to one person al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanerly, but pointed not out distinction of persons or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences in the Godhead, Ruffin. hist. lib. 1. cap. 29.

                        <p>In the reigne of GALLIENVS, and about the yeere of our Lord 264, a certaine Bishop in <hi>Egypt</hi> called NEPOS be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne <note place="margin">Nepotiani.</note> to affirme that at the latter day the godly should rise before the wicked, and should liue with Christ heere in the earth a thousand yeeres in aboundance of all kinde of delicate earthly pleasures.

He ascribed not sinne to the free wil of man and his voluntarie defection from the estate of his first creation, but to necessitie, because mans body was made of the substance of the prince of darkenesse. This was that heresie wherewith AVGVSTINE was infected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his conuersion, but the Lord who brought foorth light out of darknes, &amp; made PAVL, sometime a persecnter, to be a preacher of his Gospell, and CYPRIAN a sorcerer to bee a worthy preacher and martyre: this same gratious Lord (I say) in the multitude of his vnspeakable compassions drewe AVGVSTINE out of this filthie mire of abominable heresie, and made him like vnto a bright starre sending foorth the beames of light to the comfort of Gods house. The opinion of MANES anent the creation of the world, and the creation of man, the manifestation of Christ in our nature rather in shewe and appearance then in veritie, and the horrible abomination of their vile Eucharist, no man can be ignorant of these things who hath read but a litle of the bookes of AVGVSTINE written against the <hi>Manicheans.</hi> In ende like as MANES exceeded all the rest of the Heretiques in madnesse of foolish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions: euen so the Lorde pointed him out among all the rest to be a a spectacle of his wrath and vengeance.

First, hee thinketh that the soules of men who haue liued a very honest and vnreproouable life, when they depart out of their bodies, they goe to a place of vnspeakable happinesse. Secondly he thinketh that the soules of men who haue continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to incorrigible wickednesse, they goe to a place called
<pb facs="tcp:18670:100"/>
                           <hi>Tartarus</hi> there to be punished with endlesse paines. These two foresaide opinions PLATO by his trauelling to <hi>Egypt</hi> (where the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> had remained a long time) might haue learned, to wit, that the soules of good men goe to heauen, and the soules of euill men goe to hell. But PLATO thought by Philosophie to mend the want that was in ancient Theologie, and he deuised a third place wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to soules should be both tried and purged, and after suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of paines should be set at libertie, namely the soules of men who had heauily grieued their parents &amp; afterward repented, or had committed filthie murthers, and afterward repented, these mens soules (I say) according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of PLATO, behooued to goe through infernall floods, specially through <hi>Acheron, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These beginnings of PLATOES conceites had neuer hurt Christian religion, if CLEMENS ALEXANDRINVS, and after him ORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEN had not mingled prophane Philosophie with Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. But when the question is riped vp to the very ground, the defenders of Purgatorie fire &amp; worshipping of reliques haue cause to be ashamed, as disciples of <hi>Pagans,</hi> and not of the holy Apostles, in these two points of doctrine.</p>
                        <p>The foolishnes of CLEMENS and ORIGEN hath beene <note place="margin">Foolish bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing.</note> very pernicious to the Church of God, because they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed not from PLATO siluer and golde, as the <hi>Iowes</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> by warrant of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Exod. 11. but they borrowed chaffe and doung, lies and fables, which some time spreading, sometime growing, sometime altering the first similitude fashioned in the combes of PLATO, in end became an article of Popish faith, and was so straitly vrged, that they who would not beleeue the fained fire of Purgatorie were burned as Heretiques with true flammes of tormenting fire.</p>
                        <p>AMBROSE and HILARIVS as foolishly followed the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ORIGEN without examining it in the balance of <note place="margin">Foolish fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</note> holy scripture. Ambros. in Psal. 118. saith that all men must goe through the fire at the latter day, euen IOHN himselfe the belooued disciple of Christ, of whose death also some
<pb facs="tcp:18670:100"/>
doubted, yet no man can doubt of his passing through the fire. Thus AMBROSE suffered this opinion of ORIGEN to sincke into his heart, as though it had beene the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Oracle of God, which no man should call in question. HILARIVS maketh no exception of the blessed Virgine the mother of our Lord in Psa. <hi>118,</hi> but she must also go through this fire at the latter day. And this is a foolish thing to followe any man further then he doth follow Christ, &amp; the warrant of the written word of God, 1. Cor. 11. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first generall Councill Ann. 551.

                        <p>This <hi>Origenian</hi> errour before it was seriously impugned, it was changed to the worse, and grew neerer to the originall of PLATOES <hi>Phlegeton</hi> againe: for ORIGEN, AMBROSE and <note place="margin">Error grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worse &amp; worse.</note> HILARIVS spake of a fire that should burne at the latter day which al men behooued to passe through before they could enter into the place of refreshment, but PLATO in his dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue <hi>Phedo</hi> spake of a flood of fire whereinto men behoued to bee tried and purged immediatly after their soules were separated from their bodies, and what soules I pray you? Not the soules of the best men which went to heauen, nor the worst men, for they went to hell, but the soules of men that were not into a mid rancke, neither very good nor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry euill.

To this I answere, that besides the authoritie of the fathers aboue specified,
<pb facs="tcp:18670:101"/>
who were entangled with errour, euen they also who found out the opinion of Purgatorie fire to be erroneous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to scripture, yet did they not fully and in all points impugne this false and lying doctrine, but onely in a parte. As namely AVGVSTINE refuteth that part of CLEMENS and ORIGENS opinion wherein they thought that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils and wicked men after suffering of long tormentes may possibly be forgiuen and finde mercy. By one place of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he vtterly vndoeth that opinion, <hi>Depart'vnto the cuerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting fire prepared for Sathan and his angels,</hi> Mat. 25. ver 4 And in the booke of the Reuelation. <hi>And they shall bee tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted night and day for euer and euer,</hi> Apoc. 20, August. lib. 20. &amp; 21. <hi>de civit.

an opinion of our owne satisfactions. For the faultes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by vs after Baptisme, if we do not perfitly satisfie for them before our death, it resteth that in Purgatorie fire we should absolue the rest of our pennance that is vnfulsilled.

The other handmaide preceeding the conceit of Purgatorie, is praier for the dead albeit in all the old and new Testament there be not one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of praying for the deade, or yet offering of sacrifice for the dead. Pardons followed (sometimes called indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences in another sense then now they are) these pardons, I say, are the handmaids following Purgatorie, by which the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> (as absolut commander of Purgatorie) hath made vnto himselfe infinite gaine.</p>

In respect Christ biddeth giue the sacrament with this commandement, <hi>Take, eat,</hi> but dead bodies can neither take nor eate. Alwayes it was carnall affection not ordered with knowledge that mooued friends so to doe. And in our dayes men that are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse and full of affection toward their owne friendes are both timorous and credulous: so timorous, that they feare that their friendes after death should be pined in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: so credulous that they beleeue that the prayers and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes deades of the liuing, their saying of Masses or buying of pardons can helpe the dead, either to mitigat their paine, or to procure vnto them haistie reliefe out of paine. If these two grounds could be remoued, that simple people would not preposterously bee both timorous and credulous, the conceit of Purgatorie would cease.</p>

This proud man called IOAB the Captaine of the hoste, and ABIATHAR the Priest, and the kings sonnes except SALOMON to banket, and by not inuiting to that banket SALOMON and BATHSHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BA his mother, and NATHAN the Prophet, and ZADOCK and BENAIAH, no doubt but hee was minded to bring innocent people vnder the guiltinesse of treason, as their speeches to DAVID clearely declare, that they forsawe this inconuenient, But Iesus Christ is not like vnto ADONIIAH
<pb facs="tcp:18670:102"/>

Surely whomsoeuer the Lord hath loued so dearely, that hee hath purged them from all spot of sinne by his blood, he will not be vncouth to them, by sending them to Purgatorie when they should be inuited to his banket.</p>
                        <p>Now in this disputation of Purgatory fire a solide ground <note place="margin">The vse of temporall paines.</note> is to be laide downe, that euery man may know of what sort of paines after this life we dispute. All paines are either temporall or eternall. Of eternall paines there is no dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this treatise. Temporall paines (say we) are infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vpon men onely in this life for their amendement, if they bee of the number of Gods elect, or else are forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tokens of euerlasting wrath, if they be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the reprobate. For this cause the Apostle saith, that there is no chastisement joyous for the present vntill it bring foorth the good fruite of righteousnesse, Heb. 12. ver 11. And heere hee declareth clearely that temporall chastisements are inflicted vpon the godly for their amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
                        <p>On the other part the prophecie that was in the mouth of ZARESH the wife of HAMAN (albeit grounded onely vpon experience) yet it declareth that the downe-casting of wicked men is a forerunning token of a greater downe cast to followe after, Ester chap. 6. ver. 13. And this is a shorte summe of our opinion anent temporall punishments. But Papistes defend that euen after this life there is tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall punishments in Purgatorie, the suffering where of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth God for off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <pb facs="tcp:18670:103"/>
This opinion of theirs is linked with another absurde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that when out sinnes are freely forgiuen, wee are not <note place="margin">Fault and punishment there of both abolished in Christ.</note> absolued both from guiltinesse and paine, but from guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse only, but it remaineth still, that we should suffer paines yea such paines, whereby we satisfie for our sinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after Baptisme, what is this else but to make vs our own sauiours in a part, and manifestly to contradict both scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and fathers? for the scripture plainly saith. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ, who walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. And AVGVSTINE saith, <hi>Culpa est quod injustus es, poena quod mortalis es, Christus suscipiendo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam &amp; non culpam, &amp; poenam debevit &amp; culpam.</hi> August. <hi>de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis domini,</hi> serm. 37. that is, thy fault is this, that thou art vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, thy punishment that thou art mortall, but Christ by taking vpon himselfe our punishment and not our fault, hath abolished both our fault and our punishment.</p>
                        <p>Arguments brought in to prooue Popish Purgatorie are of three ranckes, First, some arguments taken out of the <note place="margin">Plaeces of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abused for stablishing of Purgatorie</note> wordes of Canonicke and Apocryph scripture. Secondly out of the writings of fathers. Thirdly out of visions, dreames and apparitions, where of some are put in write for a memorial to the posteritie. In the booke of the Psalms it is written. <hi>Wee passed through fire and water into thy rest,</hi> Psal. 65. ver. 12. <hi>alias</hi> Psal. 66. ver. 12. Here say they meÅtion is made of Purgatorie fire. But AVGVSTINE writing vpon this Psalme doth expone it otherwise. The fire, saith hee, burneth, the water rotteth, both are to be feared, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of trouble, and rotting of water. When there are disasters and vnhappie things in this world, they are like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fire: when we are in prosperitie and al things plenteously abound, this is like water. This is the exposition of AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE. In the prophecie of ZACHARIE it is written, <hi>Thou also shalt be saued through the blood of thy couenant, I haue loosed thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</hi> Is this also spoken of Purgatorie? There is in that chapter a prophecie of Christ of his office, humilitie, power, loue, and the operatiue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his blood, by which blood beeing his own blood, &amp; the blood of the euerlasting couenant of God, we who were sinners and bond-men of Satan are set at libertie, and wee
<pb facs="tcp:18670:103"/>
who were heires of hell and condemnation, are fred from that terrible pit whereinto there is not one drop of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, &amp; soChrist hath found out to vs by his suffering fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> as the Apostle saith, Heb. 9. ver. 12, that is, euerlasting redemption. This is the true sense of that place, for scripture conferred with scripture will find out the right meaning of scripture: but the wresting of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the conceits of our minde is a perpetuall deteining of vs in blindnesse and ignorance. To this agreeth wel the exposition of August <hi>decivit. Dei,</hi> lib. 18. cap. 35. and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret. in Zach. cap. 9. In like maner in the prophecie of Malach. <hi>Behold I will send my messinger, and he shall prepare the way before mee: and the Lord whome yee seeke, shall speedely come to his temple: euen the messinger of the couenant whome ye desire: behold he shall come, saith the Lord of hostes. But who may abide the day of his comming? and who shall endure when he appeareth? for he is like a purging fire, and like fullers sope. And hee shall sit downe to trie &amp; fine the siluer: he shall euen fine the sonnes of Leui, and purifie them as golde and situer, that they may bring offerings vnto the Lord in righteousnesse,</hi> Malac. 3. ver. 1. 2. 3. If we credite the holy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists, this is spoken of Christs first comming, and of IOHN Baptist his forerunner, and of the effectuall ministrie of the Gospel in purging sinne, Mat 11. ver. 10. Marc. 1. ver. 2 Luc. 1. ver. 76. But Papistes not conferring scripture with scripture, whersoeuer they find fire or darknesse, or a deepe pit and dungeon, or a terrible tempest, there they thinke mention is made of Purgatorie, as I could easily prooue by many other places: but let these suffice for examples of the old Testament wrested and abused.</p>
                        <p>In the new Testament it is said, <hi>And whosoeuer shall speake a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <hi>shall speake against the holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiuen him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come,</hi> Mat. 12. ver. 32. Ofthese words it is inferred that some faults shal be forgiuen in the world to come, albeit the finne against the holy Ghost shall neuer be forgiuen. The true sense and meaning of these words is set down by the Euangelist MARKE in these words, <hi>But he that blasphemeth against the holy Ghost shall neuer haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse, but is culpable of eternall damnation,</hi> Marc. 3. ver. 29.
<pb facs="tcp:18670:104"/>
What needeth further requisition when the spirit of God hath interpreted his owne meaning? Againe it is is said in the new Testament. <hi>For other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid, which is Icsus Christ: And if any man build on this foundation golde, siluer, pretious stones, timber hay or stubble, Euery mans worke shall bee made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall bee reueiled by the fire: and the fire shall try euery mans worke of what sort it is.

                              </gap>keburne, hee shall lose, but he shall be saued himselfe: neuerthelesse yet as it were by the fire,</hi> 1. Cor. 3. ver. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. The last of these verses is brought foorth as a testimonie of scripture proouing Purgatorie fire: &amp; so much the rather because S. AMBROSE doeth so expone the foresaide verse. Let vs therefore with AMBROSE agree vpon all the rest, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert onely vpon the last verse. The foundation of Christ, the golde, siluer and precious stones is true and solide do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the timber, hay, and stubble is friuolous doctrine: the triall by day, and fire is a triall by the worde of God, full of light, as the day, and mightie in operation as the fire. In this triall hee whose doctrine is authorized and not ouerthrowne by the worde, hee hath double vantage: first his worke standeth, next himselfe shall be rewarded as a good builder. But if in the triall a mans doctrine be found friuolous, albeit not hereticall, hee shall sustaine double losse: First hee shall see his doctrine ouerthrowne by the light and fire, that is, by the worde of God, next, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it himselfe shall be saued, because hee adhereth by faith to the foundation, yet because hee hath beene a slouthfull teacher in teaching friuolous things with a glorious shewe of eloquence of in steade of solide and necessarie things, hee shall bee saued by fire, that is, as wee say, hee shall be cast into the fornace of temporal troubles to learne repentance and amendement in this life, wherein onely is time and place of repentance. But the Papistes thinke that men after their death shall bee cast into the fire of Purgatorie, there to satisfie for their fault, and after satisfaction to be purged and saued Here first note, that the Apostle vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by a continuated allegorie the estate of those who
<pb facs="tcp:18670:104"/>
build vpon the right foundation any kinde of doctrine either solide or friuolous, in the end he perfiteth his allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, comparing the chastisements of God sent for our amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement vnto a fire. This agreeth better then to interpret all the rest allegorically, and the last words into a simple mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without any figure, &amp; to father that opinion vpon PAVL whereof neither hee nor any other Apostle maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their writings. Next consider that they would seeme to be followers of the interpretation of AMBROSE, when as their conscience (I meane of those that are learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them) knoweth the contrarie, that AMBROSE meaneth of that fire at the latter day, whereof ORIGEN writeth, but not of that Purgatorie fire immediatly after the issue of this life, whereof the Papistes speake, Indeed if Purgatorie fire should be set forth as an article of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, it should bee grounded not vpon allegories or obscure places of scripture, but vpon cleare and plaine places, as all the ancient fathers in one voyce doe consent, but this place of scripture is an allegorie and an obscure place. ORIGEN and AMBROSE take it in one sense, the Papistes take it in another sense, we take it in the third sense, and some of their owne scholasticke doctors are so dashed with the varietie of diuerse interpretations, that they dare determine nothing certainely, but say that either with the fire of Purgatorie, or with the fire of tribulation, or with the fire that goeth before the face of the great Iudge men who haue committed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall sinnes shall be purged and saued. THOMAS A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QVINAS in 1. Cor. 3.

                           <hi>that they should not be destroyed for thefault committed. Besides that, noble Iudas exhorted the people to keepe themselues from sinne: for so much as they sawe before their eyes the things that came to passe by the sinne of those that were slaine. And hauing made a gathering through the companie sent to Ierusalem about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand drachmes of siluer to offer for a sinne offering.</hi> Hitherto doth the author of that booke write the history of that fact, which was done by IVDAS MACCABEVS and his souldiers. First they were about to burie the dead bodies of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who were slaine in the battell fighting against GOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIAS. Secondly they found secretly couered vnder their garments jewels consecrated to idoles. Thirdly they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged this to be a sinne, and to haue beene the cause of the destruction of their brethren. Fourthly they thanked God who discouered this secret: for the punishment of their slaine brethren was an admonition to them that were aliue to absteine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the like fault. Fiftly they gaue themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to praier, fearing lest the whole army should be plagued by God for the fault committed by a few number of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, as the fault of ACHAN troubled the whole hoste in the dayes of IOSHVA, Ios. 7. Sixtly to prayer is added an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of IVDAS to abstaine from the like faults. Seuenthly a collection is gathered to be sent vp to <hi>Ierusal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              </gap>m</hi> that a sin-offering might be offered, not for the deade, but for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, who had not searched out the faultes of the host dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently as became them: And therfore there was some guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse also in them. The rest that followeth is the opinion of the author of that second booke in these words, Doing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well and honestly that he thought of the resurrection: for if hee had not hoped that they which were slaine should rise againe, it had beene superfluous and vaine to pray for the dead. And therefore he perceiued that there was great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour laid vp for those that died godly. (It was an holy and a good thought) So he made a reconciliation for the dead, that they might be deliuered from sinne. When I read this opinion of the author of the second booke of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> I am nothing moued with it: first because it seemeth to be a lie that IVDAS MACCABEVS sent to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to offer sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the dead, Hee knewe the law of God, and fought fo
<pb facs="tcp:18670:105"/>
the law of GOD wherein was no sacrifice for the deade, nor yet example in all the old Testament that any man did offer sacrifice for the dead: but this author bringeth in IV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAS fighting with his sworde for the lawe, and with his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged sacrifice against the lawe. And it is lesse inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to rub this foule spot vpon the vnwise writer then vpon that wise, valiant and godly man IVDAS MACCABEVS. And I am the bolder to rub this fault vpon the writer, rather then vpon the valiant Captaine of whome hee writeth, because in other places also he taketh boldnes to commend things forb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Likewise I am emboldened to do it, because I read this same historie in other authours more worthie then this man is, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute no such fault to IVDAS MACCABEVS, as namely Ioseph. antiq. lib. 12. cap. 12. If any man shal think me presumptuous in charging the writer of the booke rather then the worthy gouernour with a fault, let him vnderstand that the veritie of God is in nothing empared albeit there had bene a fault in both, that is, in IVDAS doing a thing repugnant to the Law, and in the authour praysing a thing done contrarie to <note place="margin">Simil.</note> the law. For like as there was no grace in DAVID, that could grace his adulterie<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> euen so therewas no gift in IVDAS MAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CABEVS that could excuse his offering of a sacrifice for the deade, which no man did before him in the old Testament, and no man is found to haue followed him in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as saith CHEMNICIVS.</p>
                        <p>In the next place arguments are brought out of ancient fathers to proue Purgatorie by their prayers for the deade. <note place="margin">By the praiers made for the dead of old Purgatorie cannot be sufficiently confirmed.</note> For after this maner they reason.

But (say they) the ancient fathers praied for the dead, whereby it is cleare that they beleeued a third place, to wit, Purgatory, whereinto the soules of some men are tormented, and haue neede of the support of the liuing: but the consequence is very false: for they cannot be ignorant that in CYPRIANS daies the name<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For answere. First, I demande of LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DANVS, if all these of his religion beleeue this that CHRY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOSTOME speaketh, that prayer for the deade in time of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the holy communion is an Apostolick tradition? IS GREGORIVS <hi>1.</hi> in that opinion, who affirmeth that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in ministring that holy sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t vsed no other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but only the Lords prayer? Gregor. <hi>in regist.</hi> lib. 7. epist. <hi>63</hi> IS PLTAINA in that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, who writing the life of XISTVS <hi>1.</hi> saith thus, <hi>Petrus enimubi consecr auerat oratione Pater noster u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus est?</hi> This being the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the most part of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Church that the Apostles vsed no other prayer but only the Lords praier before the ministration of the holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>munion, howe can they adhere to this place of CHRYSOSTOME, who calleth it an Apostolicke institution to make mention of the dead in these prayers? Secondly I demande of LINDANVS (if the passages in that same homilie be not excused by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure hyperbole) howe doth CHRYSOSTOME agree with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe when hee speaketh of them that are departed this life without Baptisme, hee saith that they are <gap reason="foreign">

Are we more louing, kinde and mercifull then ABRAHAM, in whome loue and all true vertues are perfited: yet he sawe no refreshment to a condemned man? Thirdly I demand of LINDANVS and those that bee of his opinion if CHRYSOSTOME was as deepe in the opinion of Purgatorie as in the opinion of prayer for the dead? CHRY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOSTOME neuer knew what Popish Purgatorie meaned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in his time men who died in the faith, albeit not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether faultlesse, yet they were conueyed to the burial places with torches and hymnes and spirituall songs. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were these funerall rites vsed, saith CHRYSOSTOME. Do we not conuey them (saith he) as victorious warriours? Do we not praise God, because hee hath crowned with glory him who is departed? Chrysost. <hi>in</hi> cap. 2 epist <hi>ad</hi> Heb. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 4 The funeral Psalme that was vsually sung was the 116. Psalme (the 7. verse whereof is this) <hi>Returne my soule vnto thy rest: for the Lord hath bene beneficiall vnto thee:</hi> This was not to Purgatorie, but to endlesse rest. But to speake freely what I thinke of that ancient father CHRYSOSTOME in calling prayer for the dead an Apostolicke tradition, I think he hath spoken hyperbolically calling all these opinions, Apostolick traditions, which were deliuered to him by good men, who kept the chiefe heads of Apostolicke faith, and this amongst the rest (albeit no article of faith) yet beeing deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him by Christians more ancient then himselfe, he calleth it by a figure an Apostolicke tradition. But the conceite of Popish Purgatorie neuer entred into the heartes of NAZIANZENVS, BASILIVS, ATHANA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIVS, (albeit DAMASCENE falsly alledgeth his testimonie) THEODORETVS, CHRYSOSTOMVS and the ancient learned fathers of the Greeke Church, as clearely appeareth by the

Likewise he bringeth in the fable of an ancient teacher (whose name he expresseth not, because fables delite to haue their head lapped vp in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of shadowes and silence) who had a disciple that liued licentiously in excesse and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Finally by the feruencie of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied prayers he was fully deliuered. The fable of GRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GORIVS 1. cited also by DAMASCENE goeth beyond all the rest in absurditie, that he prayed for the soule of TRAIAN the third persecuting Emperour, and obtained pardon to

it as a voyce that came downe from heauen, witnessed, saying, I haue heard thy prayers and granted pardon to TRAIANVS, but in time to come make no prayers for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men. All these fables are like vnto the gourd of IO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAS, that had a worme within it, which smote it, so that it withered incontinent, Ion. 4. euen so in al these fables there are circumstances declaring that God would not heare the prayers made for impenitent sinners after they had died in sinne.</p>

God saide vnto IACOB that IOSEPH should close his eyes, and that the Lord himselfe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him backe againe to <hi>Canaan,</hi> that is. the Lord would attend vpon his funeral in his backe comming againe, Gen. 46. ver. 4. yet that craftie aduersarie Satan building as it were vpon the Lordes owne ground vnder pretence of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to bee done to the bodies of the Saintes, as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whereinto the holy Ghost dwelt, he hath brought men so farre forwarde, that they haue opened the graues of the Saints, raised their bones, caried them in procession, and made their prayers before them with hope to be the better heard of God, because they bowe themselues before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Saintes,</p>
                        <p>Also Satans craft appeareth in this, that as the <hi>Philistims</hi> did not send SAMPSON immediatly to grind in their mill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <note place="margin">The third craft of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</note> they had first pulled out his eyes, Iudg. 16 21. euen so Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan mooued not men to bowe their knees and to say their prayers before dead mens bones at the first instance, vntill he had of along time blind-folded their eyes with a mistie cloud of ignorance, so that all things were welcome that pleased their blind guides to thrust into their hands. And so we shall see (Godwilling) that in the first 300. yeeres after the ascension of our Lord there was no adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of reliques. <note place="margin">We reade of graues ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring but not for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring. of bones.</note> Now let the history speak for it self. In the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t we read that some mens bones were raised out of their graues to dishonor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, as the bones of the priests of <hi>Bethel,</hi> which were burned vpon the altar of <hi>Bethel</hi> by IOSIAH, 2.

<pb facs="tcp:18670:109"/>
all these things, ibid. ver. 17. these bones, I say, were not raised to honour them as the bones of the idolatrous priestes were raised out of their graues to dishonour them. The body of MOSES buried in the plaine of <hi>Moab,</hi> Deut 34. ver. 6. whose sepulchre was vnknowne to man, but knowne to Satan, yet he who knew it had not libertie to open it, &amp; to discouer the reliques of his body, left it should haue bene an occasion of idolatrie, because MICHAEL the Archangell of God stroue against him in this point, epist. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The graue of the Prophet ELIZEVS was opened not of purpose to raise his bones, and to honour them, but vpon a great suddentie to cast in another dead man: and albeit the Lord wrought a great miracle by touching of ELIZEVS bones, <hi>2.</hi> Reg. 13. ver. 21. yet no man was so foolish as to raise them out of the graue, or to carie them into the Temple to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored and worshipped.

And so the historie of the old Testament may be laide aside as an holy historie furnishing no fuel to hold in this fire of Popish superstition anent adorations of dead mens bones.</p>

                        <p>In the ecclesiasticall historie it is to be noted that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who liued neerest vnto the dayes of the Apostles were also freest of this superstition of worshipping of bones and <note place="margin">The fathers neerest to the Apostles dayes, freest of superstition</note> other reliques. In the fourth persecution POLYCARPVS Bishop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> was martyred (as hath bene declared) at what time great care was taken both by Iewes and Paganes that the dead body of POLYCARPVS should not come into the handes of Christians: and to this purpose it was burned with fire. The Christians who waited on diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to honour that blessed body, which had patiently suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered rebuke for the cause of Christ, in end they got his bones, which albeit they counted to bee more pretious then gold and siluer, yet they worshipped them not, as EVSEBIVS clearely declareth, lib. 4. eccles. hist. cap. 16. but they buried them honourablie into a convenient place. Moreouer that day whereinto hee was burnt for the Name of Christ, was called by the fathers <hi>natalis,</hi> or <hi>natalitium</hi> POLYCARPI, that is, the birth-day of POLY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CARPVS, because by his death he made it manifest that he was the true childe of GOD, begotten and borne of the vncorruptible seede of the Word. And in that place where his bones were buried, and vpon the very day of his martyrdome, Christians conveened to glorifie God for the constant suffring of the Martyr &amp; to exhort others with constant perseuerance to be ready to do the like, Euseb. <hi>ibid.</hi>

August <hi>lib. confess.</hi> 9. cap. 7 To this I answere that God wrought a miracle at the sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of this holy Martyr PROTASIVS to confirme that true faith for which he suffred martyrdome. Like as God wroght a greater miracle at the sepulchre of ELISEVS in restoring a dead man to life againe. 2. Reg 13. to confirme the doctrine of ELISEVS that it was of God. But the end of these miracles was not to raise vp their bones out of the graue &amp; to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them, in regarde that such superstitious facts plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned to the summe of their faith and doctrine. Now by good reason the Papists are reduced to this strait, that either they must prooue that the adoration of dead mens bones was a point of ELISEVS doctrine, and PROTASIVS faith, or else these miracles were wroght to teach men to raise out of the graue, and to worship the dead bones of the Prophets &amp; martyrs of God. And AVGVSTINE himselfe clearelie decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth what was the issue of this miracle. First, men tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion by the sight of hat miracle to glorify God, but not to worship PROTASIVS &amp; GERVASIVS bones.

Therefore they will not seeme to be destitute of this armour also. The shadow of PETER Acts. 5. 15. was helpfull to disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed persons, and the napkins, and hand-kercheefes taken from the bodie of PAVL, helped diseases, and made vncleane spirits to depart from men. And therefore (say they) to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vertue to reliques of Saints, is no derogation to the glorie of God, but rather a great confirmation of Gods trueth. To this I answere, that scripture hauing intention to glorifie God indeed doth in these miracles neither magnifie PETER nor PAVL, nor PETERS shadow, nor PAVLS napkins, wherin there was no sauing vertue, but the text clearlie saith that <hi>Godw ought miracles by the hands of</hi> PAVL Acts 19. ver. 11. Which verse is cast in of purpose to turne our hearts from PAVL the instrument, alanerly to God the author of these miracles. And if the holy Scripture will not suffer vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose vpon PETER and PAVL, and other Apostles, as if by their owne power and vertue they had made any man whole, Acts 3. ver. 12. how much lesse can God be pleased with this, that power and vertue be attributed to PETERS shadowe, and PAVLS napkins? And albeit vertue had bene in these things,
<pb facs="tcp:18670:112"/>
yet PETERS shadow could not haue bene kept as a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent relique to the posteritie, nor yet PAVLS napkin, except miraculouslie, could haue continued so long. But this suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth our purpose, that in al the scripture there is not a word of the worshipping of PETERS shadow, nor PAVLS napkin. If I were disputing vpon words, I would demand of those that recken PETERS shadow among reliques, by what reason they do it, seeing that it hath no remaining amongst vs, after that his body is taken from vs, and therefore, cannot be called a relique? But I leaue off to speake of the shadow of words as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, as of the shadow of bodies.</p>
                        <p>Let vs remember this well, that GOD worketh great works by very contemptible meanes, to the end the glory may be attributed to GOD alone. Now seeing that GOD <note place="margin">

Some of the learned say that God buried it with MOSES in the plain of <hi>Moab,</hi> lest it should haue bene an occasion of idolatry: How euer it be, the remembrance of it is buried in scriptures, and we cannot tell what became of it.

                        <p>The miracle wrought at <hi>Apamia</hi> in the bearing about of the crosse by THOMAS Bishop of <hi>Apamia,</hi> is more regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Object.</note> then many other miracles, because EVAGRIVS wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth that he himselfe was present in the town, and that he saw the bearing about of the crosse. Likewise, that he saw a fire compassing the crosse, and the Bishop THOMAS whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he went: and that this sight was more miraculous, that this fire had a shining vertue to encrease light, but not a consuming power to offend the Bishop that bare the crosse. And the sight of this miracle so mooued the heart of EVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRIVS, that he himselfe fell down &amp; worshipped the crosse that was in the hands of THOMAS Bishop of <hi>Apamia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I giue these answers. First, that EVAGRIVS in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing <note place="margin">The first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</note> the deliuerie of. <hi>Apamia</hi> from the expected siege of COSROES King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the miraculous deliuerance of SERGIOPOLIS and EDESSA two townes besieged, indeed is so fabulous, that he deserueth no more credit in this narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then in the description of the life of BARS ANVPHIVS an Egyptian monke of whom EVAGRIVS writeth, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed himselfe within a shop beside <hi>Gaza</hi> fiftie yeeres, seene of no man, and vsing no kind of earthly thing, that is, neither meat, drinke, raiment, nor any other refreshment of earthly things. Euagr. lib. 4. cap. 33. He who can excuse this ouersight of EVAGRIVS, let him accuse me that I giue not credite to all that EVAGRIVS writeth.</p>
                        <p>Secondly the authority of THOMAS Bishop of <hi>Apamia</hi> &amp; <note place="margin">The second answere.</note> EVAGRIVS an ecclesiastical writer, are both nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                           <pb facs="tcp:18670:113"/>
of the authoritie of AMBROSE, who was nerer vnto the Apostles dayes, &amp; tooke better attendance to the scriptures of God then EVAGRIVS did: he writeth of HELENA the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of CONSTANTINE who is saide to haue found out the crosse wheron Iesus suffered, yet he saith of her <hi>Regem adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit non lignum,</hi> that is, sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>â¢â¦</desc>

                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly I affirme that in scripture is set downe two sortes of lying miracles, &amp; both are to be misregarded alike. 1. false <note place="margin">The third answere.</note> miracles wherein the senses of men only are deluded, but nothing wroght neither contrarie to nature nor aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, such as were the miracles wrought by the sorcerers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 7. 8 9. Other miracles are called lying miracles, not because the senses of men are deluded, but because they are brought forth by the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of Satan to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>firme a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrine, Deut. 13. 1. 23, And in 2. Thess. cap. 2. 9. they are called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                           </gap>, because they are both wrought and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to confirme a doctrine of lies. In this rancke let vs eount the miracle cited by EVAGRIVS.</p>
                        <p>Finally I say that if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fidence in the crosse was so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as to stay COSROES king of <hi>Persia</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> besieging <hi>Apamia,</hi> why was it not also as powerful (the people remaining no <note place="margin">The fourth answere.</note> lesse superstitious the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they were afore) to saue <hi>Apamia</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the siege of ADAARMANES the captain of the armie of COSROES who afterward tooke the towne of <hi>Apamia</hi> &amp; set it on fire? Euagr. lib. 5. cap. 10. Notwithstanding of their confidence in the crosse this superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> was no defence vnto them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fuell to augment the flame of the wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God against them. And thus I leaue EVAGRIVS spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himselfe with his own conceits, wherof what account I make, I haue already declared.</p>
                        <p>In end, Satan counting the ignorance of mankinde to be his gaining, brought in false reliques into the world, which <note place="margin">False re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</note> were worshipped with no lesse reuerence and deuotion then the true reliques were. And Satan vsed the world as the <hi>Philistim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>â¢â¦</desc>

                           </hi> vsed SAMSON, Iudg. 16. First they bound him, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly they pulled out his eyes, thirdly they compelled him to grind in their mil: and last of all they made a play-soole
<pb facs="tcp:18670:114"/>
of him. But when they were at the hight of their contempt, <note place="margin">Simil.</note> then suddenly came their destruction. Euen so after that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had bound the world with the bands of idolatrie, and blindfolded them, and made them to serue in vile and filthy offices, in end with false and forged reliques, he would mak a playfoole of the world: but then in the mercie of God the kingdome of the deuill began to be shaken and ouerturned. The coat of Christ, his purple garment, his teares, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of his circumcision, the crowne of thornes, the speare, that pearced his side, the lots that were cast for his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the linnen clothes whereinto his blessed body was wrapped, all these reliques the <hi>Romaine</hi> Church bragge that they haue them, together with the very house of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leam</hi> wherein the Lord was borne, miraculously transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Iudea</hi> to <hi>Italie:</hi> so impudent are they in forging lies. But if all these things had bene left by Christ in testamental Legacie to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they had not bene so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in keeping of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, as the negligent keeping of the purity of the word &amp; holy sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts clearly declareth: for they haue lost the key of knowledge. They haue added many things to Baptisme, and paired a substantiall part from the Supper of the Lord. And no doubt if the forenamed reliques had bene left in Testament also to the church of <hi>Rome</hi> (like vnto false executers) they had made hauocke of these in like maner.</p>
                        <p>The false reliques attributed to the blessed Virgin the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord, to MICHAEL the Archangel, and to the martyrs &amp; saints, some of them haue such babish conceits in them, others such absurditie, as it were a shame to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall of them, if so be we had not to do with a shamelesse harlot, who hath dighted her mouth, &amp; saith, I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted none iniquity, Prou, 30. ver. 20. The virgins haire in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie more then is beseeming to attribute to one person, her milke in qualitie better then is beseeming to attribut to any mortal creature: her combe wherwith she combed her haire, her girdle &amp; many other reliques vnknowne to antiquitie. In the strife of MICHAEL the Archangell of God against the deuil for the body of MOSES, epist. Iud. ver. 9. the dagger and shield wherewith he fought, are among the number of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish reliques: as if Satan could be ouercome with the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of corporal warfarc, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as men themselues are taught
<pb facs="tcp:18670:114"/>
by the Apostle to fight against spirituall wickednesse with spirituall armour. Ephes. 6.</p>
                        <p>The coales of S. LAVRENCE, the incorruptible finger of IOHN Baptist that pointed out Christ, the yron chaine that bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d PETER, the teeth of APOLLONIA, the body of S. DIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISE co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>plet aleged to be both in <hi>France &amp; Germany,</hi> the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied body of S. SEBASTIAN &amp; innumerable other forged reliques wherof they who haue inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> haue cause to be ashamed. And what shal we say of the superlatiue degree of al absurditie in defending forged reliques? The arrowes that pearced S. SEBASTIAN, the stones that stoned S. STEPHAN, the 30. pieces of money which the traitor IVDAS receiued to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his master, shall all these also be consecrated &amp; worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped? SIMON MAGVS mony was cursed &amp; execrable as wel as himself, Act, 8. 20. because he thoght that the gift of the holy spirit could be bought with money. Shall not the 30. pieces of money wherewith the blood of Christ was bought be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so cursed &amp; execrable? Now we see in our time a filthie sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ful of forged reiiques &amp; more filthy then euer the stable of AVGIAS king of <hi>Elis</hi> was, which couldby no other means be purged, but by the riuer of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> which beeing let in into the stable the great heape of 30 yeres dung was in few dayes washed away: Euen so the great heape of forged re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, wherewith the world hath bene bewitched these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreth yeres, can by no other means be abolished but by the spate of the authoritie of godly Princes, whose harts the Lord stir vp to purge the world from the filth &amp; stincke of false reliques by false teachers so obstinatly defended.</p>
                        <p>The best remedie to correct all abuses in the Church was euer this, to reduce all things vnto the first &amp; originall puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which was this, to do as the men of God in the Apostles daies did. They followed the saints in so farre as the saintes followed Christ, 1. Cor. 11. If the saints departed this life, they buried them honestly, as deuote men did burie STE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHAN, Act. 8 2. with some lamentation, but not excessiuÃ© as they doe who are without hope, 1. Thess. 4. 13 After their death if they remembred any good they had done in their lifetime, they commended it, that others might follow their example, because Christ saith that the fact of MARIE should be told for a memoriall of her, &amp; that in all places whersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Gospel should be taught, Mat. 26. ver. 13. If they had
<pb facs="tcp:18670:115"/>
patiently suffered any euill for Christs sake, they kept a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of that also, as the godly fathers of the primitiue Church did in <hi>natalitus martyrum.</hi> Thus doing, we honour the saintes and follow them as they followed Christ, but we cloth them not with the royall apparell which is only due to Christ, to whom be euerlasting glory and honour.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>ALbeit that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was not openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to be the heade of all Bishops, vntill the yeere of our Lord 607. by the Emperour PHOCAS, yet is this supremacie coloured with forged lies &amp; appearance of greater antiquitie, &amp; for refutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of alledged antiquitie I cast in this treatise in the third Centurie. And first of all let vs consider the grounds of this alledged supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, next let vs consider the steps of this ladder (not like to the ladder of IACOB leading vp to heauen, but like to the manifestation of the man of sinne) wherby the B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> by litle &amp; litle climmed vp vnto this soueraignitie, that in end he sat as a lawgiuer in the chaire of Christ. And thirdly God-willing we shal declare the tragical euent of this supremacie.</p>
                        <p>Now first the principall ground whereupon Papistes doe ground the supremacie of the Pope, is the supremacie of PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER <note place="margin">Great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to destroy Christ after he was borne as great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the Antichrist.</note> aboue the rest of the Apostles, which if it were grantes they will inferre the superioritie of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as his successour aboue all Bishops. In this argument I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue great businesse to aduance the Antichrist, and to set him vp into an eminent chair, like as when Christ was borne there was great businesse to make him out of the way, Mat. 2. but all in vaine, the crueltie and craft of HEROD, cannot vn doe the counsell of God: so great businesse is to aduance the Roman Antichrist, and to make vs beleeue that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath set him in his own chaire, &amp; giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vnto him a soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine gouernment ouer al his sheep, but al this trauel is also taken in vain: for the roome of Christ must not be filled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be vacant, &amp; the breath of Christs mouth destroying the
<pb facs="tcp:18670:115"/>
man of sinne, will one day declare that Christ is liuing, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his owne chaire, and mightie in operation to make his enemies his footstoole, Psal. 110,</p>
                        <p>Now to examine the parts of this argument, the first part is, PETER is the heade of the Apostles, and this they proue <note place="margin">Christ insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted none of the Apostles to be supreme heade ouer the rest.</note> by the words of Christ, I <hi>Will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 16.

                           </gap>in these wordes Christ had giuen any supremacie to PETER aboue the rest, then afterward when they stroue who should be greatest, Christ had not damned this fault in all his disciples, but he had only damned the eleuen disciples, for that they were not voluntarly subject to PETER whom he had alreadie made head of all the rest. But in so farre as stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for superioritie is damned in them all, Mat. 18. it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that Christ appointed none of the Apostles to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head of all the rest. And CYPRI AN plainly affirmeth in his booke <hi>de simplicitate Praelatorum. Hoc erant utique <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The second part of the argument that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the successour of PETER hath beene alreadie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in the head of succession.</p>
                        <p>Another argument proouing the supremacie of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The decretal epistles attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Bishops of Rome of old are forged &amp; false.</note> Bishops is taken out of the decretall epistles attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Bishoppes of <hi>Rome</hi> who liued in the second Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turie making mention of the superioritie of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> aboue all other Bishoppes. To this I answere, that these epistles attributed vnto them are supposititious and false, as <hi>hist. Magdeburg.</hi> clearly prooueth by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whereof I shall rehearse a fewe. First, the stile and <note place="margin">1.</note> ditement of all these epistles declareth that one and the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same man hath endited them all.</p>
                        <p>Secondly the ineptitude and barbaritie of language, no wise agreeing with the tightnesse of the Latin tongue vsed in <note place="margin">2.</note> this age.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, these decretall epistles agree not with the estate of the Church at that time persecuted by Tyrants, troubled <note place="margin">3</note> by Heretiques, &amp; slandered by the world. If these forenamed
<pb facs="tcp:18670:116"/>
Bishops had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> epistles indeed they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tained exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s to patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t suffring, apologies against sla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>drous mouths, refutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of Hereticks: but seing they sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d for the most part to the establishing of their own supremacy the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of time declareth that they are supposititious &amp; forged.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly the reasons whereby these epistles doe prooue the supremacie of the <hi>Romaine</hi> chaire, are foolish, ridiculous <note place="margin">4</note> &amp; vnworthie to be attributed to so worthie men. As name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that PETER was called CEPHAS, that is an heade, for his supremacie. Likewise PETER and PAVL died at <hi>Rome,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Romaine</hi> B. is head of all other Bishops. Also PAVL saide that hee had continuall remembrance of the <hi>Romans</hi> in his prayers. Rom. 1. therfore the <hi>Romaine</hi> Church must be head of all other Churches.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, these decretal epistles were vnknown to IVSTINVS <hi>martyr,</hi> IRENEVS, CLEMENS ALEXANDRINVS who liued about <note place="margin">5.</note> this time, as likewise to IEROME an accurat searcher of al an tiquities, for none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> mak me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of these decretal epistles.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, when the question of appellation to the <hi>Romaine</hi> Bishop, and the question of supremacie was reasoned in the <note place="margin">6.</note> sixt Councill of <hi>Carthage,</hi> if such decretall epistles had bene then exstant the ambassadours of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had alledged them for corroboration of their cause, but they were not as yet fashioned and shaped.</p>
                        <p>Finally in these decretall epistles CLEMENS B. of <hi>Rome</hi> is broght in writing to IAMES surnamed IVSTVS after the death of PETER: &amp; it is known by the history that IAMES surnamed IVSTVS was slain at the least 8. yeres before the martyrdome of PETER.

                        <p>The 3. principall argument they vse is taken from the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie of the Church of God whereinto vnitie is very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, Ioh. 17. &amp; for keeping of vnitie one ministeriall head vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christ is necessarie, like as in the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> one high Priest, to whom all the people were subject in matters of religion, was a band of vnitie amongst the <hi>Iewes:</hi> euen so say they, one ministeriall head (viz. the B. of <hi>Rome)</hi> is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for keeping vnitie: peace &amp; concord amongst Christians-To this I answere, that all things happened to them in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,

Here is to be noted that si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of BASILIVS, that a good Christian should be like <note place="margin">Simil.</note> vnto a straight line, that neither crooketh vpward nor downward: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> so a goodChristian should neither be dashed with infamy &amp; trouble, nor puft vp with honor &amp; prosperity.</p>
                        <p>The second step of this vnhappie supremacie was the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations <note place="margin">The second step.</note> of Heretiques, and men liuing inordinatly from the discipline of their own Bishops vnto the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> whome they receiued vnder their shadowe, not so much for fauour to their vnhonest causes, as for desire of supremacie aboue all other Churches. For APIARIVS appealed to the B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; EVTYCHES Abbot in <hi>Constantinople</hi> appealed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his B. FLAVIANVS to LEO B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whose excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation albeit in end LEO agreed in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> yet it is certaine that the cause of the propagation of EVTY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHES error was the lingering of LEO B of <hi>Rome,</hi> who did not incontinent separat this pestilent Heretique fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: albeit FLAVIANVS B. of <hi>Constantinople</hi> had most justly exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mmunicat him. Likewise BASILIDES and MARTIALIS Bishops of <hi>Asturica &amp; Emerita</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> who had sacrificed to idoles, and defended their apostasie in writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> bookes, after they were both excommunicate &amp; deposed by the Bishops of <hi>Spaine,</hi> they had recourse to STEPHANVS B of <hi>Rome:</hi> whose false apologies were so much the more fauourably heard, that they sought refuge vnder his wings. But CYPRIAN ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a Council in <hi>Africke,</hi> &amp; absolutely damned these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postats, Hist Magd. cent. 3, Cypr. lib. 1. epist. 4.

But the argument taken from the authoritie and example of EVLALIVS, is like vnto himselfe. If he being weyed in a just ballance, will be found foolish vnconstant, timorous, rash &amp; naughtie, what can we say of the argument taken from his authoritie and example but the like? Beside this from the 6.

<pb facs="tcp:18670:118"/>

                        <p>The Roman Bishops hunting foral occasions of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were like to a wild halke in the morning, hungrie, and <note place="margin">The fourth steppe.</note> swiftly soaring in the aire, if he cannot catch a Partridge, he will make a Lauerock his prey: euen so the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> taking their vantage by euery light occasion, laboured to bring their brethren in subjection to their soueraignitie. In witnesse whereof ACACIVS B. of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> vsed the aduise and counsell of FELIX 3. B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> in disauthorizing and excommunicating PETRVS MOGGVS a fauourer of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychian heresie. This thing ACACIVS did by no necessitie, but of good will, and as a brother seeking the aduise and support of another brother. After this PETRVS MOGGVS be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both disauthorized &amp; excommunicat, he repented, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke his errour, and offered his supplicant bill to ACACIVS crauing relaxation from that fearful sentence of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. FELIX 3. on the other side, because his aduise was not craued in the relaxation aswell as in the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he cursed ACACIVS B. of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and GELASIVS 1. his successor did the like. What meeting ACACIVS gaue to FELIX it is not needful to reherse, it is sufficiently known he was not behind with him. Here euery man may see that the <hi>Rom an</hi> bishops made vantage of these who soght their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, as if it were necessarie that he who craueth our aduise in one thing should be bound to doe nothing without our aduise in any time to come.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, the hearts of the Roman bishops being exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely bent to preferment, could not abstain from flattering of Emperours &amp; Princes, thereby gaining vantage &amp; prefer <note place="margin">The fist step.</note> ment, but lossing the fauour of God, and falling vnder that heauie sentence of the curse of God, spoken by ISAIAH the Prophet. <hi>Woe vnto them which speak good of euill, and euill of good, which put darkenesse for light, and light for darknesse, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for sowre.</hi> Isa. 5. ver. 20. It is not known to the world that BONIFACIVS 3. flattered PHOCAS emperour, who by treason &amp; vnspeakable cruelty, put out of the way MAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITIVS him master, his wife and children: And for this cause

So that the fift step of the Romane eminencie was falsehood and flatterie as hath bene declared.</p>

This was hard to bring to passe in respect the Emperors had bin in so long possession of this right, but it was so necessarie a point that the absolut soueraignitie whereat they aimed of a long time, could no otherwise be obtained. Therfore the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> put on their armour, &amp; batter at the authority of the Emperours with all their might, specially with the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts of their cursings, to haue the investiment of Bishops, <hi>per baculum &amp; annulum</hi> giuen ouer into their hands. This bargaine began in the dayes of GREGORY the 7. and inthe dayes of HENRY 4. and lasted almost 200. yeeres, some call it <hi>bellum Pontificium.</hi> HENRY 4. was cursed by GREGORY 7. HENRY 5. by PASCHALIS. LOTHARIVS 2. was rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tent to giue ouer the investiment of Bishops, then to contend with INNOCENTIVS 2. and so escaped the sentence of cursing. CVNRADVS 3. was occupied in warrefare against the <hi>Saracens</hi> and was traiterously deceiued by EMANVEL Emperour of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> but if he had taried long at home, there was great appearance of a bargaine because hee receiued not his coronation from the B. of <hi>Rome.</hi> FRIDERICVS the first called BARBAROSSA was cursed by ALEXANDER the third, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in VENICE, and in the porch of the Church of S. MARKE trampled vpon his necke. HENRY 6. was cursed by CELESTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS, who also when he repented and was crowned Emperour by him, he put on the crowne vpon HENRYES head with his hand, and dang it off againe with his foot. PHILIP brother to HENRY 6 was cursed by INNOCENTIVS, OTTO 4. was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by INNOCENTIVS 3. FRIDERICK 2, by HONORIVS 3

GREGORIVS 9. and INNOCENTIVS 4. CVNRADINVS the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of FREDERICKE 2. in stead of cursing was beheaded by the speciall aduise of CLEMENS 4. such elemencie was in our holy fathers. This large historie I haue only touched in few words to let you vnderstand that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> can be serious in maine points, whereinto the standing or falling of their supremacie doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sist. If the investiment of bishops be thrown out of the hands of the emperours, then will all bishops follow the bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not their own soueraigne Lords, and therefore moe curses then euer were pronounced out of mount Eball. Deut. 27. were thundered out: but against whom I pray you? Against the anointed of the Lord, of whom it is said, <hi>Thou shalt not curse the Prince of thy people.</hi> Exod. 22. ver. 28. But wonder not good reader of the great difference betweene the curses pronounced out of mount Eball, and the curses pronounced out of mount Tarpeius. The curses from mount Eball were giuen out to bring the people vnder the obedience of God. but the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses pronounced out of mount Tarpeius, were set foorth to bring Princes vnder the soueraignitie of the <hi>Romane</hi> bishop.</p>

                        <p>The last head of this treatise is to declare the tragicall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of this supremacie of the Roman B. not like to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of AARON &amp; his successours, which was a band of vnity amongst the nation of the Iewes: but like vnto the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of ABIMELECH, tending not onely to the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his brethren, but also to the vtter vndoing of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemits</hi> who by vnlawfull meanes advanced him to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. <note place="margin">Acompari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son between Christ, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</note> Iudg. 9. But in the beginning of the last head before I say any further, in few words I wil institut a comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ &amp; the Antichrist, as a Preface to the last head. Christ Iesus after his humiliation ascended vnto heauen, led captivity captiue, &amp; distributed good things to men, Eph. 4. ver. 8. Psal. 68. ver. 18. &amp; the hier he ascended the greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite redounded to mankinde: the Apostles receiued the gift of tongues Act 2. &amp; strength promised from aboue Act I &amp; a sanctified memory to remember all things that Christ had taught his disciples. Iohn 14. And more then this, seeing he ascended to the heauens to sit at the right hand of his father Psal. <hi>1</hi> 10. and to be our Advocat. 1. Iohn 2. it is certaine that not only the Apostles, but also all Christians haue a great &amp; vnspeakable benefit by the asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sion of Christ on high. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this ascension of Christ, and sitting at the right hand of his Father is not a new dignity that Christ had not before, but this excellent glory was something obscured <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>But when the Antichrist ascended on hie, not by the decreet of the mercy of God appointing him to sit at the right hand of the father, ps 11<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

declared before, and by the operation of Satan, 2. Thess. 2. ver 9 and by the decreet of the justice of God punishing the world for the contempt of his trueth <hi>ibid.</hi> ver. 12. Then I say, gifts were not distributed to men, but the great Vials of the wrath of God were powred vpon the earth, as shall clearely appeare by a particular declaration of the miseries that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the world by the aduancement of the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> to the supremacie foresaid. And aboue all other things when as he was not content to sit in the chaire of PETER, but also he would make himselfe a new law-giuer, not onely equall to Christ, but also <gap reason="foreign">

Then I say, the fountaines of the great deep were broken vp and the windowes ofheauen were opened Gen. 7. not to bring down raine, as in the dayes of NOAH, but to reueil the wrath of God from heauen against all vngodlinesse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteoufnesse of men, who with-hold the truth into vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.

                        <p>Now to keep some order in this great Ocean, whereinto I am embarked, the principall Tragedies following the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane supremacie I divide them in three. First the warre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>The second tragedie that followed the high aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ofthe B of <hi>Rome was bellum pontificium,</hi> others call it <note place="margin">The second Tragedie.</note> 
                           <hi>bellum Imperatorium,</hi> a cruell and hatefull warfare betweene the Emperours and Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein no sort of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie, falshood &amp; barbarous crueltie was left vnpractised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst noble and worthy Emperours. GREGORIE 7 cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Emperour HENRY 4. at <hi>Canusium</hi> in sharpe winter weather to stand barefooted, and to craue absolution from him. He vttered a false prophecie of the Emperours death within yeere and day: which when the issue declared to be a lying prophecie, he took him to his shifting mental mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that he spake of the spirituall death of the Emperours soule, and not ofhis bodily deathPope. PASCALIS 2. stirred vp HENRY 5. against his owne naturall father HENRY 4. and caused raise the body of the noble Emperour HENRY 4 out of his sepulchre, so that it remained 5. yeeres vnburied. Pope ADRIAN 4. was offended because the Emperour BARBA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROSSA held his left stirrop in stead of the right stirrop when the Pope mounted vp vpon his horse. Pope ALEXANDER3. trampled vpon the same Emperours necke. Pope GREGORY 9. by his cursings compelled the Emperour FREDERICKE 2. to leade an armie to <hi>Asia</hi> against the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> and in his absence like vnto a deceitfull traitor inuaded the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the rest of the dominions which in heritage belonged to the Emperour. Thus we see clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this second tragedie that the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> was like vnto the melt in the body, when it waxeth great by swelling and <note place="margin">Simil.</note> hardnesse, all the rest of the noble parts are lessened and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weake: euen so the excessiue preferment of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of <hi>Rome</hi> was the vndoing of the Emperours and princes of the earth.</p>

INNOCEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVS 3 in the Councill of <hi>Lateran</hi> confirmed the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous doctrine of transubstantiation Ann. 1215. In the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councill holden by GREGORIE. 10. Ann. 1273. forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenes of sinnes was promised in most ample maner to those that would bee marked with the badge of the crosse, and would goe and fight against the <hi>Saracens.</hi> But Christ promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth remission of sinnes to such onely as repent their sinnes beleeue in him, &amp; in token of true repentance to these who beare the easie yocke &amp; light burden of Christ, Mat. 11. ver. 28 29. &amp; 30. In the generall Council gathered by CLEMENS 5. in <hi>Vienne</hi> Ann. 1311. it was ordained that the Pope should not be subject to the Emperour, but rather the Emperor to the Pope, &amp; that the Emperor shal giue his oth of alledgance to the Pope expresse contrary to the written word of God. <hi>Let euery soule be subject vnto the hier powers,</hi> Ro. 13 ver. 1. Ioh 23. with aduise of SIGISMVND gathered a generall Councill at <hi>Constance,</hi> Ann. 1414. wherein the very testamental legacie of Christ was altered and impaired by sacrilegious prelats in taking from the people the vse of the holy cup in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the clause, <hi>Non obstante</hi> set down in their act, made the whole people of Christendome to tremble that they durst not set their mouthes against the heauen and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the ordinance of Christ, and that in such rude maner, that notwithstanding that Christ instituted this sacrament vnder formes both of bread &amp; wine yet the church thought meete that the sacrament shal be giuen to laicke people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the forme of bread only. The late Councils of <hi>Basil</hi> &amp; <hi>Florence</hi> are flat repugnant one to another in the head of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie. And last of all the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> wherein some piece of reformation was expected made it knowne to the world, that the whore will neuer reforme the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thell, and the Antichrist will not be consumed with the breath of his own mouth, but with the breath of the mouth of Christ, which thing the Lord performe in his owne time.</p>

                     <p>OLDE Heresies before mentioned, such as the Heresies of the <hi>Novatians, Sabellians,</hi> and <hi>Manicheans,</hi> did more harme in this CENTURIE, then in the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they were first propagated, as appeareth by the bookes and Sermons of learned Fathers, seriously insisting to quench the flame of Hereticall doctrine, which was kindled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time.</p>
                     <p>In this CENTURIE the plurality of Heretiques did most mightily abound. <hi>Meletius</hi> a bishop in <hi>Thebaida,</hi> was deposed by <hi>Peter</hi> bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (who suffered martyrdome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Meletiani.</note>

After his deposition, hee was seditious and factious, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vp tumults in <hi>Thebaida,</hi> and practising tyrannie against the chaire of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> and his disciples were founde to haue communicated with the <hi>Arrians.</hi> The Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> suffered <hi>Meletius</hi> to enjoy the name of a bishop without power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
                     <p>In the yeere of our LORD 324. sprang vp <hi>Arrius,</hi> a presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Arriani.</note> in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who denied that the Sonne of GOD was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the substance of the FATHER, but that hee was a creature, and made of things not existant: and that there was a time, whereinto the Sonne was not. <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> dealt with him, to reclaime him from his Hereticall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: <note place="margin">

All these times GOD did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his people, for omitting of externall sacrifices, because they were constrained by necessitie to intermit such outward exercises. In the meane time they worshipped GOD in spirit and trueth, and it lay not in the power of their hatefull enemies to hinder them from worshipping GOD spiritually.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Prophet brings in the LORD, declaring, that hee had no pleasure in bloody sacrifices, because hee neither eateth flesh, nor drinketh blood: and in case hee delited in such things, hee would not require them at mens handes, seeing that all the foules in the Mountaines, and all the beastes in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest are the LORDS, and hee may use them according to his owne will and blessed pleasure.

                     <p>In the second part of this Treatise, it is to bee proued, that Prayer is a spirituall sacrifice, onely to bee offered to GOD, and to none other, neither in Heauen, nor in earth, for three principall reasons. First, in Scripture wee are taught, to pray to him onely, in whom wee trust, and consequently to pray one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to GOD. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>But howe shall they call on</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 10 verse, 14.</note>

GOD is the just <note place="margin">Ierem. 17 verse, 5</note> proprietare and owner of our soules: for hee hath bought and purchased them with his owne blood: and the LORD wil part <note place="margin">Act. 20 verse, 28</note> stakes with no man, neither can hee admit a corriual in points of his honour: as the naturall mother coulde not abide to see her sonne diuided, because hee appertained totally and wholly <note place="margin">1. Reg. 3 verse, 26 Isai. 42 verse, 8 Act. 5 verse, 4</note> vnto her selfe: so can not GOD abide, that his glory be giuen vnto another, or yet that any part of that thing that is once dedicated to GOD should bee conuerted to another use.</p>
                     <p>In holy Scripture wee reade of three moste abominable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, to wit, of the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                        </gap>tar of <hi>Damascus,</hi> and the Altar of <hi>Bethel,</hi> and <note place="margin">2. Reg. 16 verse, 10</note> the Altar at <hi>Athens</hi> to the vnknowne GOD. The Altar of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18670:169"/>
                        <hi>Damascus</hi> was abominable, because it was builded to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of a false god. The Altar of <hi>Bethel</hi> was abominable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause on it the true GOD was worshipped in a forbidden ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <note place="margin">2. Reg. 23. verse, 15</note> And the Altar of <hi>Athens</hi> to the vnknowne GOD was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, because they neither knew whom they worshipped, <note place="margin">Act. 17 verse, 23</note> nor yet the right maner of his worshipping. Therefore in the matter of the worshipping of GOD, let vs set our compasse right, lest a little aberration procure a great ship-wracke: and in the matter of Prayer let vs call vpon him onely, in whome wee trust, as wee are taught by the holy Apostle, <hi>And let vs offer</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. verse, 5</note> 
                        <hi>spirituall sacrifices, acceptable to</hi> GOD <hi>through</hi> IESUS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>The seconde argument, whereby I proue, that our prayers should bee made onely to GOD, is this: Wee should pray only to him, who is Omnipotent, and can support vs in al our distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: <hi>ergo,</hi> wee ought to pray onely to GOD. The antecedent of this argument is euident, by the latter part of that short prayer indited by CHRIST to his Disciples, <hi>For thine is the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 6 verse, 13</note> 
                        <hi>Kingdome, and the Power, and the Glory, for euer.</hi> In that short forme of perfect prayer the first words leadeth vs to a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the loue of GOD toward vs, who is content to be our Father in IESUS CHRIST. In the last wordes his power is described to bee infinite, such as becommeth him, who is King of Heauen and Earth: who like as hee hath made all thinges, so likewise hath hee an absolute Souereignitie ouer all thinges, both in Heauen and in Earth. Now that Omnipotencie is an attribute onely belonging to the diuine nature, the very <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> could not denie it, who attributed the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to God. And it is certaine, that all the Angels of Heauen could not haue supported the disasterous estate of man after his <note place="margin">Genes, 3</note> fall, if God himselfe had not put hande to worke, who onely knew the way howe his justice and mercy coulde kisse one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the person of the Mediator. Therefore seeing God onely is Omnipotent, and none but hee, what fooles are wee to put our trust vnder the shadow of the bramble, as the <hi>Sichemites</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iud. 9 verse, 15</note> did, and not to dwell in the secrete of the moste High, and abide in the shadow of the Almightie?

                     <p>Thirdly, it may bee proued, that wee should pray to GOD onely, and to none other, because their is neither commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, nor example, nor promise, to be heard in Scripture, except that prayers bee made to the Creator onely, and not vnto the creatures of GOD. And in this argument I find that some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Papists giue ouer reasoning in the contrary, and they render reasons wherefore there is no example in the old or new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of Inuocation of Saints: namely this, that in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, the-Patriarchs and Prophets, who departed this life, went not presently to Heauen, and had not the fruition of the presence of GOD incontinent: but they went to <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> where their soules remained vntill CHRIST died, and arose againe from death, and then hee carried their soules to Heauen. And this is the cause (say they) wherefore there is no example found in the old Testament of Inuocation of Saintes. Likewise, they say concerning the new Testament, that if the Apostles had set downe any precept concerning Inuocation of Saintes, it woulde haue seemed vnto the people, that they were desirous that this honour should bee done vnto themselues after their death. These are the foolish conjectures of <hi>Eccius.</hi> Neuertheles the places that Papists cite out of Scripture to proue inuocation of Saints, declare with what conscience a great number of them entrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>In like maner the factes and wordes of ancient Fathers are miserably abused. When Papistes reade in the Epistles of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> that the Emperour went vnto the tombe of the Apostle <note place="margin">

Thus wee see, that when ancient Fathers spake of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of intercession, they spake of a mediator betwixt God and vs, and not betwixt Christ and vs.</p>
                     <p>But now let vs take vp out of groundes of holy Scripture a true description of the mediator of intercession: Out of two principal places of Scripture the description shal be grounded. In the Gospell of <hi>Matthew</hi> it is saide, <hi>This is my Well-beloued Sonne, in whom I am Well pleased.</hi> And in the Epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> we are <note place="margin">Matth. 3 verse, 17 1. Pet. 2 verse, 5</note> warned, <hi>to offer up spirituall sacrifices, acceptable to God, through Jesus Christ.</hi> Of these two places of Scripture I gather a description of a mediator of intercession, in this maner: Hee for whose sake onely our persons are in fauour with God, and for whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites onely our prayers are acceptable to God, hee is the onelie mediator of our intercession: But so it is, that in Christ onelie God is pleased with our persons, and for his sake onelie God accepteth our prayers, <hi>ergo,</hi> Christ is the onely mediator of our intercession.</p>
                     <p>The similitude that is vsed by Papistes in stead of an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to bee discussed.

                     <p>To conclude the question of Inuocation of Saintes, it is not vnlike to the controuersie that was betwixt <hi>Iphtah</hi> and the king <note place="margin">Iudg. 11.</note> of <hi>Ammon,</hi> for the landes lying betwixt the Riuers <hi>Arnon, Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and <hi>Iabbok:</hi> by one apparent right the king of <hi>Ammon</hi> clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that these lands should be restored vnto the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> to whom of old they did belong: but <hi>Iphtah</hi> refused to giue ouer the possession of these landes, wherein the <hi>Reubenites</hi> and <hi>Gaaites</hi> dwelt, and that for three great reasons: First, they receiued these landes out of the handes of their GOD, by whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commandement and warrant MOSES faught against <note place="margin">Numb. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Sihon</hi> king of <hi>Hesbon:</hi> Secondly, since the dayes of MOSES vntill the dayes of the gouernament of IPHTAH, that is,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18670:175"/>
the space of three hundreth yeeres the people of <hi>Israel</hi> peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie possessed those landes.

First, because wee haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a perfect forme of prayer out of our LORDS hands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are taught to pray onely to our Heauenly Father, and not <note place="margin">

                              </gap>h.</hi> 6</note> to Saints. Secondly, because the Church for the space of three hundreth yeeres after the LORDS ascension, used no other forme of prayer then this, to pray to GOD alone through IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST. Thirdly, if Papistes will needes make anie controuersie in this matter, let them controuert with CHRISTS Apostles, who haue left vnto their true successors this forme of prayer, which we now use: and such new &amp; young school-mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as Papistes are, wee cannot admit. Against the seconde of the three preceeding reasons, if they object, that in the dayes of <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Christian Virgine, whom <hi>Cyprian</hi> before his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion pursued, with Magicall arts labouring to circumueene her, <note place="margin">Nazi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Seeing the Apostle warneth vs to absteine from all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of euill, at least Papistes in their Inuocation of Saintes <note place="margin">1.

The seconde part of the argument is proued by the example of the great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie gathered at <hi>Silo</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Iosua,</hi> to suppresse the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iosua,</hi> 22</note> apparent defection of the <hi>Reubenites, Gadites,</hi> and halfe tribe of <hi>Manasses,</hi> from the true worship of GOD, as seemed vnto them. And this Assemblie had allowance of GOD, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it was ordered with wisedome: the glory of GOD
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18670:177"/>
was onely respected, and the ende of it was peace in IS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAEL.</p>
                     <p>Next the great assemblie of the ten tribes at mount <hi>Carmell,</hi> procured by <hi>Helias</hi> the Prophet, but gathered by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of <hi>Achab</hi> the king of <hi>Israel,</hi> declareth, that assemblies <note place="margin">1. Reg. 18</note> of Church-men and others of chiefe authoritie, was an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meane to reforme abuses in Religion: albeit no reformation followed after this assemblie, yet the enemies of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were conuicted in their consciences, false teachers were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced and punished, and the zeale of <hi>Helias</hi> toward the glory of GOD had allowance by a miracle of fire from Heauen.</p>
                     <p>In like maner <hi>Samuel</hi> by gathering a great assemblie of all <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Sam. 7</note> at <hi>Mizpah,</hi> procured a reformation, both in Religion and maners amongst them: <hi>Dauid,</hi> in transporting the Arke to the <note place="margin">2. Sam. 6</note> citie of <hi>Dauid: Salomon,</hi> in the dedication of the Temple; both <note place="margin">1. Reg. 8</note> used the support of holie assemblies gathered to that effect.</p>
                     <p>And in the new Testament the Apostles, Elders, and Deacons met together in an holie assemblie at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and timouslie <note place="margin">Act. 15</note> suppressed the doctrine of false teachers, who affirmed, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could not bee saued by faith in CHRIST onely, except they had also beene circumcised, and kept the law of <hi>Moses.</hi> All these examples, and manie more, contained in holy Scripture, teach vs, that the meeting of holie assemblies, was an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meane to suppresse corruption in doctrine and maners, and to aduance the kingdome of GOD.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, that thing which godlie Emperours did for the suppressing of Heresies, following the examples of the Prophets <note place="margin">2.</note> &amp; Apostles (especiallie when no better meanes could be found out) is necessarilie to bee obserued. But so it is, that the godlie Emperours <hi>Constantine, Theodosius, Valentinian</hi> the third, and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> the second the sonne of <hi>Arcadius,</hi> and <hi>Martianus</hi> conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Councils for suppressing of the Heresies of <hi>Arrius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius, Nestorius,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches:</hi> and no better meanes could be found out, neither as yet can bee founde out, for suppressing of Heresies: Therefore the custome of conuocating Councils at times requisite, is necessarilie to bee obserued.</p>

But it is the doctrine of the Holy Scripture of GOD, that begetteth Faith in the soules of men. Therefore let the Holy Scriptures of GOD haue the first and principall honour, and no man will be offended, that good Councils be regarded in their owne ranke.</p>
                     <p>In the next head let vs speake of the abuses of Councils, they are manifold: But the first and principall abuse of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, I thinke to bee this, when the very end wherefore they were wont to bee gathered is inuerted. Of old Councils were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to suppresse Heresies and Schismes: But when they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to maintaine Hereticall doctrine, or to strengthen the handes of Schismatiques, directly or indirectly, this is a great abuse of Councils. Like as the Councill of <hi>Ariminum</hi> was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled for confirmation of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie, &amp; the second Councill of <hi>Ephesus</hi> gaue allowance to the errour of <hi>Eutyches.</hi> The Councils of <hi>Tyrus &amp; Millan</hi> indirectly in labouring to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <hi>Athanasius,</hi> were in verie deede supplanting the true Faith which <hi>Athanasius</hi> professed.

                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:18670:181"/>
Secondly, Councils are abused, when they take libertie to statute and ordaine any thing repugnant to the Holy Scriptures of GOD, whether it be in forbidding to doe that thing which the Scripture licentiateth to bee done, or in allowing thinges disallowed in Holy Scripture. This abuse began very early, euen in the famous Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> wherein they forbid men, who are conuerted to Christian Religion, and are baptized in the Name of CHRIST, to returne againe to the warre-fare, as if these two thinges were repugnant to be a warriour and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. Did not <hi>Dauid, Iosaphat,</hi> and <hi>Iosias,</hi> fight the battels of the LORD? and in so doing, they made not defection from the Couenant of GOD. Was not <hi>Cornelius</hi> both a Centurion and <note place="margin">Act. 10</note> a Christian? And <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> when hee was demanded of the Souldiours, what they should doe, did hee command them to forsake their calling? and not rather to use it aright, that is, to doe violence to no man, neither accuse any falsly, and to bee <note place="margin">Luc. 3. 14</note> content with their wages. And was it lawfull to militate vnder the banner of <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius?</hi> And shall it be found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to fight vnder the banner of <hi>Constantine,</hi> a most Christian Emperour? In my judgement this was too much libertie, that the Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> tooke vnto themselues, to disallowe anie calling that in Holy Scripture is not disallowed, except onelie the abuse of it. And of olde the <hi>Iewes</hi> made no Conscience to fight vnder the banner of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> whome hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured also with <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>

But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> might bee excused, because all thinges that are lawfull are not also expedient, &amp; possibly they <note place="margin">1.

But manie other Councils, both Nationall and (called by the <hi>Romane</hi> Church) generall, haue allowed thinges expressely forbidd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18670:182"/>
the taile the head, &amp; the head the taile. In particular I speake of the Councils holden at <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Gregorius</hi> the seconde, and <hi>Gregorius</hi> the thirde, and <hi>Stephanus</hi> the thirde: and the seconde Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> holden in the seuenth yeere of the Empresse <hi>Irene,</hi> with the consent and procuration of <hi>Adrian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ANNO 790. The vnhappie Generall Councill of <hi>Vienne,</hi> ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Can any thing bee spoken more repugnant to the seconde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the first Table, and the first precept of the seconde Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then the Decretes of the Councils foresaid.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let euerie Christian man thinke of Councils as they thinke of Riuers of water, which are verie profitable so long as they hold themselues within the compasse of their owne accustomed bankes: but if they swell and by vntimous inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <note place="margin">Similitude.</note> ouer-flowe their owne accustomed boundes, then are they verie hurtfull to the neere adjacent fieldes. Enen so Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils that take libertie to allowe any thing disallowed in Holie Scripture, are very pernicius and hurtfull.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Councils are miserably abused, when they are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnjustly and without a cause. The <hi>Arrians</hi> moste vnjustly blamed the Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> for the worde <gap reason="foreign">

By conference with persons of the <hi>Romane</hi> Religion, I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that they will not giue full credite to any Assemblie, but to such a one, as is lawfully conuocated, holden, and lawfully ended. They count it lawfully conuocated, when the Bishop of ROME by his Edict hath gathered it: lawfully holden, when the Bishop of ROME, or els his substitute, is Moderator of the Assemblie: and lawfully ended, when hee, who is Moderator, continueth in his office vntill the ende of the assemblie.

Before I speake of the last head, it is to bee considered, that in gathering of Councils diuers respects haue beene had, some times to the people, some times to the Pastors, and at some times also regard hath beene had to good men, who haue bene vnjustly accused. Regarde was had to the people, when Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were conueened in those selfe same places whereinto the pestilent venome of Hereticall doctrine was chiefely ouerspred: For <hi>Novatus</hi> was damned at <hi>Rome, Samosatenus</hi> at <hi>Amiochia, Artemon</hi> in <hi>Bostra</hi> of <hi>Arabia, Eustatius</hi> in <hi>Gangra</hi> of <hi>Paphlago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and <hi>Arrius</hi> at the first in a particular Synode holden at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> In a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>The last head had beene vnnecessarie to bee entreated, if that the ambition of the Bishops of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church had not compelled men to seeke out this question to the verie ground: for who can doubt but Bishops, Elders, Deacons, and wise and learned men, hauing commission from their owne Churches, should bee present at Councils, and vote according to the word

Neuerthelesse the ambition of Bishops, fearing lest by pluralitie of votes matters shoulde frame otherwise then liked themselues best, they began to make distinction betwixt consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue and definitiue votes, minding thereby to appropriate vnto themselues onely definitiue votes, and the rest of the Councill, albeit Elders, Deacons, Doctors, and learned men, furnished with commission, their vote shoulde onely bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultatiue, and shoulde not bee numbered amongst the votes whereupon the definitiue sentence shoulde arise.

                     <p>Nowe to conclude, It were a wise course in all thinges that wee presume to doe, at least to set such a patrone before our eyes, which without all contradiction is perfect: and let vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to approach so neere as possible is, to the similitude of that patron, to the ende that our doinges bee not altogether euill and reproueable.

                     <p>In the very originall ground of the Monasticke life, I see this infirmitie, That men imagined by changing of place to bee free of the snares of the Deuill: But it is otherwise, <hi>Adam</hi> was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Paradise, &amp; CHRIST was tempted in the Wildernesse, <note place="margin">Genes. 3 Matth. 4</note> and Sathan is ready to spreade his nette both in the prison and in the palace, and by changing of place we cannot be free from his malice. In the Epistle written by <hi>Basilius Magnus</hi> to <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius,</hi> this is illustrate by the fit similitude of a man who saileth <note place="margin">Epist. Basil. ad Gregor.</note> in a ship, and findeth himselfe to bee sicke, and secretely in his owne mind blameth the greatnesse of the vessell whereinto hee saileth: but when hee steppeth downe into the little bote, that accompanieth the ship, his sicknesse continueth, and is not aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereby hee is compelled to come to a consideration of the <note place="margin">Similitude.</note> right cause of his sicknesse, that it is neither the great vessell, nor the little vessell, that is the cause of his grieuance, but rather the corrupt humours that lurke within his owne bodie. Euen so the permutation of place will not make vs free of the tentations of the Deuill, as some men imagined. And like as the conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of GOD are not tyed to any certaine place, for <hi>Moses</hi> in <note place="margin">Exod. 24</note>

And finally after his death in the 5, generall Councill, his writings against the 12. heades of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> were damned.

I superside at this time to speake much of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil gathered by <hi>Constantius Copronymus</hi> at <hi>Constantinople</hi> An. 755. whereinto 338. bishoppes vtterly damned the adoration of Images, and the setting of them vp in places where GOD was worshipped, and that for three principall causes. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the making and bowing downe to Images is expresly forbiden in Scripture, &amp; namely in the 2. Commandement of the Decalogue. Secondly, because the picturing of CHRIST (who is both God and man) and representing of him by a similitude is a diuiding of his two natures (so farre as in vs lseth) because his diuine nature cannot be pictured, and his humane nature should not be separated from his diuine nature. Thirdly, because the writings of holy and ancient farhers, damned the worshipping of Images, such as <hi>Epiphanius, Nazianzenus, c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hrysostomus, Athanasius, Amphilochius, Theodorus</hi> bishop of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius Pamphili,</hi> whose graue sentences all damning adoration of Images, are most worthie to be read.</p>
                     <p>In the rest of this Treatise, I shall set downe (Godwilling) two opposite Councills, the one allowing the adoration of Images, the other disallowing it. The second Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> vnder the Empresse <hi>Irene</hi> ann. 789. gaue full allowance to the adoration of Images, out of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Gracia,</hi> and some other parts: with the ambassadours of <hi>Adrian</hi> bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> were assembled 350. bishoppes. On the other part, vnder the reigne of <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> Emperour of the VVest, ann. 794. a great Councill was assembled at <hi>Francford de maine,</hi> wherein the adoration of Images was vtterly disallowed, and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alleadged in the second Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> for adoration of Images, are clearely refuted in presence of <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> and Emperour of the VVest, and <hi>Theophilactus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> ambassadours of the bishoppe of <hi>Rome.</hi> In these two

opposite Councills, let the iudicious Reader marke the great prouidence of GOD, who hath appointed, that there should bee contradiction to the lying doctrine, so that they who loue the trueth of GOD haue no neede to follow a false doctrine, in regarde there is no man that dare gainesay it. For I dare say, to the commendation of the Councill of <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sord,</hi> that the <hi>Ibides</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were neuer more readie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Before I set these Councills in opposite tearmes of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the one to the other, the preludie of the Councill is worthie to bee marked. <hi>Adrian</hi> bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> sent a letter to the second Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> fraughted with lies, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> was a leper, that hee ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to cure his disease by shedding of innocent babes blood, that PETER and PAVL appeared to him in a vision by night, and bade him goe, and bee baptized by SILVESTER, <note place="margin">Huseb de vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The groundes of this letter conteineth a masse of impudent lies. CONSTANTINE was not a leper, but a man gifted in soule, beautifull in body, and furnished with great giftes both of soule and body, and meete for great workes, as EVSEBIVS witne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>eth, who liued in CONSTANTINES time, and was familiarly acquainted with him. Neither was hee baptized by SILVESTER in <hi>Rome,</hi> but by EVSEBIVS in <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> For SILVESTER and MARCVS his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour were both deade, before that CONSTANTINE was baptized. The rest of his letter is like vnto the sandie ground and fabulous narration whereupon it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>The arguments of the second Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> prouing ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Images may be distributed into foure rancks. Some are taken out of Scripture, others out of Fathers, the third
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18670:224"/>
rancke from common reason, the fourth from miracles. If I propound their arguments into an intelligible order, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the answeres to them, I doe a benefite to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>The Cherubims, and the brasen Serpent were made by Gods commandement, and the Cherubimes were seated in the place <note place="margin">1 Argument.</note> of adoration: <hi>ergo</hi> Images may bee brought into the places of adoration.</p>
                     <p>There is a threefolde difference betwixt Images set vp in <note place="margin">1. Answere.</note> Churches to bee worshipped, and the Cherubimes in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. First, the Cherubimes are made by the expresse comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of GOD, but the images set vp in Temples, are made expresse contrare to the Commandement of GOD Secondly, the Cherubimes and brasen Serpent were represntations of diuine mysteries. Thirdly, neither the Cherubimes nor brasen Serpent were made for adoration as images are, that are set vp in Temples. If any man bee not fully resolued with these an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres, let him vnderstand that the Law-giuer hath absolute authoritie, to make exceptions from his owne Lawe, but it is not lawfull to others, without warrant of GODS commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doe the like. Example in ABRAHAM who had a warrant to kill his owne son<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Exod. 12. vers 35, 36 Exod. 31. vers. 7.</note> rayment, and <hi>Moses</hi> had a warrant to make Cherubimes and a brasen Serpent: but those thinges are not lawfull to others, who want the like warrant.</p>
                     <p>The next Argument borrowed from Scripture is this. IACOB <note place="margin">2. Argument</note> worshipped the top of IOSEPHS staffe, therefore it is lawfull to worship Images.</p>

                     <p>To this it may bee answered, that the breaking downe of the <note place="margin">2.

For albeit an euill intention be eneugh to bring a man within the compasse of such as dishonour Christ, yet a good intention is not eneugh to proue, that we are honourers of Christ, but our actions also must bee ruled according to the commandements of Christ: and therefore they who haue only an intention to honour Christ, but in the meane time violateth his commandements, by worshipping him into an Image, shall neuer be counted honourers of Christ.</p>
                     <p>The fourth rancke of argumentes is taken from miracles <note place="margin">An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from miracles. Answere.</note> wrought by Images. This argument is weake and faultie in all sides. The antecedent is false, as shall be declared hereafter. But suppone that miracles had beene wrought in Images, or by images, it followeth not that they should be worshipped. In the wildernesse God cured his people miraculously, by looking to the brasen Serpent, yet it was not lawfull to worship the brasen Serpent, and when the people worshipped it, HEZEKIAS brake it in pieces, and called it <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Lystra,</hi> yet would they not suffer the people to worship them, and the comming of the Antichrist is foretold to be mighty by lying wonders, yet is not the Antichrist to bee worshipped. Therefore this argument is of no force, albeit it were true that miracles had beene wrought by Images.</p>
                     <p>But let vs examine the antecedent of this argument, they say, that miracles haue beene wrought by Images: For confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this, they bring in the viue similitude of Christes face printed into a cloth, and by Christ his application of the cloth

                     <p>Before I make an ende of this Treatise, it may be demanded, Howe could the worshipping of images get place at that time when Emperours and Councils with all their might contended in the contrarie, that images should not bee worshipped. The Emperours <hi>Philippicus, Leo Isaurus, Constantinus, Copronymus,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> his sonne, were all seriously bent to suppresse the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of images, and in the VVest, <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> and Emperour, was present in the Councill of <hi>Francford,</hi> where the worshipping of images was damned To this I answere, that the authoritie of the bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was at this time so increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that they durst encounter with the Emperours of the East, who were farre distant from them. <hi>Constantine</hi> B. of <hi>Rome</hi> razed out of Charters, the name of the Emperour <hi>Philippicus.

To this vaine assertion of <hi>Papistes</hi> I answere, that the LORD neuer dealt sparingly, neither with our bodies nor soules. The LORD hath prouided greater abundance of aire for the refreshment of our bodies, than all the breathing senses of men and beasts is able to draw in. The LORD rained downe MANNA from heauen in greater plentie, than might haue sufficed the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the wildernesse: euen so when the LORD is content to shed great abundance of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, he hath done it to set foorth the great riches of his mercie toward our soules, but not to make a mortall man a dispensator of one drop of his blessed blood.</p>

                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:18670:228"/>
Nothing is more repugnant to holy Scripture, conteined in the old and new Testament, than this, that the dispensation and application of Christs blood should be committed vnto a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man.</p>
                     <p>In the old Testament the high Priest who entred once in the yeere into the moste holy place, sprinckled the blood of the <note place="margin">Leuit. 16. vers. 14.</note> sacrifice with his own fingers vpon the Arke euen so, the blood of the euerlasting Couenant, which Christ caried vp to heauen, is sprinckled on the Saints of God on the earth, but by whom only by the fingers of our high Priest the Lord Iesus. In the new Testament wee see, that albeit many things were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the dispensation of the holy Apostles, yet some things were reserued to the Lords owne dispensation allanerly. Christ gaue power to his disciples to wish peace to euery house which receiued them, but the dispensation, and application of this peace Christ reserued vnto himselfe, because hee alone, and <note place="margin">Matt. 10.</note> not his disciples knew who was the true Childe of peace. In like manner, power of preaching the Gospel was committed to the Apostles, but the conferring of the gift of faith, which is wrought by hearing, belongeth onely to CHRISTS, euen so, the preaching of saluation by the merites of CHRISTES <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note> blood is committed to many, but the application of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood to the safetie of our soules, is onely proper to Christ himselfe, who shed that blessed blood for our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The merites of the Saintes also, that is, the workes of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation are thought to enter into the Popes treasurie, and to be at his dispensation. Of this we haue spoken somewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie. But what presumption is this, that they dare mixe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the blood of the Saints, and Christs blood, and the merits of Saintes with the merite of Christ, and cast all in ore heape, and treasure. The verses of <hi>Praxilla,</hi> a Poetesse of <hi>Scycion</hi> were abhorred by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> because in her verses shee brought in Adonis matching Cucumbers and Aples with the sunne, yet is it a more tolerable thing, to match an earthly creature, with a heauenly creature, than to match creatures with the Creator, who is blessed for euer.</p>

                     <p>Of this, which I haue alreadie spoken, it is euident, that the <hi>Papistes</hi> in the wordes of Satisfaction and Indulgences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue both themselues, and others: for what auaileth it to keepe the ancient wordes vsed in the primitiue Church, and to vse them into a newe sense vnknowne to Fathers, who spake of Satisfaction and Indulgences. Did not the <hi>Athenians</hi> of olde weare the badge of the golden Grashopper, in token they were not extraneers, but they were inhabitants in that lande whereinto both their predecessors and themselues were borne, but when they were conquessed by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and their golden libertie was lost, what auailed the badge of the golden Grashopper? Euen so when substance of ancient words is lost, what auaileth it to talke of Satisfaction and Indulgences, as ancient things.</p>
                     <p>In the rest of this Treatise (God willing) I shall declare the absurditie of Popish Satisfactions and Indulgences. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of <hi>Trent</hi> in the 12.

There we are taught that in Satisfaction two thinges are principally required. First a perfect obedience to the Lawe of GOD. Secondly a perfect

sacrifice for the sinne committed by man: both these things are to bee found in CHRIST alone, who by his obedience hath abolished the sinnewhich came in by the disobedience <note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>If at any time ancient Fathers speake roundly in this matter, it is ourparte to doe that fauour to them, which is done to all men, to wit, to giue them libertie to interprete the meaning of their owne wordes. So when AMBROSE writteth that <note place="margin">

The wordes of S.

                     <p>The principall argument, whereby they endeuoure to prooue humane satisfactions by Scripture is in the wordes of the counsell of DANIEL giuen to NABVCHADNESER. <hi>Wherefore, O King, let my counsell be acceptable unto thee, and breake off thy sinnes by righteousnesse, and thine iniquities by mercie toward</hi>

Likewise Christ in holy Scripture is called the Lambe of God <note place="margin">Ioan. 1. vers. 36.</note> who taketh away the sinnes of the world. It is great obliuion in men to magnifie the finger which pointed out Christ so much, as to count it incorruptible, that the fire hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to burne it, and it is an holy relique in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, and on the other part, to bee so forgetfull of the golden sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which hee vttered at the pointing foorth of his finger, namely, that CHRIST was the Lambe of GOD, that is, the onely propitiatorie sacrifice for our sinnes, for that Lambe which was offered in the morning and the euening, in the olde TESTAMENT did not represent our satisfactions, but only the propitiatorie sacrifice, which CHRIST offered vpon the Crosse for our sinnes. The doctrine of <hi>Augustine</hi> agreeing with Scripture was this. That CHRIST taketh away our sinnes three maner of wayes, First, by forgiuing the sinnes wee haue committed.

                     <p>Finally, the writings of the Prophets and Apostles anent the doctrine of Satisfaction pointeth out CHRIST alanerly, by whome wee obteine forgiuenesse of our sinnes, as the Apostle PETER speaketh to CORNELIVS in these words. <hi>To him also giue all the Prophets witnesse, that through his</hi>

                     <p>If any man demand howe doth this Treatise of Indulgences belong vnto this Centurie, seeing that Indulgences, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dones against which I write, were not as yet in vse in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Church, yea we read not of <hi>Plenissimae Indulgentiae Ã  poena &amp; Ã  culpa</hi> before the 1200. yeere of our Lord.

The opinions of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Coelcstius</hi> anent the power of mans nature not supported by the grace of GOD, and the free will of man to doe good of it selfe, is so solidly refuted, and that by arguments taken out of holy Scripture alanerly, that it is to bee wished that other Councils had followed the example of this Council whereinto <hi>Augustine</hi> was president. The other cause of the meeting of this Councill was to constitute canons anent ecclesiasticall discipline, specially that no man should make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation from his owne bishop to bishops beyond sea, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace his own bishop did him wrong, then he should appeale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">

But now to leaue <hi>Damascene,</hi> &amp; the Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the writer of the historie of <hi>Damascenes</hi> life, who hath added vnto the multiplied number of <hi>Damascenes</hi> lies, an heape laid aboue, to the ende that his 3. orations <hi>pro Imaginibus</hi> may be like vnto a measure full, &amp; ouerrunning. And to conuert me to councils, wherein as in victuall houses and in barnes, all store of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are laide vp that can serue for the apparent allowance of Images. I superside at this time to speake much of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil gathered by <hi>Constantius Copronymus</hi> at <hi>Constantinople</hi> An. 755. whereinto 338. bishoppes vtterly damned the adoration of Images, and the setting of them vp in places where GOD was worshipped, and that for three principall causes. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the making and bowing downe to Images is expresly forbiden in Scripture, &amp; namely in the 2. Commandement of the Decalogue. Secondly, because the picturing of CHRIST (who is both God and man) and representing of him by a similitude is a diuiding of his two natures (so farre as in vs lieth) because his diuine nature cannot be pictured, and his humane narure should not be separated from his diuine nature. Thirdly, because the writings of holy and ancient farhers, damned the worshipping of Images, such as <hi>Epiphanius, Nazianzenus, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomus, Athanasius, Amphilochius, Theodorus</hi> bishop of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius Pamphili,</hi> whose graue sentences all damning adoration of Images, are most worthie to be read.</p>
                     <p>In the rest of this Treatise, I shall set downe (Godwilling) two opposite Councills, the one allowing the adoration of Images, the other disallowing it. The second Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> vnder the Empresse <hi>Irene</hi> ann. 789. gaue full allowance to the adoration of Images, out of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Graecia,</hi> and some other parts: with the ambassadours of <hi>Adrian</hi> bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> were assembled 350. bishoppes. On the other part, vnder the reigne of <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> Emperour of the VVest, ann. 794. a great Councill was assembled at <hi>Francford de maine,</hi> wherein the adoration of Images was vtterly disallowed, and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alleadged in the second Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> for adoration of Images, are clearely refuted in presence of <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> and Emperour of the VVest, and <hi>Theophilactus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> ambassadours of the bishoppe of <hi>Rome.</hi> In these two
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18670:259"/>
opposite Councills, let the iudicious Reader marke the great prouidence of GOD, who hath appointed, that there should bee contradiction to the lying doctrine, so that they who loue the trueth of GOD haue no neede to follow a false doctrine, in regarde there is no man that dare gainesay it. For I dare say, to the commendation of the Councill of <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> that the <hi>Ibides</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were neuer more readie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure the flying Serpents of <hi>Arabia,</hi> so that they would not suffer them to light in the coastes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> than the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of <hi>Francford</hi> was readie to vndoe all the foolish arguments of the second Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> proouing the adoration of Images.</p>
                     <p>Before I set these Councills in opposite tearmes of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the one to the other, the preludie of the Councill is worthie to bee marked. <hi>Adrian</hi> bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> sent a letter to the second Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> fraughted with lies, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> was a leper, that hee ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The groundes of this letter conteineth a masse of impudent lies. CONSTANTINE was not a leper, but a man gifted in soule, beautifull in body, and furnished with great giftes both of soule and body, and meete for great workes, as EVSEBIVS witne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The rest of his letter is like vnto the sandie ground and fabulous narration whereupon it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>The arguments of the second Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> prouing ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Images, may be distributed into foure rancks. Some are taken out of Scripture, others out of Fathers, the third
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18670:260"/>
rancke from common reason, the fourth from miracles. If I propound their arguments into an intelligible order, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>nsweres to them, I doe a benefite to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>The Cherubims, and the brasen Serpent were made by Gods commandement, and the Cherubimes were seated in the place <note place="margin">1 Argument.</note> of adoration: <hi>ergo</hi> Images may bee brought into the places of adoration.</p>
                     <p>There is a threefolde difference betwixt Images set vp in Churches to bee worshipped, and the Cherubimes in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <note place="margin">1. Answere.</note> First, the Cherubimes are made by the expresse comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of GOD, but the images set vp in Temples, are made expresse contrare to the Commandement of GOD. Secondly, the Cherubimes and brasen Serpent were repres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ntations of diuine mysteries. Thirdly, neither the Cherubimes nor brasen Serpent were made for adoration as images are, that are set vp in Temples. If any man bee not fully resolued with these an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres, let him vnderstand that the Law-giuer hath absolute authoritie, to make exceptions from his owne Lawe, but it is not lawfull to others, without warrant of GODS commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doe the like.

The argument inuented of later dayes, to prooue adoration <note place="margin">2. Argument,</note> of Images, is sophisticall: the dishonour done to the Image of CHRIST, redoundeth to himselfe: <hi>

The antecedent is prooued by the fact of <hi>Julian</hi> the apostate, in breaking in pieces the Image of Christ in <hi>Caesarea Philippi.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sozom. lib. 5 cap. 21. 2. Answere.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this it may bee answered, that the breaking downe of the brasen Image in <hi>Caesarea Philipps,</hi> was not a dishonouring of Christ in respect of the fact, that <hi>Iulian</hi> did, but in respect of the intention of the doer: but when this is proued, the consequent will not follow. For albeit an euill intention be eneugh to bring a man within the compasse of such as dishonour Christ, yet a good intention is not eneugh to proue, that we are honourers of Christ, but our actions also must bee ruled according to the commandements of Christ: and therefore they who haue only an intention to honour Christ, but in the meane time violateth his commandements, by worshipping him into an Image, shall neuer be counted honourers of Christ.</p>
                     <p>The fourth rancke of argumentes is taken from miracles wrought by Images. This argument is weake and faultie in all <note place="margin">An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from miracles. Answere.</note> sides. The antecedent is false, as shall be declared hereafter. But suppone that miracles had beene wrought in Images, or by images, it followeth not that they should be worshipped. In the wildernesse God cured his people miraculously, by looking to the brasen Serpent, yet it was not lawfull to worship the brasen Serpent, and when the people worshipped it, HEZEKIAS brake it in pieces, and called it <hi>Nebustan.</hi> In like maner, GOD wrought a notable miracle by the ministrie of PAVL and BARNABAS at <note place="margin">Acts 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Lystra,</hi> yet would they not suffer the people to worship them, and the comming of the Antichrist is foretold to be mighty by lying wonders, yet is not the Antichrist to bee worshipped. Therefore this argument is of no force, albeit it were true that miracles had beene wrought by Images.</p>
                     <p>But let vs examine the antecedent of this argument, they say, that miracles haue beene wrought by Image; For confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this, they bring in the viue similitude of Christes face printed into a cloth, and by Christ his application of the cloth

The Apostle PAVL neuer vsed the testimonie of the deuill, to proue himselfe to be the seruant of GOD, albeit the woman possessed with a spirite of diuination cried after PAVL and SILAS that they were the seruants of the most high GOD: and in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the arguments taken from the testimony of Sathan should <note place="margin">Acts 16. vers. 17.</note> be eschewed, for GOD hath not appointed him to be our tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs consider the multiplied honours of images hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the second Councill Of <hi>Nice</hi> vnder this one worde ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Images. This adoration standeth in decking of them, kneeling vnto them, saying of prayers before them, censing, lighting of candles, vowes, offerings, festuall dayes, salutations, building of Churches, and altars. All these honours were done both to the image, and to the Sainct represented by the image. The decking of images is damned by the Prophet HOSEA, and it is indeede a spoyling of the poore, who haue neede of such <note place="margin">Hos. 2.</note> support as is bestowed in vaine vpon images, who haue no need of ornaments and clothing.

                     <p>Before I make an ende of this Treatise, it may be demanded, Howe could the worshipping of images get place at that time when Emperours and Councils with all their might contended in the contrarie, that images should not bee worshipped. The Emperours <hi>Philippicus, Leo lsaurus, Constantinus, Copronymus,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> his sonne, were all seriously bent to suppresse the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of images, and in the VVest, <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> and Emperour, was present in the Councill of <hi>Francsord,</hi> where the worshipping of images was damned To this I answere, that the anthoritie of the bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was at this time so increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that they durst encounter with the Emperours of the East, who were farre distant from them. <hi>Constantine</hi> B. of <hi>Rome</hi> razed out of Charters, the name of the Emperour <hi>Philippicus, Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> 2. did excommunicate <hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> and forbade to pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto him. <hi>Gregorius</hi> 3. in conternpt of <hi>Leo</hi> gathered a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, and ordained the worshipping of images. As concerning <hi>Carolus Magnas</hi> who was proclaimed Emperour by the speciall mandate of the chaire of <hi>Rome,</hi> the question is greater, Howe could the bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> tolerate, that worshipping of images should bee damned by a Councill gathered by this new Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour whom they had authorized by their owne trauels. To this Ianswere, that the bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> did as the ancient <hi>Romanes</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">August. de ciwit.

                        <hi>Pipinus</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> reft from the Emperour of the East, and gaue it to the chaire of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the excessiue desire (I say) which they had to keepe this rich prey, they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> but after his death, they could not suffer his posteritie to take such a doing against the worshipping of Images, as <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> had done. In so much, that in the dayes of the reigne of <hi>Ludouicus Pius,</hi> it was hard to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to protect <hi>Claudius Taurinensis</hi> against the chaufing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the bishops of <hi>Italie</hi> who hated him, because hee cast out Images out of his Church in <hi>Turin,</hi> yea, and <hi>Claudius Taurinensis</hi> directly impugned the adoration of Images by a booke writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him vpon that subiect, whereunto none answere was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen during his lifetime, but after his death many were found like barking dogges railing against his blessed memoriall, and that so much the more, because in his booke he rubbed quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the surfeiting pleasures of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, who were better content to worshippe the Crosse of Christ, because that was easie to bee done, than to beare the Crosse of Christ, because that was a laborious worke, and painefull to the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Finally, it is to be noted, that the defection of some men of great account, was a stumbling blocke to many others. <hi>Paulus Cyprius</hi> B. of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> left his charge, entred into a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, and lamented that he had consented to the abolishing of Images. <hi>Gregorius</hi> B. of <hi>Neocesarea,</hi> one of the chiefe disallowers of Images in the Councill holden at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> gaue in his supplicant bill in the second Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> confessed his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and subscribed to the decreet of that vnhappie Councill, by whose example the bishops of <hi>Nice, Hierapolis,</hi> of the Isles of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and <hi>Carpathus</hi> were mooued to doe the like. Let this bee a warning to them who are in eminent places, that they fall not from the trueth of GOD, lest by their fall they procure a great ruining and desolation to the house of GOD. The LORD keepe vs from defection, to whome bee praise, and glory for euer.</p>

This dispensation with the rigour of olde discipline was called <hi>indulgentia,</hi> but in Poperie, which was beginning in this Centurie to haue great vpper hand, the abuse of these two words, hath vtterly vndone the ancient puritie of religion and discipline.</p>
                     <p>The word satisfaction, which of old was referred to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, now in Poperie is referred to God in this maner.

And to make this doctrine the more plausible vnto the people, they bring in the similitude of a man sailing in a ship, if he fall out of it into the sea, the ship (say they) goeth away without recouerie, and incace he find not another

vessell to support his distressed estate, and to bring him to land, he must needes perish and drowne: euen so (say they) if after baptisme we commit any transgression, we must either be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by our owne satisfactions, els wee must perish in our sinnes.

The chiefe questions betwixt vs &amp; the <hi>Romane</hi> Church anent Originall sinne are two: First, whether or no concupiscence, which remaineth in the godly after their baptisme be in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acception called sinne or not: for the <hi>Romane</hi> Church saith, that it is called sinne by the Apostle, because it came of sinne, <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> and it tendeth to sinne, but not because it is sinne, is a proper acception.

                     <p>Now anent the first question, I affirme that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>

Remember also that the Apostle is speaking of all men, yea and of himselfe also in the estate whereinto hee was presently, when he wrote this epistle, that is, after he was baptized.

Nowe the curses of the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> which they cast out so prodigally against vs, are not worthie one figge, because they are not grounded in reason, but are expresly repugnant to the written worde of GOD.</p>
                     <p>The second question is this, whether or no is concupiscence a sinne before we yeeld the consent of our heart vnto it. To this I answere, that if they vnderstood by concupiscence a bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, it is sinne euen in infants, who doe not knowe what it is to consent either to good or euill: but if they meane of the first motion or cogitation of sinne presented vnto the soule, apparently this question belongeth rather to actuall than to originall sinne: but whether it belongeth to the root of sinne, or to the branches of sinne, I shall produce three reasons wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first motion of sinne is sinne, euen before we yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it the consent of our heart. First, because a consent is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing, called good or euill, according to the nature of that thing whereunto we giue our consent, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the consent is euill, because that motion of sinne whereunto wee consented was euill, and if it had not beene euill in it selfe, the consent of our heart giuen vnto it, had neuer beene called euill.</p>

                     <p>In the wordes following, <hi>his heart is not vpright in him,</hi> the Prophet declareth the inconuenience that followeth vpon the leaning to our owne strength, to wit, wee are vtterly disapoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of our expectation, and whereas we looked for rest &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie to our consciences, the contrare falleth out, that wee are like vnto men out of their right wits, wauering minded, &amp; so tossed with doubting, that they knowe not whar course to take, because their minde is not solidly settled, nor vpright within them. This is the iust Iudgement of GOD, punishing the contempt of that quiet and peaceable harbery that is to bee found in the bosome of the compassions of GOD in his Sonne CHRIST IESVS: they who despise this sure harbery, are worthy to be tossed with mighty stormes, and to bee in hazard and ieopardie of their lifes, as the Centurion was, who despised <note place="margin">Acts 27.</note> the wholsome counsell of PAVL at <hi>Candie.</hi>

                     <p>Before I leaue the wordes of the Prophet HABACCVK, let vs yet againe ponder the Emphaticke worde <hi>Behold,</hi> for by seeing and hearing some good lessons may bee learned, Beholde men who haue leaned vpon the staffe of GOD in our owne time, how peaceably haue they concluded their dayes, <note place="margin">Luc. 2</note> with SIMEON reioycing that they had scene the saluation of GOD. And on the other side men who haue leaned to their own righteousnesse (albeit only in a part) what agonie, &amp; trouble of conscience haue they found in their last battell, vntill they haue forsaken all confidence in their owne merits, and leaned onely vnto the merites of the passion of our sweet LORD and Sauiour IESVS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>The Papistes in our COVNTRIE for the most part haue beene like vnto the fishes called <hi>Amphbia</hi> which can liue both in the Sea and on the Land: but when any man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches neere to doe them harme, they trust more to the sca than to the land: euen so when the terrors of death beginnes to

shake our countrey people, then they leaue confidence in their owne merites, and betake themselues vnto the deepe <hi>Ocean, sea</hi> of the mercies of GOD in IESVS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>In the second heade I promised to speake of the difference betwixt Iustification &amp; Sanctification, &amp; betwixt the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <note place="margin">Rom. 4. Ps<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Our Iustification is a free for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of our sinnes for CHRISTS sake, and a free imputation of his righteousnesse to vs. Our Sanctification is an inherent <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> holinesse begunne in vs by the operation of GODS Spirit, to bee a testimonie that wee are in CHRIST. The not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing of the difference betwixt these two hath beene, and as yet is the ground of great errours. True it is, that these two gifts are freely bestowed vpon vs at one and the selfe-same time, yet are they distinct in order of causes, because Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the ground, from whence Sanctification as an effect doth flow, And like as the starres called <hi>Pleiades</hi> or <hi>Vergiliae,</hi> they doe arise and manifest themselues vnto the worlde all at one time: yet are they distinct starres, and <hi>Electra</hi> is not <hi>Alcinoe,</hi> nor <hi>Alcinoe Celeno,</hi> nor <hi>Celeno M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ree, whose apparition, and disparition, albeit it bee inseparable, yet are they distinct starres: Euen so Iustification and Sanctification are inseparably linked together, yet are they two distinct giftes of GOD. I will vse yet another similitude for declaration of the same purpose. If a sword be laide into the fire, vntill the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall thereof be firie coloured, this sworde at one time hath two powers, one to cut, and another to burne, yet is not cutting burning, nor burning cutting, but these two distinct powers are at one time inseparably in one subiect: Euen so are wee at one and the selfe same time both iustified and sanctified, yet are they still two different giftes of GOD.</p>
                     <p>Nowe the doctrine of Iustification rightly taught is our cihefe incouragement to Sanctification, and on the other parte the doctrine of Sanctification rightly taught, giueth vnto vs the greatest assurance of our Iustification. A man who is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that his sinnes are freely forgiuen, that hee is beloued of GOD in CHRIST, yea and that hee hath put on CHRIST, as the <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> Apostle speaketh, he may with courage, and gladnesse addresse
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18670:269"/>
himselse to lead an holy life, being fully perswaded, that GOD will accept of his willing obedience, albeit it can not be perfect in all points, so long as wee dwell into this sinsull tabernacle. And on the other side, when the spirit of sanctification worketh in our members, it is a token that we are incorporated into the stocke of CHRIST by true faith. For like as the spirit of man quickneth no member that is cut off from his bodie, euen so the spirit of CHRIST worketh not true sanctification in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who is not made a member of Christes body by true iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith. For this cause the <hi>Romane</hi> Church blames vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deseruedly, as though by teaching that we are iustified only by faith, we had impaired the zeale of the people in doing of good workes. To this I answere, that more credite is to be giuen to the holy Apost. PAVL, who was taught in all trueth immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Christ himselfe, nor to the calumnies of the aduersaries of the doctrine of grace: for the Apostle exhorting the <hi>Romanes</hi> to agodly conuersation, he saith, <hi>I beseech you, brethren sor the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 12. vers. 1</note> 
                        <hi>of God, that yee offer vp your bodies an holy, liuely and acceptable sacrifice to God:</hi> and what mercies are those, I pray you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostle speaketh, but the mercies whereof hee hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in the former parte of that Epistle, to wit, GOD hath freely elected vs, he hath freely instified vs, he hath freely san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified vs, and hee shall freely in his appointed time glorifie vs. Nowe in regard of all these mercies, let vs endeuoure to leade a holy conuersation, as it becommeth them who are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of so great mercies. This holy exhortation could not haue beene drawne from a more pithie, more persuasiue and mouing ground. Therefore wee will walke in the footsteps of the holy Apostles, and continue still exhorting the people to leade an holy conuersation in regarde of the rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of GOD in CHRIST, who hath freely elected them to eternall life, and freely iustified them by faith in CHRIST alanerly.</p>
                     <p>Whereas they obiect that experience it selfe testifieth, that people are not nowe so bent and readie to doe good, as when the <hi>Romane</hi> doctrine was sounded in their cares, that we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified partly by faith, and partly by workes. If by good workes theymeane workes of superstition, such as leaning
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18670:270"/>
in their legacies rents to sacrificing Priestes for saying of soule Masses, wee are glad that by the preaching of the Gospell su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition is somewhat abated, like as the great d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But if they meane by good workes, such workes as GOD hath commanded in his holy law, then I answere, that the faults of some people are not to be imputed to the doctrine of the Gospell, but to the corruption of mans nature, continually repining against the knowne trueth of GOD. Like as when RACHEL left her fathers house, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nowe who shall beare the blame of this fault? whether the holy calling of GOD, or IACOB the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the LORDS calling to his wiues, or RACHEL, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not the calling of GOD aright? Here I know euery man will lay the blame vpon RACHEL, because shee left in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance her fathers house, yet she left not the corrupt maners of her fathers house. In like maner in our dayes, the feastred maners of the people, are not to bee imputed to the Gospell, neither to the true preachers of it: but to the corrupt nature of man taking <hi>occasion by the Lawe to worke all kind of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. vers. 8.</note> And in like maner taking occasion by the Gospell to bee more bent to euill doing than euer it was before: but let true Christians marke, that albeit the doctrine of Iustification by faith only, were a thousand wayes abused, yet because it is the holy Apostolicke doctrine, and necessare vnto eternall life, it must needes be preached, and beleeued of all the true disciples of CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>The Law and the Gospell goe not so in handes together, as Iustification and Sanctification does: but rather by the great prouidence of GOD the one standeth ouer against the other, and either of them pointeth out the finger to the other.

                     <p>Surely ignorance is the mother of many errours, and they who seeke righteousnes in the Law, they are ignorant in many things. First, they knowe not the right end, wherefore the Lawe <note place="margin">Galat. 3. vers. 19. Rom. 7. vers. 14. Levit. 18. vers. 5.</note> was giuen, to wit, for transgression, that is, to manifest it, but not to wipe it away. Secondly, they know not the nature of the Law, that it is spirituall, to the perfection whereof carnall men cannot attaine. Thirdly, they are ignorant of the strict condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the legall Couenant, which binds vs vnto a full obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of all things commanded in the Law. Fourthly, they are ignorant of the perill that insueth vpon the seeking of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesss of the Lawe, that they cannot submit themselues to <note place="margin">Rom. 10. vers. 3.</note>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:18670:271"/>
the righteousnesse of GOD. When all these inconueniences doe follow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> secking iustification by the Law, or by works, it were a wise course to seeke righteousnes where it may be found, that is to say, in faith, which coupleth vs to CHRIST, whome the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. vers. 30.</note> hath giuen vnto vs to be our wisdome, our iustification, our sanctification, and our redemption: and let it not be said, that the fishers of <hi>Busphorus Tracius</hi> in seeking fish, are wiser than we in seeki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For they spread not out their nets in the shallow coast of <hi>Chalcedone,</hi> where no fish can bee found, but in the deepe coast of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> where abundance of fih are to bee found: Euen so, if wee bee wise, let vs seeke saluation where it may be found.</p>
                     <p>In the thirde heade it is to be declared, that neither in our owne workes, neither in other mens works (CHRITTS workes only excepted) can a sauing power be found to worke our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Our workes are considered two maner of wayes. First, as they are before our regeneration altogether sinfull, and no man doth affirme that such workes can saue vs, either in whole or in part, Secondly, as they are after our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of these workes much is spoken, namely, that Christs death is so meritorious, that by vertue of it he hath purchased a power to our workes after regeneration, that they might merite good things at the hands of GOD. To this I will returne such an answere as <hi>Alamundarus</hi> prince of <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> returned to the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heretiques sent by <hi>Seuerus</hi> to perswade him to their opinion. To whome hee replied, that strange tythings were lately come vnto his eares, namely, that GABRIEL the Angell of GOD was dead. When they answered, that was impossible, and repugnant to reasoun, that an Angel should die. Then the Prince subioyned, that like as they would not r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In like maner I say to Papistes, that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked assertions not confirmed by testimonies of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are nothing to vs, but wee may lay them aside with as great libertie, as they are prodigall in allcadging them.</p>

Wee will answere to such arguments as seeme to be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced with some appearance of Scripture. Now they say that the worde <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> frequently vsed in Scripture importeth the merite of our good workes, because GOD vouchsafeth vpon them a rewarde. To this I answere, that if Scripture be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serred with Scripture, that same thing, which in one place is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap>, that is a reward, in another place it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap> that is, an heritage, in these wordes, <hi>Come yee blessed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 25. vers. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>of my father, inherite the Kingdome prepared for you, from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the world.</hi> When that thing, which properly is an inheritance is called a reward, it is spoken metaphorically, in respect it is giuen in the end of the world, as an hire is giuen to a feruant in the end of the day.</p>
                     <p>The second argument proouing the merite of mens works, and consequently Iustification by workes in a part, is this, that some men in Scripture are called worthie, as when it is saide to the Angell of the Church of <hi>Sardis, Thou hast a few names yet in Sardis, which haue not defiled their garments, and they shall walke</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Apoe. 3. vers. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>with me in white, for they are worthie.</hi> To this I answere the godly are called worthie, not in themselues, but in Christ, who hath made them Kings, and Priestes vnto GOD. In <note place="margin">Apoe. 4. vers. 12.</note> themselues they are called vnworthie, as when it is said, <hi>No man was found wortbie to open and to read the booke.</hi> And in another place it is saide, that <hi>the afflictions of this present <note place="margin">Aooc. 5. vers. 4</note> time are not Wortlne of the glorie that it to be shewed vnto vs.</hi> Nowe it is knowne, that patient suffering of euill for Christes <note place="margin">Rom. 8. vers. 18.</note> sake, is a degree of greater obedience, than willing doing of good, and if the suffering of the Sainctes be not worthie of the glory that is to be reueiled, how much lesse can our doings bee worthie of that glorious inheritance.</p>
                     <p>The third argument is taken from the nature of a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall couenant bound vp betwixt two parties, which doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that condition should bee keeped: but so it is, that GOD hath couenanted with such as liue a godly life, that they shall dwell in the holy mountaine of God: therefore by vertue of this Couenant men who ieades a good life, are worthie to dwel <note place="margin">Psal. 25.</note> in heauen.</p>
                     <p>To this I answere, that this couenant foresaid, is either Legal
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18670:272"/>
or Euangelicall: if it be Legall, we cannot fulfill the condition thereof, because the Law requireth a perfect obedience, which we cannot attaine vnto. If it bee an Euangelicall couenant, the Mediator of the newe couenant IESVS Christ is present at the couenant making: for whose sake I grant, that GOD promiseth vnto vs a dwelling place in heauen, and for his sake also he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth his promise, &amp; giueth vnto vs a resting place in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mountaine, and in all this haue we no cause to reioyce in our selues, but in the mercies of our GOD. Concerning our satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whereby the <hi>Romane</hi> Church saith, That sinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after baptisme should be pardoned. This belongeth to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Treatise of Indulgences, and satisfactions, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I ouerpasse this point of mens merites with silence.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> Church that Mistresse of errour hath not onely learned vs to leane vpon our owne merites, but also to leane vpon the merites of other men, such as holy Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>es, and Martyres, because some of them haue not onely ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Commandements of GOD, but also haue done more than the Law of GOD commanded. For example, the Lawe of GOD forbiddeth to commit adulterie, fornication, and all kind of vncleannesse: but many of the Apostles, Prophets &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, <note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> not only abstained from all kind of whordome, but also from mariage, &amp; such workes are called in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, workes of supererogation: these doe come into the treasure of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> as the Vicar of Christ, and he is a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of them, to such as haue need. O deepenesse of errours forged by Sathan, &amp; repugnant vnto it selfe. If abstinence from mariage bee a worke of supererogation, then either must ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, euen in men hauing a spirituall calling, bee counted a thing lawfull and agreable to GODS holy Law, or else the absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from it cannot bee called a worke of supererogation. I grant that some fathers counted abstinence from mariage a worke of Evangelicall perfection, like as the selling of all their possessions, and distributing them to the poore, but it entred not in their hearts to call such workes of Evangelicall perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, workes of supererogation, to bee sent to the treasure of the bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might bee a dispensator of them to such as had neede.</p>

                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:18670:272"/>
But nowe suppone that any such workes had beene in the Sainctes of GOD, howe can they bee imperted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to others? Can the oyle of the wise Virgines bee <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> distributed to the foolish Virgines? It cannot be, because it cannot suffice them both. Likewise when wee compeare <note place="margin">Rom. 3. vers. 14.</note> before the iudge of the worlde, wee must compeare clad with the innocencie of CHRIST, and not with the merites of his Sainctes: for the Apostle saith, <hi>Put on the Lord Iesus,</hi> but hee saith not, Put on the merites of the Sainctes. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, wee must bee acceptable as the holy Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and Martyres were acceptable, but so it is, that they <note place="margin">1 Ioan. 2. vers. 1.</note> were acceptable to GOD onely in Christ, as the Apostle saith, <hi>If any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the iust.</hi> Here none exception is made of Prophets, Apostles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, <note place="margin">Apos. 14.</note> but all must be acceptable to GOD for Christs sake alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly. Finally, the holymen of God when they die, they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them. If the soules of the holy fathers doe goe to heauen, to the bosome of ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM, to the paradise of GOD, howe can wee thinke that their workes doe goe to the treasure of the bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> except they would say, that the soules of all the holy fathers are gone to the treasure of the bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> also, and their works and merites following them, are altogether lighted in his treasure. But lest I should anticipate the treatise of Indulgences, I referre all farder discourse vnto the owne place. Intreating the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus of his vnspeakable fauour, to remooue the mistie cloud of ignorance from our soules, that our heartes bee not transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the loue of the Creator, to the loue of the creatures: but that we may seeke saluation in Christ, in whom only it may be found: to whom be praise for euer.</p>

But now <hi>(Madam)</hi> the course of the History hath led me so far forward, that I must touch the very apple of their eye, and enter into their most holy place, and declare, that their seruice, which they count most holy, is but vile abomination in the sight of GOD: And their doctrine concerning the Vicar of Christ, the successour of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the holinesse of the Masse, and the plurality of their Sacraments added to Baptisme, and the Lordes Supper, is but like wind: And wee are warned by the Apostle <hi>Paul, that wee should no more bee children, waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and carrie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> Church in our dayes bring vp their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as the harlots of <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in <hi>Phaenitia</hi> brought vp their children before the dayes of the good Emperour <hi>Constantine.</hi> These children afore-saide knewe not their Fathers, for they were strangers: and the Harlots of <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> had liberty to prostitute themselues to the lust of strangers: so it came to passe, if children had bene procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this <hi>libidinus</hi> copulation, the stranger was gone, and the procreated child depended onely vpon the mother, for hee knewe not his father: Euen so, in the subsequent

                     <p>Nowe the Great and <hi>Uniuersall Bisoph</hi> of our foules, as holie Scripture describeth him, is hee onely who hath broken downe the partition wall, and who hath made both <hi>Iewe &amp; Gemile</hi> one House-holde and familie of God, and hee who hath made them both <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 14</note> both one Sheep-folde, like as there is but one great Shepheard, <note place="margin">Ioan. 10. 26</note> &amp; he who giueth his life for his Sheep, &amp; who knoweth them all by their names, and who giueth vnto them all eternall life.

To this I answere, That it is the labour of curious &amp; idle men, to dispute vpon names, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as in substance &amp; matter there is no disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No man doth offend when the Apostles are called lights, because they are neither equalled nor matched with Christ, but only the liberality of Christ is commended, who out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his light bestoweth a portion vpon his seruants, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue light in the house of God. But when the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> is called <hi>Uniuersall Bishop,</hi> so many other prerogatiues are linked with this title, that he is equalled with Christ: as namely, That he is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not erre in matters of faith, he may dispense with the law of God, he may correct y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very testamentall legacy of Christ, &amp; ordaine the holy Sacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Supper to be otherwise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred than the institution of Christ beareth. Nowe is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion not of words only, (which oft times being lenified &amp; mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dulcenesse of tolerable interpretations, are ouer-pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the peace of the Church) but the question betwixt vs and the <hi>Romane</hi> Church is of matter &amp; substance, and of the very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour only belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ging to Christ. If it had bene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpose of Christ to make mortall man on earth his Vicare he had done to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as <hi>Pharo</hi> did to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that is, he had plucked y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ring from his own finger, &amp; put it vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> finger of his Vicare, so that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight of <note place="margin">Gen. 41. 42</note> Christs ring (that is, of power to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fer eternall life to all Christs Sheepe) had beene an vndoubted token, that Christ had indeed constituted him his Vicare on earth.</p>
                     <p>As touching the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom the feeding of Christs Sheepe was recommended, it is to bee considered, that <hi>Peter</hi> in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to the dignitie of his Apostleship, from which he had fallen by his three-folde deniall of Christ, and to be made equall againe with the rest of his brethren.

                     <p>The preheminence that God licenciateth to bee sought ouer brethren, is like to the preheminence of <hi>Moses</hi> ouer the Elders: he ascended higher vpon the mountaine of God than they did: and when he came downe againe from the mountaine of God, his face shined with greater splendor of celestiall glorie, than <note place="margin">Exo. 34. 29</note> the faces of others did.

                     <p>This supremacie aforesaid so vnhonestly sought, was vsed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannously &amp; vnrighteously.

                     <p>It grieued the bishops of ROME, that they were bound by the

In like manner, hee compelled <hi>Lotharius,</hi> prince of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and brother to <hi>Lewes</hi> 2. to forsake his newe married wife, <hi>Valdrada,</hi> and to adhere againe vnto his first wife named <hi>Thiethberga,</hi> vnder paine of cursing. This is the first time wherein the bishop of Rome durst take bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to threaten the princes of FRANCE with his cursinges. So the bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who fished in all muddy waters, partly by the intestine discord of the posteritie of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and partly by their faults, he increased his owne estate mightily: so that hee became like vnto a mightie Hunter, who goeth to the Forrest of intention to pursue one beast onely, neuerthelesse his dogges doe no sooner barke, but all the beasts in the Forrest are agaste, and with feare and trembling looke when they shall be pursued. This is that Pope whome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                        <hi>Adrian</hi> the second, by those same meanes, increased his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal authoritie, by which <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the third had first grounded the popedome, namely by flattering of a notable parricide <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius</hi> Emperour of the East, who had traitorously slaine the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Michael,</hi> who had made him associate with himselfe in gouernement.

that in the eight generall Councell, assembled in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for deposition of <hi>Photius,</hi> and restitution of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> no man was permitted to haue ingresse to the Councell, except hee who first subscribed to the supremacie of the bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuer, the Emperour <hi>Basilius</hi> procured, that the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> should be subject to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not to the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi> How beit this ordinance, violentlie extorted, contrarie both to equitie and custome, could not continue long.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Adrian</hi> succeeded pope <hi>shonne</hi> the ninth, who restored <hi>Photius,</hi> at the desire of <hi>Basilius</hi> Emperour of the East. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie of pope <hi>Ihonne</hi> the ninth, who restored <hi>Photius,</hi> whom his predecessor, <hi>Adrian</hi> the second, had deposed, furnisheth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to <hi>Baronius,</hi> to affirme, that this is the pope, who was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to haue beene of the foeminine sexe, in respect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie of his flexible and effeminate minde: and so much the more, because that pope <hi>Ihonne</hi> the ninth not onely restored <hi>Photius</hi> to his place againe, but also ramuersing his affection againe, he cursed <hi>Photius,</hi> because hee had gathered a Councell at <hi>Constantinople</hi> of 380. bishops, wherein hee annulled the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the preceeding Councell, vulgarlie called the eight Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell. Moreouer, it was ordained in this Councell conueened by <hi>Photius,</hi> that the pope of <hi>Rome</hi> shoulde accept no man into his fellowship, whome the patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> had exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>municated: by this decree cutting off all appellations from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> This fact so grieued the pope, that hee cursed <hi>Photius,</hi> whome before hee had restored to his office againe. Heere I leaue <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> reckoning one against another concerning the feminine pope: <hi>Baronius</hi> saith, it was pope <hi>Ihonne</hi> the ninth, whose inconstancie gaue occasion to the rumoured opinion of the feminine pope: <hi>Onuphrius</hi> saieth, it was the inconstancie of a libidinous pope <hi>Ihonne</hi> the twelft, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing all the desires of an harlot: but if either of them had written truelie, it had beene more competent in such a sense to haue saide, that there had beene manie femenine popes, rather than one onelie.</p>

                     <p>The apostasie whereof the apostle prophecieth, is not a dese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in manners onely, but also a departing from the faith, as is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18670:311"/>
clearlie witnessed in another place, in those wordes, <hi>Nowe the Spirit speaketh euidentlie, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,</hi> &amp;c. Defection in manners is so vsuall a thing, that <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 1</note> where the word of God is preached in most powerfull manner, there also corruption in manners doeth abound, arguing the euill inclination of our nature, which taketh occasion, by the commandement, and worketh in vs all kinde of concupiscence: so that the corruption of our nature is like vnto a gutter of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Roman. 7. 8</note> the passage whereof is hindered: it gorgeth, swelleth, and setteth forwarde its owne accustomed waye more impetuouslie than euer it did before. But the Apostle is speaking of a deeper mysterie, and of a thing more rarely contingent, to wit, of an apostasie from the faith. This is the sharpest of all punishments, which GOD inflicted vpon mankinde for the contempt of his trueth, to cast off a people into a reprobate minde, whether wee looke to the actions of God, who rejecteth, or to the miseries of them, who are rejected. The actions of God, who rejecteth, are set downe by the Prophet <hi>Zacharie, The Lord will not feede that people, yea, he will breake his shepheards staffe,</hi> to wit, the staffe called <note place="margin">Zach. 11</note> beautifull, &amp; the staffe called bandes. The miseries of them, who are rejected, are set downe by the Prophet <hi>Esai,</hi> in these wordes, <hi>Yee shall heare indeede, but yee shall not vnderstand: yee shall plainelie</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Isai. 6. 9. 10</note> 
                        <hi>see, and not perceiue: make the heart of this people fatte,</hi> &amp;c. So it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, when this heauie judgement is inflicted, there is no comfort to bee founde, neither in Heauen aboue, nor in the Earth beneath: When wee looke vp vnto God, hee will feede vs no longer: when wee looke downe to our selues, wee receiue no comfort by the externall ministerie of the worde, it is to vs the sauour of death: yea, and wee are in so desolate a case, as the Prophet speaketh, <hi>That that dieth, let it die: and that that perisheth, let it perish: and let the remnant euerie one eate the flesh of another.</hi> Of <note place="margin">Zach. 11. 9</note> this vnsupportable and remedilesse euill, that there should bee a defection from the faith, neither could the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> of olde, nor the visible Church of late euer be content patiently to heare, because it seemed to bee repugnant to the euerlasting couenant of God, made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seede. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, that same blessed mouth, which made the couenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seede, fore-tolde also, that they should bee
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18670:311"/>
cast off into a reprobate sense, and that the Great Shephearde would feede them no longer. Now both these things being vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the blessed mouth of God, it is certaine, that there is infallible truth in both: &amp; it is better, &amp; more agreeable with the honour of God, to search out what way both these thinges can consist without impeachment one of another, than so to talke of the couenant, that wee shoulde gainsay the prophesie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Church of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> hath wiselie obserued, that the couenant of God is not annulled by the defection of the most part of the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The <hi>Romane</hi> Church in like manner, casteth vp, that God hath promised, that the <note place="margin">Matth. 16</note> gates of Hell shall not preuaile against the Church. And the same God, by the mouth of his holie Apostle hath fore-tolde, that there shoulde bee a defection from the Faith. Both these <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2</note> Prophesies must bee true, neither doeth the apostasie of the great multitude presuppose, that the Church of Christ is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, or the promise of God made of none effect, but in the middest of this apostasie a remnant are saued, according to the election of grace. <hi>Ioseph,</hi> in the yeeres of famine, was prouident, <note place="margin">Genes. 47</note> and kept corne asore-hand, both for foode to men and beastes, and for seede to the ground: But Christ is more prouident in the yeeres of horrible apostasie from the faith, to keepe afore-hand a saued hand-full, as seede for the propagation of the Church. Wherefore, let no man conclude of the long lasting apostasie of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or yet of the Popish Church, that the couenant of God is of none effect, and that the Church is perished.</p>

Nowe it is to bee marked, that these two names of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> to wit, the man of sinne, and the childe of perdition, they goe conjunctly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because when sinne is neare, destruction also is at hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept sinne by repentance be abolished: And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a woe against <hi>them that put farre away the euill day, and approach to the seat of iniquitie.</hi> More-ouer, the Apostle fore-telleth, that <note place="margin">Amos 6. 3</note> the <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall bee disclosed, or reueiled: that is, how soeuer he shall maske himselfe with the vizards of holy titles, that he is the Vicare of Christ on earth, &amp; the successour of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; to him is concredite the care of all the sheepe of Christ, dispersed in the whole world: Neuerthelesse, he shalbe stripped naked, &amp; all these masks shall be plucked from his face, and he shall be knowne to bee an aduersarie to Christ, and an abuser of Christes people.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18670:313"/>
out by one of the names of the Deuill, to wit, that hee is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, to God, to his word, and to his Saincts, yea, an aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the superlatiue degree, because hee vsurpeth the honour only due to Christ. Mortall Princes count all subjectes, who are disobedient to their lawes, to bee their aduersaries: but if anie man vsurpe the title of the Kingdome, the King will count him his corriuall, and principall aduersarie: Euen so, amongst all the aduersaries of Christ, hee is counted his principall enemie, who enricheth himselfe with the honour due to Christ onelie. Howsoeuer he call himselfe the seruant of the seruants of God, yet indeede hee vsurpeth vpon himselfe higher honour than is due vnto a mortall man, and therefore is called an aduersarie to God: for the Lord will judge the world according to his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Roman.</hi> 2. 16. and not according to our conceites.</p>
                     <p>The two principall pointes of the honour of Christ, are Faith and Obedience. The <hi>Romane Antichrist,</hi> for to moue ignorant people to put their trust in him, as the Vicare of Christ in earth, taketh vpon him power to open the gates of Paradise to whom he pleaseth, as an absolute commander of HeauÃ©, and to deliuer to the Deuill and send to Hell, by his anathemes and cursinges, whom he pleaseth, as absolute commander of Hell, and to loose prisoned soules out of purgatorie, as absolute commaunder of purgatorie, and to distribute the kingdomes of the earth at his pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>The <hi>Antichrist</hi> is said to exalt himselfe against all that is called God, or is worshipped, because he taketh vpon him to dispense against the law of GOD, which argueth, that he arrogateth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe authoritie aboue the lawe-maker: for no lawe (as I

Let vs in this point marke the degrees of the defection of the visible Church, not vnlike vnto the decaying estate of a diseased man: First, his naturall sappe and moysture decayeth: Secondly, corrupt humours doe abound: Thirdly, his blood is inflamed, &amp; perilous feuers seazing vpon his bodie, doe threaten death: Euen so in the Church, when holy exercises of prayer and preaching are intermitted, this is a biginning of euill: Next, when superstitions, rites, and ceremonies, seruing to no profitable vse, doe abound in the Church, (as vitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the bodie) then is the defection increased: But when the visible Church admitteth another Law-giuer than Christ, and stoupeth vnder the yoke of his obedience, then is the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the faith come vnto a ripenesse, and the <hi>Antichrist</hi> then siueth in the Temple of God. shewing himselfe that hee is God: and if the Lord had not kept vnto himselfe a remnant by his gracious election, the visible Church had beene like vnto <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi>

                     <p>In the 5. verse, hee saieth, <hi>Remember yee not, that when I was yet with you, I tolde you these thinges?</hi> This verse is not superfluously casten in, to admonish the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> that the comming of the <hi>Antichrist</hi> was a matter of great moment, and tending to the hurt of manie mens soules: therefore it was needefull, that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous premonition shoulde bee made vnto the Saincts, to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the danger to come. This is the Lordes customable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in matters graue, weightie, and serious, to giue aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes proportionallie agreeing with the nature of the thing fore-tolde. But what shall wee speake of the lethargie and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of the worlde? wee neuer read that men were so slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishe, and ouer-laide with so deepe securitie, as when they were fore-warned of great thinges to come: as if the loude sounde of

                     <p>Now follow the 6. and 7. verses, with the beginning of the 8. verse, <hi>And now yee know what with-holdeth, that he might beercuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his owne time: for the mysterie of iniquitie doeth alreadie worke: onlie he, who now with-holdeth shall let, till he bee taken out of the way: and then shall the wicked man be reueiled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The naturall order requireth, that in these wordes three things should bee entreated: First, howe the mysterie of iniquitie beganne to worke in <hi>Paules</hi> dayes: Secondlie, who is this, that should bee a let and hinderance to the <hi>Antichrist:</hi> And thirdlie, when was it, that hee was made out of the way, so that he could hinder the <hi>Antichrist</hi> no longer. The mysterie of iniquitie began to worke euen in the dayes of <hi>Paule,</hi> because some Heretiques sprang vp at that time, who denied the diuinitie of Christ, such as <hi>Ebion,</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> these appertained to the kingdome of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> because they were his fore-runners, beginning with entising speaches to seduce men from the trueth of God. And what was wanting in them, except power, and vncontrolled authoritie, to bring to a full ripenesse the worke of defection, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie begunne. So Heresies, and the doctrine of lies, is the very first foundation of the kingdome of the <hi>Antichrist.</hi> And like as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18670:315"/>
an Eagle, that buildeth her nest in the face of a steepie rocke, the first sticke that shee carrieth to her nest, belongeth to the masse thereof: Euen so, without all controuersie, the Heretiques, who prepared a way to the kingdome of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the bodie of his kingdome. If any man shall object, that the chaire of <hi>Rome</hi> damned the olde Heresies of <hi>Ebion, Cerynthus,</hi> and of the <hi>Manichies,</hi> and therefore such men cannot bee justlie reckoned to appertaine to his kingdome, whome hee separated from his fellowship, by detesting their opinions: To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, That like as the golde, and siluer, the brasse, and yron, and likewise the claye of the great image, which <hi>Nebuchadneser</hi> saw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>In the second place, by him that letteth, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth <note place="margin">Chrys. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 4. in 2. Thes. cap. 2</note> the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, which consisting into its owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie, with vndiminished and vnbrangled authoritie, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Antichrist</hi> durst not attempt high things, and thinges farre surmounting the modest carriage of subjects. And heere by the way it is to bee marked, that like as the Apostle by him who let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and hindereth, vnderstandeth not one particulare Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour onely, but an Empire, wherein one Emperour succeedeth to another: Euen so, by him that is letted, hee vnderstandeth not one particulare man, but the estate of an vsurped kingdome, wherein likewise one succeedeth to another. But now let vs see how the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour, so long as he consisted in his owne full strength, did hinder the attemptes of the <hi>Antichrist:</hi> First, no man was admitted bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> a long time, without the consent of the Emperour: Secondlie, inuestment of bishops, by staffe and ring, beeing likewise in the Emperours hands, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue pride of the <hi>Romane</hi> bishops (euen after they were called <hi>Uniuersall Bishops)</hi> was mightilie borne downe: Thirdly, so long
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18670:315"/>
as Emperours kept in their owne hand the power of conuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Generall and Nationall Councels, the bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> all this while acknowledged <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours for their soueraine lordes: But when the Emperours were bereaued of all their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned rightes, as <hi>Palinurus,</hi> by storme of weather, was cast out of the ship, and the rudder, by violence of the tempest, was washen out of his handes, then all things were turned vp side downe, as we shall heare (God willing) in the subsequent words, wherein he prophesieth, that he who letteth should be taken out of the way, that is, the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire shall bee vtterly weakened, so that it cannot make resistance against the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> but it stoupeth vnder his might, adoreth him as the Vicare of Christ, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not erre and as a god on earth, is content to be crowned by him, and to make the oathe of alleadgeance to the Pope. In what base estate are the Emperours of late dayes? how is their golde turned into drosse? and the might of their dominion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to seruile subjection vnto the <hi>Antichrist?</hi> as was shortly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in these verses,</p>

                     <p>But it may bee demaunded, How can the bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> be blamed, as ouer-throwers of the glorie of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire? seeing it was the <hi>Saracenes</hi> who vndid the Empire of the East, and the <hi>Gothes, Vandales, Lombardis, Hunnes, Auares, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normandis,</hi> weakened the Empire of the West: To this I answere, That the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> were like unto a lowse tooth, and a wrested foote, and were deceitfull friendes, both to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the East, and of the West, rendering vnto them euill for good.

Neuerthelesse, the first occasion that they found to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the possessions of the Emperours of the East, they ouer-passed it not, but tooke the gift of <hi>Exarchatus Rauennae,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> which duely belonged to the Emperour of the East: These dominions, I say, they tooke by the gift of <hi>Pipinus,</hi> king of <hi>France</hi> (who was prodigall in bestowing vnto the chaire of <hi>Rome</hi> other mens possessions) and they possesse the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions afore-saide, with their townes, villages, and territories, euen vntill this day.

In like manner, the Holy Scriptures are to bee had in the more reuerende regarde, when they describe euery thing in their own colours, and manifesteth on the one part the riches of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God in Iesus Christ, and on the other part the falsehood, subtiltie, hypocrisie, and pride of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> to the end, that Gods people maye eschewe the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and rejoyce in the sweete saluation of Christ Iesus.</p>
                     <p>This discouerie of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> in some weake measure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan about the yeere of our Lord 1300. at what time, learned men, fearing the tyrannie of the Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> fled to <hi>Italie,</hi> and restored the Grieke and Latine languages to their own puritie.

John Wiklef,</hi> a Professor of Diuinitie in <hi>Oxford,</hi> affirmed, that whatsoeuer the Pope and his Cardinals command, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee deduced clearely out of Scriptures, this same is to bee counted Hereticall, and not to bee obeied. These few witnesses of God, holy like vnto <hi>Hanoch,</hi> the seuenth from <hi>Adam,</hi> and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous like vnto <hi>Helias,</hi> by the example of their couragious zeale, and zealous courage, incited a greater number of Holy men in <hi>Germanie, Switserland, France, Britanie,</hi> and <hi>Poll,</hi> to be witnesses to the truth of God: whose number, albeit it was as contemptible in the eyes of <hi>Romane</hi> Prelates, as the number of the armie of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedo</hi> was in the eyes of <hi>Darius,</hi> king of <hi>Persia.</hi> Notwithstanding, by these witnesses of God, the <hi>Antichrist</hi> hath bene discouered, the citie of spirituall <hi>Babylon</hi> hath bene shaken, the head of the beast hath beene wounded, and all his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions haue much adoe to cure his wound againe.</p>
                     <p>But let vs proceede to that which followeth in the ende of the 8. verse: namely, that the <hi>Antichrist</hi> should not only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled, but also should bee consumed by the Spirit of the mouth of Christ: whereof it may bee perceiued, that the Lord will not abolish the kingdome of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> as hee did abolish other Monarchies of the <hi>Babylonians. Persians, Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Romanes:</hi> but hee keepeth the kingdome of the <hi>Antichrist</hi> afore-hand to bee consumed by the tempest of his owne wrath. This argueth the great indignation of God against the kingdome of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist</hi> wherein hee findeth might joyned withslight, so that the Lord will drawe out against him his great and mightie sworde,
<pb facs="tcp:18670:319"/>
wherewith hee visiteth <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> that piercing Serpent, and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiathan,</hi> that crooked Serpent, and hee slayeth the Dragon that <note place="margin">Isai. 27. 1</note> is in the Sea, for all his might, the wrath of God shall bee reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against him from Heauen, because hee hath with-holden <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18</note> the trueth in vnrighteousnesse. Whatsoeuer shalbe done against this mother of whoredomes in this worlde, is nothing else, but an earnest-pennie of that vnspeakeable wrath of God, that shall seaze vpon the kingdome of the <hi>Antichrist</hi> at the latter daye. More-ouer, the equitie of the justice of God is to bee noted in this, that God rendereth vnto the <hi>Antichrist</hi> such punishment, as doeth moste proportionallie agree with the nature of his fault: for by the Anathemes and Curses of his mouth, hee subdued the mightie Monarches of the earth: so shall Christ pronounce a Curse against him, by the power whereof hee shall bee sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Matth. 25</note> the fornace of euerlasting punishment.</p>
                     <p>Nowe it might haue beene objected, Howe could it come to passe, that euer the <hi>Antichrist</hi> shoulde haue obtained so great place in the Temple of God? To this objection the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth a foure-folde answere: First, it came to passe by the mightie operation of the Deuill: Secondly, by lying miracles: Thirdly, by the deceiueablenesse of vnrighteousnesse: And fourthly, by the incredulitie of men who would not beleeue the trueth of God: therefore the Lord suffered them to be deluded with errours: These foure causes are set downe in the 9. 10. 11. and 12. verses, whereof when wee haue spoken a little, GOD willing, wee shall conclude this <hi>Treatise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first cause of the preuailing power of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is the mightie operation of <hi>Sathan,</hi> concurring with him, who is to bee considered two manner of wayes, sometimes as bound, at other times as lowse and set at libertie: hee is a perillous enemie at all <note place="margin">Apoc. 20</note> times, euen when hee is bound, in respect of our childish simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie: wee are like vnto babes, who through curiositie at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time will come within the reach of a bounde Lyon, and will bee harmed by the meanes. But when Sathan is set at libertie, then hath hee a mightie operation, euen so great, that albeit light bee offered vnto men, yet they loue darknesse better than the light of God. If euer Sathan was set at ample libertie, (who is euer, for <note place="margin">Iean. 3. 19</note> the Elects sake, somewhat restrained) hee was set at greatest li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
<pb facs="tcp:18670:319"/>
when the <hi>Romane Antichrist</hi> had greatest preheminence: for at that time the smoake of the bottomlesse pitte so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered all thinges with darknesse, that men sawe neither Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen nor Hell, nor yet themselues: The Heauen was darkened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Apocal. 9. 2</note> men sought an entrie into it another waye, than by the blood of the euerlasting Couenant of God, by the worthinesse whereof the moste Holy place is made patent to vs, and none other way: And Hell was darkened, because men liued in a deepe <note place="margin">Hebr. 9</note> securitie, as if they had made a couenant with Death and Hell: <note place="margin">Isai. 28. 18</note> the Popes pardon, and the fulfilling of the pennance injoyned by the Priest, was counted a complete armoure to saue them against the fierie indignation of Gods wrath: Yea and men saw not themselues, but in seeking to establish their owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they were not subject to the righteousnesse of God. Now it is our duetie, with all our heartes, to blesse the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3</note> who hath begun to cast Sathan into bandes againe: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of our wauering mindes declareth, that if Sathan were set at libertie againe, it were an easie thing to transport vs head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes to all kinde of errours.</p>
                     <p>The second cause of the preuailing power of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is signes and lying wonders: in the Grieke language <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, signifieth, miracles, confirming a lying doctrine. All the miracles of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> are either false miracles, wherein nothing is wrought aboue nature, nor contrarie to nature, or else the ende of his miracles is the confirmation of a false doctrine. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Church braggeth much of miracles, as if the power of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king miraculous workes were a gift continuallie to remaine, and an vndoubted token of the true Church of God: Howbeit Holy Scripture attributeth to false Teachers, who intise people to worship strange gods, power to worke signes and wonders. <note place="margin">Deut. 13. 1. 2</note> 
                        <hi>Socrates</hi> also, in his Ecclesiasticall Historie, writeth of <hi>Eusebius Emisenus,</hi> an <hi>Arrian</hi> Heretique, vnder the reigne of <hi>Constantius,</hi>

                     <p>IN the second head we haue the definition of the Masse, to be set downe, and to bee examined. The Masse is called a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice propitiatorie, &amp; vnbloodie, wherein the Priest offereth the bodie of the Sonne of God to the Father, vnder the formes of bread and wine, and that without suffering for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead.

                        <hi>in passione per ipsam veritatem reddebatur: post ascensum Christi, per sacramentum memoriae celebratur:</hi> that is to say, <hi>The flesh of this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was promised by sacrifices of similitudes: In the suffering of Christ, it was in verie deede exhibited: and after the ascension of Christ, it is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by a Sacrament of His memoriall.</hi> In these wordes <hi>Augustine</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth a sacrifice prefiguratiue before Christes comming, and a sacrifice commemoratiue after the Lordes ascension, from the sacrifice of Christes bodie in veritie, and actually exhibited vpon the crosse; other sacrifices point out, as types and figures, the great sacrifice of the bodie of Christ once offered vpon the crosse: but they are not that selfe same sacrifice, except by a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue manner of speach. And like as the towne <hi>Nicopolis</hi> was not the victorie of <hi>Augustus Casar,</hi> when hee faught against <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Plutarch. in vita Anton.</note> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> but it was onely a memoriall of the victorie: Euen so, the commemoratiue sacrifice of the new Testament, is not the true sacrifice of Christes bodie, but only a memoriall of that blessed sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iustinus</hi> Martyr had good occasion offered vnto him to write of the sacrifices of Christes Church, because <hi>Paganes</hi> slaundered Christians, and called them <hi>Atheistes,</hi> in regarde they offered not bloodie sacrifices, nor incense, vnto their God: to whome <hi>Iustinus</hi> returned this answere, That Christians offered to GOD such sacrifices as they knew to bee moste acceptable to Him, to <note place="margin">Iustinus apologia 2.</note> wit, the sacrifices of prayer and thankesgiuing. And as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the creatures of God, appointed for the sustentation of mankinde, we keepe them (saith hee) for our owne vse, and for the sustentation of indigent people, but we consume them not with fire. If there had bene anie corporal sacrifice in the Church of the bodie of the Sonne of God, vnder the formes of bread and wine, <hi>Iustinus</hi> had occasion offered vnto him to haue spoken of it: but hee knew no such sacrifice in his time. Yea, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper is called, by <hi>Iustinus,</hi> a Sacrifice of <note place="margin">Iustin. dialo. cum Tryph. iudeo.</note> thanksgiuing, who confidently affirmeth, that prayer &amp; thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing are the onely sacrifices perfect and acceptable to GOD, euen at that time when the Sacrament is ministred, which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs in remembrance of the Lordes suffering. Testimonies out of the bookes of ancient Fathers should bee cited without fraude and deceite, and should not bee wrested to another sense
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18670:324"/>
and meaning, than they were spoken into by the Authors. And so the worde Sacrifice could offend no man, if it were spoken in such sense as ancient Fathers spake it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> Church shoulde doe well, so to remember the names that ancient Fathers haue giuen to the Sacrament, that they shoulde not forget, that Holy Scripture calleth it a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 16. 17</note> of the bodie and blood of Christ. Then let it be such a sacrifice, wherein many participates of one bread and one cup, and thereby sealeth vp, that they are all members of one mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bodie of Iesus Christ: but not such a sacrifice wherein the people standeth gazing and looking, and the Priest alone eateth and drinketh, and distributeth nothing vnto the people. They answere, that the Priest, who offereth at the Altar, he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth with others, who doe the like seruice in other places. This is but falsehoode, in reasoning arising vpon the deceitfull handeling of one worde hauing two significations: The worde Communion importeth two things: First, a Communion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Secondly, a participation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Holy Supper in one place, and an eating of one bread, and drinking of one cuppe: and in this second sense, it is taken by the Apostle in the 10. Chapter of his first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> in which sense their priuate Masse cannot be called a Communion.</p>
                     <p>The second word of the definition of the Masse is propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This word doeth signifie a sacrifice purchasing remission of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</hi> Hebr. 9. 22</note> sinnes, as the Apostle witnesseth. And this honour doeth onelie appertaine to the sacrifice of Christ, who is a propitiation for our sinnes, &amp; the sinnes of the whole world. This ground being <note place="margin">1. Ioan. 2. 2</note> once laide, that Christ is the only person, in whom the Father is well pleased with vs: and Christes sacrifice is the onely meanes, whereby we are reconciled to God.</p>
                     <p>In the second place, we shall consider, wherefore the word of propitiation was in so frequent vse in the olde Testament. The <note place="margin">Exod. 25. 21</note> golden coucring of the Arke was called the propitiatorie: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the tenth day of the seuenth moneth, whereupon the High Priest entered once in the yeere within the Vaile, and into the most Holy place, it was called the daye of propitiation: and the <note place="margin">Leui. 23. 27 Levit. 4. 20</note> sinne-offeringes were called propitiatorie sacrifices. To this doubt the Apostle answereth, that <hi>the lawe hauing the shadowe of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 10. 1</note>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:18670:325"/>
                        <hi>good thinges to come, and not the verie image of the thinges, can neuer, with those sacrifices, which they offer yeere by yeere, continuallie san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the commers thereunto.</hi> By these wordes it is euident, that the sinne-offering, and the blood carried within the Vaile, and the golden couering of the Arke, had no power to purge the consciences of men from sinne: onelie they were types and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures representing Christ, in whome that was to bee actuallie performed, which was represented by those figures. And like as no prefiguration sacrifice in a proper sense could be called pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie: Euen so in like manner, no commemoratiue sacrifice of Christes death, can bee called a propitiatorie sacrifice, except typically, and figuratiuely.</p>
                     <p>The wordes of <hi>Augustine,</hi> speaking of the sacrament of the Altar, in the celebration whereof, there was a commemoration of the names of manie men, who were departed this life, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth to Papistes some occasion of cauillation: for they saye, that <hi>Augustine</hi> thought the sacrament of the Altar to bee a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation: <note place="margin">August. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirid. ad Laurentium Idem, de octo dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citii quest.</note> for men who had beene of a middle-ranke, that is, neither of the best, nor of the worst sort of people. But they who are well acquainted with <hi>Augustines</hi> writinges will not bee easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie miscaried with such <hi>Amphthologies</hi> as lurke in wordes. True it is, that AVGVSTINE calleth the Sacrament a Sacrifice: but in what sense? A commemoratiue Sacrifice, as hath beene declared alreadie. And in the like sense, hee calleth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar <hi>propitiatio,</hi> because in it there is a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the propitiatorie sacrifice, which CHRIST offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the Crosse. His distinction of men, who are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in three rankes, some haue beene verie good men, others haue beene verie badde men, the third ranke haue neither bene the best nor the worst sort of people, together with his doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some opinion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerning the estate of weake Christians, who are departed this life, presenteth no solide grounde to any man to build his argument vpon the testimonie of a doubting author.</p>
                     <p>The next worde of the definition is vnbloodie. Howe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant this part of the definition is vnto the former part, <note place="margin">Unbloodie</note> wherein it was called a propitiatorie Sacrifice, GOD wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I shall declare in the last head, concerning the absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Masse.</p>

                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:18670:325"/>
For one speciall respect Papistes shoulde speake sparinglie of their vnbloodie hostie: for they haue made it bloodie by the cruell shedding of the blood of manie innocent people, whome they haue persecuted to the death, massacred, tormented with formes of newe inuented crueltie, circumueened by false and deceitfull promises: and they haue excogitated horrible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the like whereof haue not beene hearde since the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the worlde: and these villanies were hatched in their hatefull heartes for the establishing of their Idolatrous Masse. <hi>Vesperae siculae,</hi> maye bee called an vnbloodie Euen-song: and the sacrifices offered to DIANA, in TAVRICA CHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONESVS, maye bee called vnbloodie sacrifices, with better reason than the Popishe Masse can bee called an vnbloodie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, because the seruice done to DIANA, albeit it beganne with the shedding of humane bloode, yet it ended with the shedding of the bloode of beastes. But the crueltie of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes will make no such exchange, because they walke in the way of <hi>Cain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next part of the definition is this: That in the Masse the Priest offereth the bodie of the Sonne of GOD to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <note place="margin">The Priest offereth the body of Christ.</note> No part of the definition is more vntollerable, and more flatlie opposite to holie Sripture, than this part: for holie Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture setteth downe CHRISTES bodie, as the onelie propitiatorie sacrifice, and CHRIST himselfe, as the onelie High Priest, who offered this sacrifice. And to transferre this <note place="margin">Heb. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Papists affirme, that when CHRIST instituted the holie Supper, at one, and the selfe same time, hee instituted both a Sacrament and a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and consecrated his Apostles, and their successours, to bee Priestes of the newe Testament, to offer vp the bodie of Christ, vnto His FATHER, vnder the formes of Bread and Wine:

and these were the wordes whereby they were consecrated to <note place="margin">Lue. 12. 19.</note> this Priesthood, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of mee.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> vnderstood the meaning of the words of Christ better than the whole Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> did: and he expoundeth these wordes. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, as the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath done. More-ouer, if CHRIST in these wordes, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> that is, <hi>Doe this,</hi> hee ordained his disciples to be Priests of the new Testament, and to offer in sacrifice the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ to his Father: then Christ, when hee ministred the holy Supper, hee offered himselfe in a sacrifice to the Father: (for hee biddeth them doe that same thing which hee did) and consequently hee offered himselfe at two diuerse times, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed to suffer twise, as the Apostle testifieth, which is an absurd <note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 25 26</note> thing once to thinke such a thing.</p>
                     <p>Further, I maye boldly affirme, that the Leuiticall sacrifices were not so farre different from the sacrifice of Christ, as the Masse is different from it: The Leuiticall sacrifices differed in manie thinges from the sacrifice of Christ: as namely in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of priesthoode in the worthinesse of the Priest, in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 8. 9 10</note> of the sacrifice, in the preciousnesse of the Tabernacle, in the glorie of the Vaile, and moste Holy place, and finally, in the vertue of the blood that was brought within the moste Holie place: Notwithstanding of all these differences betwixt the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall priesthood, and the priesthood of Christ: yet there was some agreement betwixt them, namely this, that both of them were instituted by God. But the sacrifice of the Masse, ouer and besides all other differences, whereby it is distinguished from Christes sacrifice, it is not the institution of God, but a foolishe inuention of the braine of man. <note place="margin">Under the formes of bread and wine.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next part of the definition that Christes bodie is offered vnder the accidents of bread and wine, agreeth not well with the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18670:326"/>
glorie whereinto Christ entered by his ascension: for like as the resurrection of Christ hath glorious priueledges, <hi>he beeing ra sed from death, death hath no more dominion ouer him:</hi> Euen so, the <note place="margin">Roman. 6. 9</note> ascension of Christ to Heauen hath glorious priueledges: for he who ascended to Heauen, <hi>he sitteth at the right hand of the power of God, and will come againe in the cloudes of Heauen:</hi> and it repugneth <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 64</note> as farre to the glorie of his ascension to appeare againe in a base similitude, as it repugneth to the glorie of his resurrection to die againe. But so it is, that the accidentes of bread and wine are a base similitude to the blessed and glorified bodie of Christ to put on: yea, and baser than the shape of a seruant, wherewith he was cloathed before his ascension. Concerning the sacrifice of <hi>Melchisedek,</hi> and their confident assertion, that in the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Masse Christ is offered, without suffering, I remit these questions vnto the last head of this TREATISE.</p>
                     <p>The last part of the definition of the Masse containeth, that <note place="margin">For the sinnes of the quicke and the dead.</note> it is a sacrifice for the quicke and the dead. If it bee that selfe same sacrifice which Christ offered vpon the crosse, not different from it in substance, but only in forme of offering, then behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it to bee of infinite valour, as the sacrifice offered vpon the crosse was. But the multitude of Masses saide for the relieuing of one soule out of purgatorie declareth, that there is not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and perfect valour in the sacrifice of the Masse: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not that same sacrifice in substance which Christ offered vpon the crosse: Euen as a Physition, who adhibiteth a plaster vnto a wound, hauing full vertue to cure the wound by once applying it, hee will not applie it the second time, because the wounde is perfectly healed by one sole application: Euen so if the Masse had perfect valour to saue, as the sacrifice of Christ offered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crosse had, what neede were it to say manie Masses for the reliefe of one sou'e out of purgatorie?</p>
                     <p>More-ouer, if they offer a sacrifice for the dead, it is not for them who hath died in infidelitie &amp; mis-beliefe, for their soules are buried in Hell, and there is no redemption out of that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <note place="margin">Luc. 16</note> prison: But they offer sacrifice for weake Christians, of whome notwithstanding holy Scripture saieth, that <hi>they die in the Lord, they rest from their labours, and their works follow them:</hi> so weake <note place="margin">Apoc. 14. 13</note> Christians, when they die, their soules are not carried to purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18670:327"/>
to bee tormented, but vnto the place of rest, and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and retribution of all the good thinges which they haue done, like as the Lord hath freely forgiuen them all euill which they did in their life time, because they haue repented, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in Christ their Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>The offering of sacrifice for the dead, doe not only presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone purgatorie, but also that some helpe may bee procured by them who are aliue, to shorte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> or to mitigate the paines of them who are departed this life. This opinion also repugneth to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture, which admonisheth vs <hi>to seeke the Lord in a time when he may be found,</hi> that is, to seeke the Lord in our life time, for it is <note place="margin">Psalm. 32. 6</note> vntimous seeking of the Lord after the soule be separated from the bodie. Some men seeke the Lord in a wrong place: some seeke him in a wrong manner, and some seeke him in a wrong time, as the foolish Virgines did. But of all sort of seekers of the Lord, they are most vnfortunate, who seeke him in a time when he cannot be found, and when the doore of his wedding cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 10</note> is shut and locked. For others, who haue sought the Lord in wrong places, that is, in the synagogue of <hi>Sathan,</hi> where nothing was taught but a doctrine of lies, and they haue sought God in a wrong manner, inuocating Sainctes, and worshipping Images: yet afterward, when they haue receiued better instruction, they haue sought the Lord in a right place, and in a right manner, and haue found the Lord: but they who seeke the Lord in a wrong time shall neuer find him.</p>
                     <p>IN the last head of this <hi>Treatise,</hi> I promised to speake of the <note place="margin">The absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the Masse. 1. Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. The Canon of the masse</note> absurdities of the Masse, which albeit they be many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet I shall reduce them vnto a few heads. First I begin at the blasphemous Canon of the Masse, whereunto the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath giuen such a glorious testimonie, that it is perfect, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, voyde of all errour, and therefore not to bee changed, or abrogated. I call the Canon of the Masse, that rule which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth what shoulde bee saide or sung in the Popish liturgie or Masse. It is not a worke composed by one author, but rather a rapsodie patched vp by many authors, and especially by Popes. <hi>Celestinus</hi> deuised the preamble or introit to the Masse: <hi>Gregorius</hi> added <hi>kyrie eleson: Telesphorus, gloria in excelsis Deo: Gelatius</hi> the first, <note place="margin">Platina in vita Xifti 1.</note> the Collations: <hi>Pelagius,</hi> a commemoration of the dead: <hi>Leo</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:18670:327"/>
third added incense: <hi>Innocentius</hi> the first, added the paxe: <hi>Sergius</hi> the first, ordained <hi>agnus Dei</hi> to bee sung: other partes and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Masse are assigned to their seuerall authors and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentors. In it the Priest is commanded to bowe himselfe before the hostie, &amp; say, <hi>I worship thee, I glorisie thee, I praise thee.</hi> Can there bee any Idolattie more monstrous than this? for like as GOD hath appointed some creatures to leade vs to our God in so far as he is our Creator: euen so he hath appointed other creatures to leade vs to our God in so far as he is our Redeamer. Now like as it is Idolatrie to subsist in the Sunne, Moone, and starres, and to worship them, because they are but creatures, leading vs to the knowledge of God our Creator: Euen so it is horrible Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, to worship the bread and wine in the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are but creatures, appointed by God to leade vs to the knowledge of God our Redeamer.</p>
                     <p>More-ouer, in the Canon of the Masse, the Priest is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to praye such prayers as import that Hee is a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Christ and his Father: for hee beseecheth GOD to receiue the oblation which he offereth, and in all things to make it bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: Nowe the oblation which he offereth (as they affirme) is the bodie of Christ. And shall a sinfull Priest be a mediator betwixt Christ and his Father?

Likewise, in the Canon of the Masse there is inuocation of Saincts, farre contrarie to the auncient custome of the Church: who albeit they made a reuerend commemoration of the names of holy men, when they celebrated diuine mysteries, yet they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocated them not, as <hi>Augustine</hi> clearly testifieth, saying, <hi>The names of Martyres are commemorated in their owne place and order, as men of</hi>

Vpon such sandie ground is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popish Masse builded. The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d ground of the Masse is the timorous minds of simple people, who being informed by their deceiuing teachers, that they might haue like benefite, with lesse hazard and danger, by seeing of the sacrifice, as they had by participation of the Sacrament. The people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to loathe the frequent resorting to the holy Sacrament, and they came to see the sacrifice of the Masse. Both these groundes of the Masse are abuses of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords holy Supper. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first ground, that which Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mandeth to be presently eaten in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him, a part thereof is reserued, to be eaten in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <note place="margin">Luc. 22. 19</note> contrary to Christs institution, as is already declared. In the second ground, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostolicke precept is neglected, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs <hi>to trie our selues, and so to eat &amp; drinke at the Lords table:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. cor. 11. 22</note> but he forbiddeth vs not to approach to the Lordes holy table, if we be duely &amp; rightly prepared: neither giueth hee allowance to this new forme of communicating, that the people shall stand only gazing and beholding, and shall communicate by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of the Priest alone. They who brag of antiquitie, and follow new inuented toyes, they haue no honour by their bragging.</p>
                     <p>The third absurditie of the Masse, consisteth in the rotten pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <note place="margin">3. Absurd. the pillars of the masse</note> whereupon the Masse standeth, to wit, Trans substantiation
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18670:328"/>
and Purgatorie: for incase the bread bee not changed into the substance of Christs bodie, the priest cannot offer Christs bodie to His Father. And incase there be no soules tormented in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, how doeth the priest offer a sacrifice for the dead? So it is manifest, that these are the two rotten pillars vpholding the Masse. I shall refute the doctrine of Transsubstantiation (GOD willing) in its own place: for the present, I say, If there be Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation in the holy Sacrament, then is the spirite of man corporally fedde, and the body of Christ is eaten by many in the Sacrament, to whom hee is not promised in the Word, which is an absurd thing once to imagine it. And if such a place as Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie had beene, then Christ, who hath reueiled vnto vs all <note place="margin">Ioan. 14. 2</note> thinges necessarie to be knowne, hee woulde haue reueiled that mysterie also vnto vs. But Christ hath tolde vs of the pleasures of Heauen, and of the terrours of Hell, but neuer a word of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 28</note> If a house, builded vpon sandie grounde, and leaning vnto rotten pillars, can stand, then possible the Masse also may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist and stand: if not, the Masse also is in danger to fall.</p>
                     <p>The fourth absurditie of the Masse, is a vile abusing of places of holy Scripture, for vpholding the sacrifice of the Masse. In the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>4. Absur. a vile abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holie Scripture.</hi> Gen, 14. 18</note> olde Testament, they confirme the sacrifice of the Masse, by the fact of <hi>Melchisedek,</hi> who brought foorth bread and wine to refresh the wearie armie of <hi>Abraham:</hi> but not to offer these ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a sacrifice to God. And the ancient Fathers, who trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Hebrew word <hi>(obtulit)</hi> in stead of <hi>(protulit)</hi> yet their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that <hi>Melchisedek</hi> offered bread and wine to <hi>Abraham</hi> for his refreshment, but not to God in a sacrifice. But suppose the words of <hi>Moses</hi> did sound to that sense, that <hi>Melchisedek</hi> offered a sacrifice of bread &amp; wine vnto God, What belongeth that to the sacrifice of the Masse, wherin they say, that bread and wine is not offered vnto God, but the verie bodie of Christ, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the accidents of bread and wine? This was not the sacrifice of <hi>Melchisedeck.</hi> Also, the words of the prophesie of <hi>Malachi</hi> are mis rably abused, for confirmation of the sacrifice of the Masse whereas hee saieth, <hi>For from the rising of the Sunne, vnto the going downe of the same my Name is great among the Gentiles, and in</hi>

                        <pb facs="tcp:18670:329"/>
The Prophet expoundeth his owne meaning so clearelie, that there is no neede of any other commentarie for hee is speaking of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the kingdome of God, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one point of the true worship of God: namelie, inuocation of his blessed and glorious Name, hee comprehendeth all other <note place="margin">Tertul. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Marcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. lib. 3.

                     <p>In the newe Testament, besides the wordes of Christ spoken at the institution of the holie Supper, where of I haue spoken already, two other places are mightily abused: First the place of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> chap. 8. vers. 3. <hi>For euerie high Priest is appointed to offer giftes and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessarie, that this man haue somewhat also to offer.</hi> What is in this place, that countenanceth the sacrifice of the Masse? Like as euerie priest was furnished with an offering: euen so the High priest and Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of our soules, CHRISTIESVS, hee had an offering, to wit, his blessed bodie, which hee offered for our sinnes: But papists referre this place to an offering, which euerie priest must offer presently, so long as hee enjoyeth the honour of his priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: and therefore (saye they) seeing CHRIST offereth no externall sacrifice in Heauen, he must doe it in earth, by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse: But the verie Grammer refuteth them, for the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap>, is a worde of the preterit, and not of the present tense, and importeth, that CHRIST hath alreadie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a sacrifice for our sinnes, which hath no neede to bee ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, because it hath perpetuall vertue to saue them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. Another place of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> chap. 13. vers. 10. they abuse, wherein it is saide, <hi>Wee haue an altar, whereof they haue no power to eat, who serue in the tabernacle.</hi> Here (say they) mention is made of an altar: therfore in the Church there must not only bee a Communion table, but also an altar, in a proper sense to offer CHRISTES bodie vpon it. To this I answere,
<pb facs="tcp:18670:329"/>
That in the newe Testament, like as there is but one high priest, and one propitiatorie sacrifice: so in like manner, there is but one altar, euen Iesus Christ, who is in Heauen, and in whom our spirituall sacrifices are acceptable vnto God, as the Apostle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saieth, <hi>Bee you made a spirituall house, an holie priesthoode, to offer spirituall sacrifices acceptable vnto God, by Iesus Christ. 1. Pet. chap. 2. vers. 5.</hi> Of this Altar, to wit, Christ, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who were mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie addicted to the ceremoniall lawe, they could not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers: for by adhering to shaddowes, they neglected to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the veritie, represented by those shaddowes, after it was indeede exhibited vnto the worlde. In the booke of the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation wee reade of an Altar in Heauen, vnder which the soules of them who were slaine for the worde of GOD doe repose: <hi>(Apocal. chap. 6. vers. 9.)</hi> This is not a materiall altar, because it is in Heauen: but this Altar is Christ, vnder whose shaddow the soules of the Godlie finde comfortable refreshment. And <hi>Ireneus,</hi> in expresse wordes, saieth, <hi>Est ergo Altare in Coelis: illue</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iren. aduers. Valentin. lib. 4. ca. 34</note> 
                        <hi>enim preces nostrae diriguntur:</hi> that is, <hi>Therefore our Altar is in Heauen, for thithertoe our prayers are directed.</hi> The <hi>Romane</hi> Church woulde deceiue vs in this point, as <hi>Zebul</hi> of olde deceiued <hi>Gaal,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ebed:</hi> when <hi>Gaal</hi> sawe men comming from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, <hi>Zebul</hi> answered, <hi>The shaddowe of the mountaines seeme men vnto thee:</hi> (IVD. CHAP. IX. VERS. XXXVI.) Euen so, when holy Scripture speake of Christ the true Altar, they would perswade vs, that Scripture is speaking of a materiall altar, such as is among them.</p>
                     <p>The fift absurditie of the Masse, is a contradiction to it selfe. In the description of the Masse there are two manifest contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions: <note place="margin">5. <hi>Absurd. contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to it selfe.</hi>
                        </note> First it is called a sacrifice propitiatorie, and vnbloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: which two thinges are so opposite, that they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist together, because the Apostle (in the ninth chap. to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> and the 22. verse) saieth, <hi>Without shedding of bloode there is no remission of sinnes.</hi> Secondlie they saye, that in the Masse the body of Christ is offered, without suffering: &amp; these two things also are so flatte contradictorie one to another, that the Apostle continuallie joyneth suffering with offering, in so much, that hee saieth, <hi>If Christ had offered himselfe often, hee behooued also to haue suffered often. Heb. chap. 9. vers. 25. and 26.</hi>

                        </note> them to three heads. First, prohibition of marriage to men in spirituall offices, is a consequent of the Masse: for albeit in the Councell of NICE this matter was seriouslie v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>â¢â¦</desc>

<pb facs="tcp:18670:330"/>
like as married persons, for prayer and fasting, (I. CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINTH. CHAPTER VII. VERSE V.) shoulde abstaine, for a short time, from matrimoniall fellowship: In like manner, these, who are called to a continuall exercise of praying, and sacrificing, they shoulde also continuallie abstaine from the bed of marriage. So that prohibition of marriage, to men in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall offices, attended the Masse, as a Page doeth his master. And Popes, such as SIRICIVS, CALIXTVS, GREGO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIVS the seuenth, &amp;c. did vrge prohibition of marriage with no lesse vehemencie, than they did the establishing of the Masse.</p>
                     <p>The seconde consequence of the Masse, is a miserable abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the people of GOD, because by this sacrifice, for the moste part, the people were bereaued of the preaching of the Worde, and the ministration of the Sacramentes, the verie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie meanes, whereby the Kingdome of GOD is builded amongst them: The Worde was seldome preached, and in verie vnfruitfull manner, and mixed with fables and lying miracles, borrowed out of legendes, not worthie to bee read: and the holie Sacramentes were seldome ministred, and with filthie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ceremonies, inuented by the braine of man, to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and a sacrilegious with-holding from the people, the cuppe, in ministring vnto them the holie Supper: and so the fountaines of liuing water were stopped, and cisternes were opened, and the wholsome foode of GODS people was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into ashes: and in steade of preaching GODS Worde sincerelie, all Church-seruice was turned into a dumbe guise of the Masse: and in reading of prayers and passages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, into an vnknowne language: so the people, for fault of good instruction, withered as grasse, when it is not refreshed with dewe and raine: Yea, and SALOMON saieth, <hi>Where there is no vision, the people decay,</hi> PROV. 29. 18.</p>
                     <p>The thirde, and moste venomous consequence of the Masse, is procession and adoration: for hosties, consecrated in time of Masse, although not broken and eaten, they are counted CHRISTES bodie, and carried about in procession, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18670:331"/>
worshipped. This was not the ancient custome of the Church: for the sacrament consisting in the action and vse thereof, so long as the blessing, and the actions of breaking, distributing, and eating lasted, the bread was counted holie, and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>And of all thinges, that are deficient in Poperie, I haue of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>The ground of Popish procession, no doubt, was the sending of the Sacraments to those who were sicke and absent by some <note place="margin">Iustin. apol. 2.</note> necessitie. But they reade not in IVSTINVS, nor in any other ancient writer, that people who met the deacon carrying the Eucharist to sicke persons, fell downe vpon their knees, and worshipped it.

                     <p>To <hi>Adrian</hi> succeeded <hi>Leo</hi> the third, and gouerned 21. yeeres: he was hated by <hi>Pascalis</hi> and <hi>Campulus,</hi> who lay in waite for him <note place="margin">Leo the third.</note> at the Church of Sainct <hi>Syluester,</hi> threw him downe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, <hi>spoy</hi> led him of his pontificall garments, beate him with manie strokes, and finally, cast him into prison and bands: but he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the meanes of a cubiculare, named <hi>Albinus,</hi> &amp; lurked in the Vaticane vntill the time that <hi>Unigisius,</hi> duke of <hi>Spoleto,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyed him safely vnto his boundes.

And from that time forwardes, the custome beganne, that Emperoures shoulde receiue their Coronation from the Bishop of ROME.

This <hi>Ihonne</hi> was infected with the heresie of the <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelites,</hi> and was remoued by <hi>Artemius,</hi> by whome <hi>Germanus</hi> was aduanced to the chaire of <hi>Constantinople. Germanus</hi> continued vntill the reigne of <hi>Constantinus Copronymus:</hi> Hee was deposed and excommunicated by the Generall Councell assembled by <hi>Constantinus,</hi> because hee allowed the worshipping of images.</p>
                     <p>To him succeeded <hi>Anastasius,</hi> who albeit hee disliked ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet hee was vnthankefull to the Emperour, and fauoured the seditious attemptes of the people of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced <hi>Artabasdus</hi> to the Emperiall dignitie. More-ouer, hee slandered the Emperour, as if he had spoken against the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christ. Hee receiued a just recompense of his vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse: for hee was deposed, and scourged, and set vpon an Asse, with his face towards the Asses taile, and made a ridiculous spectacle to the people.</p>
                     <p>After him, <hi>Constantine,</hi> a Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ke, was made Patriarch, who at the first seemed to damne images: but afterward he was found to be a maintainer and allower of them. The Emp. banished him to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18670:337"/>
                        <hi>Iberia,</hi> where hee spake contumeliouslie both of the Emperour and of the Councell holden at <hi>Constantinople:</hi> therefore hee was brought backe againe from banishment, and was beheaded, and his bodie was trailed through the towne with a corde, &amp; casten into a pit, where the bodies of male-factors were accustomed to bee casten.</p>
                     <p>After him succeeded <hi>Nicetas,</hi> a man vnlearned, &amp; adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ced by the Em. <hi>Const.

The vaine repentance of this timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and superstitious man, was the chiefe occasion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of the seconde Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> by the Empresse <hi>Irene.</hi> To him succeeded <hi>Tarasius,</hi> who was present at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and gaue allowance to the adoration of images.</p>
                     <p>The preuailing power of the <hi>Saracenes</hi> in <hi>Alexandria, Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> did so obscure the names of the Patriarches of these cities, that I haue no remarkeable thing to write of them in this CENTVRIE.</p>
                     <p>IN this declining age, wherein spirituall grace dayly decayed, <note place="margin">Of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Doctors.</note> and nothing encreased except an heape of earthly treasures, which God permitteth to be powred into the bosomes of them who loue the wages of iniquitie. Alwayes, euen at this time some men of good literature and learning did manifest themselues vnto the world, such as <hi>Bonifacius</hi> bishop of <hi>Mentz. Damascene</hi> alearned Monke, <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> a learned writer of histories, and <hi>Beda</hi> a man counted venerable in his time: yet all these were miserably infected with the superstitions of their time, such as the opinion of Purgatorie, inuocation of Sainctes, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, and prohibition of Marriage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bonifacius</hi> was a man borne in ENGLAND, in a place neare adjoyning to EXCESTER: he was familiarly acquainted with fiue popes, to wit, with pope <hi>Constantinus</hi> the first, <hi>Gregorius</hi> the seconde, <hi>Gregorius</hi> the thirde, <hi>Zacharias</hi> the first, and <hi>Stepanus</hi> the seconde: And by them hee was aduaunced to manie honours,

First, to be the Popes Legate in ENGLAND, GERMANIE, and FRANCE, and afterwardes to bee Archbishop of <hi>Mentz.</hi> All his studies and trauels tended to this, to bring the people of ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, <hi>Germanie,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to the subjection of the <hi>Romane</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and to a conformitie to the superstitions of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church. In the name, and at the commandement of pope <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> he disauthorised <hi>Childericus</hi> king of <hi>France,</hi> thrust him into a Monasterie, and anointed <hi>Pipinus,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Carolus Martellus</hi> to be king of <hi>France.</hi> So zealous was hee to performe all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the <hi>Romane</hi> bishops, by whome also his name was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: for hee was first named <hi>Vinofridus,</hi> but the bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who delited in his seruice, called him <hi>Bonifacius.</hi> After he had ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the <hi>Romane</hi> bishops in slauish subjection 36. yeeres, hee was slaine by <hi>Pagans,</hi> because he had anointed <hi>Pipinus</hi> king of <hi>France,</hi> and for hope they had to enrich themselues by his coffers, in the which, when they had opened them, they found nothing, except bookes, and reliques of Saincts, whereof they made no account.

The purposes intraited in this Councell were two, to wit, concerning the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of images, and prohibition of marriage to men in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall offices. About worshipping of images no disputation was heard, whether that forme of seruice did agree with the written worde of God, or not.

                        </gap>we againe condemned, as a notable heretique, in the Councell of FRANK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORD partly also in respect of the great disputation that arose euerie where concerning the worshipping of images, disallowed in the Councell of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and allowed in the seconde Councell os <hi>Nice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not onelie the bishops of <hi>France,</hi> but also of <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>Lombardie,</hi> as Prouinces subdued to the King of <hi>France,</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at this Councell. Likewise, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> sent his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, <hi>Theophilactus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus,</hi> to the Councell. And <hi>Charles</hi> himselfe, King of <hi>France,</hi> was present in the Councell of <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> The Ambassadours of pope <hi>Adrian</hi> produced the actes of the seconde Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> hoping that the Councell of <hi>Frankford</hi> shoulde haue giuen consent and allowance vnto the same. But the Fathers of this Councell collationed the actes of the Councell of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with the actes of the seconde Councell of <hi>Nice.</hi> And they disallowed in the Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> the strict prohibition to picture images, either in Temples or other places. And in the seconde Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> they disallowed the Act of worshipping of images, and of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring them with garmentes, incense, candles, and kneeling vnto them: counting the afore-saide Act to bee so impious, that the Councell in the which it was concluded, was neither worthie to bee called Catholicke nor Oecumenicke. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes whereby the seconde Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> endeuoured to approue the adoration of images, are all refuted in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Frankford,</hi> as I haue declared alreadie in a <hi>Treatise</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning worshipping of Images.</p>

Concerning the argument taken from the authotitie of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> who in his booke called <hi>Panarium,</hi> reckoneth not the worshippers of images in the roll of Heretiques: it is answered by the Councell of FRANKFORD, that incase <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had counted the haters of the worshippers of images Heretiques, hee had likewise inferted their names in the catalogue of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques: but seeing hee hath not so done, the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> had no just cause to triumph so much in this friuolous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which maketh more against them, that it maketh for them.</p>
                     <p>More-ouer, in the Councell of FRANKFORD, the Epistle of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> written to <hi>Ihonne,</hi> bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> was read, wherein hee disalloweth the verie inbringing of images into Churches: and this Epistle was translated out of Grieke into the Latine language, by <hi>Ierom.</hi> The Epistle is worthie to bee read.

It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee sufficiently expressed in words, what malice <hi>Sathan</hi> hath born against the true preaching of the word of God, &amp; the right
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18670:344"/>
ministration of the Sacraments. The sixt persecution of Ethnick Emperoures was so directly set against the Preachers of Gods worde, as the worlde might easily discerne, that the intention of <hi>Maximinus</hi> was to vndoe the sheepe-folde of God, for lacke of pastures, and of refreshing waters. For this cause let not our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations be rauished with admiration, when we heare or reade, that manie questions haue beene mooued concerning the holie Sacrament of the Lords Supper. If there were not plenty of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall consolation to bee receiued by the right participation of this holy Sacrament, <hi>Sathan</hi> had neuer busied himselfe so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly against it, as if the throate of his kingdome were cut, if this Sacrament be rightly ministred by the Preachers, &amp; rightlie receiued by the people.</p>
                     <p>Let the Christian Reader remember, that of olde vnder the tenne persecuting Emperoures the receiuing of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lordes Supper was called the banquet of <hi>Thyestes:</hi> This proceeded from none other ground, but from the malice of the Deuill, hating the Lords holy banquet: Secondly, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichean</hi> heretiques so peruerted the Lords holy Sacrament, that <hi>Augustine</hi> (to whom their secret mysteries were not vnknowne) was compelled to call their Communion <hi>Execramentum,</hi> and not <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> that is, an execrable thing, and not a Sacrament: Thirdly, the <hi>Donatists,</hi> in ministring the Lords Sacraments, were in an opinion, That the Sacrament was onely effectuall, when it was ministred by one of their owne number. But seeing the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of <hi>Sathan</hi> is an infinite thing, and hath not a period wherein it endeth. For defacing of the right vse of the holy Sacrament, <hi>Sathan</hi> filled the heart of an hereticall Monke called <hi>Damascene,</hi> with a lewde opinion, to affirme, That the bread in the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was transsubstantiate into the body of Christ, and that the wine was transsubstantiate into His blood. Which opinion I may justly call a Noueltie, because it was neither in worde nor writ hearde before the seuen hundreth yeere of our Lord. But it is the custome of Papists to follow Nouelties, and in the meane time to bragge of Antiquitie. What abuses of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followed after the seuen hundreth yeere of our Lord, God willing shall bee declared in its owne time, for the present thus much I say, That vpon a time I saw the images of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:18670:344"/>
pictured by an vnlearned painter, with such habite as the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> are appareled with in our dayes: These pictures made mee not to thinke that the <hi>Germane</hi> habite was in vse in the dayes of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> but rather that the painter was a foolishe man, &amp; destitute of vnderstanding: Euen so, when I reade the works of <hi>Damascene,</hi> albeit I was at that time but young in yeeres, yet I thought not that the opinion of <hi>Damascene</hi> was agreeable to Apostolicke doctrine, but rather that <hi>Damascene</hi> was a foolishe and doating Monke, and somewhat ambitious also, desiring to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted the author of some new opinion, which no man had maintained before him.</p>
                     <p>IN this TREATISE I shall first declare (God willing) what it is that they call Transsubstantiation: secondly, howe absurde an opinion it is: and thirdly, with what relÃ¹ctation it was insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated into the bosome of the Latine Church, but euer vntill this daye was rejected of the Grieke Church. Nowe Transsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation (as they saye) is an euanishing of the substance of bread and wine after the wordes of consecration, and a substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the bodie &amp; blood of Christ, in place of the euanished substance of bread and wine, the accidents of bread and wine alwayes remaining without inherence into anie subject. Albeit the worde <hi>Transsubstantiation</hi> seemeth to import a change of one substance into another, and the moste part of them define it to bee a chaunge of the substance of bread into the substance of Christes bodie: yet some of them doe forsee a great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie, if Transsubstantiation be defined to a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ge of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread into the substance of Christes bodie: namely this, that Christes bodie in heauen, cladde with a most glorious and celestiall brightnesse, and Christes bodie in earth, ouershad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with the accidentes of bread and wine, shall not bee counted one and the selfe same bodie, in respect that the bodie of Christ that is in heauen was formed by the holy Spirit, of the substance of the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> and the bodie of Christ in the Sacrament, woulde bee founde to bee made of the substance of bread. This is the cause wherefore they who are more subtile than the rest, abstaine from the grosse definition afore-saide.

                     <p>Concerning consecration of the elementes, there are diuerse opinions: The <hi>Romane</hi> Church supposeth, that the wordes of Consecration are these, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>

                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>

                     <p>The time, in the which the elementes are thought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, is not the time in the which these wordes, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> &amp;c. are begun to bee vttered, but rather when they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: So that the consecration is not an action fashioned by partes, but wholly in one minute, and at once perfected, when the wordes are ended. Albeit I agree to this opinion with full consent of my mind: yet I could wish, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, who haue auouched y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, would make no exception against their owne doctrine. But when they speake of the intention of the consecrating Priest (which is continually vnknowne to the people) the people are left in a doubt whether they are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Christes bodie or not. And this is not the forme of the teaching of Christ, to leaue the people in a suspence and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but to manifest clearely vnto them the mysterie whereof they doubt, if so bee it bee necessarie to bee knowne: as Christ manifested to his Disciples the parable of the sower and the, <note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> seede, and of the husbandrie and the tares, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The first word of Consecration is the principall word impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Transsubstantiation: for the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The moste ancient Fathers are moste vnacquainted with this Noueltie of <hi>Transsubstantiation:</hi> for they all in one voyce for the space of 500. yeeres, doe consent, that the substance of bread and wine remaineth in the Sacrament after the wordes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, <note place="margin">Iust. apol. 2</note> albeit the vse of the elementes bee changed <hi>Iustinus</hi>

Martyr saith, that the elementes in the Sacrament of the Supper <note place="margin">Ioann. 1. 14</note> are made the flesh and the blood of Iesus, in that same forme that the eternall worde of God was made flesh: but so it is, that the substance of the diuine nature, neither euanished, nor yet was changed into the substance of flesh: And in like manner, the bread is made the body of Christ, neither by the euanishing of the substance thereof, nor yet by changing the substance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into another substance.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, <hi>Ireneus,</hi> when he saith, that the holy Eucharist consisteth of things earthly, and of thinges celestiall: by mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of earthly things, hee would declare, that the substance of <note place="margin">Iren. contra Valent. lib. 4 cap. 34</note> the bread and wine remaineth after the consecration. And lest any man (by shifting wordes) shoulde saye, that <hi>Ireneus</hi> meaneth not by earthly thinges the substance of bread and wine, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the accidents, hee expresseth his owne meaning, in the 32. chap. that he is speaking of the bread and the cuppe.</p>

                        <hi>Ambrose,</hi> speaking of the operatiue vertue of the Lords word <note place="margin">Ambros. de Sacr. 1. 4. c. 4</note> in the Sacrament, he saith, that the elementes remaine that same thing which they were, &amp; they are changed into another thing, because the substance of the elements remaineth, and their vse is changed. Like as a regenerated man in substance both of soule and body, is that same man that hee was before, yet in qualities and conditions there is a great change.

The wordes of <hi>Theodoretus</hi> are not more effectual to instruct vs in the right judgement concerning the nature of the Sacrament, than the very purpose whereat hee aimeth in those his Dialogues: They are written of purpose, to refute the heresie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> who affirmed, that after the diuine nature assumed the humane nature, all became diuinitie, and there was not two distinct natures in Christ, but one only. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doretus,</hi> for refutation of this heresie, bringeth a comparison ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

                     <p>These speaches of <hi>Theodoretus</hi> doe import two thinges: First, that the elementes in the Sacrament of the Supper remaine still in their owne substance, and their substance is neither changed, nor euanished: Secondly, that in the holy Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, there are signes, not accidentall, but the elementes in their owne substance remaining, are signes of the body and blood of Jesus Christ.

                        <hi>Augustine</hi> in like manner, is so farre from imagining that the substance of the bread is euanished, or turned into another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that he putteth a difference betwixt <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> and <hi>res</hi>

Of this it is euident, that <hi>Augustine</hi> calleth that <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> which is eaten, either wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily or vnworthily, either to saluation or to damnation. And he is speaking of the substance of bread and wine which can bee eaten &amp; drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, and not of accidents, which no man can eat or drinke. But wherefore doe I spende time to cite testimonies of Fathers, to prooue, that after the wordes of blessing the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the holy Supper, neither change their substance, nor yet doeth their substance euanishe, when I haue brought tenne times moe testimonies than I haue already done, I shall receiue this answere returned vnto mee, That whatsoeuer was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

of these Fathers, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> generall Councell of <hi>Lateran, anno</hi> 1215. which was wiser than these fore-mentioned Fathers, haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a deeper consideration into this matter, than these Fathers did: and they haue allowed the doctrine of <hi>Transsubstantiation.</hi> Howsoeuer, let me obtaine this fauour at the hands of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader, that he may consider, that they who brag so much of Antiquitie, are driuen backe to seeke refuge in the Noueltie of late Councels.</p>
                     <p>THE latter part of their definition, wherein they say, that after consecration the accidents of bread and wine, such as whitenesse, roundnesse, and rednesse, doe remaine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without inherence into any subject. In this part I blame them againe of Noueltie. No ancient Father euer spake of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents without a subject. And albeit M. <hi>Harding</hi> impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tly citeth the testimonie of <hi>Basilius Magnus,</hi> to prooue, that accidentes may subsist without a subject because in the first dayes creation there was light, &amp; this light had no subsistance in any subject. This citing of the authoritie of an ancient Father, expresse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his owne meaning and wordes, is an intolerable abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the writinges of Fathers. The words of <hi>Basilius</hi> are these, (as is well obserued by the learned Doctor IEWEL) <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>But seeing they haue refuge continually to the Omnipotent power of God, when they vtter pointes of new and absurde do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and they saye, that God by his Omnipotent power can make that accidents shall subsist without a subject. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, That our disputation with them is not about the power of God, but about the will of God, in the matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And it is the will of God in the Sacrament of the Supper, to leade vs vnto Christ, as the onely bread of life, by whome our soules are nourished vnto eternall saluation. And the Lord vseth the externall signes to leade vs to the thing signified. What are we, that wee should despise the simplest meanes of the working

of God? Not only doeth the externall signes leade vs to Christ, but also the analogie and similitude that is betwixt the bread &amp; Christs body, leadeth vs to a consideration of the nourishing vertue that is in Christs body, to feede vs vnto eternall life.

                     <p>Secondly, this substance that remaineth in the Sacrament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">The second absurditie.</note> the words of consecration, is knowne to be capable of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: for Emperours Kinges and Popes, haue bene poysoned by the consecrated hostie, such as the Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, and Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the third, was poysoned in the Challice: therefore, it cannot bee the reall body of Christ, which f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Thirdly, if Christes body after the words of consecration bee corporally present in the Sacrament, then is it at one time both in heauen and in earth: in heauen vnder a glorious similitude, and in earth inuisible, and ouer-couered with the accidentes of bread and wine, which aggreeth not with the nature of a true humane bodie, to bee at one time in diuerse places, whereof I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18670:349"/>
shall speake at greater length hereafter, God willing. Onely at this time, I affirme, that the Papistes are vntimously serious to proue the corporall presence of Christs body in the sacrament, which position if it were granted, yet are they nothing nearer to their purpose, neither are we put backe in any thing whereunto we shoot and aime: because if Christ were corporally present in the Sacrament, as they speake, yet no vertue can be drawne out <note place="margin">Marc. 5. 34</note> of him to the comfort of our soules, but onely by spirituall tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching by faith, as appeareth in the woman diseased with the bloodie issue.</p>
                     <p>The doctrine of <hi>Trans substantiation</hi> not only importeth corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall presence of Christs body in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of the Supper, but <note place="margin">The fourth absurditie.</note> also corporal manducation of the body of Christ which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to godly &amp; vngodly men: and this they deny not, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they say, that godly men eat Christs body worthily, &amp; vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> eat Christs body vnworthily. But I affirme, that if vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men eat the body of Christ corporally in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Supper, then is his body receiued in the sacrament by them to whom it is not promised in the worde, which is an absurde thing: For like as a seale affixed to a charter, sealeth vp nothing to him to whome the charter promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, True it is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnbelecuers haue no fellowship with Christ, no not although they eat his body corporally, because they eat it vnworthily. But to this I answere, that this their doctrine is new, and vnknowne to antiquitie: For ancient Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a worthie &amp; vnworthie eating of the Sacrament of Christs body, but not a worthy &amp; vnworthy eating of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, in respect <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Res veroipsa cujus sacramentum est omni homini ad vitam, nulls adexitium, quicunque ejus particeps fuerit:</hi> that <note place="margin">August. in Ioan. 6.

                     <p>The doctrine of <hi>Transsubstantiation</hi> importeth also accidentes without a subject, as hath beene touched in a part before in the

It is hard to bee a prolocutor for an euill cause, for it is like vnto a bulge in a wall, which falleth, and bruiseth him who woulde sustaine it, which cannot sustaine it selfe.

                        <hi>Mailrosius Scotus,</hi> liued vnder the reigne of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> about the yeere of our Lord 800. and likewise RABANVS, Bishop of <hi>Mentz:</hi> these two had so acquainted themselues with the doctrine of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that they could in no manner of way giue allowance to the doctrine of <hi>Transsubstantiation.</hi> And about the yeere of our Lord 840. <hi>Carolus</hi> the second, the sonne of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douicus Pius,</hi> and brother to <hi>Lotharius,</hi> and <hi>Ludouicus Germanicus,</hi> he writ to <hi>Bertramus,</hi> a Presbyter, to haue his resolution concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the mysterie of the Sacrament, and after what manner of way the body and blood of Christ was present in the Sacrament. To whome hee returned this answere, That in the Sacrament of <note place="margin">Bertram. de corpore &amp; sanguine Domini.</note> the holy Supper there were some thinges that were perceiued with bodily senses, other thinges were taken holde of onelie by faith: And the bread and the wine were to vs the body &amp; blood of Christ, as MANNA, and the waters of the spirituall rock were Christs body and blood to the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. This opinion aggreeth well with the doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Fathers in the wildernesse ate that same spirituall food which <note place="margin">1.

                        <hi>Transsubstantiation,</hi> and the <hi>Romane</hi> Bishops were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mooued with great indignation, as appeareth by the number of Councels as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled against one poore man, who durst presume to speake against the opinion once embraced by the <hi>Romane</hi> Church. <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth gathered a Councel at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the which he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the opinion of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and excommunicated him, euen before he was warned to be present at the Councell, and before hee was heard. Hee assembled also another Councell in <hi>Vercellis,</hi> about the yeere of our Lord 1051. in the which <hi>Borengarius</hi> was not present: but Messengers who came to pleade his cause, were imprisoned, and casten into bands, and the booke of <hi>Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Scotus Mailrosius, De Eucharistia,</hi> was condemned. By the way, if any equitie had beene kept in these Councels, looke by what reason they condemned <hi>Ioannes Scotus,</hi> whose opinion <hi>Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> followed: by the like reason they shoulde haue condemned <hi>Augustine,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> whose opinion <hi>Ioannes Mailrosius</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.

And when the cause is demaunded, wherefore there was no Sacrament of Pennance, when men confessed their sinnes with a contrite heart, and were baptized <note place="margin">Matth. 3</note> by IHON, and brought foorth the fruits of amendement of life? Wee can heare no answere, except this, that men confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their sinnes in generall before they were baptized of IHON: But in the Sacrament of Pennance a particular confession of sinnes is required. And in this they discouer their owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for in the action of repentance, instituted by GOD, it is enough that all things be present, which God requireth: But in the Sacrament of Pennance, instituted by man, &amp; not by God, if any thing be inlaking which humane cogitation hath founde out, the doctrine of <hi>Ihon Baptist,</hi> the contrition, consession, and satisfaction of the people, together with <hi>Ihon Baptists</hi> absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all is nothing.

How commeth it to passe, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Church ouer-giueth the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, as a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the Sacrament of Pennance had no place, because it was not as yet instituted by Christ? But they count it a Sacrament of the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, instituted by Christ, after his resurrection. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is not so vncouth in his speaches, who attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Baptisme to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and Circumcision to vs (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. &amp; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.) in regarde their Sacramentes differed from our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, rather in the signe, than in the thing signified. But the <hi>Romane</hi> Church is so disgusted of the olde Testament, that they cannot admit, that the Sacrament of Pennance had place at that time. Notwithstanding, whatsoeuer can bee spoken of the repentance of <hi>Marie Magdalene</hi> and <hi>Zaccheus</hi> in the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the like may be spoken of the repentance of <hi>Dauid</hi> in the olde Testament (2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13.) God mollified his heart, and it was pearced with a deepe sense of his sinne: God lowsed his tongue, and he confessed his iniquitie against himselfe <hi>(Psal.</hi> 32. 5.) hee patiently endured the fatherly chastisementes of GOD inflicted vpon him for his sinne: and the Prophet NATHAN pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced forgiuenesse from GOD. Heere no man can deny, but true repentance is founde in DAVID, consisting in contrition of the heart, confession of the mouth, satisfaction in his deedes, and absolution by the mouth of the Prophet: And what more is requisite in Popishe Pennance? Yet because DAVID con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed his sinnes vnto GOD, and not to the Priest, and hee patientlie sustained the chastisementes of GOD, but not the pennance injoyned to him by the Priest. All that DAVID did appertaineth nothing to the holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of Pennance, which now is in vse in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> Church, in this case, is not vnlike vnto an herde of cattell, possessed a long time into a folde: if any vncouth beast enter in amongst them, they will rudely putte at it, because it <note place="margin">Similitude</note> is vncouth &amp; none of their fellowship: Euen so, when we speake of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> repentance of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which hath allowance in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of God, &amp; of the repentance of <hi>Miriam,</hi> whose satisfaction
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18670:354"/>
(I meane, to remooue the slander shee gaue to Gods people) it was prescribed by Gods owne mouth, and the repehtance of <hi>Ionas</hi> sealed vp by a miraculous worke of his deliuerance from the Whales belly. All this is nothing to them: for albeit here be founde repentance and absolution, yet (saye they) not such as is founde in the Sacrament of Pennance in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church. For in the olde Testament, there is but a prediction, that GOD will forgiue their sinnes, prouiding that they repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t. But in their Sacrament, there is an actuall conferring of remission of sinnes, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> to such as obeye the injunctions of the Priest. What haue we to doe with such foolish and babbling speaches, which are not grounded in Scripture? For the Apostles, who preached repentance and remission of sinnes, after Christes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention to heauen, they ledde the people expressely to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises <note place="margin">Act. 3. 25 26</note> made to the Patriarches and Prophets, concerning the comming of Christ, and of remission of sinnes in him: heereby acknowledging no difference in substance betwixt repentance vnder the olde Testament and vnder the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, because both they and wee are ledde to one fountaine of the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> there to be washen, and to be cleansed from all spotte of <note place="margin">Zach. 13. 1</note> sinne.</p>
                     <p>Truely the doctrine of repentance, taught in holy Scripture, declareth, that it is a worke wrought in vs by the Lord himself, according as Christ our Lord witnesseth, saying, <hi>No man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioan. 6. 44</note> 
                        <hi>vnto mee, except my Father, who sent me, draw him.</hi> The meanes whereby this worke is wrought in vs, is by the fearefull trumpet of the law, and by the sweet promises of the Gospell. The instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, which GOD vseth in this worke, are the Prophets, Apostles, their successors. None of these things can be denied: for the Apostle saieth, <hi>God was in Christ, and reconciled the Worlde</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 19. 20</note> 
                        <hi>vnto himselfe, not imputing their sinnes vnto them: and hath committed vnto vs the worde of reconciliation: no we then are wee Ambassadours for Christ, as though God did beseech you, through vs: we pray you in Christs sleade, to beereconciled vnto God.</hi> In these fore-mentioned places of Scripture three thinges are set downe: First, God is counted the efficient worker of repentance: Secondly, the promises of the Gospell (whereunto the terroures of the lawe prepare an open doore) are the meanes, alluring vs to repentance: Thirdly, the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18670:354"/>
Ministers of the Worde, are the instrumentes to carrie the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of reconciliation vnto vs. The very law it selfe, and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, cannot haue the honour due to God, who is the efficient worker of repentance, because both law and Gospell was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to reprobate <hi>Iewes:</hi> but they were not conuerted by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the trueth of God, in regarde the Lord, who is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient worker of repentance, wrought not inwardly in their hearts. As concerning the Preachers of the doctrine of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, they receiue their honour from their Ambassadrie, and they giue no honour vnto it, except by accident, in respect of the people, who carry the greater reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce to an holy message, when they see the Ambassadour who carrietith, to bee an holy man. But now let vs consider God in the worke of repentance as the <note place="margin">Isai. 43. 12</note> head, the message of reconciliation as the stomacke, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the word, who carrieth this message, as the feete: whose feete, albeit they bee called beautifull, in regarde of the sweete message which they carry, yet the feete must neither haue the honour of the head, nor of the stomack. But the <hi>Romane</hi> church, by giuing this honour to a priest, that hee conferreth, <hi>exopere operato,</hi> remission of sinnes to the person who confesseth in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular all his faults vnto him, they giue the honour of the head to the feete. Like as in all their Religion their principall drift seemeth to bee this, to leade the people from the Creator, who is blessed for euer, to an excessiue confidence in the creatures of God.</p>
                     <p>The grounde of the Sacrament of Pennance is a conceite of satisfaction, which men can make for their own sinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after Baptisme: as if the promise of remission of sinnes made in Baptisme did extende onely to sinnes preceeding Baptisme. What is this else, but directly to contradict the words of Christ spoken to his Apostles. <hi>Hee who beleeueth, and is baptized, shall bee</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 16. 16</note> 
                        <hi>saued.</hi> Can any man be saued, by an absolution from a part of his sinnes, and not from all his sinnes? This doctrine of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, bringeth in Christ as a Sauiour, and not a Sauiour, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering vs from the debt of by-past sinnes, and setting vs once without the prison doore, but knowing assuredly that wee shall be thrust into the prison againe, there to remaine, vntill wee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for our own sins co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mitted after Baptisme. And they make
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18670:355"/>
vs to be our owne sauiours, rather than Christ: for he who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth a man from his last and greatest trouble, is rather to bee counted his deliuerer, than he who deliuered him from his first trouble.</p>
                     <p>The particular thinges required in the Sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they say, are foure, to wit, Contrition in the heart, Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the mouth, Satisfaction in the deede, and Absolution of <note place="margin">Contrition</note> the Priest. If these things were rightly conceiued, in repentance, all these thinges are necessarily required. But as they are in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, all are meere abominations, and displeasing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
                     <p>First, concerning the Contrition of the heart, the Psalmist speaketh, <hi>The sacrifices of God are a contrit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap> spirit: a contrite, and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</hi> But in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, <note place="margin">psal. 5 1. 17</note> when a <hi>Poenitentiare</hi> commeth to his father <hi>Confessor,</hi> and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth a sinne, not such as he hath already committed, and for the which he is pearced with sore displeasure, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was: but rather hee discouereth to his father <hi>Confessor,</hi> a treasonable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which he is minded to practise, with obstinate purpose, of an incorrigible heart: shall such a man bee counted to haue a contrite and a broken heart? Yet, in our dayes, no man is more welcome to a father <hi>Confessor,</hi> than such a man as discouereth to him horrible treasons, plotted against Noble Princes: Yea, and no confessions are more secretly buried in the mindes of father <hi>Confessors,</hi> than those confessions are. Is this a contrite spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and a broken heart, wherein the Lord delighteth? Or can there bee a greater abuse of the doctrine of Contrition, than to count them contrite in heart, who are bent obstinately to runne forward in the course of vngodlinesse?</p>
                     <p>Popish Contrition is not vnlike vnto the fighting of <hi>Marcus Crassus,</hi> both father and sonne against the <hi>Parthians. Crassus</hi> the elder, in his Oration made to encourage his army to fight va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly, his voyce failed him: <hi>Marcus Crassus,</hi> his sonne, in his <note place="margin">Plutarch. in vita Crass.</note> first out-going out of the house he stumbled: Both these things were counted euill presages of the vnprosperous successe of the battell, which after followed. And what esperance can wee haue of this new found out Sacrament of Popish Pennance, when as they judge so boldly of the first point thereof, that is, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18670:355"/>
counting traitors to bee men of a contrite spirit, whome God hath appointed for the flames of euerlasting burning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they repent.</p>
                     <p>The forme of Confession vsed in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, hath neither warrand nor example in the Scripture of God, that anie <note place="margin">Confession.</note> person should bee bound in particulare to confesse all his secret sinnes to the Priest.

                        <note place="margin">Epist. Iam. cap. 5. vers. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>your faultes one to another, and praye one for another, that yee may be healed,</hi> &amp;c. it should bee expounded by another place of Scripture, wherein a man, who hath offended his neighbour, is commanded to confesse his faults to his neighbour, whome hee hath offended <hi>(Luke</hi> 17. 4) And it belongeth nothing to auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confession, except Popish Priestes would confesse in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular all their sinnes to the people, like as the people confesseth all their secret sinnes in particular to the Priestes, And our Lord and Master Iesus Christ, when hee receiued a particular confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of secret sinnes from the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman, hee sent away his Disciples to <hi>Samaria,</hi> to the ende the weakenesse of a poore <note place="margin">Ihon, 5. 8</note> penitent sinner should not bee troubled by a particular confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of secret sinnes before them who knewe not thinges which were done in secret. But let vs confesse secret sinnes to God, who knoweth things that are done in secret. But sinnes whereby the Church of God is openly slandered, let them also bee openlie confessed.</p>
                     <p>Seeing that auricular confession hath no testimonie in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it followeth to search out by diligent examination, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it had place after the dayes of the Apostles in the first three hundreth yeeres of our Lord. Wee reade of the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stned Emperour <hi>Philippus,</hi> who slewe <hi>Gordianus,</hi> and was slaine by the Emperour <hi>Decius, anno</hi> 250, that hee was desirous about Easter time, to bee admitted vnto the participation of the holy <note place="margin">Euseb. li. 6. cap. 34</note> Sacrament: but this benefit was refused vnto him, vntill the time that he made his publicke repentance, and vntill hee stood in the place where <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap> were accustomed to stand. They were so called, because they were demaunded concerning the sinnes which they had committed, and the sense and feeling of griefe that God had wrought in their heartes for their precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding offences. This was not a secret and auricular confession,
<pb facs="tcp:18670:356"/>
but an open confession of publike sins in sight &amp; open audience of the people. So we see, that for the space of two hundreth and fiftie yeeres after the Lords ascension, auricular and secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of sinnes, to the Bishop or Presbyter, was vnknowne in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Nowe if at any time open confession of sinnes shoulde haue ceassed, and giuen place to secrete and auricular confession, it was in time of the tenne Persecutions, because that Christians were drawne continually before the judgement seates of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Iudges, from whom the weaknesse and faultes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians might haue beene obscured, if auricular confession had beene in vse at that time. But the Fathers who liued in that age, were so carefull to purge the Church from slander, that they preferred the puritie of the Church vnto their owne liues.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that euen before the ten Persecutions had an ende, some good Christians woulde consult with their Pastors, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was expedient to confesse their sinnes openly before the people, to the edification and good of the Church, or secretly onely to God? But this secrete consulting with the Pastor, what was most needfull to bee done, was not an auricular confession to him of all secret sinnes, but rather an aduisement concerning some sinnes, whether the sinner himselfe and the Church might receiue greater benefite by open confession before the people, or by secret confession to God onely?</p>
                     <p>The wordes of <hi>Origen</hi> very pertinently cited by <hi>Chemnisius</hi> are these, <hi>Consider circumspectly to whom thou shouldest confesse thy sinne.</hi>

                     <p>If the custome of the Primitiue Church were proponed in simplicitie and sinceritie, it shoulde bee founde, that the newe toye of auricular confession cannot bee shrowded vnder the vaile of great Antiquitie.</p>
                     <p>Whatsoeuer a fewe men, wounded more deepely with a sense of sinne, than others, they did voluntarily in powring out their sinnes in the bosome of their Pastors, albeit they had neither sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed

                        <hi>Theodosius</hi> himselfe confessed his fault openly, and in sight of the people at <hi>Millane,</hi> for the slaughter of the innocent people of <hi>Thessalonica.</hi> Secondly, it is to bee marked, that <hi>Nectarius</hi> in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the custome of auticular confession, he acknowledged it to bee but an humane, and not a diuine constitution: for who dare abolishe, either in doctrine, or discipline, the constitutions and ordinances of God?</p>

finnes, who is not Eternall GOD, <hi>(Marke 2. 7.)</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in forme of a Messenger, executing GODS commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in such manner as GOD hath prescribed in his holie worde. It is great vncertaintie to absolue men from the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their faults, but not from their punishment: insomuch, that if they bee preuented by death, before they haue fulfilled the pennance enjoyned by the Priest, then their soules must bee tormented in Purgatorie, vntill they haue made full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for their offences. Then Popishe Absolution, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon the vncertaintie of a mans life, cannot bee a certaine thing, but a miserable excrutiation of poore soules, put in vaine hope of absolution, and yet vncertaine whether they be absolued or not.</p>
                     <p>Nowe because they will needes referre the institution of the Sacrament of Pennance vnto CHRIST, as the Author thereof, when Hee breathed vpon His Disciples, and saide, <hi>Whose sinnes yee remitte, they are remitted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(Ihon, chapt. 20. verse 23.)</hi> Necessitie constraineth them to prooue two thinges out of the wordes of CHRIST, which they count essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in the Sacrament of Pennance; First, that CHRIST commaunded a penitent sinner to make a particulare rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of his secrete sinnes in the eare of the Priest: which thing CHRIST neuer commaunded. Secondlie, that in the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of a penitent sinner, CHRIST commaunded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne vnto him a satisfaction, whereby hee might merite at the handes of GOD forgiuenesse for sinnes committed after Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme: which thing CHRIST neuer commaunded: yea, repugneth manifestlie to the Holie Scriptures of GOD, in the which it is saide, <hi>With one offering hath Hee consecrated for euer them that are sanctified, Hebr. chapt. 10. vers. 14.</hi> This is not a single and vpright dealing to referre the institution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Pennance vnto CHRIST, when as they cannot prooue, that thinges moste essentiallie requisite in their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath allowance from the mouth of CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>I compare the <hi>Romanists</hi> in their doctrine of Pennance to king <hi>Hezekias,</hi> not in time of his zeale &amp; vprightnes, but in time of his reproueable weaknes: for hee shewed vnto the Ambassadours of <note place="margin">Isai. 39. 2</note>

the King of BABEL, the house of his treasures, his Siluer, Golde, Spices, and Precious Ointmentes, and all the house of his Armour. The Messengers of the King of BABEL had no such commission from their Master, to viewe the Treasures, Riches, and Armour of King HEZEKIAS: but onely to present letters of congratulation for the miraculous restitution of HEZEKIAS to health, and to bring vnto him a present from MERODACH BALADEN, King of BABEL. But HEZEKIAS, King of IVDA, in his reprooueable weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (as I haue alreadie spoken) let the Ambassadoures see maine chinges, which they had no commission to see, to the great harme and disaduantadge of his posteritie: Euen so, CHRIST sent out His Apostles, and their true Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, to preach the doctrine of repentance, and remission of sinnes. But the ROMANE Church will let the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doures of GOD see such thinges, as are not contained in their commission, to wit, a particular confession of all secrete sinnes, together with a satisfaction to GOD for sinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after Baptisme, of which thinges no mention is made in the written worde of GOD.</p>
                     <p>Heere I leaue them, delighting in their Nouelties, which haue no grounde from the mouth of CHRIST, nor from the doctrine of His Apostles.</p>
                     <p>Yea, they are like vnto the frogges of the Ile of SERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHVS, one of the Iles called CYCLADES, in the which the Frogges sette vp their heads in the Monethes of March and Aprill, but they vtter no sounding voyce. as the Frogges in <note place="margin">Similitude</note> other places doe: Euen so, the ROMANE Church holdeth vp their heads, as if they would prooue, that CHRIST in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted this Sacrament, but they faint in the probation.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Sacrament of Confirmation, there is a glorious shewe of a signe, and a spirituall thing signified. The outward signe is Chrisme, that is, Oyle, mixed with some mixture of Baulme, which beeing signated with the signe of the Crosse, vpon the fore-head of him who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, in the Name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost: they saye, that with this outwarde signe is conferred the seuen-folde grace of the holy Spirit. And this Sacrament they extoll aboue the Sacrament of Baptisme, because the grace of God which is begunne in vs by Baptisme, is perfected by the Sacrament of Confirmation: Yea, and a Priest, or Deacon of the Church, may baptize: but the Sacrament of Confirmation must only bee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrated by a Bishop.</p>
                     <p>Verie early did Popish bishops prouide, that they shoulde not be altogether idle: for they beganne to loath the office of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and baptizing: and lest they should seeme to bee idle bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they reserued some easie exercise to themselues, to wit, the making of Chrisme, and anointing the people therewith.</p>
                     <p>To all this is added a Rhetoricall discourse, That the people of Israell, after they had passed thorow the redde Sea, they ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into a Wildernesse, in the which they had a great combate with many troubles, before they could enter into their rest. And in like manner, after that we are baptized, we haue a great fight with many aduersaries &amp; troubles, before we can enter into the rest of God. All this is true, but what is inferred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> this? If the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> were our instructor, hee woulde bid vs put on the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18670:359" rendition="simple:additions"/>
complete armour of God, to the ende that we might withstand <note place="margin">Ephes. 6</note> spirituall wickednesse, and eate the blessed bread, and drinke the cuppe of blessing, to the ende that beeing corroborated by <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10</note> the strength of the Sacramentes ordained by God, wee might fight a good fight, and finishe our journey with joye. This is the Apostolicke doctrine. But Papistes will correct the Apostolicke doctrine in all points, &amp; they wil haue a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to be corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Chrisme &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament of confirmation, to the end he may passe ouer the stormie tentations of this world in peace.</p>
                     <p>Let mee now demand of them two thinges: One concerning the signe, Another concerning the thing signified. Concerning the signe, I demand who gaue commandement to vse it? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the thing signified, I demaunde who hath promised to conferre the seuen-folde grace of the holy Spirite to them who are signated vpon the fore-head by the bishops thombe with the signe of the Crosse? These two thinges, to wit, the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and the promise are inlacking in Popish Sacramentes: and so their newe found out Sacramentes are like vnto a bodie that is not quickened with a soule. The Scholasticke Doctors, the first inuentors of this pluralitie of Sacraments, they confesse roundly, that the Sacrament of Confirmation hath no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in holy Scripture, such as <hi>Alexander Alensis, Bonaventura,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who after much fatigation of himselfe and others also, hee cannot finde, that euer Christ, or yet His Apostles, conferred this Sacrament to any person. Whatsoeuer they can cite out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or <hi>Basilius,</hi> or any ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, for the confirmation of Chrisme, it is certaine, that they confesse, that this custome hath no authoritie of the written worde of God. And this is the principall marke whereat I aime in all my writinges, to prooue, that there is no Antiquitie where <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, the written word of God, doeth not confirme the antiquitie of that which is alleadged.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> Church waketh great businesse to proue that in holy Scripture many promises of confirmation and corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worke of God begunne in vs are contained: But they bestirre themselues in vaine, in proouing that thing, which no man denieth. But incase they would prooue, that the Sacrament of Confirmation is a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t in a proper sense, then it became
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18670:359"/>
them to proue, that God in His word hath promised the grace of confirmation, to such as are signated vpon the fore-head and annointed with Chrisme, and buffeted vpon the chieke with the bishops hand. Seeing none of these thinges can bee prooued by Scripture, it is a friuolous thing for them to alleadge a promise made by God, when as they inuent the element whereunto this promise shall bee annexed. If this bee a forme, according to the which Sacraments should be fashioned: then I dare affirme, that the number of Sacraments may be multiplied, according to the number of the promises contained in the word of God: So that God shall make a promise, and man shall inuent, without anie warrand of Gods commandement, an external element, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the promise shall bee annexed. By this forme of doing not onely may they make vp seuen Sacramentes, but also seuentie times seuen Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that the holy Apostles, by imposition of handes, conferred the gift of the holy Spirit (that is, the gift of Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) <note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> to many professors of the true Faith: and this gift conferred vnto them, confirmed them in the faith of Christ. But what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth this vnto the Popish Sacrament of Confirmation, in the which the externall signe of imposition of handes is inlacking, and the promise of a spirituall grace annexed to the signe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so inlacking: and finally, that thing which was extraordinarie and appertaining to a few, is brought in as the ground of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Sacrament, which shoulde appertaine to all them who beleeue.</p>
                     <p>I will not insist long to speake of this new Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. Onely this I say, that whatsoeuer is brought in into the Church of God, with derogation of the dignitie of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, an holy Sacrament instituted by Christ himselfe, it should <note place="margin">Matth. 28</note> be abhorred. But so it is, that the Sacrament of Confirmation is brought in with a derogation to the dignitie of Baptisme, <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The seconde part of the argument is prooued by their slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and derogatiue speaches of Baptisme, together with their superlatiue aduancements of the eminencie of the Sacrament of Confirmation. In Baptisme they say that wee receiue not the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, defending, gouerning, and strengthening Spirite of God: but all these graces are conferred in the Sacrament of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18670:360"/>
Confirmation. Likewise, in Baptisme is prepared an habitation to God: but the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost enter not into this habitation before wee receiue the Sacrament of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. What can be more directly repugnant to H. Scripture? <note place="margin">Marke 16</note> wherein it is expressely said, <hi>He who beleeueth, and is baptized, shall be saued.</hi> Can any man be saued, befor his soule be an habitation and Temple in the which God is content to dwell? So that the doctrine of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church is like vnto the nauigation of men who dare presume to saile in deepe and dangerous Seas without a Compasse: Euen so, they talke of matters of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance without the warrande of holy Scripture: whereby it commeth to passe, that their doctrine in many pointes is flatte repugnant to holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the testimonies of Fathers, whereby they ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to proue the Sacrament of Confirmation, I might answere compendiously with S. <hi>Augustine, Quicquid attulerint, &amp; unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque attulerint, audiamus potius, si oues sumus vocem pastoris nostri: non ergo audiamus, haec ego dico, haec tu duis: sed haec dicit Dominus:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">August. de unitate Eccles, cap. 3</note> that is, <hi>Whatsoeuer they bring in, and from whence soeuer they haue brought it in, if we be the Lords sheepe, let vs rather bearken to the voyce of our shephearde: therefore, let vs not hearken to them who saye, This I saye, or this thou sayest, but this saieth the Lord.</hi> Neuerthelesse, seeing they glorie so much of ancient Fathers, let the judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beware of supposititious writings, and he shall not find this Chrisme in ancient writers. The Sermon of <hi>Cyprian, De Chrismate,</hi> is knowne to be supposititious. The opinion of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who writeth, that they who are baptized with water, haue not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Holy Spirit, but are prepared to receiue it by anointing <note place="margin">Tertull. de Baptism.</note> with oyle, and imposition of handes, after baptisme: doeth not euery man, who is versed in the reading of Fathers, smell, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> writte this when hee made defection from the trueth, and was intangled with the errour of the <hi>Montanistes?</hi> And <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> in the bookes of his epistles, when he attributeth too much to Vnction with Oyle and imposition of hands, after baptisme, <note place="margin">Cypr. lib. 1 epist. 12</note> it is easie to perceiue, that he borrowed this errour from <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> whom he acknowledged as his Master. But neither <hi>Tertullian</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Idem, lib. 2 epist. 1</note> nor <hi>Cyprian</hi> are speaking of the Popishe Sacrament of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but of annointing with oyle and imposition of handes
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18670:360"/>
immediately after baptisme. Marke the words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> where he saith, <hi>Non posse esse filios Dei, si non utroque sacramento nascantur, lauacro scilicet aquae in verbo, &amp; unctione Chrismatis:</hi> that is, <hi>They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee the sonnes of God, except they bee borne againe by both the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to wit, by the lauacre of water in the word, and the anointment of Chrisme.</hi> True it is, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> calleth the anointment of oyle after baptisme, a Sacrament different from the dipping in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but his meaning is, that the anointing with oyle is an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment different from the element of water, and <hi>Augustine</hi> long after <hi>Cyprian,</hi> calleth the externall signe of the Sacrament, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <note place="margin">August. in Euangel. Ioan. cap. 6 tract. 26</note> and the thing represented by it, <hi>res sacramenti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nowe what vantadge hath the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, when they take holde of the wordes, <hi>utroque Sacramento,</hi> that is, both the Sacraments? and in the meane time they neither take heede to the sandie grounde, whereupon <hi>Cyprian</hi> leaneth, to wit, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> neither yet take they heede in what sense <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> calleth anointing with oyle a Sacrament, to wit, because it is one of the elementes, whereby our spirituall birth is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.</p>
                     <p>The reuerence that was carried toward the ceremonies of si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification in the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> hath made a patent doore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospell, to receiue many legall ceremonies, such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration by oyle, the linnen Ephod, the lightes shining all the night long, and many other ceremonies, which are the more easily embraced, because in Poprie the substance of godlinesse is vtterly forsaken, and vaine ceremonies are adhered vnto, euen such as are ceassed, because they had their performance in <note place="margin">Similitude</note> Christ. And like as it is a follie to take the huskes of the wine grapes, after the liquor is pressed out of them, and to cast them into the wine-presse againe: Euen so, it is a foolishe conceite to returne the ceremonies of signification, which haue had their performance in Christ, and are abolished, to haue place againe in the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, let the <hi>Romane</hi> Church bragge of Antiquitie as much as they please, in their Sacrament of Confirmation, no antiquitie shall bee founde, and that for three causes: First<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the anointing with oyle, whereof the Fathers doe speake, is not a different sacrament from baptisme, but a ceremonie
<pb facs="tcp:18670:361"/>
Preceeding and following Baptisme. Secondly, the oyle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with persons baptized were anointed, was not mixed with Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. And thirdly, after baptisme, anointing with oyle, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands followed immediately: but in the Sacrament of Confirmation, when it began to take place in the Church of God, anointing with oyle mixed with Balsome followed not immediately vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the necke of baptisme, as a continuate action: but it was ministred 12. or 15. yeere after baptisme: so that it is a deluding of the world, and a peruerting of those who are weak in vnderstanding, to proue that the Sacrament of Confirmation is an auncient Sacrament in the Church, because it was an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient custome to anoint with oyle those who were baptized, as if Baptisme and Confirmation were both one thing, which they vtterly denie.</p>
                     <p>Let the judicious Reader vnderstand, that the purpose of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church to aduaunce their Sacrament of Confirmation with impairing of the dignitie of Baptisme, is but a new Popish inuention: For the writers, after the dayes of the Apostles, the more auncient they are, the more they magnifie the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptisme: by which (saieth <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus)</hi>

Whereas auncient Writers haue attributed to Baptisme receiued truelie, and with singlenesse of heart, such perfection as leadeth vs vnto immortallitie and eternall life.</p>

                        <hi>Lindanus</hi> pineth himselfe much, as a woman trauelling in birth, to bring foorth her childe: so doeth hee endeuour with <note place="margin">Lindan. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopl. lib 4 cap. 29</note> all his might, to prooue, that CHRIST instituted the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confirmation, and that the Chrisme shoulde bee renewed from yeere to yeere, and that this custome hath beene continuallie in vse since the dayes of the Apostles, not onelie in the Church of ROME, but also in the Churches of AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIOCHIA, HIERVSALEM, and EPHESVS. This is a verie confident assertion, if hee coulde make it good. And for proofe of all this geare, is brought foorth asupposititious let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:18670:361"/>
of <hi>Fabian,</hi> bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The cause is weake that is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon such sandie grounde as Decretall Epistles doe falselie attribute to a great number of the bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi> The olde prouerbe hath place in <hi>Lindanus,</hi> as much as in anie Writer, <hi>Parturiunt Montes, nascetur ridiculus Mus:</hi> that is, <hi>The Mountaines are trauailing in birth, and aridiculous Mouse shall bee brought foorth. Fabianus</hi> testimonie, written in a Legende of lies, that is, in Decretall Epistles, vnknown to Antiquitie, is no sure ground to any man to leane his Faith vpon it.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, he fetcheth a compasse to draw this Sacrament of Confirmation out of Scripture one way or other, and hee saith, that Christ commaunded his Apostles, who were already bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, to remain at <hi>Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,</hi> vntill they were endewed with stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>gth from aboue <hi>(Act. 1)</hi> &amp; in the day of Penticost, the H.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon them in the similitude of fiery &amp; clouen tongs <hi>(Act. 2)</hi> &amp; again, the disciples at <hi>Samaria,</hi> who were already baptized, yet by imposition of the handes of the Apostles, they receiued the gift of the H. Spirit <hi>(Act, 8. 17)</hi> What can <hi>Lindanus</hi> inferre vpon these groundes? Christ bestowed vpon Christians, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready baptized, a more ample grace than they had at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they were baptized, &amp; Christ added a signe in time of Confirmation, somtimes fiery tongues, &amp; somtimes imposition of hands: <hi>ergo,</hi> Confirmation is a Sacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t: it followeth not: for God in ordinary sacraments, like as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth promises appertaining to al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beleeuers: euen so in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he sealeth vp these promises by signes appertaining to all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> members of the Church of God: but promises belonging to a small number, &amp; sealed vp with signs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ferred vnto a few, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not bee the ground of a sacrament, which is a seale of the couenant of God, belonging to all true professors and beleeuers. And when <hi>Lindanus</hi> hath troubled himselfe with much businesse, in end he granteth that Chrisming is an vnwritten tradition, and hath no authoritie in the written word of God, citing the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>Basilius Magnus</hi> to this effect: God confirmeth and <note place="margin">Basil. aduer. sus Eunom.</note> strengtheneth them who are baptized in his name, to bring his owne worke begunne in them to a perfection, but not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a newe SACRAMENT. And like as the GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TILES of olde, who worshipped the SVNNE, they
<pb facs="tcp:18670:362"/>
worshipped it not onely for the glory and splendor that was in it, but also for the benefite that it did communicate vnto the earth, by warming it, and making it fruitfull. Euen so, wee doe magnifie God our Creator and maker, not onely for his owne most excellent and incomprehensible glorie, but also because he daylie refresheth our soules with his goodnesse, &amp; strengtheneth our weaknesse with the power of his sauing grace. These are points whereof no man doubteth: and a large and fruitfull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vpon this subject is a commendation of the superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant goodnesse of God: but it belongeth nothing to prooue that Chrisming is a Sacrament distinct from Baptisme.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>African</hi> Councell, called <hi>Mileuitanum,</hi> pronounced an Anatheme against all those who saye, that the grace of God in <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Canon</hi> 3</note> Baptisme conferreth only remission of sinnes already co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mitted, &amp; that in it there is no support promised to preserue men from sinnes in time to come that they bee not committed. Whereby wee may euidently perceiue, that the spirituall graces, which the <hi>Romane</hi> Church referreth to the Sacrament of Confirmation, were of olde referred to the Sacrament of Baptisme.</p>
                     <p>Likewise, <hi>Antididagma Coloniensis</hi> (as <hi>Themnisius</hi> declareth) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, for what cause doth the Presbyter anoint him, who is baptized, with Chrisme, seeing that he is to be anointed of new againe, with Chrisme, in the Sacrament of Confirmation? And out of the booke, <hi>De Gestis Pontificum,</hi> he recordeth a constitution of <hi>Syluester,</hi> That for the perill of vnexpected death, it is meete, that the Presbyter shall anoint with Chrisme him who is to bee baptized, lest through absence of the Bishop the person bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed should depart this life without Confirmation: but if the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop be present, let him be anointed by the bishop. This decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. that of olde Chrisming was annexed to Baptisme. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, to multiplie the number of the Sacraments, they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated it from the action of Baptisme, and made it a peculiar Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to bee ministred some space of time after Baptisme, at the least seuen dayes, for reuerence toward the seuen-folde gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God conferred in the Sacrament of Confirmation, as <hi>Durandus</hi> citeth out of RABANVS: vsually twelue or fifteene yeeres interuene betwixt Baptisme and the Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church. Onely this I request of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18670:362"/>
Reader, that when hee readeth of Chrisming in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, hee would not take it for the Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, but for anointing with oyle in Baptisme. And this custome also had no allowance in the written worde of GOD, as <hi>Basilius</hi> expressely graunteth, in these wordes, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, <hi>What Scripture</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Basil. aduer. sus Eunom. Lindan. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopl. lib. 4 cap. 32</note> 
                        <hi>hath taught vs anointing with Oyle? Doeth not this proceede from secret and mysticke tradition?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, let vs search out this matter to the very grounde, whereby it may bee euidently knowne, howe this Sacrament of Confirmation crept in into the Church. It was a custome of auncient time, that children were presented to Baptisme by their Christian parentes: and albeit their infancie coulde not comprehende the summe of Christian Faith, yet neuer thelesse they were instructed and catechised when they came to yeeres of discretion: and when they had sufficiently comprehended the summe of Christian Faith, their parentes of newe againe presented them to the Bishop, who after hee had receiued in audience of the people, a cleare confession of their Faith, hee blessed them, and with the ceremonie of imposition of handes, prayed to God, that these persons, who had giuen out of their owne mouth a confession of that same Faith, which their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes had professed in their name in Baptisme, might continue in that same true Faith constantly vnto their liues ende. This imposition of handes was vsed to imprint into the heartes of the persons, who had made a confession of their faith, a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reuerence of God, and a greater care to continue constant. But in doing of this, there was no purpose to institute a newe Sacrament of Confirmation in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, persons who were baptized by Heretiques, when they forsooke their heresie, they were not rebaptized, but they were receiued into the Church by the ceremonie of imposition of handes, as hath beene declared in the life of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> CENT. III. CHAP. II. And this imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of handes was joyned with prayer, That it woulde please God to vouchsafe vpon him who was receiued into the bosome of the Church by imposition of handes, the gift of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18670:363"/>
which was offered vnto him in Baptisme, but it was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, because hee professed not the true Faith. Neither can there bee founde in this seconde sort of imposition of handes anie grounde for the Sacrament of Confirmation.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, this Sacrament of Confirmation is either of God or man. If it bee of God, let the warrande of His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement bee brought foorth, in the which Hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to anoint with Chrisme those who are alreadie baptized. And is it not a disficill thing, to these who are content to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice their life for Christes sake to offer their children also to bee signated with Chrisme when they are twelue or fifteene yeeres of age. But if no diuine commaundement can bee founde out, commanding vs so to doe, but it is a plaine humane inuention, Then let the <hi>Romane</hi> Church bragge lesse of Antiquitie than they doe, seeing there is nothing in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuentions, but Antiquitie of Errour.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18670:369"/>
but they shoulde freely choose whome they thought meetest to bee Pope. Hee tooke the greater boldnesse to doe this, because the Emperour <hi>Carolus</hi> was occupied in warre-fare.

                     <p>Neuerthelesse, the faction of his competitor, SERGIVS, ceassed not to vexe and molest FORMOSVS: so that hee sent secrete aduertisement vnto ARNVLPHVS, the Nephewe of <hi>Carolus Crassus,</hi> to come to ROME: who came with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and was crowned Emperour by <hi>Formosus,</hi> as hath beene alreadie declared.</p>

In speciall, hee condemned the worshipping of the Crosse. affirming, that if it shoulde bee worshipped because Iesus died vpon it: then the Shippe, in the which Christ sailed, the Asle, whereupon Christ did ride into <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and infinite other thinges, which Christ touched, by the like reason, behoued also to bee worshipped.

Let euery Bishop feede the flocke committed vnto him, not onely with doctrine, but also with examples of a good conuersation. 5. A Bishop must not bee giuen to sumptuous banquets, but, be content, with a moderate diet, lest hee should seeme to abuse the counsell of our Lord, saying <hi>Take heede, that your hearts be not surfetted with gluttonie, or drunkennesse:</hi> but let holy lecture be at his table, rather than the idle wordes of flattering fellowes. 6. Let strangers and indigent people bee at Bishops tables: whome they maye refreshe both with corporall and spirituall repaste. 7. The delicate pleasures of the eare and the eyes, are to bee es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed, lest by such pleasures, the minde bee effeminate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted. 8. Let not the Lordes seruantes delight in vaine jesting, nor in hunting, nor halking. 9. Let Presbyters and Deacons followe the foot-steps of their Bishops, assuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18670:374"/>
that the good conuersation enjoyned vnto their Bishops, is also enjoyned vnto them. 10. Let Bishops haue a great sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude and care towards the poore: and be faithfull dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Ecclesiasticall goods, as the Ministers of God, and not as hunters after filthie lucre. 11. It is lawfull for Bishops, with consent of Presbyters &amp; Deacons, to bestow out of the Church treasure support to indigent people of that same Church. 12. A Presbyter is not to bee ordained vntill hee bee 30. yeeres olde. 13. Let the B. make dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t inquisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in his own Paroch Church, that no Presbyter, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming from any other parts, make seruice in his Church, without letters of recommendation. 14. Let a Pres byter, leauing a lowe place, and presuming to an higher, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre that same punishment, which a Bishop, deprehended in the like fault, should incurre. 15. A Presbyter, who attaineth to a Church, by giuing money for it, let him be deposed. 16. Let tythes, bestowed vpon Churches, by aduise of Bishops, be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully distributed to the poore, by the Presbyters. 17. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of Bishops shall bee instructed in the summe of the true faith. In the knowledge of the retribution to be giuen to good men, and the condemnation of vngodly people, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and last judgement, and by what kinde of workes eternall life may bee promerited: and that the Homelies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining these instructions, shall bee translated into Rusticke La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine language: to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end that euery person may vnderstand them. Marke in what estimation the Latine language hath bene at this time: that instructions, in Rusticke and Barbarous Latine, are <note place="margin">â</note> counted better than instructions in good French Language. 18. It is the duetie of the Bishop to instruct his Presbyters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacrament of Baptisme, what it is that they should desire the people baptized to renounce: namely, they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the deuill, &amp; all his works, &amp; his pomps. Now the works of the Deuill are murther, fornication, adulterie, drunkennesse, and other such like faultes. But the pompes of the Deuill are pride, ostentation, swelling conceites, vaine glory. lostinesse, and such other faultes, as spring vp from such groundes. 19. Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters are precisely to bee admonished, that when they say the Masse, and doe communicate, they doe not distribute the Lords bodie indiscretely, to children, and to all persons, who happen
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18670:375"/>
to bee present, who if they bee entangled with great sinnes, they procure vnto themselues rather damnation, than any remedie to their soules, according to the saying of the Apostle, <hi>Whosoeuer eateth this Bread, and drinketh this Cuppe vnWorthilie, hee shall bee guiltie of the bodie and blood of the LORD: Let a man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, trie himselfe, and so let him eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cuppe. By</hi> this let the judicious Reader marke, that euen in the dayes of <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> priuate Masses had no place: but they who were duely prepared did communicate with the Priest. <note place="margin">NOT A.</note> 20. Presbyters shall not suffer the holy Chrisme to be touched by euery man. 21. Presbyters shall not resort to Tavernes to eate or drinke. 22. Bishops and presbyters, shall prescribe to sinners, who haue confessed their sines, pennance, discretly, according to the weightinesse of their fault. 23. Chanons, who dwell in Cities, let them eate in one Closter, and sleepe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one roofe, to the ende they may bee readie to celebrate their Canonicall houres. From the 24. Can. vnto the 32. are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Constitutions concerning Monkes and Nunnes, which I ouer-passe with silence, fearing to bee prolixt. Can. 32. All men should studie to peace and concorde, but especially Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: forsaking hatred, discorde, and enuie. 33. Lordes and Iudges should bee obedient to the wholsome admonitions of their bishops: and bishops on the other part, should reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie regarde them, to the ende they may bee mutually supported euery one with the consolations of another. 34. Lordes and Iudges are to bee admonished, that they admitte not vile and naughtie persons to beare witnesse in their judicatories, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are manie, who for a contemptible price are readie to make shipwracke of a good conscience. 35. Let no man, for his decreet, receiue a rewarde: for diuine Scripture in manie places for biddeth this, <hi>as a thing that blindeth the eyes of the wise.</hi> 36. Let euerie man bee carefull to support indigent persons of his owne familie and kinred: for it is an impious and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing in the sight of God, that men abounding in riches, should neglect their owne. 37. Christians, when they make supplications to God, let them in humble manner bowe downe their knees, following the example of the Martyr <hi>Steuen,</hi> and of the Apostle <hi>Paul:</hi> Except vpon the Lordes daye, and other so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18670:375"/>
dayes, on the which the vniuersall Church keepeth a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of the Lordes resurrection: and at such times they are accustomed to stand and pray. 38. Faithfull people must be admonished, not to enter into the Church with tumult and dinne: and in time of Prayer, and celebration of the Masse, not to be occupied in vaine confabulations and idle speaches: but euen to abstaine from wicked cogitations. 39. Let not the Consistories and Iudgement seates of secular Iudges bee in the Church, or portches thereof, in any time to come: because the house of God shoulde bee an house of Prayer, as our Lord Iesus Christ saieth. 40. Let it bee forbidden, that Merchandize be vsed vpon the Lordes daye, or Iustice Courtes: because all men should abstaine from seruile laboures: to the ende this day may bee spent in praysing and thanking God, from Morne till Euen. 41. Incestuous persons, parracides, and murtherers, are found, who will not hearken to the wholsome admonitions of Church men, but perseuere in their vitious conuersation, who must bee reduced to order by the discipline of the secular power 42. Let the people bee admonished to abstaine from Magicall Artes, which can bring no support and helpe to the infirmities of men and beastes: but they are the deceitfull snares of the Deuill, whereby hee deceiueth mankind. 43. A frequent custome of swearing is forbidden, wherein men, vpon euery light occasion willing to purchase credite to that which they speake, they take God to bee witnesse of the veritie of their speaches. 44. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie frie subjectes, by the oppression of their Masters, aro-reda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to extreame pouertie. whose causes, if our clement Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne please to examine, hee shall finde, that they are vnjustlie redacted to extreame indigence. 45. A false measure, and a false ballance, is an abomination vnto the Lord, as <hi>Salomon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth. The 46. Canon containeth a regrate, that tythes were not duely payed to the Church: notwithstanding that the Church had giuen in their complaint to the ciuill Magistrate: whereby it came to passe, that not onely Lightes in the Church, and steependes to the Clergie, beganne to inlacke, but also the very Paroch Churches became ruinous. 47. When generall Fastinges are appointed, for any impendent calamitie, let no man neglect the fellowship of the humbled Church, for desire
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18670:376"/>
to fearce his bellie with delicate foode. 48. Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and surfetting are forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, as offensiue both to soule and and bodie, and the ground of many other sinnes. 49. Lords and Masters are to bee admonished, not to deale cruelly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully with their subjectes: yea, and not to seeke that which is due vnto themselues with excessiue rigour. 50. Let Laicke people communicate at least thrise in the yeere, vnlesse they bee impeded by some hainous sinnes committed by them. 51. In the last Canon mention is made, that they diligently examined the cause of them who complained to the Emperour, that they were disherited by the donation of landes, which their fathers and friends had bestowed vpon the Church: and in their bounds they found no man who did complaine. Alwayes, in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if any thing was done amisse, they humbly submitte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be corrected by their Soueraigne lord and king.</p>
                     <p>THE Councell of <hi>Chalons</hi> was the fourth Councell, conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the yeere of our Lord 813. by the commandement <note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Chalons.</note> of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> for the reformation of the Ecclesiasticall estate. Manie of the Canons of this Councell are coincident with the Canons of the former: therefore I shall bee the shorter in the commemoration thereof.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Bishops acquaint themselues diligently with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Bookes of holy Scripture, and the Bookes of auncient Fathers, together with the Pastorall booke of <hi>Gregorius.</hi> 2. Let Bishops practise in their workes the knowledge which they haue attained vnto by reading. 3. Let them also constitute schooles, wherein learning maye bee encreassed, and men brought vp in them, maye bee like to the sault of the earth, to season the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt manners of the people, and to stoppe the mouthes of heretiques, according as it is saide to the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, <hi>A thousande Targ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let Priestes bee vnreprooueable, adorned with good manners, and not giuen to filthie lucre. 6. The blame of filthy lucre, where with many Church men were charged, for this, that they allured secular men to renounce the worlde, and to bring their goods to the Church, they endeuour, with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18670:376"/>
number of wordes, to remoue. 7. Bishops and Abbots, who with deceitful speaches haue circumuened simple men, and shauen their heads, &amp; by such meanes doe possesse their goods, in respect of their couetous desire of filthie lucre, let them bee subject to Canonicall or Regulare repentance. But let those simple men, who haue laide downe their haire, as men destitute of vnderstanding, who cannot gouerne their owne affaires, let them remaine in that estate, which they haue once vndertaken: but let the goods giuen by negligent parentes, and receiued, or rather reaued by auaritious Church men, bee restored againe to their children and heires. 8. If Church men lay vp prouision of Cornes in Victuall houses, let it not bee to keepe them to a dearth, but to support the poore in time of neede therewith. 9. Hunting and halking, and the insolencie of foolishe and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie jests. are to bee forsaken of Church men. 10. Gluttonie &amp; drunkennesse is forbidden. 11. The Bishop or Abbot must not resort to ciuill judicators, to pleade their owne cause, except it bee to support the poore and the oppressed. Presbyters, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and Monkes, hauing obtained licence from the Bishop, maye compeare in Ciuill judgement seates, accompanied with their Aduocate. 12. Let not Presbyters, Deacons, or Monks, bee fermers or labourers of the ground. 13. It is reported of some brethren, that they compell the persons, who are to bee admitted, in time of their ordination, to sweare, that they are worthie: and that they shall doe nothing repugnant to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons: and that they shall bee obedient to the Bishop, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth <note place="margin">NOT A.</note> them, and to the Church in thewhich they are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: which oath, in regarde it is perilous, wee all inhibite, and discharge it. 14. Bishops in visiting of their parishioners, let them not be chargeable vnto them, but rather comfortable, by preaching the word, and by correcting things that are disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. 15. It is reported, that some Arch-deacons vse domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ouer the Presbyters, and take tribute from them, which smelleth rather of tyrannie, than of due order. For if the Bishop should not vse domination ouer the Clergy, but by examplares to the flocke, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> writeth. Much lesse shoulde these presume to doe any such like thing. 16. Like as in dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Churches, and for receiuing of orders, no money is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18670:377"/>
euen so, for buying of Baulme to make Chrisme, the Presbyters (keepers of Chrisme) shall bestowe no money: but Bishops, of their owne rent, shall furnish Baulme for the making of Chrisme, and Lightes to the Church. 17. It hath beene found in some places, that Presbyters haue payed 12. or 14. pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in yeerely tribute to the Bishop: which custome wee haue ordained altogether to bee abolished. 18. The receiuing of paunds from incestuous persons, &amp; from men who pay not their Tythes, and from negligent Presbyters, is forbidden, as a thing which openeth a doore to auarice: but rather let Ecclesiasticall discipline strike vpon transgressours. 19. Let people giue their Tythes to those Churches wherein their children are baptized, and whereunto they resort all the yeere long, to heare Church seruice. 20. Let peace bee kept amongst all men, but in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall betwixt Bishops and Countes, whereby cuery one of them maye mutually support another. 21. Ciuill Iudges ought to judge righteously, without exception of persons, and without receiuing of rewardes: and let their Officiars, Vicars, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaries bee righteous men: lest, by their auarice and griedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the people bee grieued, and impouerished. And let the witnesses bee of vnsuspect credite: for, by false witnesses the Countreye is greatly damnified. 22. The Abbots and Monkes in this part of the Countreye, seeing they haue addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted themselues to the Order of Sainct BENEDICT: let them endeuoure to conforme themselues vnto his institution and rules. 23. The ordination of Presbyters, Deacons, and other inferioures, is to bee made at a certaine prescribed time. 24. Concerning Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Monkes, who shall happen to bee slaine, let the Emperour giue determination to whome the satisfaction of blood shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. 25. In manie places, the auncient custome of publicke repentance hath ceasted: neither is the auncient custome of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication and reconciliation in vse. Therefore, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is to bee entraited, that the auncient discipline maye bee restored againe and they who sinne publikely, may be brought <note place="margin">â</note> to publike repentance: and euery man, according as hee deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, maye either be excommunicated, or reconciled. 26. It is reported, that in some Churches there is contention &amp; strife
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18670:377"/>
for diuiding of Church rentes: It is ordained, therefore, That no Masse shall bee saide in those Churches, vntill they, who are at variance, be reconciled againe. 27. Neither the Sacrament of Baptisme, nor the Sacrament of Confirmation, should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated. 28. Concerning the decrees of affinitie, and in what degree Marriage may bee bounde vp, euery man is sent to the Canons of the Church to seeke resolution. 29. Seeing that the man and the woman are counted in SCRIPTVRE as one fleshe, their Parentage is to bee reckoned by like degrees in the matter of Marriage. 30. The Marriage of seruantes is not to bee dissolued which is bounde vp with consent of both their masters, euerie seruant remaining obedient to his owne master. 31. It is rumoured, that some women by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and others fraudulently, doe present their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">NOT A.</note> to the Sacrament of Confirmation, to the ende they may bee separated from the companie of their husbandes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wee statute and ordaine, that such woman as either neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently or fraudulently present their owne children to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confirmation, they shall be compelled to do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance all the dayes of their life: neither shall they in anie wise be separated from their husbandes. 32. Let a sinner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse vnto his Father Confessor all his sinnes which hee hath committed either in thought, worde, or deede: because that hatred, enuye, and pride are such pestilentious bot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>hes of the soule: and the more secretly that they are couched; the more periculously they hurt. 33. Sinnes shoulde not onely bee confessed to GOD, according to the example of DAVID, who saieth, <hi>I will confesse against my selfe my wickednesse vnto the LORD, and thou for gauest the punishment of my sinne, Psal. 32. vers. 5.</hi> But also wee shoulde confesse our sinnes to our Father Confessor, according to the precept of the Apostle, <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your faultes one to another, and pray one for another, that yee may bee healed, Iac.</hi> 5. 16. 34. In prescribing of pennance, let fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and hatred of any person bee laide aside, and let the injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be giuen according to the rule of H. Scripture, &amp; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s &amp; custome of the Church, following y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> physitions of the body, who without exception of persons doe adhibit cuttings, burnings, &amp; veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t remedies to perilous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18670:378"/>
35. Many in doing of pennance, are not so desirous of remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, as of the accomplishment of the prescribed time of their humiliation: and beeing forbidden to eate fleshe, or drinke wine, they haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater desire of other delicate meates and drinkes: but spirituall abstinence, which should bee in peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent persons, excludeth all bodily delightes. 36. Let no man sinne of purpose, to the ende hee maye abolishe his sinnes by Almes deedes: for that is all one as if a man should hy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                        </gap>e God to grant vnto him a libertie to sinne. 37. Seeing all Canons of Councels are to be diligently read, in speciall such as appertaine vnto faith, and reformation of manners, shoulde bee moste fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently perused. 38. Bookes, called <hi>Libelli Poenitentiales,</hi> are to bee abolished, because the erroures of these bookes are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, how beit the authors of them bee vncertaine: and they prepare pillowes to laye vnder the heads of them who are slec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in sinne. 39. In the solemnities of the Masse, Prayers are to bee made for the soules of them who are departed, as well as for them who are aliue. 40. Presbyters, who are degraded, and liue like seculare, neglecting repentance, whereby they might procure restitution to their office, let them bee excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. 41. A Presbyter, who transporteth himselfe from his owne place, shall not bee receiued in any other Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee prooue, both with witnesses and letters sealed with lead, and containing the name of the Bishop. and of the Citie which hee liued in, that hee hath liued innocently in his owne Church, and had a just cause of transportation. 42. Let no Church bee committed to a Presbyter, without consent of the Bishop. 43. In some places are founde <hi>Scots</hi> men, who call themselues Bishops, and they ordaine Presbyters and Deacons, whose ordination wee altogether disallowe. 44. Presbyters <note place="margin">â</note> must not drinke in Tavernes, wander in Markets, nor goe to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Cities, without aduise of their Bishop. 45. Many, both of the Clergie and Laickes, goe to holy places, such as <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Turon:</hi> imagining, that by the sight of these places, their sinnes are remitted: and not attending to the sentence of <hi>Ierome, It is a more commendable thing to liue well in Hierusalem, than to haue seene Hierusalem.</hi> 46. In receiuing the Sacrament of the bodie and blood of Christ, great discretion is to bee vsed: Neither let the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18670:378"/>
taking of it bee long differred, because Christ saieth, <hi>Except yee eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee haue no life in you:</hi> Neither let vs come without due preparation, because the Apostle saieth, <hi>Hee who eateth and drinketh vnworthilie, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation.</hi> 47. The Sacrament of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood of Christ, which in one daye is accustomed to bee receiued of all Christians: let no man neglect to receiue it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept some grieuous crime doe hinder him from receiuing of it, 48. According to the precept of the Apostle <hi>Iames, Weake per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons shoulde bee annointed with oyle by the Elders, (which oyle is blessed by the Bishop)</hi> these wordes inclosed in a parenthesi are added to the Text: for hee saieth, <hi>Is anie man siecke amongst you, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him, and annoint him with oyle, in the Name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall saue the sicke, and the Lord shall raise him vp: And if hee haue committed sinne, it shall bee forgiuen him, Iam. cap. 5. vers. 14. 15.</hi> Such a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine as cureth both bodily and spirituall maledies, is not to bee neglected. 49. In the Councell of <hi>Laodicea</hi> it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that Masses should bee saide, and Oblations offered by Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or Presbyters, in priuate houses. This questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> also was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in this Councell. 50. The authoritie of the Emperour, is to bee interponed for reuerent keeping of the Lordes daye. 51. Because the Church is constituted of persons of dine: se conditions, some are Noble, others are ignoble, some are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, vassalles, strangers, &amp;c. It becommeth them who are in eminent rowmes, to deale mercifully with their inferioures, knowing, that they are their brethren, because God is one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father to both, and the Church is one common mother to both. From the 52. Canon vnto the 66. are contained pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of chaste and honest liuing prescribed to Prioresses and Nunnes, which I ouer-passe, as I haue done in the preceeding Councels. 66. It is ordained, that prayers and supplications shall bee made for the Emperour, and his children, and for their well-fare both in soule and bodie. 67. These things haue wee touched shortly, to bee exhibited to our Soueraigne lord the Emperour.

They who refused to subscribe the fore-saide supremacie, were contemptuously rejected, and not admitted to the Councell. So did the authoritie of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> proceede to further grouth, by flattering of <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who slewe his associate <hi>Michael:</hi> as it was founded in the flatterie of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the thirde, who flattered that vile murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer <hi>Phocas,</hi> who slewe his master <hi>Mauritius.</hi> In this Councell <hi>Photius</hi> was deposed, and excommunicated, and his bookes which hee wrote against the supremacie of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> were commanded to be burnt. <hi>Photius</hi> was accused for this, that hee had accepted the office of a Bishop, before hee had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued other Ecclesiasticall orders. <hi>Photius</hi> alleadged, that this was no sufficient cause of deposition, in respect that <hi>Ambrose,</hi> bishop of <hi>Millan, Nectarius,</hi> bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and of late dayes <hi>Tarasius,</hi> with consent of the bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> of Laickes they

were made Bishops. The Ambassadours of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the second answered. that <hi>Ambrose</hi> was endewed with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie giftes, <hi>Nectarius</hi> was called at an extraordinarie time, to wit, when heresie was so ouer-spred, that it was an harde thing to finde out a man who was not spotted with heresie: and, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the aduancement of <hi>Tarasius</hi> to bee bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to whose admission <hi>Adrian</hi> the first gaue consent, they answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That it was done for a speciall cause, in regarde hee was a zealous maintainer of the adoration of Images. This answere declareth, that incase <hi>Photius</hi> also had beene a zealous maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the adoration of Images, the <hi>Romane</hi> Bishop and his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadoures coulde haue dispensed with the want of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call orders preceeding his admission to his Bishopricke, as they <note place="margin">â</note> did in the person of <hi>Tarasius.</hi>

                     <p>In this Councell also the Ambassadoures of <hi>Adrian,</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the authoritie of the Pope, affirmed, that the bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> might judge of the actions of all other bishops: but no man might judge of him. And albeit the Orientall bishops in the sixt Generall Councell, cursed Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> after his death: yet it is to bee marked (saye they) that hee was accused of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: And in this case onely it is lawfull for inferiours to resist their superioures, and to disclaime their peruerse opinions. In this point also they saide, That none of the Patriarches and Bishops <note place="margin">Hister. Magdeb. Cent. 9. Cap. 9.

                     <p>More-ouer, the worshipping of Images in this Councell got a newe allowance againe, and it was commaunded, That the image of Christ shoulde bee holden in no lesse reuerence than the bookes of the Gospell.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bulgarians</hi> also were made subject to the <hi>Romane</hi> Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.

But on the other part (saye they) Christ hath instituted the Sacrament of <hi>Extreame Unction,</hi> as an armour to guarde vs at our last breath against the subtile inuasions of that deceitfull aduersarie. This Preface importeth, that all the weapons of our spirituall warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18670:383"/>
both defensiue and offensiue, wherewith wee faught against spirituall wickednesse in our life-time, are not sufficient to guarde vs in our last combate, except wee bee annointed with oyle at our last departure, Neuerthelesse, the holie Scripture expresselie saieth, <hi>I am the resurrection, and the life: hee that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in mee, though hee were dead, yet shall hee liue: and whosoeuer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and belecueth in mee, shall neuer die, Ioann. Chap. 11. verse 25. 26.</hi> In which wordes it may bee euidentlie perceiued, that the word of GOD, apprehended by faith, can saue vs both in life and death.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romanistes,</hi> in proouing <hi>Extreame Unction</hi> to bee a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Newe Testament, in the which there is a signe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by GOD, and to the signe there is added a promise of forgiuenesse of sinnes, and consequentlie of eternall life. They are like to the drunkardes of our Nation, who when their stomacke is ouer-laden with too much drinke, then they laye them downe to sleepe: but incase by any occasion they be wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Similitude</note> before the drinke be digested and gone out of their heads, they arise like madde men, and make such a stirre and businesse, that all men wishe that they were in their bedde againe: Euen so, the <hi>Romane</hi> Church hath beene so miscarried with the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, with the writinges of auncient Fathers (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in poinctes of doctrine in the which they were weake) and with the authoritie of Councels, that they layed them downe, and slept securelie, as people who were perfectlie instructed in the way of GOD. But nowe they awake, after a manner, out of their sleepe: and they will seeme to grounde their doctrine vpon Scripture, which they so miserablie abuse, that they are in no better case, but rather in a worse, than when they misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded Scripture, layed it aside, and counted the Decretalles of Popes to bee of as great authoritie as the holie Scriptures of GOD.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that about the yeere of our LORD 520. <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisius</hi> reckoneth the yeere of our LORD 528. <hi>Foelix</hi> the fourth, the successour of <hi>Ioannes</hi> the first, and predecessour of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the seconde: hee ordained, That Christians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they departed this life, shoulde bee annointed with oyle.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18670:383"/>
And this is the true originall of <hi>Extreame Unction,</hi> yet in such manner, that in the dayes of Pope <hi>Foelix</hi> the fourth, it had not the name of a Sacrament. But seeing the Councell of TRENT referreth it vnto a more auncient beginning: let vs examine the places of SCRIPTVRE whereupon they grounde this their opinion.</p>
                     <p>The wordes of the APOSTLE IAMES are these, <hi>Is anie sicke amongst you, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them praye for him, and annoint him with oyle, in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall saue the sicke: and the Lord shall raise him vp: And if hee haue committed sinne, it shall bee forgiuen him. Iacob. Chap. 5. vers. 14. 15.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For better vnderstanding of this place of SCRIPTVRE, let vs consider these three thinges, to wit. That when the Gospell was first preached, for the propagation and aduan cement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, GOD appointed extraordinarie offices, (EPHES. 4.) which were not to continue in the Church, such as the office of Apostles, Euangelistes, and of Prophets. Likewise, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them, and some other beleeuers, with extraordinarie giftes, such as the gift of tongues, of prophesie, and working of miraculous workes. And like as the extraordinarie offices continued not in the Church: euen so the extraordinarie giftes continued not long in the Church: for they were giuen to open a doore to the Gospell: which beeing once opened, Christians must content themselues with ordinarie offices and gifts.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, let vs consider, that persons who had receiued a gift of GOD to cure diseases miraculouslie, they vsed not at all times the selfe same signes and ceremonies in curing of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, but sometimes they sent hand-kirches to the diseased persons, (ACT. CAP. 19. vers. 11.) sometimes they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed the dead, and restored them to life, (ACT. CAP. 20. vers. 10.) and sometimes they annointed them with oyle. (MARC. CAP. 6. vers. 13.) Which diuersitie of signes had not beene lawfull to vse, if <hi>Extreame Unction</hi> had beene an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Sacrament in the Church: For, like as it is not lawfull to baptize with anie other liquor except water, because Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is a Sacrament instituted by GOD<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Euen so, in curing
<pb facs="tcp:18670:384"/>
the diseased it had not beene lawfull to vse anie other signe and ceremonie but annointing with oyle, if so bee it had beene an ordinarie Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Thirdlie, it is to bee considered, that when signes and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies doe accompanie extraordinarie giftes, incase the gift doe cease, it is a foolishe thing to keepe in vse the signe and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, except it were to bee a memoriall of a thing done of olde, as the people of GVIDVS dedicated the shelles of the Fishe <hi>Remora</hi> to VENVS GVIDEA, for a memoriall of their deliuerance. But wee reade not of anie Prophet, to whome GOD gaue not the gift of working miraculous workes, who counterseited HELISEVS, by sending their staffe to raise the dead, (2. REG. CAP. 4. vers. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                        </gap>.) or directing anie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                        </gap>eprous person to washe his bodie seuen times in the waters of <hi>Iordane,</hi> as HELISEVS directed NAAMAN the <hi>Syrian</hi> to doe. (2. REG. CAP. 5. vers. 10.) For in vaine is the outward signe adhibited, when the gift of miraculous he ling of diseases is ceassed.

(1. SAM. CHAP. 16. vers. 2.)

But all this is nothing except the thirde circumstance bee added, to wit, that CHRIST hath giuen vnto vs this signe to bee vsed, and hath annexed the promises afore-saide as belonging vnto vs: for who can denie. but in circumcision there was a signe instituted by GOD, whereunto a diuine promise was annexed? Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, both the signe and promise appertained vnto them who liued vnder the olde Couenant, (GALATH.

In like manner they saye, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie lawfull for a Priest to applie this Oyle: as if in the dayes of the Apostle IAMES there had beene such sacrificing Priestes, as are in our dayes: Whereas by the contrarie Pope INNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENTIVS the first, who liued in the dayes of AVGVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE, permitted not onelie Priestes, but also common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to comfort themselues and their friendes by annointing them with oyle, as SIGEBERTVS writeth in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles. Also with this oyle, made by the Bishop, exercised, consecrated, and saluted, as if it were a sensitiue and reasonable creature, the organes of mens senses are to bee annointed, such as the eyes, the eares, the nosthrils, the lippes, the handes, the feete, and the reines. In this poinct their heartes are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casten with darknesse: and they erre, mis-knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and power of GOD: For the grounde of corruption is in the heart, and not in the senses: and the verie heart of EVA. was corrupted with infidelitie and pride, before her eyes, or hands, or mouth did sinne. (GENES. 3.) No man can discourse rightlie of sinne, nor of anie other thing, except hee knowe the fountaine and well-spring thereof.</p>
                     <p>Concerning auncient Fathers, they had no such custome to annoint with oyle the eyes, eares, and the rest of the organes of senses, before mens departure from this life. And whereas they bring foorth the testimonie of AVGVSTINE <hi>(Lib. 2. De visitatione infirmorum)</hi> reckoning <hi>Unction</hi> as one of the necessarie consolations to bee adhibited to them, who are concluding their life. This citation is an ouer-giuing of their cause, and a secret confession, that <hi>Extreame Unction</hi> is but the inuention of man: for they cannot bee ignorant, that those bookes, <hi>De Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione Infirmorum,</hi> were not written by AVGVSTINE, bishop of HIPPO, but by another after his death, who sette them foorth vnder the name of AVGVSTINE.</p>
                     <p>AECVMENIVS, writing vpon the aforesaide place of the Apostle IAMES, is shorter in his Commentarie than the Apostle is in his precept or counsell: which thing hee could not
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18670:385"/>
haue done, if hee had thought that an holie Sacrament had beene recommended to the Church, to remaine vnto the ende of the worlde: for hee writeth onelie, that the Apostles had this custome whilest CHRIST was conuersant with them in the earth, to annoint sicke persons with oyle, and to restore them to health. <hi>Aecum, in Epistol. Iacob. cap. 5. vers. 14.</hi>

                     <p>The custome of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church approacheth somewhat nearer to the fashions of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and olde Heretiques cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gnostici,</hi> than to the custome of the Apostles: for the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> annointed with oyle the bodies of the dead, as the Poete witnesseth in these wordes, <hi>Corpusque lauant frigentis, &amp; vnguunt. (Iren. Lib. 1. Cap. 18.)</hi> And olde Heretiques annointed the head of the dead with oyle and water, to procure redemption to their soules.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> Church annointeth not the dead with oyle, but they annoint them who are halfe dead, in whome there is no hope of life and recouerie.</p>
                     <p>LINDANVS, in all his writinges, is like vnto an ASIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICKE Oratour, fighting rather with the shaft, than with the poinct of the Speare: and when hee citeth a place of CHRY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOSTOME, <hi>(De Sacerdotio, Libr. 3.)</hi> to prooue <hi>Extreame Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to bee an ordinarie Sacrament in the Church, hee proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth starke nothing, yea the thing that is not in controuersie betwixt vs and the Papistes: for CHRYSOSTOME affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that men are more benefited by their teachers, than by their parentes: in respect their naturall parentes haue begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their bodies, but their pastors haue begotten their soules to GOD: Yea, and their naturall parentes haue not suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their bodilie infirmities so much, as their pastors haue done: for oft times by prayer and annointing them with oyle, they haue procured health to their bodies, as Sainct IAMES wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, which their naturall parentes were not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. In all this discourse there is not one worde which wee denye. But this prooueth not Extreame Vnction to bee a Sacrament of the Newe TESTAMENT, instituted by CHRIST, to continue vnto the ende of the worlde.</p>

But seeing in euerie one of these Orders the outwarde signes at their entrie are different, and the thinges signified are different, to wit, diuerse graces of the holie Spirite, increassing according as men by ascending degrees mounted vp to higher honoures: what is the cause that all these seuen are counted one SACRAMENT, and not rather seuen SACRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTES?</p>
                     <p>To all these Orders one thing was common, to wit, all were shauen in the vpper part of their heads, to represent (as <hi>Lindanus</hi> affirmeth. <hi>Panopl.

It is true, that men and women of olde delighted in haire, as a naturall ornament of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and MARIE is commended for this, that shee dryed the feete of CHRIST with the haire of her head, (IOAN. CAP. 12. vers. 3.) And all the glorie of the worlde, yea, and the crownes of immortall glorie, shoulde bee casten downe at the feete of CHRIST. (APOCAL. CAP. 4. vers. 10.) Neuerthelesse, the fact of SAMSON is reprooueable, who suffered his haire to bee cutte off, and casten at the feete of DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LILA. (IVDG. CAP. 16. vers. 19.) And the shauing of the haire of men to bee casten at the feete of the Antichrist, and to bee a signe of subjection vnto him, that is a thing no lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueable, than the fact of <hi>Samson.</hi>

ANOTHER custome in the ROMANE Church, is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint with oyle all them who are admitted to Church Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

                     <p>To grace this Sacrament of Order, all these seuen Orders afore-saide are attributed vnto CHRIST himselfe: Hee was a Doore-keeper (saye they) when He cast out the buyers and sellers out of the TEMPLE: (IOANN. CAP. 2. VERS. 15.) Hee was a Reader, when Hee read the place of ISAIAS in the Synagogue of NAZARETH, saying, <hi>The Spirite of the LORD is vpon mee,</hi> &amp;c. (LVKE CAP. 4. vers. 17.) Hee did the office of an Exorcist, when Hee cured a man possessed with a Deuill: (LVKE CAP. 4. vers. 33.) Hee practised the office of Acoluthus, when Hee saide, <hi>Hee who followeth Mee, shall not walke in darkenesse, but shall haue the light of Life: (Ioann. Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 12.) The office of a sub-Deacon, when Hee washed His Disciples feete: <hi>(Ioann. Cap.</hi> 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 4.) The office of a Deacon, when Hee distributed Bread and Wine to His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: <hi>(Matth. Cap.</hi> 26. <hi>vers.</hi> 26.) And finallie, Hee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted His Priestlie office, when Hee offered Himselfe vpon the Crosse, a Sacrifice for our sinnes. <hi>(Matth. cap.</hi> 27. <hi>vers.</hi> 50.) Who can bee so babishe ignorant, but hee maye vnderstande, that CHRIST, in working sauing miracles, Hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Himselfe the promised MESSIAS and Sauiour? In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the abuses of the Temple, Hee declared Himselfe to

bee both King and Priest, to whome reformation of abuses in the Church belongeth: In reading Holie Scripture, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the sense and meaning thereof to the people, Hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Himselfe to bee the Great Prophet, whom GOD promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to sende into the worlde: (DEVTER.

                     <p>NOwe the Ceremonies which are vsed in the Consecration of them who are admitted to inferiour Orders, are these: The Doore-keepers are admitted with the signe of deliuering the keyes of the Church-doore vnto them.

                        </gap>, by deliuering vnto them Tapers of waxe, with a little water potte.

If these two thinges cannot bee prooued by Holy Scripture, then no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can bee acknowledged in these Orders: especiallie since the administration of these offices is committed to boyes, to ignorant fellowes, and to men who haue no extraordinarie gift of casting out of Deuils, as the Exorcistes of the Primitiue Church had of olde.</p>

                     <p>The Deacons in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, are ordained by a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, who cloatheth them with their Stoles, and their Oraria, vpon their left shoulders, and putteth into their handes the Booke of the Euangell, whereof they shoulde bee Preachers.

                     <p>NOwe seeing I haue remembred in all my preceeding <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,</hi> to speake of Antiquitie, I shall not ouer-passe with silence this poinct (GOD willing) in this <hi>Treatise</hi> also.</p>
                     <p>Albeit the Hierarchie of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church were founde to bee auncient, yet it sufficeth for this <hi>Treatise</hi> to declare, that of olde these Orders were not called a Sacrament. And there is no ancient Writer whome I haue read, who reckoneth Church Orders in the number of Sacramentes. As for the wordes of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> cited by <hi>Lindanus,</hi> they are not worthie of refutation, because in a generall signification manie thinges maye bee called Sacramentes. But to call Order a Sacrament in a strict signification, it is a newe inuention founde out by the Scholasticke Doctors, who behooued to bee serious in some thing after they had lost the substance of Religion.</p>
                     <p>But I will set forwarde, and declare, that the Hierarchy it selfe is not so auncient as they affirme it to bee. True it is, that about the yeere of our LORD 250. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Bishop of <note place="margin">Euseb. hist. Libr. 6. Cap. 43.</note>

And after the time of the promotion of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the honour of Vniuersall Bishop, the number of Church offices encreassed: and to Presbyters were added Arch-priestes: and to Deacons were added Arch-deacons. And <hi>Lindanus</hi> lamenteth that other inferiour offices, which were inuented by men, had
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18670:389"/>
ceassed in the Church, such as Fossores, Syngeli, Copiatae. When the liberalitie of the people bestowed superfluitie of riches vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church, then newe offices behooued to bee founde out, to the ende, that all which was bestowed might seeme too litle, because manie Church offices were to bee sustained: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe spoken of olde of women, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>About the yeere of our Lord 308, and vnder the reigne of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> a constitution is attributed to <hi>Caius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that men should bee promoted to superiour Orders, by degrees ascending from inferiour Orders. And all the fore-mentioned Orders are reckoned in that Decretall of <hi>Caius,</hi> to wit, Ostiarius, Lector, Exorcista, Acoluthus, Sub-diaconus, Diaconus, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Episcopus.

This beeing done, and their authoritie beeing setled, they tooke boldnesse to make lawes, both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious against GOD, and injurious to men: as namelie, that Marriages, bound vp betwixt young persons, without consent of Parentes, shoulde bee firme and itable: That amongst kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke it shoulde not bee lawfull to marrie within the seuenth degree: and these were alreadie married within these degrees, shoulde bee separated againe: That a man, who is diuorced from an adulterous woman, shall not haue libertie to marrie during her life-time: That they who are spirituall brethren and sisters, by the Sacrament of Baptisme and Confirmation, shall not haue leaue to marrie one another: And, Marriage is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden at certaine seasons of the yeere: And finallie, that the Church may dispense with the degrees of consanguinitie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the eighteenth CHAPTER of LEVITICVS, and finde out moe degrees impeding Marriage to bee bound vp.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle PAVL, when hee calleth Marriage a great mysterie, (EPHES. CAP. 5. VERS. 32.) hee is speaking concerning CHRIST, and concerning His Church: And it is indeede a mysterie vnspeakeable, whether wee consider the beginning, or the progresse, or the consummation of this Marriage: It is begunne in Earth, and perfected in Heauen: And the loue of CHRIST and His Church, is vnspeakeable: For euen the Spouse of CHRIST, albeit shee bee infirme and weake in the Earth, yet her heart is so inflamed with the loue of her husband, that shee forgetteth all thinges, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membereth vpon Him: shee counteth all thinges to be dongue in comparison of him: one sight of His reconciled face is dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to her than all the treasures of the worlde: His name is like a sweete oyntment powred out, and delighting her soule with the sweete smell of saluation. And if the loue of the Church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes CHRIST bee vnspeakeable, who can comprehende
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18670:391"/>
the length, breadth, and deepnesse of the loue of CHRIST towardes His Church, who hath purged her from all spotte of sinne in this worlde, and prepared a glorious mansion for her in His Fathers house, that is, in Heauen. But this is not spoken of the marriage of mortall men with their wiues.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that the Apostle PAVL in that same place setteth downe some similitude betwixt corporall marriages, and the spirituall marriage betwixt CHRIST and His Church: But that is not enough to furnishe out an ordinarie Sacrament in the Church of GOD, for then shoulde there bee infinite Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes: For the Kingdome of GOD (MATTHEW 13.) is compared to a man who soweth good seede in his fielde: It is compared to leuen, and to a treasure that is hidden in the fielde, and to a drawe nette, and to a graine of Mustard. seede: yet all these thinges are not Sacramentes in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and in the marriage of ADAM and EVA, wee see a certaine similitude of the spirituall marriage betwixt CHRIST and His Church: for ADAM loued the woman which was fleshe of his fleshe, and bone of his bones, and in whom hee saw his owne similitude: (GENES, CHAP. 2. VERS. 23.) And CHRIST in like manner, by feeding vs with His owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood, Hee maketh vs fleshe of His owne fleshe, and bone of his owne bones: and more-ouer, Hee stampeth vs with His owne similitude, to assure vs, that He loueth vs, whom Hee hath stamped with His owne likenesse.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, a matrimoniall bande is more indissoluble than other bandes: for other bandes, like as they are bounde vp with consent of parties, so in like manner they maye bee dissolued and vndone with consent of parties: but the bande of Marriage cannot bee vndone, except by death or fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the conjunction betwixt CHRIST and His Church, (ROMAN. CHAP. VIII.) cannot bee vndone by death it selfe. As concerning spirituall whordome, the true Church, which consisteth of a number, whome GOD hath elected, called, justified, sanctified, and whome Hee intendeth to glorifie: These, I saye, the LORD in mercie preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

from spirituall whordome, and apostasie from the knowne trueth.</p>
                     <p>And, like as a chaste woman delighteth in her husbande, whether hee bee present with her, or absent from her: if hee bee present, shee delighteth to conferre with him: if hee bee absent, shee delighteth to talke of him, to reade his letters, to beholde the tokens of his fauour towardes her, and finallie, in the secrete parloure of her heart to meditate of his goodnesse towardes her. <hi>(Basil.

                     <p>IN nothing doeth the ROMANE Church agree better with vs, for a time, than in magnifying Marriage as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bande instituted by GOD in PARADISE, and hauing a type and similitude of the loue of CHRIST towardes His Church: and therefore they make it an holie Sacrament in the Church, which no man euer did before the dayes of Pope GRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GORIE. But when they perceaued that this was not consented vnto, that Marriage shoulde bee counted one of the ordinarie Sacramentes in the Church, especiallie, the whole Hierarchie of the ROMANE Church disclaiming it, and the East Church in a generall Councell, disallowing prohibition of Marriage to men called to spirituall offices.</p>
                     <p>The ROMANE Church tooke offence at euerie thing, which was repugnant to their opinion. They coulde neither abide them who denied that Marriage was a Sacrament, nor yet them, who gaue libertie to Church men to marrie: And so beeing irritated on all sides, they beganne to speake euill of Marriage as a worke of the fleshe, and an estate vncompetent to men in spirituall offices.</p>

But HENRIE the eight, King of ENGLAND, when hee sought resolution in this question at the moste part of the Vniuersities in EVROPE, if it were lawfull for the Bishop of ROME, or for a Councell, to dispense with the degrees of consanguinitie, forbidden in the eighteenth of LEVITICVS, hee receaued a negatiue answere, That it was not lawfull so to doe.</p>

The prohibition of Marriage in moe degrees of consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and affinitie, than are contained in the XVIII. of <hi>Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> is a wicked inuention, to make the Law of GOD of none effect: For like as <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when hee caused manie channels to bee made, wherein the water of the Riuer <hi>Gyndes</hi> should bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued. What intention had hee, but to drie vp the Riuer <hi>Gyndes,</hi> and to make it ebbe of water, that young boyes &amp; girles should not bee afraide to wade thorowe it: Euen so, prohibitiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, added to the Lawe of GOD, tended to none other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <note place="margin">Similitude</note> but to vndoe, and make of none effect, the blessed Lawe of GOD. And this appeareth the more manifestlie, because in that same Canon, in the which they claime libertie to adde moe degrees of prohibition of Marriage, to the degrees forbidden in <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> they claime also a libertie to dispense with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees forbidden by GOD. But GOD confoundeth the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of men, which are opposite to His diuine institution, and turneth them all to follie. And the prohibition of Marriage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the seuenth degree was retrenched in the Councell of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane, anno</hi> 1215<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and reduced to the fourth degree of consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie.

meaning of holy Scripture, haue giuen to others occasion of stumbling and erring. True it is, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Let not the wife depart from her husband: but if shee depart, let her remaine vnmarried, or be reconciled vnto her husband, and let not the husband put away his wife.</hi> (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. 11.) In this place the Apostle is spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of such alienation of minds as falleth out betwixt man and woman, and separateth their cohabitation for a time but hee is not speaking of diuorcements, justly made for fornication: for like as death cutteth insunder the bandes of Matrimonie, &amp; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth liberty to the liuing party to marry in the Lord <hi>(Rom.</hi> 7. 2. 3) Euen so, fornication cutteth insunder the matrimoniall bande, and giueth libertie to the innocent partie to marrie another in the Lord. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 32.</p>
                     <p>The billes of diuorcement giuen to honest women in the old Testament after the receauing whereof they married other hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, as clearly appeareth in the booke of <hi>Deuteronomie, cap.</hi> 24. <hi>vers.</hi> 4. this custome (I saye) is no sufficient grounde to prooue that the innocent partie may marrie after diuorcement: for such diuorcementes were rather tollerated for the hardnesse of the <hi>Iewes</hi> heartes, than commaunded or allowed: and because they were made without anie triall of fornication, they are damned by Christ, as occasions of adulteries. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 9. But the exception that Christ maketh in expresse words of fornication, declareth that the diuorcement made for fornication, is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diuorcement, and consequently giueth libertie to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent partie to marrie, as death interuening, giueth libertie to the partie liuing to marrie.</p>
