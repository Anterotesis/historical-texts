            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therfore my good friendes, I pray you all as effectuously as I may possible, that ye will ayde and helpe me as much as ye may, to recouer those good and valiant Knightes, whether they be of this countrie or strangers, the whiche I promise you by the faith and worde of a king, to entreat and honor in such sort and wise, that they shall haue cause to praise and to content themselues: for you are not ignoraunt, that the better we are accompanied, the more we shal be feared and redouted of our enimies, and you the better kepte, ntertayned and estéemed.

For séeing that the vnfaythfulnesse and litle sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse that you haue vnto me (the which am vnfortunate and forsaken of al good fortune, bycause I loued you aboue all worldly things) is nowe manifest, and also that with so great iniurie you are gone so farre from hence, to drawe neare to hir, the which (considering hir yong age, and small discretion) can not haue in hir the thing to fauor you and to entertaine you: she hathe purposed also to banishe from me for euer this extreame loue that I beare you, seeing that my heauie and poore heart can haue no other vengeance. And if I would take in good part the iniurie and wrong that ye doe me, it shoulde be but great folly in me, to will well vnto the most vnthankefull, for whome to loue perfectly, I hate all things and my selfe also. Alas, nowe I perceiue very well (but it is to late) that I submitted too vnfortunately my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to so ingrate a person, considering that in satisfaction of my syghings and passions, I sée my selfe mocked, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately deceyued.

               <p>ALas fortune, that art to light and without roote, by what occasion hast thou preferd and eleuated me among all the best Knightes, afterwardes to bring me to ruine so lightly? Now I perceiue well, that thou mayste doe more euill in an houre, than grace in a thousande yeares: for if in time past thou hast done &amp; gyuen me pleasure or ioy, thou hast robbed me of that euen nowe most cruelly, leauing me in martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome muche worsse than death: and seeing it was thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure so to do, why hast thou not at least wise made equall the one with the other? considering thou knowest that at other times thou haste contented me, nor that neyther without mingling of it with sorowes and great troubles. So then thou shouldst haue reserued for me some litle hope, with this crueltie wherewith at this present thou dost torment me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting in me things incomprehensible in the thoughtes of those that thou dost fauor, the which not knowing this euill, estéeme the pompes, glories, and honors that thou dost lende them, sure and perdurable. Nor they remember not that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides and aboue the torments that their bodies shall suffer to mayntaine them, their soules shall fall in hazard of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.

I beleeue that there is not he of you al, that doth not sufficiently vnderstand howe we haue enterprised this battell with good right, and also to defende the honor and reputation of Englande, the which King <hi>Cildadan</hi> and they of Irelande would deminish, denying vs the tribute, the which at al times they haue payd to our prodecessors, recognising y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefites which they haue receyued of them in times past. I knowe well that there is not one of you all that hath not an entiere heart and a bold: and therefore it is no néede further to encourage you against those that you haue to do withall, hauing your honor before your eyes, the which you estéem more than a hundreth lines, if it were possible to haue them one after an other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my friendes, let vs stoutly goe forwardes, hauing no regarde of any cruell Gyant and full of bloude, the whiche are of theyr companie. For a man is not the more estéemed bycause of his rude and greate members, but for his good heart and courage. You sée that oftentimes the Hare dothe ouerleape the Oxe, and a Sparow Hauke or a Merline to to beate and to ouercome a Kyte. Our enimies do put their trust in the face of these monsters, hauing no regarde of the wrong that they haue and doe vs, and we truste that God, the which is a doer of right, will giue vs force and strength to ouercome them, through the dexteritie of our persons, and diligence that we shall shewe and doe. Therefore my friends let vs stoutly go forwardes, thinking that euery one of vs euen of himselfe is sufficient and able to fyght and to destroy the moste braue of all their companie: assuring you that

               <p>SYr, I would thinke it good (or euer you did this thing) that you shoulde haue the aduice of the noble men of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: for you knowe that <hi>Amadis</hi> and they of his kindred are wonderful good Knights, and very mightie through the frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that they haue. Furthermore, there is not he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not howe falsly they haue bene accused before your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, whereof the victorie that <hi>Angriote</hi> and <hi>Sarquelles</hi> haue obtained within these few dayes that be past against the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, hath giuen good witnesse, and if the right had not bene on their side, yet bicause they are good and valiant Knyghts, they shoulde not haue bene so easily dispatched of <hi>Candan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles</hi> children, nor of <hi>Amadis:</hi> the whiche thing dothe suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently make vs to vnderstande and beleeue, that the Lorde mayntained them in their iustification and ryght. And therefore syr, it should be best (as I doe suppose and thinke) if it woulde so please you, to forget the euill that you bears them, and to call them agayne to your seruice, séeing that it shall not be greatly approued nor allowed, that a Prince should make war against those, that he may easily and with his honor call againe to his amitie &amp; seruice, considering that doing the contrarie, is oftentimes losse of men, extreme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses, and diminishing of authoritie, a thing that shortly after causeth the Lords and neighbors therabouts, to desire and to make newe enterprises, to get them out of subiection,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:212:29"/>
and to enter into a more libertie than they had before. And therefore a sage and a wise Prince ought at no time (if it be possible) to giue occasion to his vassalles to go and depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the feare and reuerence that they owe vnto him: but muste proue and assaye by all meanes and wayes to rule them, as the good shepeheard by temperate discretion dothe with his shéepe, winning their hearts and wils more by faithful loue, than by rigour and tyrannie.

For oftentimes after the fault be knowne, the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is to farre gone. <hi>Amadis</hi> is so humble and so much yours, that if you would send to reuoke him, you shal easily recouer him with those that haue followed him, of the whiche you may be better serued than euer you were.</p>

               <p>TRuly (Lord <hi>Amadis</hi>) ye are not out of purpose, to say that ye haue said vnto me: also it is easy for him that is whole to counsel the sick.

For notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that the obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I haue to the iust vengeance of him, of whom I am sole inheriter, and to the wrong as ye know, that you your selfe did me, do greatly constrayne me to hate you to death, yet cruell loue that doth dayly vndermind my heauie heart to loue you but too much, will not suffer it to consent to the ruine and destruction that I haue prepared for you. The whiche truly doth cause me to name you, and that of right, a louer and a friend of the high Gods, the whiche haue founde (and thought it good to proue your courage and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame constancie) not onely by the strength of manye a braue man, and beastes more cruell, the whiche ye haue conquered and tamed: but also with the rodde of their might and supreme power, they haue punished you with so hard and gréeuous persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that I being your enimie, as I am, haue felt it in my soule, so that I wept with both my eyes, iudging thereby, what that dolour and heauinesse might be, that ye suffered for the losse of your wife and louer so déere, and your only sonne so comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dable. And yet being true (as it is true indéede) that the consolation of the vnfortunate, is to find their like. Yet ye haue some occasion to moderate this greate anoyance by that, that I beare euen such another (or there lacketh very little) as yours is. Ye haue lost (as men say, your wife, and I could neuer recouer him, whome I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merited to haue to my Lord &amp; husband, that is your selfe, that hath made me oftentimes maruell, howe it was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that so great amitie might conceiue in heart so great

hatred, where such conformitie ought to be represented. And yet if ye way all things well, the time present doth shew you him, whome ye ought to folow in time to come. And that it is so, ye sée the end, wherevnto your great prosperities haue brought you. The heauens are not alwayes in one being, nor <hi>Lisuard</hi> also ought not to be continually victorious, nor <hi>Abra</hi> alwayes ouercomde by him. What then? must I sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and be heauy for the mischance that maketh and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth at the sight of the eye a better fortune than I may wish for, and that doth promis me a sure recompence of the loue that I haue nourished so long in my soule, yea and vntill he put him into my hands that so cruelly, and by so many long dayes hath illuminated and inflamed my heart, the which I already haue almost distild in the fire of Ielously. Truly all things well considered, it séemeth <hi>Lisuard,</hi> that the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth, in the which I may execute vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you the vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that ye haue merited, finishing my anguishes and the hatred that I beare you, by the augmentation and increacement of loue, the Gods giuing you the knowledge of the euill that ye haue done me, with the will to aske me pardon, and me to graunt it you. Therefore I counsel you to preuent the time, and sooner to beléeue my aduice, than your owne opinatiue will, knowing the forces that I haue so nigh vnto you, and well minded to do you more harme, than I desire ye shoulde haue.</p>

Seyng then that your will is suche, I would it should not please God to sende one thing, that is so impossible to me, as to liue any longer with the disgrace and disfauour of my Lady. O euill houre to much miserable, for I requyre no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but it is denied me by the thing that I require it, nor I flie nothing but it is graunted me by the thing that I flie. Alas madame <hi>Lardenia,</hi> I beséeche you to take no pitie vpon mée, seyng I pitie not my selfe, and that to conforme my will to my Ladies will, for I cannot will, but that shée wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and I hate my selfe more than shée hateth me: but if ye loue me, it shalbe reason that ye will that I will, that is onely to goe to accomplish the promisse that I haue made to my Lady the Quéene, so that all that I shall doe from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, shalbe done agaynst my will: for I kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
