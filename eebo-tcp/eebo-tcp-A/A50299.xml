            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Lory is the Recompence of good Actions. And although they ſay of Virtue, that it is the Reward of its ſelf, it is nevertheleſs very ſeldom that any man is induced to do well upon this Principle. Glory is rather his more-pleaſing and continual Object; He loveth it, and by the effect of this his love, he is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly carried on to undertake all that may enable him to poſſeſs the ſame. He becometh moderate, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh couragious, he becometh prudent, and by a thouſand proofs that be ſheweth of his virtue, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a thouſand Witneſſes of the deſire that he hath to poſſeſs this Glory. By this deſire all men bend the inclinations they receive from their Birth, towards Virtue. By this deſire ſome have attained the Title of Valiant, others of great Politicians. Many have embraced Learning; and according to the excellent motions of their mind, ſome have been praiſed for their Piety, and others have carried away the glory of having attained to the perfection of that which they have undertaken, and to be an Example to all thoſe that love the Reputation of their Countrey, as much as they do their own. The Author of the Work which I preſent thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> is become of the number of theſe vertuous Ones: He was a Gentleman, and that he might render its due to his Profeſſion, he followed <hi>Henry the Great</hi> whitherſoever the occaſions of that Prince did call thoſe of his condition. But after that <hi>France</hi> had received, from the goodneſs as well as from the Valour of its King, a general Peace; <hi>Monſieur de Mauclerc</hi> retired himſelf home; where following the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of his Genius, he made this <hi>Work;</hi> which is become no leſs glorious for the <hi>French,</hi> than it is for the Author himſelf. The matter hereof hath been handled by divers ſtrangers: But he hath underſtood it as well as they; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have preceded him in the publiſhing of their Meditations, they have no further advantage of him than in time only. He hath made ſuch Obſervations therein, which are as ſo many Rules, and ſuch Illuſtrations as ought to paſs for ſolid inſtruction; and throughout all, the ordering is ſo admirable, it compelleth us to believe he did not reduce it into the eſtate in which it is, but in a long time, and very curious inquiry. His death was the cauſe that this Work hath not ſeen the light ſooner. But now it is reſtored to <hi>France,</hi> after half an Age ſince he was taken from it. It is the whole Body of Architecture; it is a perfect Treatiſe of that Art, much enableth Marble and Stone to become the delights of men, which maketh them the Glory of Palaces, the Ornaments of Churches, and the moſt durable Monuments which the ambition of men could ever find out to make their Riches and Power recommendable to Poſterity. It hath alwayes been ſo eſteemed; it hath, as it were, become familiar in the Courts of Kings and Princes: And for the Credit it hath got among magnificent Rich Ones, it maketh us ſtill to report of their Virtuous Inclination, as well as of their great Fortunes. The People that firſt perfectly poſſeſſed it, are the firſt alſo that acquired Elegancy of Behaviour, and the perfection of Sciences. From the <hi>Greeks</hi> it paſſed to the <hi>Romans:</hi> And although the great underſtanding of this latter People could have invented ſome things new, yet they alwayes conformed themſelves to the Rules which the firſt delivered concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Art. They alſo added thereto worthy Augmentations: and both the one and the other have received the Glory of that whereof they were the Authors. The <hi>Grecians</hi> Province, called <hi>Doris,</hi> gave its name to the <hi>Dorick</hi> Column; the <hi>Ionick</hi> is ſo called of <hi>Ionia,</hi> which is a part of Greece: and the famous City of <hi>Corinth</hi> hath encreaſed much its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, by having invented the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Column. The <hi>Romans</hi> named the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Column, which they found out: and the <hi>Compoſite</hi> is a ſort of Column that receiveth all the Beauty and Ornaments of the other within its body. Laſtly, Every Nation hath ſet forth ſtately Teſtimonies of the eſteem which they have all had of this Art. The <hi>Jews</hi> much boaſt of the Temple of Great <hi>Solomon:</hi> The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> their <hi>Babylon:</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> talk much of their <hi>Pyramides:</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> of the famous Temples which they built for the memory of their Godds. <hi>Rhodes</hi> boaſteth of its great <hi>Coloſſus: Rome</hi> ſetteth before our eyes its Temples, its Ampitheaters, its Arches of Tryumph, and its thouſand ſtately Palaces, which makes us ſtill to admire its former greatneſs. I will end with our ſelues, and without mentioning innumerable particular Houſes, which are as many Palaces comparable to thoſe of Antiquity: I will ſay that the <hi>Louvre</hi> is an Abſtract of all the Curioſities of Architecture, and that its Magnificence far excelleth all that the ambition of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers can arrogate to themſelves therein. This witneſſeth to all the World, that the <hi>French</hi> have had the perfect knowledg of this Art, and that our Author intended not ſo much to give Inſtructions to his own Countrey-men, as to make it known that this Art was very acceptable amongſt them. He hath written thereof all that ought to be ſaid, but this not being his whole intention, he hath ſet them forth, and cauſed them to be Engraven in Copper. His Work ſheweth the care he hath uſed therein, the exact juſtneſs he hath given to the Meaſures of his Columns, the excellency of the moſt fitting Ornaments, and of the leaſt particularities he hath obſerved in the Bodies, and in every Member thereof, might make his Work to paſs for a Miracle, if Strangers had not foreſtalled our Contemplation with that which they have written upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: Yet howſoever the Work is altogether new, ſeeing it hath not hitherto been publiſhed; and thoſe skilful Architects to whom I have ſhewed it, have made me highly eſteem thereof.</p>
            <p>I have made an entry into the body of the Book, with an Addition of divers particular Members that I have borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Italian</hi> Architects; which are the ſeparated parts, I have been adviſed to add thereto, and chiefly the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Frieſes in each Order: which in reſpect of their great length, could not there be placed in their juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meaſure; and the <hi>Ionick</hi> Scrole, with the Rule for its Conſtitution, according to the manner of <hi>Vignola,</hi> A Profile for the <hi>Ionick</hi> Capital, ſome Imboſſings, Frontlets and Corniſhes, to take up empty places: which together may afford both variety and ſatisfaction for the Curious. At the end of the Book you may ſee alſo ſeveral Plates, which I have added. The firſt part doth ſhew the demonſtrations of all the Proportions of the Heights, Diſtances, Breadthꝰ and Openings which are to be allowed to the Enter Columns, and to the Arches Projecters, that are in the frame of a great Building; the which I have borrowed from <hi>Palladio.</hi> The other Plates contain all Architecture in general, by repreſenting the different Columns of each Order, with all their Proportions and Meaſures, as well of the Bodies as the
<pb facs="tcp:99233:4"/>
particular Members, according to that which hath been allowed them by the famous Modern Architects, <hi>Scamozzi, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladio,</hi> and <hi>Vignola:</hi> the one allowing more or leſs to the Pedeſtal, the other to the top or point of the Column; Alſo to the Architrave, Frieſe, and Corniſhes, where each of them have ſtudied how they might add the more comelineſs thereto. And becauſe that the meaſures which they have obſerved are different, I ſuppoſed that if I ſhould make to appear, in an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract at the end of the Book, a brief of the Reſolution of each of them, I ſhould be able to give ſome light to them which have not the whole knowledge thereof, and particularly to thoſe which have not alwayes at hand the Works of thoſe divers Architects, as well in reſpect of their rareneſs, as for thoſe that have not the underſtanding of the Language in which the Originals are written: Tranſlation being ſubject to Omiſſions or Augmentations; or elſe, that often to expreſs ſome Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or proper Name, they put in many needleſs words, which do more obſtruct the Reader, then give him any true light; I mean ſuch Tranſlators as have no knowledge in Architecture: For to Diſcourſe well of this Subject, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it rightly.</p>
            <p>I have Compoſed a brief Inſtruction at the end of the ſeventh Chapter of this Book, which directeth to the foreſaid lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Plates, where their Meaſures are alſo deſcribed on the ſide of each Column, with a Scale of the models and parts which the Architects have uſed in meaſuring them, that I might ſhew more diſtinctly all that dependeth thereon: for I know well, that when there is need of turning over a leaf to ſeek the inſtruction that is intended by ſome Figure or Letter-ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one may be ſo troubled, that they can hardly find that which they had before their eyes: This alſo hath cauſed me to have the proportion of the Columns of this Book printed in one leafe, in a ſmall ſize, that nothing thereof might be cut off, and that thereby might be ſeen altogether the whole Column in its proportion. And ſo much for that which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Augmentations of this Book.</p>
            <p>But not to deprive them of the Glory to whom it is due, we are to know that <hi>Monſieur de Mauclerc</hi> hath followed the great <hi>Vitruvius;</hi> and that all which he hath written thereof, and brought into deſign, is nothing but a faithful demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of that which this chiefeſt of Architects hath diſcourſed thereon: He hath bent himſelf wholly to illuſtrate his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; He hath kept, throughout all, the juſtneſs of his Rules; and, neither diminiſhing nor adding any thing to his Inſtructions, he hath uſed them as the moſt ſolid Foundation he could build his Enterprize upon.</p>

The Baſe of the Column noted F, is to be ſet upon the Pedeſtal, at half the thickneſs of the Column, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in two parts, whereof one ſhall be the Plinth; the other divided into three parts, whereof two are for the Thorus, and the part remaining for the Fillet: The Projecture is as much as from the outward ſquare unto the inward ſquare; the Fillet muſt project one ſquare beyond the Column, and the remainder muſt be for the Thorus. The height of the body of the Column noted G, is of ſix parts of its diameter with its Baſe and Capital. The Capital noted H, ſhall be as high as half the body of the Column below, and is divided into three parts, whereof one part is to be for the Abacus of the Capital, another for the Boultin; the part remaining for the Neck, the Egs and Achors, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into four parts, one part ſhall make the Fillet, the reſt make the Egs and Anchors. The Neck noted I, is divided in two parts, which is marked with two little Croſſes, the one is the breadth of the Aſtragale; this Aſtragale again divide into three parts, whereof one ſhall be for the Fillet, the eighth part of the thickneſs of the body of the Column below, ſhall be the Projecture of the Capital: the Aſtragale muſt project in a ſquare; as may be ſeen more plainly in the great Capital following the projecting of the body of the Column noted K; is made after this manner, The ſaid Column in its length, between the Baſe of the Column and the Aſtragale, it ſhall be divided into ſix parts,<note place="margin">The manner of diminiſhing the Column, as it ought to be, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>K.</hi>
               </note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of two ſhall remain below, and is the third part of the height; having made a diviſion from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to the top, you ſhall draw lines paſſing through on each ſide; and upon the line of the third part, you ſhall ſet a Compaſs compaſſing from one end to the other; apply the Compaſs to the ſide, and divide the Circle from one of the ſides of its half Circle, unto the place where the Perpendicular line falleth off the Scapus or thickneſs of the Column above, until it be on the ſixth part of Icnographia, being on the Pedeſtal, where they divide the round of the ſide into four parts, which you ſhall make with lines acroſs, as it appeareth in this Figure. Likewiſe you ſhall draw out of each part, a line pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upward, beginning on the outſide, and reaching unto the ſixth part of the body of the Column, and ſo following the ſecond and third of the lines ſo drawn, each in his place; let the lines of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing be drawn, proceeding acroſs unto the other, and by this the body ſhall have its diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and to render it more equal and pleaſant to the eye, whereas the Circle is divided into four parts, divide the ſame ſpace into 5, 6, 7 or 8, and the body of the Column likewiſe; for the more diviſions you make thereof, the ſaid diminiſhing will be the more equal and pleaſing; but I would not make it into more then four; for to make the manner thereof more intelligible to thoſe that have leſs skil in this Art, the which having practiſed in four diviſions, will make the other more eaſie to them.</p>
            <p>There is yet another manner of diminiſhing of Columns, which <hi>Vitruvius</hi> ſets forth in his third Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. which is made after this manner; it is, That each of thoſe Columns which ſhall reach from the Baſis unto the Capital, about fifteen foot of height, the Diameter of this Column below,<note place="margin">Another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Columns.</note> ought to be divided into ſix parts; and of this it will ſuffice that the end above have five of them: Of thoſe which ſhall be from fifteen to twenty foot, the greater end below ſhall be divided into ſix parts and a half, whereof you muſt allow five and an half for the end above: of another, which may have from twenty to thirty feet, let the Diameter below be divided into ſeven parts and an half, whereof there
<pb facs="tcp:99233:5"/>
ſhall be allowed ſix and half for the end above, and the leſſening thereof will be convenient: when one ſhall be preſented between thirty and forty feet of height, divide the end below into ſeven parts and a half, then allow ſix and a half for the end above, and ſo the Columns will have a good dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing.<note place="margin">Yet another manner for Columns of <hi>30</hi> feet, noted <hi>3.</hi>

In the other part of the leaf, on the left ſide of the ſaid Pedeſtal and Baſis, may be ſeen a Capital of great Proportion, agreeable to the ſaid Baſis and Pedeſtal, which is noted in his Frieſe with Q.

            <p>Above the Frieſe, on the left ſide, is placed the Corniſh, noted R; which is of the ſame height with the Architrave: The Corniſh ſhall be divided into two parts, whereof the firſt is to be divided into four, one for the Cimatum, two for the Corona, the reſt for the little Cima, which is placed above. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part divided into ſeven, is the O. G. which is ſet upon the Corniſh, and one ſeventh part joyned thereto, ſhall be the Fillet upon the O.

               <head>The Antiquity of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Column, being the ſecond in Order.</head>
               <p>AS for the Original and Antiquity of the ſaid <hi>Dorick</hi> Column, and of the firſt Buildings that have been adorned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, I thought it fitting to make mention in this Chapter, for to eaſe the Curious Reader of the labour of reading many other Authors which have written thereof. Amongſt the reſt, the moſt excellent <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his fourth Book, where he writeth, that the ſaid <hi>Dorick</hi> Column, is the firſt and antienteſt of all others. The which was firſt invented by a Prince named <hi>Dorus,</hi> Lord of <hi>Achaia</hi> and <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Dorus</hi> built firſt, by an occaſional chance, a Temple of this form in the City of <hi>Argos,</hi> and afterwards others like in many other Towns of the ſaid Countrey, the Symmetry, Proportion and Compartition of the Meaſures, being not then as yet found out. But afterwards thoſe of <hi>Athens,</hi> with their Captain <hi>Ion,</hi> Son of <hi>Xanthus,</hi> making War in <hi>Aſia,</hi> conquered the Countrey of <hi>Caria,</hi> and named it <hi>Ionia,</hi> according to the name of the ſaid <hi>Ion</hi>; and having begun to build Temples of their Godds, they built the firſt to <hi>Apollo,</hi> after the likeneſs and faſhion of thoſe which they had ſeen in <hi>Achaia.</hi> And the ſaid Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> was by them named <hi>Dorick,</hi> becauſe that they had ſeen ſuch like in the Countrey of <hi>Doria</hi>; but when as they would in the ſaid Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, place and erect the Pillars; they found not any Proportion, Meaſure, nor Symetry certain; and ſeeking a means to make ſuch as might bear a great weight, and nevertheleſs be pleaſant to behold, they took their Dimenſions upon the foot of a Man, which they found to be the ſixth part of him, which they tranſported and appropriated to the ſaid Column, in ſuch manner as the body of it was by them lifted up ſix times the Diameter of the body of it below, containing therein its Capital. Thus the <hi>Dorick</hi> Column took at firſt its Proportion and Meaſure according to the bigneſs and ſtrong ſtature of a Man. Accordingly the Edifices and Buildings after a manner pleaſing to behold, both firm and ſtrong, to the which afterwards, for the greater pleaſure, hath been added a Diameter more by thoſe of Modern times, which are ſeven Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, leaving the ſix for the height of the <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> being the thickeſt and ſtrongeſt of the Columns.</p>

The Baſe, noted C, hath the half height of the body, which is divided into three parts; whereof one is the height of the ſaid Plinth; the two remaining parts divide into ſeven parts, three for the upper Thorus; the reſt divide into eight parts, two for the two Aſtragals of the middle; and the half of one part ſhall be for each of the Fillets, which are both upon the Plinth, and above and below the Aſtragals. That which is under the Thorus, ſhall contain two parts of one of the ſaid eight parts, as it is plainly ſhewed in the figure of the great Baſe enriched, noted under its Plinth, and in the middle thereof with the letter D. The Fillet, which is ſet over the Thorus of the Baſe of the Column, noted D, is made after this manner;<note place="margin">The diviſion, height, &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of the Fillet which is ſet on the Baſe of the Column, noted <hi>D.</hi>

On the top of the body of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, is ſet the Capital marked E, which is made after this manner;<note place="margin">The manner to make &amp; frame the <hi>Ionick</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital as it ought to be, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>E.</hi>
               </note> Divide the largeneſs of the Column below into eighteen parts, the which you ſhall ſet on the Abacus of the Capital, adding to each ſide one half; but the Fillet, on which are the eighteen parts, ought to have the breadth of half one of theſe parts, which maketh the Cima, ſo that it be large, one part and a half with the Fillet. Of theſe eighteen parts of the Fillet, you ſhall apply nine to the ſide of the Capital, and ſhall diſtribute them in ſuch manner, that one part may be for the Cima, two for the Trochilus of the Voluta, two for the Boultin, adorned with Egs and Anchors; one for the Aſtragale, with Beads; and the three parts remaining, for the half Circle below. Under the Scroul you ſhall take four of the eighteen parts which make the Frieſe; but on the top of the Column, you ſhall make an Aſtragale, which ſhall have in height the twelfth part of the largeneſs of the Column; whereof the third part is the Fillet, the reſt for the Boultin, having the Projecture equal to the height: And for the plainer underſtanding of the ſaid Capital, I have made on the left ſide of this another in a greater proportion, by this means very intelligible, the which you ſhall find noted in the midſt of its Trochilus with O.

                  <p>The diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, noted <hi>G.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> noted F, is made in the form and manner, as it is declared in the framing of the great Scrowl of the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ſet and expreſſed on the right ſide of the ſaid Column, noted by the ſaid O, in its Trochilus. For the diminiſhing of the body of the Column, noted G, from the Baſe below, divide it into ſix equal parts, whereof you ſhall leave two; but from the ſecond part of the Column below going upwards, you ſhall draw on each ſide right lines, and traverſing, by each part of theſe diviſions, and after you have drawn all theſe lines, you ſhall make upon the line of the ſecond part, an half Circle, from one end of the breadth of the third of the Column, unto the other. After this, you ſhall divide the Arch of the Semi-circle, which is contained within the lines erected upwards, into four equal parts, the which you ſhall joyn together by croſs lines, ſo that the firſt and higheſt of them may touch the lines which are erected from the twelfth part, in the place in which it maketh the Circle; and when this line, ſo erected, cometh to touch the end of the ſixth part of the Column, you ſhall draw alſo the lines from the other Sections and Pertitions of the Circle, and they ſhall agree with them. Theſe lines being thus drawn, you ſhall draw within the Semi-Circle, the lines of the diminiſhing, as is to be ſeen in this Figure. And by this manner the Column may be diminiſhed, as it is more largly declared in the firſt Chapter of the ſaid firſt Book, treating of the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Order. Over the Capital is placed the Architrave, noted H, having the height of the halfe thickneſs of the Column below: This Architrave divide into ſeven parts; let one be the Cima, ſo that the third thereof be for the Fillet; the ſix parts remaining divide into twelve, three parts for the Faſcia below, four for the middle, and five for the upper, having their Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and place as this figure ſheweth. The Frieſe, noted I, is of the ſame height with the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trave,
<pb facs="tcp:99233:15"/>
and is divided into nine parts, one of them is the little Sima under the Teath and Dentiles; the third of the remainder is for the Fillet: the two other parts make the Sima; over the Sima are placed the Teeth and Dentels, noted K on the ſide, whereof the height is equal to the Facia of the middle of the Architrave; the Projecture agreeth with the height; their breadth is the half of the height, and two thirds of the largeneſs make the ſpaces which is between them two. To the Teeth and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, add a little Cimatum, which is to be as high as one ſixth part of one of the Teeth and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; the third thereof is the Fillet, the remainder is the Sima, which ought to project in a ſquare. Afterward the Corona is made, noted L, which is as high as the Facia of the midſt of the Architrave: the third thereof is the Cima, and the reſt the O. G.; the Projecture thereof is equal to the diſtance that there is of the Frieſe, to the end of the ſaid Teeth and Dentiles, as it is ſhewed by the figures of them, noted M. Upon the Corona, they ſet the O. G. noted M, which is as high as the height of the leſſer Facia of the Architrave, the which is marked with a Croſs; a ſeventh part of which being joyned thereto, is for the Fillet, the remainder for the Cima: The Projecture of the Fillet ſhall be equal to the height. If you would flute the Column, you ſhall divide the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of it into 24 parts; one of them divide into five, whereof one fifth is the Flute, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſhall be for the Strix; and this being done, you have accompliſhed the true Symmetry and proportion of this Column, according to the cuſtom which the moſt excellent antient <hi>Romans,</hi> and other excellent Common-Wealths have made uſe of.</p>
            <p>And for the more large declaration, to put in practice the members of the ſaid Column here above deſcribed and particularized; in the two next Portracts of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order with the Pedeſtal, may be ſeen in the two pages following in a great proportion, a Baſe and Capital adorned with their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richments, and the Ichnography or Plain. By the means of which Capital and Baſe enriched, the curious Artiſt ſhall be largely inſtructed how to adorn the ſaid particular Members, whenſoever it ſhall be fit for him to uſe them, and occaſions ſhall offer themſelves; the which Baſe is noted under its Plinth, and in the middle of it with P: and above the Baſe, you may find the Scrowl deſigned at large, according to the Rule of <hi>Vignola,</hi> and it is made as it is here deſcribed; you muſt draw a perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler line, called by him <hi>Cathette,</hi> and divide it into ſixteen equal parts, whereof nine ſhall be for the part above, and ſeven for the part below; and the ſeparation A, ſhall be the Center of the Scrowl: After you muſt draw three other lines traverſing, which ſhall divide the Center, and part its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference into eight parts; and then make the Triangle, as it is here on the ſide eaſie enough to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood without any other deſcription; only I ſhall ſay, That its line B C, ſhall have the nine parts heretofore named, and the line C D the ſeven parts; the other lines, without meaſures, do finiſh the Triangle, in which you muſt make the 25 figures, which are to ſerve for the proportion, as it is done on the ſide of the great <hi>Ionick</hi> Baſe.</p>
            <p>Having drawn your <hi>Cathetus,</hi> which being divided into 25 parts, as was ſaid before, place the Center of the eye of the Scrowl upon ſeven parts upwards, and about that Center deſcribe a Circle, whoſe half Diameter muſt be one part: this Circle ſhall be the eye of the Scrowl; then draw a ſtrait line through the Center, which muſt cut the <hi>Cathetus</hi> at right Angles: this divides the eye into four equal parts or Quadrants; then divide the Quadrant in two equal parts, and through the two oppoſite diviſions, draw ſtreight lines, which muſt be continued out to a convenient length, as it may contain the breadth of the Scrowl in that place; ſo you have the eye divided into eight equal parts; then ſet the foot of your Compaſſes on the point C of the Triangle, and carry the other foot to the diviſion marked 1; then remove your Compaſſes with that diſtance to the Scrowl, and ſet one foot in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the eye of the Scrowl at the Center, noted A, and the other foot to the top of the <hi>Cathetus</hi> to the figure 1; this being done, remove your Compaſſes to the Scale again, and placing one foot in the Center of the eye, as before, remove the other to the diviſion, noted 2. Then remove your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes again to the Scrowl, and place one foot on the Center, noted A, as before, then direct the other foot to the ſecond line, and it will fall where the figure of 2 is: Then remove your Compaſſes to the Scale again, placing one foot on the Center, noted C, as before; and the other guide to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure 3: then carry your Compaſſes in the ſame diſtance again to the Scrowl, placing one foot at the Center A, as aforeſaid, directing the other foot to the third line, and it will fall on the figure 3; then remove your Compaſſes again to the Scale, as before, placing one foot on the Center C, and the other on the figure 4, removing your Compaſſes to the Scrowl, placing one foot on the Center, noted A, as aforeſaid, guiding the other foot to the fourth line, and it will juſt reach the point marked 4; then remove again the Compaſſes to the Scale, placing one foot on the Center, the other on the diviſion, marked 5; then remove that to the Scrowl, as aforeſaid: So you muſt do by the ſixth, ſeventh and eighth, and ſo to all the reſt, till you come to the number 25, as you may ſee over the great <hi>Ionick</hi> Baſe, noted under the Plinth with the letter P.</p>

               <p>THis fourth ſort of Column, named the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> imitates the ſhape of a fair and comely Virgin, neatly adorned, and cloathed with rich Ornaments: It would not be fitting to forget the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, and eſpecially its Capital, which was found out by an excellent, and one of the antienteſt Architects, named <hi>Callimachus;</hi> who for his skill in buildings, and works of Marble, was accounted amongſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> moſt excellent. And to come to the antiquity of the ſaid Capital, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention thereof, it is to be noted, that in the City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> there was a Maid, of Age marriageable, who hapned to be taken with a ſickneſs, of which ſhe died; Whereupon her Nurſe or Keeper, conceived ſuch grief and ſadneſs of heart, as well for the love that ſhe bore to her living, as to ſee her ſo to fail in that flouriſhing Age, adorned with ſo excellent Beautie and Virtues, that every time that this good Matron and Governeſs hapned to find any piece of the Works wherewith this young Beauty was accuſtomed to buſie her ſelf, the ſame did bring into her mind all the griefs and bitterneſs paſſed: ſeeing the which, ſhe was conſtrained, for a remedy thereof, and to defend her ſelf from the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, at leaſt of ſo ſad a life, to gather together all the ſaid Works and Implements with which the ſaid Maid was accuſtomed to buſie her ſelf, which ſhe put in a Wicker Basket covered with a Tile, the which ſhe cauſed to be put on the top of the Grave of the ſaid Virgin. And by chance there was found under the Basket, the Root of <hi>Acanthus</hi>; the which being loaded with the weight aforeſaid, began at the Spring time to bud forth and ſeek a place to put forth its Sprouts and Leaves, in ſuch manner, as the Branches were compelled to bend and crook themſelves downward in manner of the Volute; at which the ſaid <hi>Callimachus</hi> took great delight and pleaſure to ſee the novelty of this Herb, and took thereby a Pattern to enrich the ſaid Column and its Capital, for to uſe it in the City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to the which he gave moſt excellent Symmetry and Proportion, as one may ſee by the Pourtracts and Delineations of the ſaid Column and Capital here ſet forth.</p>

            <p>The Modilions, noted M, ſhall have equal breadth and height, and equal diſtance; their proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, as is to be ſeen in this figure, and more plainly in the great Corniſh on the left ſide of the ſaid Columns; the which Corniſh you ſhall find, noted O in the Corona, and more plainly in the great Corniſh following enriched, noted P upon one of its Modilions. The Ornaments of the Frieſes of the ſaid Corniſhes are on the ſide deſigned in ſmall. The height of the Corniſh on the left ſide, noted L, divide into five parts, one ſhall be for the Boultin with its Fillet, two to the Modilions, one to the Corona, and one to the O. G. One third of the Boultin is the Fillet. Divide the Modilions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eight parts, the upper ſhall be joyned to the Corona, another ſhall be the Sima next the Modilions; the Faſcia muſt be divided as thoſe of the Architrave; the Modilions muſt be ſquare in breadth, length, height, and thickneſs; and there muſt be ſo much diſtance, that a Quadrant of the Corona may enter in there: One third of the Corona maketh the Sima. The O. G. muſt be divided in ſix parts, the upper maketh its Fillet; the projecture of the Corniſh muſt be equal to the height. Being done as aforeſaid, you will have the true Symmetry and proportion of all the parts of the ſecond <hi>Corinthian Column,</hi> as the Antients have uſed, and as may be ſeen at preſent in the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Rotunda.</hi>

The Projecture of the Corniſh is equal to the Projecture of the Baſis.</p>
            <p>The Corniſh of the Pedeſtal, noted C, muſt be divided into ſeven parts, one of them is for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtragale and Fillet, two to the Frieſe, one to the ſmall Boultin, two for the Corona: one part may make the Simatum, and two parts the Faſcia. Each part or Member muſt project in a ſquare. Upon the Pedeſtal is ſet the Column, which hath ſuch thickneſs as it is ſaid in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Column, that is to ſay in this manner: Divide the largeneſs of the Pedeſtal into ſix parts; four of them ſhall be the thickneſs of the Column, and the two remaining ſhall make the Projecture of the Baſe, which is ſet upon the Pedeſtal.</p>

            <p>The Fillet, which is ſet upon the Baſe, where you ſee the twelve parts, is made in this manner: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Diameter of the Column into twelve parts, two of them make the diminiſhing of the Column on each ſide; one half part is the breadth of the Fillet, and one whole part is the Projecture.

This is in brief the Symmetry and true meaſure and proportion of the ſaid Column, which finiſheth and accompliſheth its height in thirteen parts, as appeareth by the Columns in <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Amphitheater,</hi> which at preſent is called the <hi>Coliſas.</hi> The manner how to hollow and round the Cimaes or Corniſhes is ſhewed very plainly in the Corniſhes, in a great proportion, on the left ſide of the ſaid Columns, which is for the more plain underſtanding, noted P. that on the left ſide, and that on the right with Q; to the which Corniſhes are added a Frontlet, as appears in the Chapter of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order, with the Rule for its conſtruction, and in that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Corniſh of the Rule and Meaſure of <hi>Vignola</hi> with its Proportions, to the end that the curious may chuſe that which pleaſeth them beſt.

               <head>An Advertiſement for the Enter Columns, Arches or Portals, and of the divers Meaſures of Columns of <hi>Scamozzi, Palladio,</hi> and <hi>Vignola,</hi> which are at the end of this Book.</head>
               <p>WE muſt now ſpeak of Spaces which <hi>Scamozzi, Palladio,</hi> and <hi>Vignola</hi> have obſerved between the Columns, and for the Portals, Gates, and Arches, for the which they have reſolved upon a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure neceſſary for their perfection: and that I may not be tedious, I will diſcourſe but of one ſort, therefore I mean that of <hi>Palladio,</hi> for that I have applyed my deſign thereunto for its variety; begining then with the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Order, where he nameth his meaſure a Module, inſtead of which our <hi>French</hi> Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects have given it the name of a Foot by the Standard: Nevertheleſs the one cometh home to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for if that lawful foot be divided into 12 inches or parts, and one part into 12 points, it is for the better to find out the ſmalleſt diviſions of the leaſt Fillets: and the Module of <hi>Palladio</hi> is divided into ſixty minutes, which meaneth ſo many parts, as likewiſe <hi>Vignola</hi> nameth parts of the Module; and all to the ſame end, to find the better the ſaid diviſions. <hi>Scamozzi</hi> nameth it alſo a Module divided into ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty minutes; whereby it muſt be noted, that he which would allow the proportion to a Column, ought to uſe that meaſure which the Order which he would follow hath uſed to compaſs it. 1. <hi>Palladio</hi> hath allowed to the Enter Columns of the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Order, two Modules and a half of diſtance between the two Columns, to meaſure the ſpace from the body of one Column, to the body of the other Column below, as you ſhall ſee it marked in the deſign that I have made thereof at the end of the Book, where all the Arches, or Portals, or Enter-columns of each Order are reduced into ſmall, to ſerve for a demonſtration only to the Reader: the Arch or Portal of the ſame Order muſt have ſix Modules, and 25 minutes of opening or largeneſs, to take the ſpace or largeneſs of the middle of the body of one Column of the ſaid Arch, to the middle of the body of the other Column on the oppoſite ſide, as it is marked in the ſaid deſign, with a little Angle pointed in the middle of the bottom of the Column of the ſaid Arches, obſerving the ſame in every Order; and the height of the ſaid Arch or Portal, ſhall have 7 Modules, &amp; 40 minutes from its Plane, unto its Center or Mould, even as it is marked in the ſaid deſign by little ends of lines pointed. 2. It muſt be marked in the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, becauſe <hi>Palladio</hi> hath divided his Module into two in this Order only, and the Module into 30 minutes, whereas in others he hath made 60 thereof, the Enter-column of the ſaid Order ſhall have 5 Modules and a half to meaſure, as hath been ſaid in the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Order; and the Arch or Portal ſhall have 15 Modules of opening or largeneſs, and its height ſhall have 20 Modules and a half from its Plane, unto its Center or Mould, as it is ſaid of the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Order. 3. Of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order, its Enter-column ſhall have two Modules, and one fourth of diſtance; and the Arch or Portal ſhall have 7 Modules and 17 minutes of opening or largeneſs; and its height ſhall have 11 Modules from its Plane unto its Mould to meaſure, as it is ſaid here above. 4. Of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order, its Enter-columns ſhall have two Modules of diſtance, and the Arch or Portal ſhall have 6 Modules and a half of largeneſs, and its height ſhall have 11 Modules 10 minutes from its Plane unto its Mould, meaſuring as here above. 5. Of the <hi>Compoſite</hi> Order, its Enter-columns ſhall have one Module and a half of diſtance, and the Arch or Portal ſhall have 7 Modules and 15 minutes of opening or largeneſs; its height ſhall have 12 Modules and 20 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes from its Mould, meaſuring as here above; and <hi>Vignola</hi> alloweth to all the Order, to the Arches or Portals two lines, their opening or largeneſs for their height, to meaſure the ſaid largeneſs of the corner of the Baſe of one Pedeſtal to the other, excepting the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order Pedeſtal, to which he alloweth in height one Module more. It muſt be conſidered that the Columns of the Arches or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals muſt have projecture from the Pilaſters againſt which they are placed, one third part of a Module more then their half, becauſe that the Projecture of the Impoſt goeth forth juſt the half of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn: and this ſhall be a general rule to be obſerved in all the five Orders.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not diſcourſe here of the divers Proportions which the Architects here above named have given to the five Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Columns, and whereof the deſign and Profiles of Columns that are repreſented in ſeveral Prints at the end of the Book, becauſe that upon them the ſaid Proportions are deſcribed in brief; the which I believe might be ſufficiently intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible for thoſe which ſhall allow themſelves the leaſure to read the ſeven Chapters contained in this Book with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhall furniſh them with the opening and knowledge of the proper names and words particularly uſed in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, without the knowledge of which it is very hard to underſtand it well. There are Rules alſo for diminiſhing of Columns; Likewiſe how to make the wreathed Column of <hi>Vignola,</hi> tranſlated out of <hi>Italian</hi> into <hi>French,</hi> and out of <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Engliſh</hi>: Likewiſe you may be ſatisfied that you have in this Book the Meaſures and Proportions of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi> exactly; and you may ſee at the end of the Book, thoſe of the moſt famous Modern <hi>Italian</hi> Architects, where it ſeemeth to me that there is all that one can deſire that would learn Architecture; the others being but weak imitaters of theſe, will never have much authority.</p>
