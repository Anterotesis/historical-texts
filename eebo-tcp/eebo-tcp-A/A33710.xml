         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>I Have in all my Writings taken Truth
for my Guide, as being the Soul of
an Undertaking, and a Duty which
ought to be ſtipulated by every Writer,
both with God and Man; and this I may
ſay that I have not wanted courage to
ſpeak it, nor means to diſcern it.</p>
            <p>The oppoſition I have met with hath
been almoſt inſupportable, Truth at its
firſt appearance never wanting multitudes
of Oppoſers; but (thanks to God) the
Eyes of the World begin to be opened, and
the new Doctrine I have advanced hath
gained ſo much ground, that few Authors
<pb facs="tcp:60930:5"/>
in their own life time, have ſcarce ſeen
the like. This unwonted and unexpected
Encouragement that I have met with,
hath filled me with ſuch a ſenſe of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
that at preſent I am not able to
expreſs; neither can I better manifeſt it,
than by proſecuting the Work I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
with all the diligence and induſtry
that my Nature is capable of bearing,
and this I do oblige my ſelf to do.</p>
            <p>Reaſon is the true Touchſtone by which
we ought to examine every thing; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as any thing doth agree or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree
with it, ſo we ought either to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
or reject it. I remember that that
Prodigy of Nature, the learned Mrs. <hi>Ann
Baynard,</hi> did once, in my hearing, ſay,
<hi>That Reaſon was that eternal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
which God Almighty, as a
Ray of his own Image, has impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
on Man, to the election or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of what may hurt or ſuccour
him; and where this is rais'd and
<pb facs="tcp:60930:5"/>
improv'd, makes him an Angel, but
where ſunk and depreſs'd, a grove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Brute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do proteſt I have never yet advanced
any thing before I had weighed it in the
Balance of the beſt Reaſon that God has
given me; and for fear leſt Reaſon
alone ſhould deceive me, and thereby
ſuffer me to impoſe upon the World, I
have always joined experience to it; ſo
that both being combined together, I
could not well be deceived my ſelf, nor
lead others, into errors. And I am apt
to believe, that if People would but lay
aſide their Prejudices, and conſult
their Reaſons, I ſhould not have one Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
left. But to my no ſmall grief, I
have heard ſome Phyſicians of no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reputation, poſitively declare, That Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and not Reaſon, was what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon. Of theſe men I have little
hopes; but ſince they won't hearken to my
Reaſons, let them but inquire into the
<pb facs="tcp:60930:6"/>
ſucceſs of my Practice; and if they find,
that by the means of <hi>Acids</hi> I am able to
cure thoſe Diſtempers, which are not to
be cured by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> I hope it will at
laſt cure them of their Scepticiſm.</p>
            <p>From one Generation of Phyſicians to
another it has conſtantly been handed
down, that the <hi>Gout</hi> was a Diſtemper
not to be cured; and in ſpight of all the
Noiſe that the laſt Age has made about
experimental Philoſophy, no man ever
went out of the common Road to try
whether this Poſition were true or falſe.
But now it doth evidently appear, that
the <hi>Gout</hi> is not ſuch a Fury, but
that it may with eaſe be overcome by
the means of proper and powerful <hi>Acids;</hi>
the truth of which there is ſcarce any part
of <hi>England,</hi> but there is one or other
that can experimentally atteſt. Now if it
doth evidently appear that my Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
have been ſo notoriouſly ignorant, as
to the Cauſe and Cure of ſo common a
<pb facs="tcp:60930:6"/>
Diſtemper, it is not unreaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that they have been ſo in other Caſes,
nay it is moſt certain they have been ſo:
and there are a great many honeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the Faculty who are not aſhamed
to acknowledg it, and that not only in
words, but by the alteration of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Practice: tho there are another
ſort, who of late have with good ſucceſs
made uſe of <hi>Acids</hi> plentifully, and at the
ſame time have given me all manner of
opprobrious Language: but I thank God I
am out of the reach of their malice, and
though they perſiſt in their ingratitude, yet
I ſhall continue my endeavours to ſerve
them to the utmoſt of my power.</p>
            <p>I have the ſame juſt Apology to make
at this time as formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a continual hurry of Buſineſs, I
have not been able to perform things with
that niceneſs and, exactneſs that I ſhould
otherwiſe have done; and I know there
are a great many who will read theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb facs="tcp:60930:7"/>
with no other deſign than to find
faults: but the Barks of theſe Criticks
will never diſturb me, becauſe I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
nothing but with a real deſign to
ſerve Mankind; and I doubt not, but in
ſpight of all the imperfections that are to be
met with, there are a great many Candid,
Ingenious men, who will make as favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a conſtruction of this, as they have
done of my former Undertakings. And if
men of Candor are but pleaſed, I care not
what the envious Criticks ſay.</p>

he ſent to another place for ſome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60930:8"/>
               <hi>dulcified Spirit</hi> of <hi>Niter,</hi> a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of which he gave him in <hi>Claret,</hi>
and with the reſt he <hi>embrocated</hi> his
<hi>Finger</hi> and <hi>Hand,</hi> which at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
afforded him ſome relief, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then in <hi>extream Agonies,</hi> and had
ſuch a <hi>trembling</hi> in his <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Arm</hi>
as is ſcarce <hi>conceivable.</hi> But in a little
time the <hi>ſymptoms</hi> returning, the
<hi>dulcified Spirit</hi> of <hi>Niter</hi> not being
powerful enough to overcome ſo
<hi>ſubtile</hi> a <hi>Poiſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stringer</hi> again
preſſed him to ſeek for further help:
upon which he told Mr. <hi>Stringer</hi> that
he had a <hi>Brother</hi> in <hi>Pal Mal,</hi> who
was an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> to whom he
would apply himſelf for aſſiſtance
and advice: ſo to his <hi>Brother</hi> he
went in a Coach, Mr. <hi>Stringer</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
him.</p>
            <p>When he came to his <hi>Brothers,</hi> the
<hi>ſymptoms</hi> were ſo <hi>aggravated,</hi> that his
<hi>Brother</hi> was under very great concern
for him, and propoſed ſending for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60930:9"/>
Dr. <hi>Sloane</hi> and ſeveral others; but
Mr. <hi>Stringer</hi> mentioning me, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
aſſented to take my advice in the
matter; upon which they got into
the Coach, and drove to Mr. <hi>Strin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's</hi>
Houſe, by which time the man
was grown ſo weak that he could
ſcarce ſtand. After they had gotten
him into a Room, they ſent for me;
but I not being at home, Mr. <hi>Strin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
ſent for Mr. <hi>Alexander Small</hi> a <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi>
in <hi>New Round Court,</hi> a <hi>young Man</hi>
of great <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and one
whom I frequently imploy.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Small</hi> having never ſeen any
thing of the like nature before, was
at a ſtand what to do; he firſt of all
thought of <hi>ſcarifying</hi> the <hi>Finger,</hi> but
when he conſidered that the <hi>Tumor</hi>
had extended it ſelf even to his
Shoulder, in which part he had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>acute Pains,</hi> and from the other
<hi>ſymptoms</hi> that attended him, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Poiſon</hi> had dilated it ſelf
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60930:9"/>
through the whole <hi>maſs</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> he
altered his firſt reſolution, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>ſcarification</hi> made uſe of the
following <hi>method.</hi> Before I give an
account of which, I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of his <hi>circumſtances,</hi> as they were
related to me, by Mr. <hi>Small,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Stringer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Philipſon Apothecary,</hi>
the man's <hi>Brother.</hi> His <hi>Hand</hi> and
<hi>Arm,</hi> as is before related, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<hi>ſwelled</hi> and <hi>inflamed,</hi> and full
of <hi>pain;</hi> but the <hi>pain</hi> in his <hi>Finger</hi>
where the <hi>Bite</hi> was, and that in his
<hi>Shoulder</hi> did much exceed the <hi>pain</hi> in
other parts; he had a great <hi>Vertigo</hi>
or <hi>Giddineſs,</hi> a <hi>Deliquium Animi</hi> or
<hi>Faintneſs,</hi> even to ſuch a degree, that
he could ſcarce ſit without being
held in the Chair; an extraordinary
and violent <hi>Strangury</hi> alſo attending
him, with <hi>cold ſweats,</hi> and great <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders</hi>
in his <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Bowels,</hi> and
his <hi>Countenance</hi> turned extreamly <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
and <hi>ſtretched</hi> out, almoſt, as <hi>dead.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60930:10"/>
Mr. <hi>Small</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stringer</hi> provided
a good quantity of my <hi>Elixir Vitrioli,</hi>
an account of which and its prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
may be met with in the <hi>ſecond
Edition</hi> of my <hi>Eſſay</hi> of <hi>Alkaly</hi> and <hi>Acid.</hi>
With this <hi>Elixir</hi> Mr. <hi>Small embrocated</hi>
the <hi>Fingers, Hand</hi> and <hi>Wriſt</hi> for near
<hi>half</hi> an <hi>hour</hi> together, and two or
three times in the ſaid ſpace he <hi>dipped</hi>
the end of the <hi>bitten Finger</hi> in plain
<hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol:</hi> in the interim he gave
him <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Drams</hi> or more of the
<hi>Elixir Vitrioli</hi> inwardly in a large
quantity of water, when the man
finding a great propenſity to <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Small</hi> adviſed him to put
his <hi>Fingir</hi> in his <hi>Throat</hi> and help
it forwards; after he had <hi>vomited</hi>
plentifully, Mr. <hi>Small</hi> plied him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
with the <hi>Elixir Vitrioli</hi> in water:
the quantity he took after his <hi>vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Mr. <hi>Small</hi> gueſſeth to be near, if
not quite, <hi>half</hi> an <hi>ounce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60930:10"/>
In leſs than half an <hi>hour</hi> after Mr.
<hi>Small</hi> came to him, all the <hi>ſymptoms,</hi>
except the <hi>ſwelling</hi> of his <hi>Hand</hi> and
<hi>Arm,</hi> and that was ſenſibly leſſened,
were totally vaniſhed, and he able
to walk from <hi>York-buildings</hi> to the
<hi>Grecian Coffee-houſe</hi> in <hi>Eſſex-buildings,</hi>
to find me out to deſire my further
directions in the matter. Now the
<hi>violence</hi> of the <hi>ſymptoms</hi> being abated
and gone, I preſcribed him more
<hi>temperate Acids</hi> than thoſe he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
taken, and that had been appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the affected parts.</p>

            <p>I ordered the man to go to his
<hi>Lodging,</hi> which was in <hi>Black Fryars;</hi>
and becauſe his <hi>Brother</hi> could not get
the forementioned things ready un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60930:11"/>
               <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four hours,</hi> I adviſed him
as ſoon as he came home, to take
<hi>three ounces</hi> of <hi>Treacle Water,</hi> (in my
opinion one of the beſt <hi>Medicines</hi> in
the <hi>London Diſpenſatory</hi>) and as ſoon
as he had taken it, to go to <hi>Bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ordered that the <hi>Cataplaſm</hi> ſhould
be applied warm to the <hi>Hand</hi> and
<hi>Arm</hi> as far as the <hi>ſwelling</hi> reacht, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>ſix hours;</hi> and before the <hi>applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the <hi>Cataplaſm,</hi> that the parts
ſhould be well <hi>embrocated</hi> with the
<hi>Mixture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Infuſion</hi> he took <hi>four Ounces</hi>
every <hi>four hours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenever he was <hi>thirſty,</hi> I adviſed
him to take <hi>twenty Drops</hi> of the <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> in a <hi>draught</hi> of <hi>White
Wine</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Sunday morning</hi> about <hi>eleven</hi> a
<hi>Clock</hi> I went to viſit him, and when
I came to his Lodgings, I found Dr.
<hi>Sloan</hi> with him; the Doctor ſaid the
<hi>method</hi> that had been uſed was <hi>new,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60930:12"/>
but that the Man was in a very good
condition, and out of all danger. He
had <hi>ſlept</hi> well the whole <hi>night,</hi> and
was not in the leaſt <hi>Feveriſh,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had he the leaſt <hi>diſorder</hi> upon
him, only a very ſmall <hi>pain</hi> in his
<hi>Finger,</hi> the <hi>ſwelling</hi> of his <hi>Hand</hi> and
<hi>Arm</hi> being greatly abated.</p>
            <p>I ordered the continuing of his
former <hi>method,</hi> the which I had no
reaſon to vary. But Dr. <hi>Sloan</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that if his <hi>Infuſion</hi> ſhould make
him <hi>puke,</hi> as it once had done, then
in the room of it, he ſhould at the
ſame intervals take <hi>half</hi> a <hi>dram</hi> of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian
Snake Root</hi> in pouder, drinking
afterwards <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three ounces</hi> of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle-water,
ſweetned</hi> with <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liflowers;</hi>
the which I conſented to,
it no way thwarting the <hi>Methods</hi> that
had before been taken.</p>
            <p>At night I viſited him again, and
then found him as <hi>brisk</hi> and <hi>well</hi> as
if nothing had ailed him; the <hi>Infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60930:12"/>
had not <hi>diſagreed</hi> with him, and
therefore he took not the <hi>Powder</hi> of
<hi>Snake Root;</hi> but I mixed the <hi>Treacle-water</hi>
and <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> with
the remaining part of the <hi>Infuſion,</hi>
and ordered him to take <hi>four ounces</hi> of
it <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>evening</hi> only, ſo long
as it laſted.</p>
            <p>The next day I viſited him again,
when I found him up and eating his
Dinner very heartily: I then ordered
him to continue the uſe of the <hi>Cataplaſm</hi>
ſo long as he found the leaſt <hi>ſwelling</hi>
in any part, and then diſmiſſed him
from my care, there not being any
more need of my further attendance.</p>
            <p>A ſmall <hi>ſwelling</hi> of his <hi>Finger</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for ſome time after, but
without <hi>trouble</hi> or <hi>pain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe I may without vanity
ſay, that conſidering the <hi>ſymptoms</hi>
that attended this man, which were
as ſevere as poſſible, and he ſurvive
it, there has not been a more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traor-dinary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60930:13"/>
Cure</hi> wrought, nor ſuch
<hi>ſymptoms,</hi> raiſed upon ſuch an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ever taken off in ſo ſhort a
ſpace.</p>
            <p>Now did the <hi>poiſon</hi> of <hi>Vipers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in a <hi>Volatil Acid,</hi> as ſome would
make us believe, how is it poſſible
for any one to conceive, that ever
theſe <hi>dreadful Symptoms</hi> could be ſo
ſoon taken off, by giving more <hi>Acids,</hi>
and that in ſo <hi>extravagant</hi> a <hi>quantity</hi>
as they were at firſt given by Mr.
<hi>Stringer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Small?</hi> Nay had the
<hi>Poyſon</hi> been an <hi>Acid,</hi> it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to believe, that the more
<hi>Acids</hi> they had given him, the more
his <hi>Symptoms</hi> would have been <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.</hi>
Whereas, on the contrary, it
plainly appears, that by the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
large quantities that they gave
him, the <hi>Symptoms</hi> were ſo ſoon aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it is almoſt paſt belief.</p>
            <p>I cannot but obſerve, that in the
ſtrange relation that Dr. <hi>Stubbs</hi> gives
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60930:13"/>
of the <hi>ſevere Symptoms</hi> that attended
the man at <hi>VVarwick</hi> that was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with an <hi>Adder,</hi> the only thing
that put him out of <hi>danger</hi> of loſing
his life, was the <hi>Mixtura ſimplex</hi> that
was given him, which is a moſt <hi>noble
Acid;</hi> but this man had not the <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura
ſimplex</hi> given him in ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,
or in any <hi>proportion</hi> to the <hi>Acids</hi>
that Mr. <hi>Philipſon</hi> took; neither was
his <hi>Cure</hi> either ſo <hi>expeditious</hi> or ſo
eaſie, as may be ſeen in Dr. <hi>Stubbs</hi>'s
relation of that matter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>hot Iron</hi> was equally uſeleſs in
this, as in that Caſe; and I am apt
to believe doth never do any ſervice
at all, unleſs applied at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of time, that the <hi>bite</hi> is received.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Philipſon</hi> did <hi>ſuck</hi> his <hi>Finger</hi> as
ſoon as he was <hi>bit,</hi> and to that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Phyſitian</hi> attributes a great deal,
and ſays it help'd to <hi>expedite</hi> the <hi>Cure.</hi>
Whereas there are ſeveral <hi>Authors</hi> of
<hi>undoubted credit,</hi> who have given <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60930:14"/>
of perſons that have <hi>died</hi> by
ſo doing. And if this man had <hi>ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
out any great quantity of the <hi>Poiſon</hi>
with his mouth, how came the
whole <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Arm</hi> to be ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<hi>affected</hi> in ſo <hi>dreadful</hi> a <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lemery</hi> in his <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi>
does confeſs, that the <hi>Viper</hi> doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
more with <hi>Volatile (Alkalious)
Salts,</hi> than moſt other <hi>Creatures,</hi> and
aſſigns a very good reaſon for it, <hi>viz.</hi>
from the extraordinary <hi>cloſeneſs</hi> of the
<hi>Cutaneous Pores,</hi> by which means they
do not <hi>perſpire</hi> ſo freely as other <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
do. Nay he confeſſeth, that
their <hi>Poiſon</hi> conſiſteth in the <hi>emiſſion</hi> of
a very great quantity of <hi>Volatile Salts,</hi>
at the time of their being <hi>enraged</hi> or
<hi>angred;</hi> but then to <hi>ſquare</hi> himſelf
with the <hi>vulgar Opinion,</hi> he tells us,
that theſe <hi>Volatile Alkalious Salts</hi> are
inſtantaneouſly, at the time of their
<hi>emiſſion,</hi> during the time of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60930:14"/>
ſhort rage,</hi> turned into <hi>Acids</hi> of
the moſt <hi>volatile nature:</hi> this is ſuch
<hi>Jargon</hi> that nothing can be imagined
like it. The <hi>tranſmutation</hi> of <hi>Metals</hi>
(even to thoſe who are the greateſt
enemies to it) is a mere jeſt to it.</p>
            <p>If we look into <hi>Moſes Charras</hi> his
account of the <hi>German</hi> that was bit at
his houſe, after all the <hi>pother</hi> that he
makes about his <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi>
yet the <hi>Cure</hi> of that man was
not performed without a great deal
of <hi>hazard</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi> and the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture</hi>
of a <hi>great many</hi> other <hi>Medicines,</hi>
beſides that of the <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> and
thoſe even <hi>Acids</hi> too, as <hi>Treacle-water,</hi>
and <hi>ſlices</hi> of <hi>Citrons</hi> with Sugar; but
theſe <hi>Acids</hi> could not ſo effectually
<hi>operate</hi> as otherwiſe, it's probable, they
would have done, by reaſon of their
being <hi>obtunded</hi> by the <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi>
that was ſo <hi>frequently</hi> given him.
But <hi>Hoffman</hi> in his <hi>Clavis Pharmaceut.
Schroderi, pag. 45, &amp;</hi> 46. (as I have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60930:15"/>
elſewhere obſerved) doth wholly <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute</hi>
the <hi>Cure</hi> of this man to the
<hi>Juice</hi> of <hi>Citrons,</hi> after all other things
had proved <hi>ineffectual;</hi> and <hi>ridicules
Charras</hi> for feigning the <hi>Poiſon</hi> to be
an <hi>Acid:</hi> For if this were ſo (ſays
<hi>Hoffman</hi>) how could the <hi>juice</hi> of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons</hi>
(which is an <hi>Acid</hi>) afford the
<hi>Patient</hi> any <hi>relief?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this <hi>ſubject</hi> with
this one <hi>obſervation, viz.</hi> That <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
get more <hi>reputation</hi> by keeping
their <hi>Patients</hi> a long time in hand, and
in <hi>continual danger</hi> of their <hi>lives,</hi> than
by <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>expeditious Cures.</hi> As
for inſtance:</p>
            <p>One <hi>Phyſician</hi> has a <hi>Patient ſick</hi> of
a <hi>Fever;</hi> he takes ſuch a <hi>method</hi> that
his <hi>Patient</hi> lies a <hi>month</hi> in <hi>continual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
and <hi>hazard,</hi> but at laſt <hi>recovers</hi> and
gets abroad; he then <hi>proclaims</hi> to
every body the <hi>miraculouſneſs</hi> of the
<hi>Recovery</hi> and the <hi>Danger</hi> he was in;
upon which enquiry is made who
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60930:15"/>
was the <hi>Phyſician?</hi> he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
replies, the <hi>Famous Doctor</hi>
ſuch a one; and if he be a <hi>Perſon</hi>
of any <hi>Note,</hi> the <hi>Phyſician's</hi> work is
done.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Phyſician</hi> has a Patient
that has the very ſame <hi>Fever;</hi> this
<hi>Phyſician</hi> takes care to <hi>obviate</hi> all <hi>ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms,</hi>
and his Patient is abroad in
eight or ten days, and perhaps has
never been in the leaſt <hi>hazard</hi> of his
<hi>Life.</hi> He (inſtead of <hi>magnifying</hi> the
<hi>skill</hi> of his <hi>Phyſician)</hi> tells his
Friends, my <hi>Phyſician</hi> tells me I have
had a <hi>Fever,</hi> ſuch as my Neighbour
ſuch a one had, but I believe he is
miſtaken, mine could be no more
than a <hi>Cold,</hi> which would have gone
off had I done nothing at all; and
this is frequently the <hi>reward</hi> that <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
men</hi> meet with: and I doubt not
but the ſame <hi>reflections</hi> will be made
upon Mr. <hi>Philipſon</hi>'s <hi>Cure, viz.</hi> that
he would have been well in the ſame
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60930:16"/>
time, had nothing at all been done
to him.</p>
            <p>Several Phyſicians have publickly
ſaid, that a prick with a Needle or
the point of a Lancet in ſome Parts

is not ordinarily ſeen; and Dr. <hi>G.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU are the only fair <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt</hi>
that ever I have had to
do with, and therefore I
ought to treat you with all the <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
and <hi>reſpect</hi> imaginable. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be ſenſible that I walk in an
unbeaten path, and therefore if I now
and then am out of my way, I am
the more excuſable. It's true, ſome
few other <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have heretofore
uſed <hi>Acids</hi> in the Cure of ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
and the friendly correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
I have had with ſome of them
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60930:17"/>
has been of great uſe to me; but
the aſſiſtance I have had from them
as to the <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> of my <hi>Principles,</hi>
has been very inconſiderable. If I
have made any <hi>falſe ſteps,</hi> neither of
them are obliged to anſwer for me,
and if I have made any good ones,
(which I cannot forbear flattering
my ſelf that I have) I am ſure it is
owing to my own <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>induſtry;</hi>
and altho I were not bred up at the
<hi>Univerſity,</hi> yet I have taken as much
true pains to inform my ſelf in all the
<hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> as perhaps any man
ever did.</p>
            <p>Let an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> be laid down
with all the <hi>caution</hi> and <hi>care</hi> in the
World, and eſtabliſhed upon never
ſo certain a <hi>Foundation,</hi> yet there will
ſtill be ſome room left for men to
object; and he that will ſpend his

that may and will be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a thing that is new, muſt lead
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60930:18"/>
but an uneaſie life. But, Sir, I do
not mention this in relation to you,
what <hi>Objections</hi> you have raiſed have
ſeeming weight in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have given my ſelf the trouble
to clear my ſelf of them as well as I
can.</p>
            <p>I no where tell you, that I have
ſaid all that is to be ſaid on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of my <hi>New Hypotheſis,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
ſeveral years to perform.
But I have already ſaid ſo much, that
I believe I may boldly ſay, it is
the beſt and cleareſt <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi>
now extant, and upon the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
of which a man may with
greater <hi>certainty</hi> attempt the <hi>Cure</hi> of
more <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> than upon any other
that has yet been made publick.</p>
            <p>The preſent buſineſs of my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
together with another Piece
of Work I am ingaged in, <hi>viz.</hi> A
General <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Fevers,</hi> does ſo
take up my time, that I cannot make
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60930:18"/>
any very large Remarks upon your
further <hi>Objections;</hi> and were it not
that I am willing to let the World
ſee, that I have a greater eſteem for
you, than for thoſe <hi>Scoundrels</hi> that
have heretofore appeared in <hi>Print</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, for the preſent I ſhould
have been ſilent. For I muſt aſſure
you, that I do not think my <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
at all <hi>ſhaken</hi> by what you have
now ſaid, there being little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than what was contained
in your firſt <hi>Objections.</hi> However I
ſhall tranſcribe your freſh <hi>Objections</hi>
in the order I find them, and make
my <hi>Remarks</hi> in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>Reply. <hi>If you pleaſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the</hi> Alkaline Spirit <hi>that you</hi>
extracted <hi>from the</hi> Conſumptive
<hi>Man's</hi> Blood, <hi>with that which the</hi> heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Blood <hi>afforded, you'l find no great
diſproportion, eſpecially if you conſider the</hi>
Caput Mortuum <hi>of the</hi> ſound Blood.
For you ſay that it being broken into
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60930:19"/>
ſmall Atoms, <hi>each</hi> Atom <hi>appeared to
be ſo many little</hi> Bodies <hi>of</hi> Fire <hi>in your</hi>
Microſcope. <hi>That there is not the
leaſt</hi> ſpark <hi>of</hi> Fire <hi>in the</hi> Blood, <hi>I ſhall
endeavour to prove anon; wherefore 'tis
not irrational to ſuppoſe that thoſe</hi> lucid
Atoms <hi>were of the</hi> Family <hi>of</hi> Salts:
<hi>And if</hi> Salts, <hi>then</hi> Alkaline, <hi>according
to the</hi> Rules <hi>of your own</hi> Hypotheſis.
<hi>But then (you reply) the</hi> Tabid Blood
<hi>would have yielded much more</hi> Alkaly,
<hi>had not the great quantity of</hi> Luxuriant
Alkaly <hi>been thrown upon the</hi> Lungs.
<hi>Methinks this looks a little ſtrange. For
if you remember the</hi> Conſumptive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<hi>did</hi> ſweat <hi>prodigiouſly. Now you
make</hi> Sweat <hi>to be nothing but an</hi> excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
Alkaly. <hi>If this</hi> Alkaly <hi>then
was carryed off in ſuch quantities, it
could not well abound ſo much in the</hi>
Lungs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> This <hi>Objection</hi> or <hi>Reply</hi> to
my <hi>Anſwer</hi> is a tolerable good one,
and not without ſome ſeeming
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60930:19"/>
weight; but is what I am eaſily
able to clear my ſelf from. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I my ſelf have before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of the ſmall <hi>diſproportion</hi>
between the two peoples <hi>Blood,</hi> and
have aſſigned one very good reaſon
for it; but according to your wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Candor, you have furniſhed me,
with a <hi>ſecond,</hi> and that is the <hi>profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of the <hi>Sweats.</hi> Now if after theſe
two great diſcharges of <hi>Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
Alkaly</hi> by <hi>ſweating</hi> and <hi>ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
the <hi>Blood</hi> at laſt abounds with
any quantity of <hi>Alkaly</hi> more than
that of a <hi>ſound perſon,</hi> it is, I think,
very reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the
<hi>Blood's</hi> being at firſt overcharged with
<hi>Alkaly</hi> was the cauſe of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
and in very many Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Caſes it is uſual for the Patient
to ſpit up perfect <hi>Chalk,</hi> and that in
great quantities: Now if the <hi>Blood</hi>
were overcharged with <hi>Acids</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,</hi>
the whole Maſs paſſing ſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60930:20"/>
frequently through the <hi>Lungs,</hi> could
not fail of being ſweetned by this
<hi>Chalky Alkaly.</hi> But on the contrary,
I think it very plain, that the <hi>Tone</hi>
of the <hi>Lungs</hi> being ſpoiled, and the
<hi>Blood</hi> abounding with <hi>Alkaly,</hi> a part
of this ſuperabundant <hi>Alkaly</hi> is
thrown upon them, and cauſes all
the havock that is made by this
<hi>Tyrannical Diſtemper;</hi> and this being
a Diſtemper that moſt of my <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi>
have died of, and of which
I my ſelf am apprehenſive, has
made me not a little inquiſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That you might load the
<hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>healthy perſon</hi> with more
<hi>Alkaly</hi> than I take notice of, you
pretend from my own <hi>Hypotheſis</hi>
(tho without reaſon) to aſſign the
cauſe of the <hi>Lucidneſs</hi> of the <hi>Atoms</hi> of
the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> to proceed from
the ſaid <hi>Caput Mortuum's</hi> abounding
with <hi>Alkalious Salts.</hi> Now I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60930:20"/>
you, that the whole quantity of
<hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> which that <hi>Blood</hi>
produced, would ſcarce afford one
grain of Salt of any kind. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
it to contain but the fourth
part of a grain of <hi>Phoſporus,</hi> which
is a true <hi>Animal Fire,</hi> that would
diffuſe it ſelf through the whole,
and make it <hi>lucid.</hi> The <hi>Phoſporus</hi>
is a true <hi>Animal Fire,</hi> and is to be
extracted from all <hi>Animal Subſtances;</hi>
and if it did not exiſt in them, how
is it poſſible for it to be <hi>extracted</hi>
from them? And that the <hi>Phoſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
is an <hi>Acidoſulphureous</hi> ſubſtance,
is to be demonſtrated without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
And I have plainly told you,
that the <hi>Pabulum</hi> of <hi>Animal Fires</hi> is
a <hi>ſulphureous Acid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third Replies</hi> I ſhall
not meddle with, because you either
grant me what I have ſaid, or elſe
proceed upon meer ſuppoſitions, of
which I can take no notice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60930:21"/>
But here you fall upon me again
without that order I could wiſh for,
firſt with <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and then <hi>Firſt</hi> and
<hi>Secondly</hi> again, and ſo on. Of this
I ſhall take no notice, but go on
from your firſt Reply to the Second,
Third and Fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and mark the pages in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 6, 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>You ſay,</hi> That
in page not 67th of my
Anſwer, I know not what to make of
your <hi>warm Particles.</hi> And by way
of <hi>Reply</hi> you ſay, you mean <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalious
Particles,</hi> ſuch as you believe
the Blood abounds with in ſome <hi>Fevers,</hi>
and in which you grant <hi>Acids</hi> are of uſe.
But yet <hi>(ſay you)</hi> I cannot agree with
your notion of <hi>Fevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Fever <hi>(ſay you Pag.68.)</hi>
proceeds from a <hi>Conſtipation</hi> of
ſome of the Emunctories, ſo that the
<hi>excrementitious Alkaly,</hi> which ſhould
be carried off by them, is detained in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60930:21"/>
               <hi>Blood,</hi> which by breaking its <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules,</hi>
&amp;c. This Doctrine does not ſeem
at all to correſpond with your <hi>Practice.</hi>
For <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and other <hi>Acids</hi>
which are very <hi>ſtiptick,</hi> the uſe of which
you applaud in <hi>Fevers,</hi> ſhould methinks
conſtipate the pores more cloſely. And
then they being of a very fixing nature,
ſhould fetter or retain thoſe <hi>excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
Alkalies, Again, if <hi>Fevers</hi> are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
only by a detention of theſe <hi>Alkalies,</hi>
then it muſt follow, that when ever they
have free vent, the <hi>Fever</hi> muſt abate. But
the contrary has been ſometimes experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
where the Patient has ſweated very
liberally, and yet died at laſt. If this
will not ſerve the turn, I hope to make it
appear anon, that <hi>Alkalies</hi> are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of breaking the <hi>Globules,</hi> and making
ſuch a buſtle in the <hi>Blood.</hi> But I cannot
but ſpeak one word or two in their defence
before I go any further. I am very apt to
think, that in ſome <hi>Fevers,</hi> eſpecially
Peſtilential and Malignant, the Spirits are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60930:22"/>
primarily affected, according to the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi>
of the ingenious Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
thoſe ſymptoms which attend the <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſum
Genus</hi> immediately upon the firſt
ſeizure. But you muſt not admit of this
notion, from the ſoil which you muſt lodg
in the Blood, and thence be communicated
to the Spirits. Well, let it be ſo, I will not
diſpute it: the difficulty on your ſide will
be great ſtill. For, tho I ſhall readily
grant the <hi>Globules</hi> to be broken in the
aforeſaid <hi>Fevers;</hi> yet 'twill be a hard
matter to convict <hi>Alkalies</hi> of thoſe tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
diſorders. For firſt, experience ſhews,
that nothing is more proper in thoſe Caſes
Malignant (I ſhall adventure to uſe the
term, notwithſtanding it has been ſo ſcouted
of late) than <hi>pul. e Chelis, Rad. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentar.</hi>
nay, <hi>Sp. C. C.</hi> it ſelf, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in a proper Vehicle. But ſecondly,
Nothing does ſo readily diſſolve the maſs
of <hi>Blood,</hi> or ſeparate its Principles as
<hi>Acids,</hi> which I ſhall prove by and by,
when I come to ſpeak ſomething of Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60930:22"/>
But this long diſcourſe of the heat
of the <hi>Blood,</hi> does naturally lead me to
conſider ſomewhat of its Flame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> I do ſtill affirm that <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
in general do proceed from a
conſtipation of the <hi>Emunctories.</hi> Now
what I mean by <hi>Emunctories,</hi> are thoſe
parts which are only deſigned and
provided by Nature for the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Excrements from the
Blood; and whenever they are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
as not to be able to perform
that office, why then there muſt either
a <hi>Fever,</hi> or ſome other great diſorder
follow. And that this Doctrine
quadrates with my practice is very
plain. For whenever theſe <hi>Emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
are over relaxed, they cannot
ſqueeze out the excrementitious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in ſufficient quantities, and ſo
they return back again into the <hi>Blood,</hi>
and cauſe <hi>Fevers,</hi> or ſome other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;
and ſo of conſequence Spirit
of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or ſome ſuch kind of <hi>Stip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60930:23"/>
is the only proper remedy to take
off this diſorder. But to knock this
matter on the head, you ſay that in
many <hi>Fevers</hi> the Patient ſweats ſo
much, that by ſo doing it has coſt
him his life. This I will readily
grant you, but the Sweats you mean
are certainly ſuch as we call <hi>colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
ones; in which caſes the <hi>Emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
are ſo overmuch relaxed, that they
cannot bear a congeſtion at all, and
ſo there is no ſuch thing as a ſecreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the Juices good and bad are
all let out together; and unleſs they
can be prevented by proper Stipticks,
which will put Nature into her right
courſe, the whole Fabrick muſt ſoon
be deſtroyed. And it is alſo to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that in ſuch <hi>Fevers</hi> the heat
doth ſcarce exceed that of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
temper, the Pulſe being alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
low. In the latter part of
this Reply you altogether go upon
ſuppoſitions, without the leaſt kind
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60930:23"/>
of demonſtration, and ſo it is ſcarce
worth my taking notice of: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to manifeſt my reſpect, I ſhall
go on with it. As for what you
mean by the Spirits being primarily
affected in Peſtilential and Malignant
<hi>Fevers</hi> (all deference being had to
the worthy Dr. <hi>Morton</hi>) it is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Greek to me: For by my own
experience, (to uſe your own terms)
in ſuch caſes I have found the <hi>Blood</hi>
ſo full of ſoil, that from thence I
ſtick not to acount for all the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Spirits and other nervous
Symptoms that attend thoſe <hi>Fevers.</hi>
And for a <hi>Fever</hi> of the Spirits purely,
a very late Author has ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded
that matter. And in my
own Practice, within the ſpace of a
twelve month, I have been concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with three Perſons (and thanks
to God I have ſeen no more) that
have had the true Peſtilence or
Plague; the <hi>Blood</hi> of all which I have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60930:24"/>
ſeen, and indeed it has rather deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the name of Soil than Blood,
they being ſuch maſſes of Putrilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Subſtance, that no man could
without horror behold; and (by the
aſſiſtance of Providence) two of
theſe perſons I recovered by the
means of <hi>Acids,</hi> and believe I might
have done the ſame by the third, had
I been called in time. As for what
you ſpeak of your Experience as to
the efficacy of <hi>Pulvis è Chelis,</hi> and <hi>Sp.
C. C.</hi> it's a meer trifle; and if ever any
thing was done after the exhibition
of them, Nature her ſelf deſerved
the whole honour, nothing in the
leaſt being to be attributed to the
Medicines, as may demonſtrably be
made appear, and to pleaſe you I
ſhall endeavour to do. But by the
way I beg of you, that you will not
rank the <hi>Rad. Serpentariae</hi> with the
<hi>Pul. è Chelis</hi> and <hi>Sp. C. C.</hi> for the <hi>Rad.
Serpentariae</hi> belongs to me, it being a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60930:24"/>
moſt noble ſulphureous <hi>Acid invelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;</hi>
and that it is ſo I will be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to maintain. But to return. I
do boldly aſſert that in no <hi>Fever</hi> that
ever I have yet met with, let them
be either <hi>benign</hi> or <hi>malign,</hi> have I ever
yet obſerved that the Patient has been
in the leaſt ſenſible of any Acidity
in the Stomach or Mouth, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
thoſe parts have been clog'd
up with a Matter that looks ſo like
<hi>Alkaly,</hi> that if it be not the very ſame,
I am ſure it's no kin to the <hi>Crab-Tree.</hi>
Now ſuppoſe it to be <hi>Alkaly,</hi> as it's
plain it is, what can the <hi>Pul. e Chelis,</hi>
which is a fixt <hi>Alkaly,</hi> or the <hi>Sp.
C. C.</hi> which is a volatile one, do
to remove; the <hi>Pul. e Chelis,</hi> or any
Medicines of that Tribe, I mean of
the <hi>Teſtacea,</hi> which for want of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid</hi>
to diſſolve them, muſt lie upon the
Stomach, and by clogging of that
cannot fail of doing a great deal
of miſchief to the whole Body? As
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60930:25"/>
for <hi>Sp. C. C.</hi> or any Medicines of
that kind, I cannot ſee what reaſon
there can be for the exhibition of
them, becauſe it is moſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
manifeſt, that the Blood of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh
People is always overclog'd
with Particles of the ſame Nature,
<hi>viz. volatile Alkalious Salts.</hi> But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the <hi>Teſtacea</hi> and <hi>volatile Salts,</hi>
if you uſe any of the following ſort
of Medicines, I am apt to believe
that your Practice in Malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
will be more ſucceſsful than it
has hitherto been; <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as <hi>Aq.
Theriacalis</hi> in large quantities, <hi>Mixtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
Simplex, Elix, Vitrioli N<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>
               </hi> an Infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Virginian Snake Root, &amp;c.</hi> in
Vinegar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but here I have not
room to expatiate. By the uſe of theſe
Medicines you may raiſe the Pulſe,
and fortifie the deprav'd and paul'd
Stomach, promote due and regular
Secretions, and change the malignant
colliquative ſymptomatick Sweats
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60930:25"/>
into benign and critical ones. But
this is not a place for me to expati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
upon the method of the Cure of
<hi>Fevers,</hi> that being reſerved for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Tract by it ſelf; which with
ſome other things that I have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the World, ſhall appear abroad
as ſoon as I am able.</p>
            <p>As for what you here ſay in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Acids</hi> diſſolving the Blood, I
ſhall now take no notice of it, becauſe
you handle that matter more largely
in another place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> And here the Life of Man you
take to be a Fire or Flame, and all we
eat and drink, together with the Air,
we draw in, to be Fuel for this Flame.
The chief Arguments you bring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this Doctrin, are taken from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
of this Flame and its Fewel. The
Excrements are <hi>Alkalies,</hi> which are near
of kind to Aſhes, the Relicts of other
Flames: And for its <hi>Pabulum,</hi> 'tis
Acid and Sulphur the common <hi>Pabulum</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60930:26"/>
of all Flames. Here I muſt confeſs you
talk very ingeniouſly, and highly improve
the Notions of that great Philoſopher. But
let us examin this Hypotheſis a little. As
for <hi>Alkalies,</hi> I confeſs they are of the
ſame nature with Aſhes and Soot: Yet it
does not follow, that becauſe <hi>Alkalies</hi>
are found in the <hi>Blood</hi> there muſt be a
Flame too. We extract <hi>Alkaly</hi> out of
ſeveral Herbs. 'Tis true the Herbs muſt
be calcined firſt. But certainly the Salt
was pre-exiſtent in the Herb before the
Calcination, or elſe the Fire produced it
<hi>de novo,</hi> which you will by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
The Inference then is plain. I will
not adventure to ſay any thing of Crabs-Claws,
Oyſter-Shells, &amp;c. leſt you ſhould
make them the Recrements of a vital
Flame. Come we next to the <hi>Pabulum,</hi>
and that is Acid and Sulphur. That Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
in which Sulphur is predominant, are
inflammable no body queſtions: But that
ſuch in which Acid is the chief Ingredient
ſhould burn, look like a Paradox. To
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60930:26"/>
inſtance in a few: <hi>Acet Spirit.</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.
Suc. Limon.</hi> &amp;c. are ſo far from
promiting Fame, that they immediately
quench it: and indeed I know but one
Acid in Nature, which is inflammable, and
that is <hi>Niter.</hi> But then this Vital Flame
is not of a Nature with Culinary Flames.
<hi>Anſwer,</hi> Since the <hi>Pabulum</hi> is the ſame,
methinks the Flame ſhould be ſo too. Again,
tho you ſpeak ſo much of this Vital Flame,
yet you do not (as I remember) much
care to fix the Place of its Exiſtence. I
ſuppoſed it muſt be in the Blood, if any
where. Now 'tis very hard to ſuppoſe a
Flame in that Body, of which no part is
inflammable. If you open a Vein, and the
Blood ſpouts out reeking hot on the Fire,
it will immediately quench it. So that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
theſe Notions ſeem to be a little
too finely ſpun. Acid and Sulphur did
ſupport human Life, Men live upon Coals,
Brimſtone, &amp;c. in which there is ſtore of
Acid and Sulphur. That we cannot ſubſiſt
without Air is evident: For tho there is no
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60930:27"/>
Fire in the Blood, there is Motion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly.
Now the Nitro-aereal Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
give a freſh Fermentation (or Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to it, and free it from Coagulation.
If you are not ſatisfied with this, conſult
the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Mayow.</hi> But then
the Blood has heat and warmth; and theſe
are the Properties of Fire. <hi>Anſw.</hi> May
they not be excited by its Motion? No
(you <hi>reply</hi>) we are much warmer in
Bed, when we uſe no Exerciſe, than when
we are up and in Motion. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The
Body indeed is in no motion there; but the
Blood is greater than when we are out of
our Beds; and 'tis impoſſible ſhould be
otherwiſe. For do not the Bed-clothes
protect us from the Coldneſs of the ambient
Air? And are not a great many of the
Volatile Alkalies detained by them, which
reflecting upon the Body, warm it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate
the Motion of the Blood? But
after all, if we move violently when out
of our Beds, we are much warmer than
when in them. You are pleas'd to Object,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60930:27"/>
'tis impoſſible meer Motion ſhould cauſe
any Heat in fluid Bodies. How ſo? Let
a Man put <hi>Spirit. Corn. Cerv.</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Vitrioli</hi> together, and obſerve their
Effects, they will ſoon grow warm. 'Tis
evident, they do not ſtand ſtill, but move
very briskly before they are warm. And
what is the Heat of theſe Bodies occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by, but their Fermentation or inteſtine
Motion? Surely it cannot be by Accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> That the Life of Man is a
Flame, I think I have ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
before, and ſhall here
endeavour to make it ſomewhat
more plain. The <hi>Phoſporus</hi> is a thing
that is to be obtained from all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Subſtances; and that the <hi>Phoſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
is a Fire is paſt diſpute, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
all thoſe things that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fire will do, <hi>viz.</hi> enkindle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable
Bodies, give heat and
warmth to thoſe things that are near
it, afford Light in the Dark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60930:28"/>
yet in very many things doth
differ from common Fire. Now
if this Fire were not actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent
in Animal Bodies, how is it
poſſible that it ſhould be extracted
from them? Common Brimſtone,
Tallow, Pitch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do abound with
Sulphur, and ſo of conſequence are
inflammable; yet from none of theſe,
by any Artifice now known, is there
the leaſt quantity of <hi>Phoſporus,</hi> or
any thing like it to be obtained. The
<hi>Phoſporus</hi> won't burn, without a free
acceſs of Air, any more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fire: But herein is a very great
difference between the <hi>Phoſporus</hi> and
common Fire. Let any inflammable
Body be never ſo well enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and afterwards the Flame or enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
part of it immerged in water,
and it will inſtantaneouſly be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
ſo as not to be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it ſelf, tho expoſed to never
ſo free an Air, without being again
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60930:28"/>
applied to ſome enkindled Body.
Let a piece of <hi>Phoſporus,</hi> in a dark
night, be placed upon a ſheet of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
it will immediately, or its own
accord, afford a Light, will heat your
Fingers, and burn the Paper; this
piece of <hi>Phoſporus</hi> being put into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
will, in all appearance, be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
extinguiſhed, but tho it has
lain in the Water for a whole Year,
upon being taken out, will of it ſelf
burn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the ſame manner it did
when put into the Water. Upon ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of ſome Cats in the dark, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of ſmall flaſhes of Fire will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ones hand, as I have frequently
experienced: Now this gentle ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
can never cauſe ſo violent a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as you make Fire to be, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is, unleſs it were actually exiſtent
in the Animal before. Altho I confeſs
Fire to be a Subſtance that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
in motion, and that this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a very brisk one, yet all brisk
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60930:29"/>
motion is not a Fire, which from the
<hi>Carteſian Hypotheſis,</hi> ſeems to be a
neceſſary concluſion: But I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, I know ſeveral Fluids, that
the more briskly they are moved, the
colder they are; as for inſtance, a
River is always colder in that part
where there is a quick Current, than
where the Water ſtands ſtill: The
Air is always more or leſs cold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the Motion of it is greater
or leſs; and I can aſſure you I
have been almoſt ſtarved when
forced to travel in high Winds in the
<hi>Winter-time,</hi> at which ſeaſon the Air
is moſt full of <hi>Nitrous Particles,</hi> which
you own to be inflammable; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
here your <hi>Nitrous Particles</hi> in
violent motion, and yet a Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſtarved by them, nay ſeveral
have actually been ſo, ſo that you
may ſee it is not all kinds of violent
motion, tho of Particles inclined to
take Fire, that will cauſe a Flame.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60930:29"/>
So that you ſee I have ſufficient reaſon
to maintain my aſſertion, that meer
Motion, tho never ſo much excited,
will not occaſion Heat in fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and that there is a difference in
ſome reſpects between the <hi>Vital Flame</hi>
and common <hi>Culinary Fire,</hi> tho in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things they agree. I ſhall here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
enumerate ſome things wherein
<hi>Animal Fire</hi> and <hi>Common Fire</hi> do agree
and diſagree. <hi>Animal Fire</hi> won't burn
without a due acceſs of Air, no
more won't <hi>Common Fire; Animal
Fire</hi> cauſeth Heat and Warmth, ſo
doth <hi>Common Fire; Animal Fire</hi> cannot
ſubſiſt without a conſtant ſupply of
ſulphurious-Acid Particles, neither
can <hi>Common Fire</hi> ſubſiſt without a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of the ſame Particles, <hi>&amp;c. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Fire</hi> (for ſo I call the <hi>Phoſporus</hi>)
being immerged in Water, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
taken out again, will regain
all its properties of Light, Heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
without being applied to other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60930:30"/>
Bodies: This <hi>Common Fire</hi>
will not do; for let it be once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
by immerſion in Water,
or otherwiſe, and it is never able to
recover it ſelf. I do ſtill aſſert,
that thoſe Bodies which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Pabulum</hi> for Fire, are thoſe which
are compoſed of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur;</hi>
but thoſe which abound with moſt
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> burn with the greateſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
thoſe which abound moſt
with <hi>Acid,</hi> more ſlowly; and ſome
<hi>Acid Subſtances</hi> which have little <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>
in them will ſcarce burn at all, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if much diluted with Phlegm,
ſuch as <hi>Vinegar, Juice</hi> of <hi>Lemons,
Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore
when the Heat of the Body is too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe,
I give thoſe <hi>Acids</hi> which are
leaſt impregnated with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> to
abate the violence of the Flame;
when the Heat is too remiſs, I then
give <hi>ſulphurous Acids</hi> to excite the
Flame. You ſay you know but one
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60930:30"/>
               <hi>Acid</hi> in Nature which is inflammable,
and that is <hi>Niter:</hi> Now I do aſſure
you it is my opinion, nay I am
very well able to demonſtrate, that
moſt, if not all the pure <hi>Acids</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have their <hi>origins</hi> from the <hi>Niter</hi>
of the Air, but pure <hi>Niter</hi> alone will
ſcarce burn at all, unleſs mixed with
ſome kind of <hi>Sulphur.</hi> As for fixing
a particular place for the exiſtence of
the Vital Flame, I did not think
there was any reaſon for ſo doing,
but now I tell you, that I ſuppoſe it
is diffuſed through all the parts of
the Body, and if by accident any
part is deſtitute of it, a mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enſues. But then again you ſay
it is a hard matter to conceive a
Flame in that Body, of which no part
is inflammable. Pray what do you
think of the Oily Fat Particles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
not only in the Blood, but
all other parts, are not they inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.
The reaſon why we are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60930:31"/>
warmer in Bed, and after violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
is not to be attributed to any
unknown Doctrin of Fermentation,
but becauſe we have a freer Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
at theſe times, and ſo of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
the Flame muſt burn more
freely. The Compariſon you make
between the Heat of the Blood and
that occaſioned upon the mixture of
the Spirit of <hi>Harts-Horn</hi> and Spirit of
<hi>Vitriol</hi> will not hold good; for in the
mixing of thoſe two Liquors, or in
any kind of Fermentation, there is
a very ſenſible commotion and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in all the parts of the ſaid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
whereas in the Blood of well
Perſons there is no ſuch thing to be
diſcerned. I confeſs by the impulſe
of the Heart it is driven progreſſively
from the center to the extremities,
to ſupply the neceſſities of the Parts;
but beſides this progreſſive Motion,
I know no other it has, all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions
being performed by proper
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60930:31"/>
Strainers, not from any Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Nay it is a very eaſie thing for
a man to perceive that there is no
ſuch thing as a Fermentation in the
Blood by the following eaſie Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
<hi>viz.</hi> let a few ounces of
Blood run out of the Veins or Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Man, or other Animal, into
a very clear Glaſs Veſſel, which
veſſel you may put into a Sand Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
wherein the heat may be ſuch
as to keep the Blood in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of warmth as it came out of
the Veſſels; and if there be any
commotion to be ſeen with the beſt
Light and beſt Eyes, like unto what
may be ſeen in ſuch Liquors which
are in a ſtate of Fermentation,
upon information I ſhall gladly own
my ſelf miſtaken. There is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
a Froth to be ſeen upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of ſome Blood after it is let out
into the Porringer, which looks like
the ſurface of Liquors which are fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60930:32"/>
But this Froth is ſo far
from being the effect of Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it proceeds from nothing
elſe but the different ſtream that
the Blood runs in. For in the ſame
Perſon, let one Parcell run out in a
rapid ſtream, and it will occaſion
froth or bubbles; let another Parcel
run out gently, and it will produce
no ſuch thing. Will not ſimple
Water or any other Liquor do the
ſame? but Blood being a Liquor of
greater conſiſtence, the bubbles when
raiſed will not ſo ſoon diſappear, as
in Water or other Liquors that are
more fluid; from which I hope it is
plain, that the conſtant natural heat
of the Blood does not proceed from
Fermentation. And if the progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Motion from the Heart to the
Extremities gives it its heat, by the
ſame reaſon, I think, the Water
that runs from our Cocks ſhould be
warm alſo; whereas I dare be bold
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60930:32"/>
to ſay, that inſtead of gaining any
heat by its rapid propulſion through
the Pipes, it is much colder than the
Water in the River at the place
from whence it was received into
the Engine. I had like to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to take notice of what you have
ſaid concerning the production of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies;</hi>
but it being a very material
thing, I ſhall here expatiate a little
upon what I have before ſaid upon
that Subject, and ſhall take care as
much as may be to avoid repetitions.
I have already own'd that <hi>Alkalies</hi>
do actually exiſt in ſeveral Bodies as
the principle of their death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
but I never could yet ſee
or hear of any one that has ſeen any
ſuch thing as either a volatile or fixt
<hi>Alkalizat Salt,</hi> that was any other
ways to be obtained out of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or Mineral Bodies, than from
the Bodies after they had been burnt,
<hi>viz.</hi> out of the Aſhes or Soot of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60930:33"/>
them, which are their Excrements,
or rather the Excrements of Fire;
or elſe after the Body had undergone
a Putrefaction, which is analagous
to Fire. Now this being ſo in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Vegetables and Minerals, I
think in may not be amiſs to infer,
that the <hi>Alkaly</hi> to be found in Animal
Subſtances is the Excrement of their
Fire; and which mightily confirms
me in this Notion, all the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Animals are <hi>Alkalious, viz.</hi>
a Matter thrown away either as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
or incommodious; and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
all the <hi>Alkaly</hi> to be met with
in the Blood or elſewhere, is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
in a way of being carried
off. More upon this Head I ſhall not
ſay at this time, by reaſon I ſhall
have occaſion to enlarge upon this,
and upon the Heat of the Blood in
my Tract of <hi>Fevers.</hi> But what I
have now and before ſaid is, I
think, ſufficient to ſatisfie any one
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60930:33"/>
who is not a meer <hi>Sceptick.</hi> But for
manifeſt <hi>Acids,</hi> they are to be met
with every where almoſt, both in
the Mineral and Vegetable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
even in thoſe Bodies that
have never undergone a Putrefaction,
but are in the greateſt ſtate of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and for <hi>Vinegar</hi> and the like, it
is ſo far from being the effects of
Putrefaction, that it is the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Perfection Nature alone is
capable of bringing thoſe Liquors to.
It is alſo to be obſerved, that thoſe
Fruits of which Wine is made, were
firſt <hi>Acid,</hi> before they came to a ſtate
fit to make Wine of; and that Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
is the Cauſe of the Acidneſs
of Unripe Fruits, I believe none will
aſſert. This Subject is alſo too long to
treat fully of in this place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall alſo omit the further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of it for a <hi>Practical Diſcourſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> If <hi>Alkalies</hi> are the Original
of Diſtempers, whence is it, that in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60930:34"/>
               <hi>Dropſies, Catarrhs,</hi> ſome <hi>Gouts,</hi> and
other Diſeaſes, we find the Texture of
the Blood ſo thin? 'Tis obſervable, that
thoſe Particles you term <hi>Alkalies,</hi> the
more the Blood is ſaturated with them,
of the more thick Conſiſtence it is, as we
ſee in <hi>Pluriſies, Rheumatiſms</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inflammatory Caſes (in which Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
if in any, the <hi>Alkalies</hi> abound)
Is not then its Tenuity rather to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to <hi>Acids?</hi> Do not <hi>Acids</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
put the Blood in a Fuſion, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it thin? Your <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this is, that
'tis not the Thinneſs of the Blood is the
only Cauſe of theſe Distempers, but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Tone of the Parts. Here
methinks you do not argue ſo fairly. For
you mention little or nothing of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Tone of the Parts in your
Etymologies of Diſtempers till now. And
why may not I as well ſay, in Inflammatory
Caſes the Blood is not affected with any
Alkaline Particles? Theſe Inflammations
only ariſe from a Deſtruction of the Tone
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60930:34"/>
of the Parts; eſpecially, if you conſider
what you aſſerted in your Notion of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:</hi>
For there the <hi>Emunctories</hi> are
very much out of order. But (you <hi>object</hi>)
ſince <hi>Acids</hi> will reduce the Blood to its
due Conſiſtence, it is not reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they ſhould be the Cauſe of its Fuſion.
<hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether <hi>Acids</hi> will reſtore the
Conſiſtence of the Blood I ſhall examin by
and by: I fear they will not. But this
I am certain of, they will put it in a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
'Tis well known that you celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> taken alone, or tho in a
Vehicle, if in too great quantity, kills.
Now how does it kill? Does it not by
diſſolving the Maſs of Blood, by ſeparating
the Grumous Parts from the Serous, and
breaking its Texture after the ſame Manner
as it does that of Milk? Sure I am, that
Blood coagulated by the aforeſaid Oyl,
does much more reſemble Whey and Curds
than Jelly of <hi>Harts-horn.</hi> Now then,
what is all this but an Extraordinary Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?
And if a large Doſe will make ſuch
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60930:35"/>
mad Work, and put the Blood into ſo great
a Fuſion; certainly a leſs Doſe muſt cauſe
ſomewhat of a Fuſion. And 'tis rational
to believe that Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is proper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in thoſe Diſtempers, where the Blood
is too thick; very pernicious in ſuch as
have it too thin. And here I am very
glad, that you ſo opportunely give us
your Sentiments of <hi>Dropſies.</hi> A <hi>Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi>
(ſay you) or the Thinneſs of Blood
in that Diſeaſe does not proceed from
<hi>Acids,</hi> but overmuch Drinking. <hi>Anſw.</hi>
That large Draughts (there being little
Evacuation by Urin) render the Blood
more thin is very obvious. But now the
Patient had no ſuch deſire for Drink,
till the Diſtemper was actually upon him.
So that the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, what firſt
brought on the Diſtemper. Was it not a
weakneſs of Blood or want of due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence?
I do not ſee how you can well
deny it. But then (you <hi>reply</hi>) let it
be ſo, 'tis impoſſible <hi>Acids</hi> ſhould occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
this ill Habit of Blood. For, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60930:35"/>
People are Thirſty, and 'tis ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
to imagin that <hi>Acids</hi> ſhould excite
Thirſt, when they are the only Things in
the World that will quench it. <hi>Anſw.</hi>
This I confeſs, at firſt ſight, looks like
an invincible Argument: But I muſt
crave leaver to weigh it a liltle. That
<hi>Acids</hi> drank, or held in the Mouth, uſually
quench Thirſt, is an undeniable Truth:
Tho 'twill hardly hold good in all Caſes.
For, let a Man drink Brine, which is
very much impregnated with <hi>Acids,</hi> or eat
high-ſeaſoned Meats; I believe tho he were
a <hi>Stoick</hi> he would immediately grow thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.
But common Salt is not an <hi>Acid</hi> of
a right Nature. Well, admit this. The moſt
famous <hi>Acids</hi> that I know for ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Thirſt, are <hi>Oyl Vitriol. Spirit.
Vitriol,</hi> &amp;c. Now I hope to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that theſe, or <hi>Acids</hi> of the ſame
nature, abounding in the Blood, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
Thirſt. I proved juſt now, that
Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> had an ugly Faculty of coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
the Blood, or ſeparating its Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60930:36"/>
That there is a Separation of the
Serum in <hi>Dropſies</hi> is evident: If any
Man ſhould deny it, let him look upon the
<hi>Abdomen</hi> and extream Parts, and his
Eyes are enough to convince him. Well
then the Serum being thus ſeparated (pray
obſerve) and the Maſs of Blood not
enough diluted; the oral Glands muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
be defrauded of their due Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
and conſequently Thirſt excited. But
ſtill you harp upon the ſame ſtring: Thoſe
Medicines which reſtore the Conſiſtence of
the Blood, cannot well be ſuppoſed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
it. Now <hi>Acids</hi> reſtore it; and
Steel in particular. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Steel
is of excellent Uſe, and a very great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative,
is not to be denied. But under
favour, tho you diſcourſe very ingeniouſly
of the Nature of Steel: Yet all you have
ſaid will not amount to a Proof of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>Acid.</hi> I am ſtill inclined to think
it is an <hi>Alkaly.</hi> For tho it does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it ſelf to be ſuch by its Colour, yet
it plainly does by its Effects, <hi>viz.</hi> its Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60930:36"/>
with <hi>Acids.</hi> If, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> you will needs
have it to be an <hi>Acid,</hi> why then one <hi>Acid</hi>
will ferment with another; and ſo one
<hi>Alkaly</hi> with another: wherefore, tho we
ſhould ſubſcribe to the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that
<hi>Alkalies</hi> are the Original of all Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
yet 'tis hard to exclude the Uſe of
them in general in Diſtempers. For ſome
<hi>Alkalies</hi> or other might be found out that
ſhould diſpute it with theſe offending <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies.</hi>
You are pleaſed to quote <hi>Beeker</hi>
for a Confirmation of the Acidity of Steel.

If I apprehend the Senſe of
the Author, this does not make ſo much
for you. But ſuppoſe it did, <hi>Beeker</hi>
was never reckon'd Infallible. And tho
<hi>Chalybs</hi> were an <hi>Acid,</hi> it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
becauſe one <hi>Acid</hi> will renew the
State of the Blood, that others will do ſo
too. But ſince we have ſo happily
fallen on this Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Maſs of Blood; let us ſee what
other Medicines beſides <hi>Chalybs</hi> are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
to this End. And here I ſuppoſe
your bitter Herbs may not be <hi>infimi ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellii.</hi>
'Tis needleſs to prove it; for
hardly any <hi>Phyſician</hi> but what has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
it. I do not believe you will
dare to ſay, there is any thing of an
<hi>Acid</hi> in theſe, ſince you know very well
that <hi>Alkaly</hi> may be extracted from moſt,
if not all of them. So that poor <hi>Alkaly</hi>
is effectual in ſome Caſes you ſee. But
then <hi>(you ſay) Oakbark, Biſtort,
Tormentile, Comfrey-roots</hi> and
others of that Tribe will reduce the Blood
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60930:37"/>
to Conſiſtence. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That they are
aſtringent I grant; whether they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Blood, or invigorate its depaupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Principles, I much queſtion. 'Tis
very rare to ſee them preſcribed in <hi>Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
Cackexies</hi> and the like Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
where the Blood is poor and low. They
are proper indeed in <hi>Fluxes</hi> by virtue of
their aſtringent Faculty; but then they
owe this Aſtringency to <hi>Acids.</hi> Whether
they do or not it matters not much. But
why may not this Quality be derived as well
from the Terreſtrious as the Salt Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of theſe Vegetables: Since <hi>Bol. Arm.
Terra Lemnia</hi> and other plain Earths
are very ſtiptick? I do not ſay theſe Earths
are ſo ſimple as to have no manner of Salt in
them, but ſurely they have very little <hi>Acid.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Remark.</hi> I am very glad you own
<hi>Alkalies</hi> to abound in <hi>Pluriſies</hi> and
<hi>Rheumatiſms,</hi> and other inflammatory
Diſtempers. Upon my work if this
be granted, I have gained a great
point; for to have put the World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60930:38"/>
a true way of Curing but one
ſingle Diſtemper, is what deſerves
no ſmall Honour. And for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of <hi>Dropſies,</hi> I do aſſure you I
have no reaſon to recede from what
I have ſaid upon that Subject; but
if you or any one elſe would favour
the World with as certain a Method
of curing a <hi>Confirmed Aſcites</hi> or <hi>Belly-Dropſie,</hi>
as I have done of curing
<hi>Rheumatiſms, Gouts,</hi> &amp;c. I may ſelf
would ſpare no pains to trumpet up
that Man's Fame, let him be who he
would: But this is a thing I am
afraid I ſhall never live to ſee effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
becauſe the <hi>Tone</hi> of the <hi>Parts
principally affected,</hi> is ſo deſtroyed and
ſpoiled, that it would be next door
to a <hi>Miracle</hi> to recover them. And
although you are pleaſed to charge
me with arguing unfairly, for attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
the Cauſe of <hi>Dropſies,</hi> in a
great meaſure, to proceed from a
deſtruction of the <hi>Tone</hi> of the <hi>Parts,</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60930:38"/>
becauſe I had not before in my Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies
of <hi>Diſtempers,</hi> taken ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
notice of that Matter: Well, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
I had before been deficient in
that point, I hope it is no Crime to
bring it in late, rather than not at
all. But I do aſſure you, I have
frequently taken notice of that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and do lay as great a ſtreſs upon
it as upon any one thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and I do ſtill inſiſt upon it,
that the great Thinneſs of the Blood
in <hi>Dropſies</hi> dos in great meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the great quantities of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids
taken into the Body, and the
ſmall quantity diſcharged, by reaſon
the Parts of it have loſt their Tone,
and therefore the <hi>Secretions</hi> not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be performed; a man that
drinks two Quarts in twenty four
hours, not being able to piſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
above four Ounces, <hi>perſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
alſo being greatly hindred upon
the ſame account. Now for want of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60930:39"/>
a due <hi>ſecretion</hi> by the <hi>excretory Veſſels,</hi>
the Blood is clogged with too great
a quantity of <hi>Serum;</hi> which <hi>Serum</hi>
being admitted into the <hi>Lumpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Veſſels,</hi> and being impregnated
with <hi>Alkaline Particles,</hi> cannot freely
paſs along theſe Veſſels by reaſon
of its <hi>Gelatinous</hi> quality, by which
means they are diſtended to a vaſt
Magnitude, and ſometimes broke;
and from the broken <hi>Lympheducts</hi> it
is, that ſo great a quantity of Liquor
is thrown into the Cavity of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi>
which diſtends it to ſuch a
bigneſs. But for all this great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
that is thrown into the <hi>Abdomen,</hi>
the Blood is ſtill loaded with three
parts in four more of <hi>Serum</hi> thatn
it ought to be, and therefore the
<hi>Oral Glands</hi> cannot want ſufficient
Moiſture. But here lies the thing,
the Matter that in a ſtate of health is
ſeparated by the <hi>Oral Glands,</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with a Noble <hi>Volatile Acid,</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60930:39"/>
as does manifeſtly appear. But in
this Caſe the ſaid <hi>Acid</hi> is almoſt, if
not totally deſtroyed, and the ſaid
<hi>Lympha</hi> impregnated with <hi>Alkaly,</hi>
which is the occaſion of the great
Thirſt that attends <hi>Hydropical People.</hi>
But ſince I have attributed an <hi>Acidity</hi>
to the <hi>Lympha</hi> in a ſtate of Health,
and yet aſſert that there is no ſuch
thing as a Pure <hi>Acid</hi> to be obtained
from the Blood either in a <hi>Morbid
State</hi> or in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Health,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inveloped in the <hi>Oily Particles,</hi> I
ſhall preſume, to avoid further <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,</hi>
to make a little excurſion
concerning the general uſe of the
<hi>Glands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall at preſent divide the <hi>Glands</hi>
into two kinds or ſorts, the firſt of
which ſeparate the <hi>Excrementitious
Particles</hi> from the <hi>Blood,</hi> and throw
them quite off by ſome proper <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctories,</hi>
ſuch are the <hi>Excretory
Glands</hi> of the <hi>Skin,</hi> the <hi>Glandulae Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:60930:40"/>
the <hi>Glands</hi> of the <hi>Liver,</hi> &amp;c. all
which do ſeparate an <hi>Alkaly</hi> from the
Blood, to be thrown off as <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and if by any accident theſe
<hi>Glands</hi> are made uncapable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
their office, ſo that the Blood
cannot be rid of its Excrements, why
then a Diſtemper of ſome kind or
other muſt neceſſarily follow. The
<hi>Second Kind</hi> do receive a Noble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
into them to be again mixed
with the Blood, or for other Uſes, of
univerſal Advantage to the whole
Body. The <hi>Glands</hi> of the Mouth do
ſeparate the thin Juice impregnated
with a <hi>Volatile Acid,</hi> which Juice was
never deſigned by Nature to be
thrown away, as ſome <hi>Tobacco-takers</hi>
laviſhly do, but to impregnate our
Food as it is chewed in the Mouth,
and afterwards to diſſolve it in the
Stomach, and turn it into a Subſtance
fit for the Nutrition of our Bodies.
The other <hi>Receptory Glands,</hi> for ſo I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60930:40"/>
to call all thoſe which do not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Excrements from the Blood,
do, by the extraordinary providence
of Nature, receive into them that
fine Subſtance which is ſuperfluous
in the nouriſhing of the Parts, and
by means of the <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> in a
gentle and eaſie courſe, do convey
it to the <hi>Ductus Thorachicus,</hi> where it
is mixed with the Chyle, juſt before
it is admitted into the Blood; and
that this <hi>Lympha</hi> is a <hi>Mild Acid</hi> has
already been owned by many. So
that here you ſee, if there be any
<hi>Acid</hi> in the <hi>Body</hi> ſuperfluous, Nature
is very provident in the preſervation
of it, and equally careful in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off the ſuperfluous <hi>Alkaly</hi> by a
multitude of <hi>Emunctories</hi> or <hi>Excretory
Glands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Uſe of the <hi>Glands,</hi> a great
many <hi>Phaenomena</hi> concerning <hi>Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi>
and other Diſtempers, may
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60930:41"/>
with eaſe be ſolved. In <hi>Dropſies,</hi> for
inſtance, as is before obſerved, the
<hi>Excretory Glands</hi> not being able to
perform their Office, the <hi>Excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Alkaly,</hi> together with its <hi>Watry
Vehicle,</hi> is detained in the Body; by
which means, altho the Body may
increaſe in bulk, yet none of the
Parts receive their due Nouriſhment;
and the <hi>Tone</hi> of the whole being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed
and ſpoiled, the <hi>Receptory
Glands</hi> forget their duty alſo, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of receiving into them a pure
acidulated <hi>Serum</hi> only, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to let paſs ſome Alkalized Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious
<hi>Serum,</hi> which makes
the whole of a kind of <hi>Gelatinous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence;</hi>
which not being able to paſs
along the Tracts of the <hi>Lympheducts,</hi>
diſtends them to that degree that it
cauſeth ſwellings in the Belly, and
<hi>Aedematous Tumors</hi> in the Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And <hi>Belly-Dropſies</hi> having for the moſt
part a <hi>Jaundice</hi> as their Forerunner, nay
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60930:41"/>
frequently goes along with them
through the whole courſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
is no ſmall Argument to
prove the Truth of what I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
taken notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome
of the <hi>Excretory Glands</hi> have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in their duty, by which
means the whole Body is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with this <hi>Yellow Die,</hi> and the
whole <hi>Aeconomy</hi> put out of order:
And that the Yellowneſs of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
does proceed from a redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
of <hi>Bile,</hi> no body denies; and
that <hi>Bile</hi> is an <hi>Alkaly</hi> you don't diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own.
But now come we to the
Curative part of this <hi>Damnable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper;</hi>
which altho it be rarely to
be performed in a <hi>confirmed State,</hi> yet
in the beginning, nay after it has
made ſome progreſs, is frequently
to be done, and that as effectually
by <hi>Calibiats</hi> and <hi>Bitters</hi> as by any ſort
of Medicines. But here for want
of making Experiments, (by which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60930:42"/>
means only we are capable of arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to any ſort of Certainty in
the knowledg of things) you ſay
that Steel and the bitter Herbs are <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies,</hi>
and the reaſons you give for it
are, becauſe Steel being mixed with
<hi>Acids</hi> will cauſe an <hi>Efferveſcence,</hi> and
the bitter Herbs, after burning, do
afford a fixt <hi>Alkaly.</hi> Solid Reaſons
indeed! For all <hi>Sulphurs</hi> being mixt
with <hi>Acids</hi> will cauſe an <hi>Efferveſcency,</hi>
nay ſome of them take Fire; and
that all <hi>Metals</hi> are full of <hi>Sulphur</hi> is
paſt diſpute; and from the Aſhes of
all Plants, even <hi>Sorrel</hi> it ſelf, may
be extracted a fixt <hi>Alkaly;</hi> therefore
by this way of arguing, <hi>Sulphur</hi> muſt
be an <hi>Alkaly,</hi> and ſo muſt <hi>Sorrel</hi> alſo.
But the manner of the Production
of Volatile and Fixt <hi>Alkalies</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been ſpoken to before, I ſhall
ſay no more to that Matter. I ſhall
touch a little upon what I take to be
the General Principles of mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60930:42"/>
not that all theſe Principles are
to be ſeparated from all Bodies, ſome
containing all, ſome two, three or
four of them; and according to the
different mixture of them, different
Subſtances are produced. <hi>Acidum</hi>
and <hi>Sulphur</hi> I take to be the <hi>Vital
Active Principles</hi> in <hi>Bodies, Alkaly</hi> the
<hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Corruption, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Earth</hi> the two <hi>Paſſive Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
From theſe <hi>five Principles</hi> I think
I can more eaſily account for the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Phenomena</hi> in <hi>Natural Bodies,</hi> than
from the old Five of <hi>Salt, Sulphur</hi> and
<hi>Mercury, Water</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> or from
any other <hi>Principles</hi> that have yet
been broacht in the World. I have
only mentioned this matter to let
you know the Principles I go upon,
but ſhall leave the further proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it to another opportunity. But
to return to the buſineſs of <hi>Steel</hi> and
<hi>Bitters;</hi> as for <hi>Steel,</hi> I have ſaid ſo
much already concerening that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60930:43"/>
places, that I ſhall not here trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my ſelf nor you any more about it.
But if we can cure Diſtempers with
it, it is no matter tho one takes it for
an <hi>Alkaly,</hi> and the other for an <hi>Acid;</hi>
nay I can aſſure you, that if you will
but black your Fingers a little with
Charcoal, you will find it to be a
ſulphureous <hi>Acid.</hi> As for <hi>Bitters,</hi> I
will be bound to lay a good Wager
with you, that if you put a pound of
<hi>Centaury</hi> or <hi>Wormwood</hi> dried into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
and diſtil it with an eaſie Fire
till all be come off that will, and
afterwards calcine the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi>
and extract the fixt <hi>Alkaly</hi> from the
Aſhes, if you don't find a treble or
much greater proportion of <hi>Acid</hi> to
that of <hi>Alkaly,</hi> to be produced from
theſe moſt bitter Plants, I will be a
loſer; and I aſſure you I will lay
you or any one elſe a good ſum
upon this matter. But further, if
bitterneſs did proceed from a predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60930:43"/>
of <hi>Alkaly</hi> in any Body,
why then a man would ſuppoſe the
more this Body were impregnated
with <hi>Alkaly,</hi> the bitterer it would be:
but upon my word I have frequently
experienced the contrary. For when
I was a Champion for <hi>Alkalious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines</hi>
(as I am not aſhamed to own
I once was) I have extracted a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
from <hi>Mirrh, Alloes</hi> and <hi>Saffron,</hi>
with well rectified Spirit of <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi>
hoping to do great Feats
with it. Now after I had digeſted
them together for ten or twelve
days in a gentle Sand-Heat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of having the Tincture bitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
than the <hi>Mirrh</hi> and <hi>Alloes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were, I have always found it
almoſt, if not altogether, without
any bitterneſs at all in it. Nay after
a longer digeſtion it has been almoſt
perfectly ſweet. However I lay not
any great ſtreſs upon Taſts, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
in them being one of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60930:44"/>
ſpecifick differences the Great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
hath planted in things, of which
we have as yet but very little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.
A few degrees of predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
of any of the Principles,
cauſe very great alterations in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
both as to <hi>Colour, Smell</hi> and <hi>Taſt;</hi>
and for ought I know, a knowledg
of theſe <hi>Minute Circumſtances</hi> is what
we have no poſſibility of arriving to
in this World. But one word more
concerning <hi>Bitters,</hi> becauſe you will
account them <hi>Alkalies,</hi> and lay ſo
great a ſtreſs upon them. <hi>Vitriol</hi> of
<hi>Silver</hi> is the moſt exalted Bitter I
know, and a Celebrated Medicine in
the Cure of <hi>Dropſies,</hi> but yet is no
<hi>Alkaly;</hi> and after you have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, I believe you won't term it ſo.
What you ſay to <hi>Acids</hi> fuſing the
Blood, it is directly contrary to what
our Predeceſſors have aſſerted, who
attributed its coagulation to <hi>Acids,</hi>
and to what you your ſelf ſay a little
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60930:44"/>
after. But what I attribute to <hi>Acids</hi>
in general is this, that they keep
the Blood in its due ſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> keep
the <hi>Fibrous</hi> and <hi>Globulous Parts</hi> in their
due <hi>Texture,</hi> and keep the <hi>Serum fluid,</hi>
by which means the whole Maſs is
capable of performing its proper Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
without being liable to <hi>Stagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
and alſo by confirming and
ſtrengthning the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts,
they greatly contribute to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
end, <hi>viz.</hi> preventing <hi>Stagnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and promoting the <hi>Secretions.</hi>
As for what you ſay concerning the
giving of <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> alone, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
aſſent to it, that it will make
mad work. But I hope you cannot
charge me with any ſuch <hi>mad Practice.</hi>
When People are cold, they natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
run to the Fire for warmth, but
none but mad Perſons will put their
hands into it; and altho Culinary
Fire, if People are ſo imprudent as to
throw themſelves into it, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60930:45"/>
and deſtroy them, yet a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
uſe of it is a very great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to Humane Life; and were it
not for Fire the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> and other
<hi>Northern People</hi> would have but a
very ſad time on't during the courſe
of their long <hi>Winters:</hi> ſo it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> altho given
alone it will cauſe Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
yet being diluted in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Vehicles,</hi> and given in very large
quantities, will in many caſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
as noble Effects as any one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
now known. It is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Phyſician to conſider the
Nature and Conſtitution of his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in all reſpects, and to proportion
the Doſes of Medicines according to
what their Stomachs and Natures
will bear. I hope there was never
any one ſo wild, becauſe <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi>
is recommended in <hi>Fevers,</hi> as to
give it alone without a <hi>Vehicle.</hi> But
what you charge upon <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:60930:45"/>
may be retorted upon moſt other
Medicines of an active Nature. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
an ounce of <hi>Calamelanos</hi> given
at once to a Man will ſcarce fail of
killing him, I ſuppoſe that don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you from giving a few grains of
it to a young Child. An ounce of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin</hi>
of <hi>Jallup</hi> will kill a Plow-man,
and yet a few grains may with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be given to a very tender conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
I could retort a great many
things of this kind upon you, were
it not altogether needleſs: for that
Phyſician that gives a Medicine
without firſt conſidering it in all its
circumſtances, deſerves to be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the ſociety of Mankind; and
he that knows moſt, is generally
moſt cautious: and altho I am ſo
clamour'd at by my Brethren, yet I
can boldly ſay, that the greateſt ſlips

            <p>I hope what I have ſaid is ſufficient
to remove that Mighty Objection
about the hazard of giving Oyl of
<hi>Vitriol</hi> alone: But I might have ſpared
my ſelf this trouble, for I am almoſt
poſitive, that there is not any <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> of any buſineſs,
tho never ſo great an aſſertor of the
uſefulneſs of <hi>Alkalies,</hi> who has not
ſome time or other made uſe of even
Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> that dangerous <hi>Acid:</hi>
but how they can anſwer for it I
cannot tell: for if <hi>Acids</hi> are the cauſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60930:49"/>
of Diſeaſes, how they dare with
a good Conſcience give even the
moſt temperate <hi>Acids</hi> to their Patients,
I cannot underſtand; and I am ſure
they themſelves can give no reaſon
for it. But I believe it is from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of Conſcience that nothing is
to be done without them. Again,
if <hi>Acids</hi> were ſo pernicious to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as ſome People would make us
believe, I wonder that the College
of Phyſicians don't unanimouſly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
the Parliament to prohibit the
Importation of <hi>Oranges</hi> in ſuch vaſt
quantities as we now have 'em. You
greatly harp upon that ſtring, that
<hi>Acids</hi> held in the Mouth won't
quench the violent Thirſt of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical
People; to which I anſwer,
that it is impoſſible when the
whole Maſs of Blood and <hi>Lympha</hi>
are contaminated with <hi>Alkalious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi>
that the waſhing the Mouth
only with <hi>Acids</hi> ſhould take away
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60930:50"/>
the Thirſt, when the parts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
waſhed with the contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
Juices, and ſo, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
the particles of the <hi>Acid</hi> muſt
be ſoon <hi>obtunded.</hi> But however
nothing is more grateful or delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to an <hi>Hydropical Perſon,</hi> than a
ſlice of <hi>Lemon</hi> or any ſuch thing.
Common Salt I allow will excite
Thirſt, but not <hi>quatenus Acid,</hi> for
Spirit of Salt will take it off as ſoon
as any thing. But, Sir, I do aſſure
you I have ſtumbled more at this
one thing, <hi>viz. Common Salt's exciting
Thriſt,</hi> than at any thing elſe beſides,
and therefore have ſpared no coſt in
making <hi>Experiments</hi> to find out the
reaſon of it; at laſt, after much <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>
and <hi>ſweat,</hi> I found there was no
<hi>Salt</hi> but what had more or leſs of a
damn'd thing call'd <hi>Bittern</hi> mixt
with it, of which you may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
inform'd at any Salt Works;
now this <hi>Bittern</hi> is the moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60930:50"/>
fixt <hi>Alkaly</hi> in Nature; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
it be inconſiderable in quantity
in reſpect of the <hi>Acid</hi> the Salt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
yet it will fix it ſelf upon the
parts after the <hi>Acid</hi> of the Salt is all
diſſolved, and ſo excite Thirſt. Of
this <hi>Bittern</hi> you may expect more in
another place; for had I not had a
deſign to pleaſe and ſatisfie you, I
would not at all have taken notice
of it here; becauſe the allaying of
violent. Thirſts I only attribute to
manifeſt <hi>Acids,</hi> and common Salt
not being one of that ſort, it matters
not whether it will allay Thirſt or
not. I love not repetitions, but
however for once I ſhall be guilty of
it. You may remember that in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place I tell you, that thoſe
things which by Diſtillation afford a
greater quantity of <hi>Acid</hi> ſubſtances,
than of <hi>Alkalious</hi> ones, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<hi>Acids &amp; vice verſa;</hi> now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt affords nineteen parts in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60930:51"/>
twenty more of <hi>Acid</hi> than of <hi>Alkaly,</hi>
therefore is an <hi>Acid:</hi> but before Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation
the <hi>Acid</hi> is ſo <hi>inveloped,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
it contains ſo much of it, that
it is not at all diſcernable to the Taſt.
I believe no one that has blackt his
Fingers will deny <hi>Guaiacum</hi> to be an
<hi>Acid,</hi> but at the ſame time I believe
it was never preſcribed to allay
Thirſt. Things, tho of the ſame
Tribe, are differently to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
according as they are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
ſpecificated by Nature. It is
not a certainty of the knowledg
whether <hi>Acids</hi> or <hi>Alkalies</hi> are the
Cauſes of Diſeaſes, will preſently
make a man a Phyſician, tho it will
go a great way towards it, but a
thorow knowledg of the different
ſpecifications of Nature muſt alſo
concur.</p>
            <p>You charge me with contradicting
my ſelf, and after that you ſhould
have been ſure to have avoided any
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60930:51"/>
ſuch thing your ſelf; but however
in one place you ſay, that Oyl of
<hi>Vitriol</hi> diſſolves the Blood, and in
another that it coagulates it; but I
ſhall take no advantage of this ſlip,
but ſhall conclude my Remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Paragraph, I having already
ſpun them out to too great a
length.</p>
            <p>The next Paragraph is too long
to tranſcribe, and there being little
material in it, I ſhall only make
ſome general Remarks upon what
I find worthy taking notice of.</p>
            <p>You firſt of all charge me with
<hi>ſaying,</hi> that neither too much nor
too little <hi>Acid</hi> muſt be given, which
is the ſum of a Page or two, <hi>viz.</hi>
19, and 20. In anſwer to which,
I do aſſure you, that no <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> need
be aſhamed to employ his time in
conſidering the due proportions of
things requiſite to accompliſh the
thing he undertakes. Now in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60930:52"/>
he that doth not underſtand the
true Rules of Proportion, deſerves
not the Name of a Phyſician. He
that will preſcribe an Ounce of
<hi>Jallap</hi> inſtead of a Dram deſerves to
be hang'd; and who but a mad man
will give a Pound of Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi>
when forty Drops in a Pint of Water
is all that is deſired? But, Sir, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Phyſicians have a wonderful
Director in relation to Manifeſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,</hi>
and indeed to every thing elſe,
that is the Stomach, which is a nice
judger of things; that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to her, ſhe receiving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
with pleaſure, that which is
diſagreeable ſhe rejecting and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring.
But however ſhe muſt not
be overloaded with thoſe things in
which ſhe taketh the greateſt delight.
Now Manifeſt <hi>Acids</hi> are things ſhe as
much or more covets and delights in
than in any thing beſides; but when
ſhe hath enough to ſupply her wants
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60930:52"/>
ſhe gives ſufficient item of it; and
if the Stomach be rightly conſulted,
it is impoſſible the Blood ſhould be
overcharged with them; but if at
any time People are not ſufficiently
cautious of that matter, but load the
Stomach with more manifeſt <hi>Acids</hi>
than the Body hath occaſion for,
ſhe won't fail of rejecting them
by Vomit: this Matter may at any
time be ſafely experimented by an
over-large draught of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> in
any Caſe where the Body hath no
need of it, or at leaſt in ſo great a
quantity at a time; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
I tell you that the Blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſuperabound with <hi>Acids,</hi> as it's
plain in fact it doth not, neither in a
<hi>Morbid</hi> nor <hi>Healthy State,</hi> becauſe the
Stomach will not receive or retain
more than it hath occaſion for; but
altho it cannot overdo, yet it is
very frequently defective in convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſufficient quantity into it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60930:53"/>
through its own fault, or the
fault of the Phyſician who forbids
the uſe of them, and ſo the whole
Body ſuffers damage. How gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
will the poor Stomach embrace
the Juice of an <hi>Orange,</hi> or the
like, in a <hi>Fever?</hi> and how ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
will ſhe reject and abhor any
thing of a contrary nature? nay the
uſefulneſs of <hi>Acids</hi> is ſo evident and
extenſive, that it is almoſt a ſhame
they ſhould now want a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
after there has, for ſo many
years together, been ſo great a noiſe
made about <hi>Experimental Philoſophy,</hi>
and even publick Societies, in many
Nations, erected on purpoſe to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
it. But to return from
whence we left off; I am apt to
believe that if you take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advice, you will ſcarce be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of an Error in the giving of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<hi>Acids, viz.</hi> always give them
in ſuch quantities as the Stomach will
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60930:53"/>
receive them with pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and never refuſe them when
the Stomach earneſtly craves them;
this is the method I obſerve at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and believe I ſhall never have
occaſion to recede from. I confeſs
it may be lawful ſometimes in very
extraordinary caſes to ſtrain a point
beyond what Nature craves, but
herein if the thing ſhould chance
to be overdone, all the damage that
can enſue is occaſioning a puke or
two; this you may take from my
conſtant experience, and believe me
I would not willingly impoſe upon
you and the World: But in general,
it is always neceſſary for us Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
who are, or at leaſt ſhould
be, only Natures Servants, ſtrictly
to obſerve her Neceſſities, and not
to outrun her Dictates.</p>
            <p>Without making the leaſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
to convince me of being in
an error, you go on to range <hi>Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafras</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:60930:54"/>
amongſt the number of <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;</hi>
but when, from Experience, I
do aſſure you that <hi>Saſſafras</hi> is an
<hi>inveloped Acid,</hi> I think you ought not
to trouble me and the World with
conjectures; and were it not that
I value and reſpect you, I would
not ſo much as take the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of your Conjectures. As for
the remaining part of this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
I think I have no occaſion
to take notice of it, I having ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
anſwered every thing that
looks like an Objection in it in my
former Remarks; and therefore
ſhall, in your own words, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that if I have any where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
my ſelf indecently, I hope you
won't attribute it to rudeneſs or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect:
for I do aſſure you, I
think you a Bleſſing to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
wherein you live, and don't
doubt but that I ſhall ſee you an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to our Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:60930:54"/>
I ſhould have concluded, but that
you alſo begin again; and that I
may not be unmannerly, I ſhall for
once keep you company to the end
of your Journy; but do not deſign
any more to trouble the World with
Diſputes, but if any thing more
of that Nature offers it ſelf, worth
my taking notice of, it ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in ſome Practical Diſcourſe.
And ſo paſs we on to your Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Firſt Part of my <hi>Eſſay</hi>
of <hi>Alkaly</hi> and <hi>Acid.</hi> And firſt,</p>
            <div type="subpart">

               <head>OF THE
Small Pox.</head>
               <p>WHAT I think worthy
taking notice of at preſent
in your Reflections upon this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is this, That you honeſtly and
fairly allow the giving of <hi>Acids</hi> in
a <hi>Flux Pox,</hi> the only <hi>dangerous one,</hi>
and from which our Patients are in
moſt danger: but in <hi>Benign Poxes</hi>
you commend me for doing nothing,
and indeed I ſhall always continue
ſo to do where my Patients have
no occaſion for Medicines. I am a
Friend to <hi>Rad. Serpentariae Virg.</hi> as
well as you, in all thoſe Caſes
where there is an occaſion for <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks;</hi>
that and <hi>Saffron</hi> being as Noble
Cordials, as perhaps, are at all
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60930:55"/>
known; yet they muſt never be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
but with due caution and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection.
But I am a profeſſed
and declared Enemy to <hi>Pul. e Chelis,</hi>
and all things of that kind. And
once again I do aſſure you, that
<hi>Rad. Serpentar.</hi> upon diſtillation will
appear to be a <hi>ſulphureous Acid;</hi> and
in caſes where the <hi>Pox</hi> doth not
come out kindly, and the Pulſe is
low, an infuſion of that Root in
<hi>Vinegar,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing, will do
very good feats. I confeſs the <hi>Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taceous
Pouders</hi> in <hi>Benign Poxes,</hi> are
frequently given without any evil
conſequence; but the reaſon is, that
the Patients are generally in ſo good
a condition, and have ſo much
ſtrength of Nature to ſupport them,
that it is almoſt impoſſible to kill
them; but what fatal work they
make in <hi>Flux Poxes,</hi> or any other
of a malignant kind, is but too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſeen. Here obſerve the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60930:56"/>
between your Method and
mine, even by your own confeſſion.
Mine is principally ſerviceable in
dangerous Caſes, Yours in thoſe
wherein there is no danger. Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, you may ſtill keep your
own Method to your ſelf, and I
will ſtick to that which will ſtand
me in ſtead in hazardous Caſes,
and even only ſtand by and look

no occaſion for my help. You at
laſt blame me for giving <hi>Syrupus e

Pox;</hi> but ſurely you are overhaſty
in blaming me upon that ſcore, for
of all men in the World I deſerve
leaſt to be blamed for tampering too
much with <hi>Opiats.</hi> If you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
the occaſion of my preſcribing
<hi>Diacodium</hi> in the beginning of the
<hi>Small Pox,</hi> was this, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
Stomach be overcharged or
clogged with viſcous Matter, I then
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60930:56"/>
preſcribe an eaſie Vomit; and after
the operation of the Vomit is over,
to allay the hurry and diſorder occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by it, I preſcribe a little <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codium,</hi>
but never proſecute it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as ſome people fatally do. I
have not time, elſe I would remark
upon you Line by Line; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken notice of what is materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
I ſhall let fall the reſt, and leave
you and your Friends to make the
beſt of it. But cannot forbear to
aſſure you, that two or three of my
greateſt Enemies in this Town, have
of late preſcribed <hi>Acids</hi> plentifully to
their Patients in the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and
yet at the ſame time have railed at
me for ſo doing: whether this be like
Gentlemen, I leave the World to
judg.</p>

I ſhall not here trouble my ſelf nor

Nay if we can but once agree in the

               <head>OF
Conſumptions.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Conſumption</hi> is a Diſtemper, the
progreſs of which in this our
Iſland, I have oftentimes heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed.
It is likewiſe a Diſtemper
that moſt of my Predeceſſors (as I
have before obſerved) have died of,
even in the Prime of their Ages; and
is alſo what I have more cauſe to be
afraid of than any thing elſe beſides;
upon which ſcore I have ſpent a great
many days and nights in the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Nature and Cauſe of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60930:59"/>
this <hi>Fatal Diſtemper,</hi> which deprived
me of the beſt of Fathers, whilſt I
was but a Child, and has alſo rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
me of ſome other of my beſt
Friends. Now the reaſon why I
have not hitherto ſpoken ſo much
about it, as of other Diſtempers, is,
becauſe I have been ſome years in
collecting Obſervations in order to
the Writing a particular Tract of
<hi>Conſumptions,</hi> and was unwilling to
anticipate what I had to ſay upon ſo
weighty a Subject, tho I was able
to ſay as much concerning that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as of any Diſeaſe about which
I have treated. Nay, I am apt to
believe, that I may without Vanity
ſay, that I have cured more true <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions</hi>
in the ſpace of one Year
laſt paſt, than any one Phyſician in
<hi>England</hi> has done, and that by the
means of <hi>Acids</hi> of one ſort or other,
<hi>viz.</hi> either Manifeſt or Inveloped
ones; an ample account of which,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60930:59"/>
as ſoon as my buſineſs will permit,
I deſign to make publick. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I ſhall ſpend a little time in
remarking upon what you have ſaid.
You allow <hi>Acids</hi> to be proper and
beneficial in thoſe <hi>Conſumptions</hi> not
attended with a <hi>Catarrh,</hi> which is a
conceſſion which very few Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
beſides will give their aſſent to;
or at leaſt if they will, they are but
very lately come over. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that the main thing you
harp upon, is, that manifeſt <hi>Acids</hi>
are not proper to be uſed in <hi>Catarrhs;</hi>
I ſhall a little take that thing into
my conſideration. Now although
a <hi>Catarrh</hi> will cauſe a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> or
waſting of the Parts of the Body,
yet a <hi>Catarrh</hi> is not what we in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
commonly call a <hi>Conſumption;</hi>
the Diſtemper called <hi>Tabes Anglicana,</hi>
or the <hi>Engliſh Conſumption,</hi> proceeding
from an <hi>ulceration</hi> of the <hi>Lungs:</hi> and
in theſe caſes for the moſt part we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60930:60"/>
have no <hi>Catarrh,</hi> though ſometimes
it doth attend them; but one of
the principal Symptoms of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
is the diſcharge of a great
quantity of tough, yellow and green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<hi>Pus,</hi> in which caſes you allow
<hi>Acids</hi> to be proper: nay although
there be a <hi>Catarrh</hi> attending them,
yet it is not from that that we
make our fatal Prognoſticks, but
from the good or evil nature
and quantities of the aforeſaid <hi>Pus,</hi>
with ſome other Symptoms not
neceſſary here to enumerate. Nay
it is not uncommon for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive
People to bring up from
their Lungs by Coughing, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Chalk Stones</hi> as ever were found in
the joints of Perſons ſeverely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the <hi>Gout;</hi> which Chalk
I am ſure was never the Daughter
of an <hi>Acid.</hi> But however not to
inſiſt any longer upon this matter
at this time, it not being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60930:60"/>
place for it, I ſhall return to the
buſineſs of <hi>Catarrhs.</hi> I have before
taken notice, and as you your ſelf
here own, that the <hi>Saliva</hi> is a noble
<hi>Acid,</hi> and conveyed to the Mouth
for a moſt noble purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to be
mixed with the Food in chewing, and
afterwards in the Stomach, to turn
it into a ſubſtance fit for the nutrition
of our Bodies. Now if on any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the <hi>Glands</hi> of the <hi>Pharynx,</hi> and
other <hi>Glands</hi> about the Mouth are
over-relaxed, that they cannot retain
the <hi>Lympha</hi> in their proper recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
but let it fall continually from
them, being what we call a <hi>Catarrh,</hi>
or defluxion, this muſt inevitably
cauſe a tickling Cough, not becauſe
it is an <hi>Acid,</hi> for even a defluxion
of the moſt ſimple Water would
produce the ſame effect; but the
Body being continually robbed of
this moſt noble Juice, cannot fail
of being waſted and decayed by it.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60930:61"/>
And that the cauſe of a ſimple <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh</hi>
doth proceed from a relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the texture of the <hi>Glands</hi> only,
and not from the <hi>Lympha</hi> contained
in, and continually brought to them
being over-acid, the following
eaſy Cure is ſufficient to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<hi>viz.</hi> Let ſome <hi>Maſtick</hi> and
<hi>Olybanum</hi> be made into <hi>impalpable
powder,</hi> and with a long Quill or a
hollow Inſtrument made on purpoſe,
let it be blown upon the <hi>Larinx</hi> at
night going to Bed; the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of which for ſome Nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
will frequently do wonders
in the cure of <hi>Catarrhs.</hi> I confeſs
this was none of my own contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
but was communicated to
me by my worthy Friend Dr. <hi>Jones,</hi>
who is a man of the moſt happy
invention that ever I met with. Now
the only deſign in the uſing of this
Pouder is, that being immediately
conveyed to the Parts affected, it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60930:61"/>
ſhould cauſe them to contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or regain their <hi>Tone,</hi> and of
conſequence the <hi>Catarrh</hi> will ceaſe.
This is not all that I have to ſay
concerning <hi>Catarrhs,</hi> but I think is as
much as is neceſſary at this time.
You tell a famous Story of a Perſon
that had a <hi>Catarrh</hi> brought upon him
by the over-plentiful uſe of <hi>Sevil</hi>
Oranges; but are ſo deficient in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
ſeveral circumſtances that are
neceſſary to be known upon ſuch an
occaſion, that if I have not already
ſaid enough to ſolve this difficulty,
I ſhall leave you to make your beſt
advantage of it; for I am ſo tired
that I can go no further. And I do
aſſure you it ſhall be the laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial
Diſcourſe that ever I will
write; for if ever I meet with any
Objections againſt my <hi>Hypotheſis</hi>
worth taking notice of, I ſhall make
it my buſineſs to clear my ſelf from
them as well as I can, in thoſe Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60930:62"/>
Diſcourſes that I deſign (God
willing) hereafter to publiſh. I
confeſs I am over head and ears in
debt to the Publick, having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſeveral things which many have
expected ſhould have come abroad
long before this time, and indeed
I deſigned they ſhould; but ſeveral
unexpected Accidents have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened,
which have put me by, and
hindred me in my undertakings,
yet in due time I will endeavour
to fulfil what I have promiſed. I
ſhall conclude with aſſuring you,
that I am now ſo abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the truth of my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi>
that I am ſure it is not in the power
of any one to overthrow it; tho
at the ſame time I muſt own that I
may have been deficient in ſome
circumſtances relating to the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it; but time and further
obſervation, I hope, will clear all
thoſe things. Thus wiſhing you to

            <p>DR. <hi>Coward</hi> took an occaſion to
make ſome wonderful Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
upon me and my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> in
order to recommend a Medicine of
his own invention to the World. This
Medicine, which he calls <hi>Tinctura Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis,</hi>
is as Noble in its Nature, as the
Author is Generous and Great in his
Temper. I can aſſure the World it
is nothing elſe but the moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
kind of <hi>Sal Volatile Oleoſum</hi> that
ever I ſaw; and were it not that I
am unwilling to expoſe a Member
of the <hi>College,</hi> I would print the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
which was communicated to
me by one that has been imployed
by him to prepare it. The Doctor
cannot but own that I am more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
to him than he has been to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60930:63"/>
me, in that I have not publiſhed the
Story relating to Mr. <hi>Bat</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Lord</hi> alſo. But ſuch poor Enemies
as him and <hi>Lee,</hi> are rather to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
than any thing elſe. However,
<hi>Sal volatile Oleoſum,</hi> being a Medicine
in great vogue with almoſt all other
Phyſicians, I ſhall preſume to make
ſome few reflections upon the main
ingredient in it, which is the <hi>Volatile
Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi> Now
every body knows that the <hi>Volatile
Spirit,</hi> or ſalt of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> are
little elſe but the <hi>Volatile Spirit</hi> or <hi>Salt</hi>
of <hi>Urin,</hi> which at beſt is no more
than an Excrement of our Bodies.
But however, there is ſomething more
that deſerves our taking notice of, in
order to deter us from the uſe of this
Medicine, which is now ſo much in
faſhion, to the no ſmall detriment
of many. The <hi>Salt Armoniack,</hi> from
which the <hi>Volatile Spirit</hi> or <hi>Salt</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
is a Compoſition of <hi>Urine,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60930:64"/>
Soot</hi> and <hi>Sea-Salt;</hi> and by the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a <hi>fixt Alkalizate Salt</hi> or <hi>Quick-lime</hi>
(which is the uſual method in
making <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack)</hi>
the <hi>Acid</hi> of the <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> is
ſo intangled, that it readily lets go
from it the <hi>Volatile Spirit</hi> or <hi>Salt</hi> of the
<hi>Urine</hi> and <hi>Soot;</hi> but that of the <hi>Soot</hi> is
very inconſiderable in quantity to
that of the <hi>Urine.</hi> Now the <hi>Urine</hi>
made uſe of for the aforeſaid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
is generally procured from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Houſes, which is a jumble of all
together, <hi>viz.</hi> of People labouring
under all kinds of Habitual Diſeaſes,
as <hi>Pox, Gout, Scurvy, Scrubbado,</hi> &amp;c.
Now there is ſcarce a Diſeaſe attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man's Body, but ſome of the
Morbifick Particles are imparted to
the <hi>Urine;</hi> and if the <hi>Urine</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
partake of them, the Spirit and
Salt muſt do ſo in a more eminent
degree; ſo that, I think, a neceſſary
conſequence of giving ſuch a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60930:64"/>
muſt be the ſowing the Seeds
of Diſeaſes in Mens Bodies. And I
believe in my Conſcience that one
great reaſon of the late frequency of
ſome Tyrannical Diſeaſes, more
than heretofore was wont to be, has
proceeded from the exorbitant uſe of
Spirit and Salt of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> and
thoſe other things of which they are
prime ingredients. Now I deſire
that our Ladies, who are ſubject to
Hiſterical Diſtempers, would well
conſider this matter, becauſe they
are generally armed with it, to fright
away that Diſtemper, of which I am
afraid it is in great meaſure, if not
altogether the cauſe, or at leaſt of the
ſaline Particles of the ſame kind with
which their Blood abounds. I ſhall
ſay no more at this time, but hope
this further Hint, to deter people
from the uſe of <hi>Volatile Alkalious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
and <hi>Salts,</hi> of which the Spirit
and Salt of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> are moſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60930:65"/>
common, may not be unſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>I have made uſe of the words
Spirit and Salt of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> as
of things ſomewhat different, tho
indeed there is no real difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; that which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Spirit, being only a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Salt diluted in a proper
quantity of Phlegm: this is well
known to Phyſicians, but it is Very
probable that other Perſons into
whoſe hands theſe Papers may
chance to fall, might have laboured
under ſome difficulty about it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this Intimation.</p>
