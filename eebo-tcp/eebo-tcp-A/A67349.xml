            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reader need be told no more in commendation of these Poems, than that they are Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s: A Name that carries every thing in it, that's either Great or Graceful in Poetry. He was indeed the Parent of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Verse, and the first that shew'd us our Tongue had Beauty and Numbers in it. Our Language owes more to him than the <hi>French</hi> does to <hi>Cardinal Ri<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hlieu,</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:35838:5"/>
whole Academy. A Poet cannot think of him, without being in the same rapture <hi>Lucretius</hi> is in, when <hi>Epicurus</hi> comes in his way.
<q>
                  <l>Tu pater &amp; rerum inventor, Tu patria nobis</l>
                  <l>Suppeditas praecepta: Tuesque ex In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyte, chartis</l>
                  <l>Floriferis ut Apes in sallibus omnia li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</l>
                  <l>Omnia Nos itidem depascimur aurea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta:</l>
                  <l>Aurea, perpetua semper dignissima vita.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Tongue came into his hands, like a rough Diamond; he polish'd it first, and to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that all Artists since him have
<pb facs="tcp:35838:5"/>
admired the Workmanship, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending to mend it. <hi>Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi> and <hi>Carew,</hi> I must confess, wrote some few things smoothly enough, but as all they did in this kind was not very considerable, so 'twas a little later than the earliest pieces of Mr. <hi>Waller.</hi> He undoubtedly stands first in the List of Refiners, and for ought I know, last too; for I question whether in <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign, <hi>English</hi> did not come to its full perfection; and whether it has not had its <hi>Augustean Age,</hi> as well as the <hi>Latin.</hi> It seems to be already mix'd with Foreign Languages, as far as its purity will bear; and, as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
<pb facs="tcp:35838:6"/>
says of their <hi>Menstruums,</hi> to be quite sated with the Infusion. But Posterity will best judge of this—In the mean time, 'tis a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Reflection, that between what <hi>Spencer</hi> wrote last, and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> first, there should not be much above twenty years distance: and yet the one's Language, like the Money of that time, is as currant now as ever; whilst the other's words are like old Coyns, one must go to an Antiquary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their true meaning and value. Such advances may a great Genius make, when it undertakes any thing in earnest!</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35838:6"/>Some Painters will hit the chief Lines, and master strokes of a Face so truly, that through all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Age, the Picture shall still bear a Resemblance. This Art was Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s; he sought out, in this flowing Tongue of ours, what parts would last, and be of standing use and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament; and this he did so suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully, that his Language is now as fresh as it was at first setting out. Were we to judge barely by the wording, we could not know what was wrote at twenty, and what at fourscore. He complains indeed of a Tyde of words that comes in upon the <hi>English</hi> Poet,
<pb facs="tcp:35838:7"/>
o'reflows whate're he builds: but this was less his case than any mans, that ever wrote; and the mischief on't is, this very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint will last long enough to confute it self. For though <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> be mouldring Stone, as he tells us there; yet he has certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pick'd the best out of a bad Quarry.</p>
            <p>We are no less beholding to him for the new turn of Verse, which he brought in, and the improvement he made in our Numbers. Before his time, men Rhym'd indeed, and that was all: as for the harmony of measure, and that dance of words, which
<pb facs="tcp:35838:7"/>
good ears are so much pleas'd with, they knew nothing of it. Their <hi>Poetry</hi> then was made up almost entirely of monosyllables; which, when they come together in any cluster, are certainly the most harsh untunable things in the World. If any man doubts of this, let him read ten lines in <hi>Donne,</hi> and he'll be quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd. Besides, their Verses ran all into one another, and hung together, throughout a whole Copy, like the <hi>hook't Attoms,</hi> that compose a Body in <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> There was no distinction of parts, no regular stops, nothing for the Ear to rest upon—But as soon as
<pb facs="tcp:35838:8"/>
the Copy began, down it went, like a Larum, incessantly; and the Reader was sure to be out of Breath, before he got to the end of it. So that really Verse in those days was but down-right Prose, tagg'd with Rhymes. Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> remov'd all these faults, brought in more Polysyllables, and smoother measures; bound up his thoughts better, and in a cadence more agreeable to the nature of the Verse he wrote in: So that where-ever the natural stops of that were, he contriv'd the little breakings of his sense so as to fall in with 'em. And for that reason, since the stress of our Verse lyes
<pb facs="tcp:35838:8"/>
commonly upon the last Syllable, you'll hardly ever find him using a word of no force there. I would say if I were not afraid the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would think me too nice, that he commonly closes with Verbs, in which we know the Life of Language consists.</p>
            <p>Among other improvements, we may reckon that of <hi>his Rhymes.</hi> Which are always good, and very often the better for being <hi>new.</hi> He had a fine Ear, and knew how quickly that Sense was cloy'd by the same round of chiming Words still returning upon it. 'Tis a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided Case by the great Master of Writing. <hi>Quae sunt ampla &amp; Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chra,
<pb facs="tcp:35838:9"/>
diu placere possunt; quae lepida &amp; concinna,</hi> (amongst which Rhyme must, whether it will or no, take its place) <hi>cito satietate afficiunt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium sensum fastidiosissimum.</hi> This he understood very well, and therefore, to take off the danger of a Surfeit that way, strove to please by Variety, and new sounds. Had he carried this Observation (among others) as far as it would go, it must, methinks, have shown him the incurable fault of this jingling kind of Poetry, and have led his later judgment to blank Verse. But he continu'd an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Lover of Rhyme to the very last: 'Twas a Mistress, that
<pb facs="tcp:35838:9"/>
never appear'd unhandsome in his Eyes, and was courted by him long after <hi>Sacharissa</hi> was forsaken. He had rais'd it, and brought it to that perfection we now enjoy it in: And the Poet's temper (which has always a little vanity in it) would not suffer him ever to slight a thing, he had taken so much pains to adorn. My Lord <hi>Roscommon</hi> was more impartial: No man ever Rhym'd truer and evener than he; yet he is so just as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that 'tis but a Trifle, and to wish the Tyrant dethron'd, and blank Verse set up in its room. There is a third person, the living Glory of our English Poetry, who
<pb facs="tcp:35838:10"/>
has disclaim'd the use of it upon the Stage, tho no man ever employ'd it there so happily as He. 'Twas the strength of his Geinus that first brought it into credit in Plays; and 'tis the force of his Example that has thrown it out agen. In other kinds of writing it continues still; and will do so, till some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirit arises, that has leisure enough, and resolution to break the charm, and free us from the <hi>trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some bondage of Rhyming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> very well calls it, and has prov'd it as well, by what he has wrote in another way. But this is a thought for times at some distance; the present Age is a little
<pb facs="tcp:35838:10"/>
too Warlike: It may perhaps fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish out matter for a good Poem in the next, but 'twill hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage one now: Without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying, a Man may easily know, what sort of Lawrels are like to be in request?</p>
            <p>Whilst I am talking of Verse, I find my self, I don't know how, betray'd into a great deal of Prose. I intended no more than to put the Reader in mind, what respect was due to any thing that fell from the Pen of Mr. <hi>Waller.</hi> I have heard his last Printed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, which are added in the several Editions of his Poems, very slightly spoken of; but certainly they don't deserve it. They do indeed disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:35838:11"/>
themselves to be his last, and that's the worst we can say of 'em. He is there <hi>Iam Senior: Sed cruda Deo viridisque Senectus.</hi> The same censure perhaps will be past on the pieces of this second part. I shall not so far engage for 'em, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they are all equal to whatever he wrote in the vigour of his Youth. Yet they are so much of a piece with the rest, that any Man will at first sight know 'em to be Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s. Some of 'em were wrote very early, but not put in former Collections, for reasons obvious enough, but which are now ceas'd. The Play was alter'd, to please the Court: 'Tis not to be doubted who sat for
<pb facs="tcp:35838:11"/>
the two Brothers Characters. 'Twas agreeable to the sweetness of Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s Temper, to soften the rigour of the Tragedy, as he expresses it; but whether it be so agreeable to the Nature of Tragedy it self, to make every thing come off easily, I leave to the Criticks. In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, and Epilogue, there are a few Verses that he has made use of upon another occasion. But the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be pleased to allow that in him, that has been allowed so long in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Lucretius.</hi> Exact Writers dress up their thoughts so very well always, that when they have need of the same sense, they can't put it into other words, but it must be to its
<pb facs="tcp:35838:12"/>
prejudice, Care has been taken in this Book to get together every thing of Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s, that's not put into the former Collection; so that between both, the Reader may make the set compleat.</p>
            <p>It will perhaps be contended after all, that some of these ought not to have been Publish'd: And Mr. <hi>Cowly</hi>'s decision will be urg'd, that a neat Tomb of Marble is a better Monument, than a great Pile of Rubbish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It might be answer'd to this, that the Pictures and Poems of great Masters have been always valu'd, tho the last hand weren't put to 'em. And I believe none of those
<pb facs="tcp:35838:12"/>
Gentlemen that will make the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would refuse a Sketch of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s, or one of <hi>Titian</hi>'s draughts of the first sitting.</p>
            <p>I might tell 'em too, what care has been taken by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to preserve the Fragments of the Ancient Greek and Latin Poets: There has been thought to be a Divinity in what they said, and therefore the least pieces of it have been kept up and reverenc'd, like Religious reliques. And I am sure, take away the <hi>mille anni,</hi> and Impartial reasoning will tell us, there is as much due to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> as to the
<pb facs="tcp:35838:13"/>
most celebrated names of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>But to wave the dispute now of what <hi>ought</hi> to have been done; I can assure the Reader, what <hi>would</hi> have been had this Edition been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd. The following Poems were got abroad, and in a great many hands: It were vain to expect that amongst so many admirers of Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> they should not meet with one fond e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Publish 'em. They might have staid indeed, till by frequent transcriptions they had been corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extreamly, and jumbled together with things of another kind: But then they would have found their
<pb facs="tcp:35838:13"/>
way into the World. So 'twas thought a greater piece of kindness to the Author, to put 'em out; whilst they continue genuine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd; and such, as he himself, were he alive might own.</p>

               <l>This and <hi>Philaster</hi> have the lowdest fame,</l>
               <l>Great are their Faults, and glorious is their Flame.</l>
               <l>In both our <hi>English</hi> Genius is exprest;</l>

               <l>But faultless Writing is th' effect of Care.</l>

               <l>But as the present, so the last Age writ;</l>
               <l>In both we find like negligence and wit.</l>
               <l>Were we but less indulgent to our faults,</l>
               <l>And patience had to cultivate our thoughts.</l>
               <l>Our Muse would flourish, and a nobler rage</l>
               <l>Would honour this, than did the <hi>Graecian</hi> Stage.</l>
               <l>Thus says our Author, not content to see</l>
               <l>That Others write as carelesly as He,</l>
               <l>Tho he pretends not to make things compleat,</l>
               <l>Yet to please You, he'd have the Poets sweat.</l>
               <l>In this old Play, what's new we have exprest</l>
               <l>In rhiming Verse, distinguish'd from the rest:</l>
               <l>That, as the <hi>Roan</hi> its hasty ways does make,</l>

               <l>You may compare the former with the new.</l>
               <l>If we less rudely shall the Knot unty,</l>
               <l>Soften the rigour of the Tragedy:</l>
               <l>And yet preserve each persons character:</l>
               <l>Then to the Other, This you may prefer.</l>
               <l>'Tis left to You: the Boxes and the Pit,</l>
               <l>Are soveraign Iudges of this sort of Wit.</l>
               <l>In other things the knowing Artist may</l>
               <l>Iudge better than the people: but a Play,</l>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Commands for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these sticks into a Faggot, had sooner been obeyed, but intending to present you with my whole Vintage: I stayed till the latest Grapes were ripe, for here your Ladiship hath not only all I have done, but all I ever mean to do in this kind: Not but that I may defend the attempt I have made upon Poetry, by the examples (not to trouble you with History) of many Wise, and Worthy Persons of our own times: As Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> Sir <hi>Fra. Bacon,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> the ablest of his Country-men; and the former Pope,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35838:54"/>
who they say, instead of the triple Crown, wore sometimes the Poets Ivy, as an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perhaps, of lesser weight and trouble. But, Madam, these Nightingals sing only in the Spring, it was the diversion of their Youth. As Ladies learn to Sing and Play when they are Children, what they forget when they are Women. The resemblance holds further, for as you quit the Lute the sooner, because the posture is suspected to draw the body awry, so this is not always practised without some Villany to the mind, wresting it from present occasions, and accustoming us to a Still somewhat removed from common use. But that you may not think his case deplorable, who had made Verses, we are told, that <hi>Tully</hi> (the greatest Wit among the <hi>Romans</hi>) was once sick of this Disease, and yet recover'd so well, that of almost as bad a Poet as your Servant, he became the most perfect Orator in the World. So that not so much to have made Verses, as not to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35838:54"/>
give over in time, leaves a man without excuse; the former presenting us with an opportunity, at least, of doing Wisely; that is, to conceal those we have made; which I shall yet do, if my humble request may be of as much force with your Ladiship, as your Commands have been with me: Madam, I only whisper these in your ears; if you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish them, they are your own, and therefore as you apprehend the reproach of a Wit, and a Poet, cast them into the fire; or if they come where green Boughs are in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with the help of your fair Friends, (for thus bound, it will be too hard a task for your hands alone) to tear them in pieces; wherein you shall honour me with the fate of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> for so his Poems, whereof we only hear the form (not his limbs as the Story will have it) I suppose were scattered by the <hi>Thracian</hi> Dames. Here, Madam, I might take an opportunity to Celebrate your Vertues, and to instruct you how Vnhappy you are, in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35838:55"/>
that you know not who you are; how much you excel the most excellent of your own: And how much you amaze the least inclined to wonder of your Sex. But as they will be apt to take your Ladiship for a <hi>Roman</hi> Name, so would they believe that I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Character of a perfect Nymph, Worshipp'd an Image of my own making, and Dedicated this to the Lady of the Brain, not of the Heart of your Ladiships most humble Servant</p>

            <p>WE shall make it appear, the Errors of Divines, who would that a Monarch can be absolute, and that he can do all things <hi>ad libitum</hi>; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding not only from their Text, (though that be wandring too) but from the way their own Profession might teach them. <hi>Stare super vias antiquas,</hi> and remove not the ancient bounds and Landmarks which our Fathers have set.</p>
            <p>If to be Absolute, were to be restrained by no Laws, then can no King in <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> be so, for they all stand obliged to the Laws Christian, and we ask no more;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35838:56"/>
for to this Pillar be our Priviledges fixt, our Kings, at their <hi>Coronation,</hi> having taken a Sacred Oath not to Infringe them. I am sorry these men take no more care, for the informing of our Faith of these things, which they tell us for our Souls Health, whilst we know them so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly in the wrong way, in that which concerns the Liberties and Priviledges of the Subjects of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They gain Preferment, and then it is no matter, though they neither believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor are believed by others; but since they are so ready to let loose the Conscience of our Kings, we are the more carefully to proceed for our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection against this Pulpit-Law, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and reinforcing, Municipal Laws of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is worthy the Observation, how new this Opinion, or rather this way of Rising, is even amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:35838:56"/>For (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who was no Refractory man (as they term it) thinks that the first Government was Arbitrary, until it was found, that to live by one mans Will, becomes all mens Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; these are his Words, and that these were the Original of inventing Laws.</p>
            <p>And (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) if we look farther back, our Histories will tell us, that the Prelates of this Kingdom, have often been the Mediators between the King and his Subjects, to present and pray redress of their grievances, and had reciprocally then, as much love and reverence from the People.</p>
            <p>But these Preachers, more active than their Predecessors, and wiser than the Laws, have found out a better form of Government.</p>
            <p>The King must be a more Absolute Monarch than any of his Predecessors, and to them he must owe it, though in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35838:57"/>
the mean time they hazard the hearts of his People, and involve him into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Difficulties.</p>
            <p>For, suppose this form of Government were inconvenient; (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) this is but a Supposition; for this five hundred years, it hath not only maintained us in safety, but made us Victorious over other Nations. But suppose this form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were inconvenient, and they have another <hi>Idea</hi> of one more convenient, we all know how dangerous Innovations are, though to the better, and what hazards those Princes run, that enterprize the change of a long Established Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) of all our Kings that have gone before, and of all that are to succeed in this Happy Race, why should so Pious, and so Good a King, be exposed to this trouble and hazard? Besides, that King so diverted, can never do any great matters abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:35838:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>But (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) whilst these men have thus bent their Wits against the Law of their Country, have they not neglected their own Profession? What Tares are grown up in the Field which they should have Tilled? I leave it to a second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, not but Religion be the first thing in our purposes and desires: But that which is first in Dignity, is not always to preceed in order of time, for well-being supposes a being; and the first impediment which men naturally endeavour to remove, is the want of those things; without which they cannot subsist. God first assigned unto <hi>Adam</hi> maintenance of life, and added to him a title to the rest of the Creatures, before he appointed a Law to observe.</p>
            <p>And let me tell you, that if our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries have any such design, as there is nothing more easie, than to impose Religion on a People deprived of their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35838:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Liberties, so there is nothing more hard, than to do the same upon Freemen.</p>
            <p>And therefore (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) I conclude with this motion, that there may be an Order presently made, that the first thing this House goes about, shall be the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this Nation in general, to the Fundamental and Vital Liberties, the Prosperity of our Goods, and Freedom of our Persons; and then we will forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with consider of the supply desired.</p>
            <p>And thus shall we discharge the Trust reposed in us, by those that sent us hither: And His Majesty shall see, that we will make more than ordinary haste to satisfie <hi>His Demands</hi>; and we shall let all those know that seek to hasten the matter of Supply, that they will so far delay it, as they give no interruption to the former.</p>

            <p>I Am commanded by the House of Commons, to present you with these Articles against Mr. Justice <hi>Crawley,</hi> which when your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships shall have been pleased to hear read, I shall take leave (according to custom) to say something of what I have collected from the sense of that House, concerning the Crimes therein contained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here the Charge was read, containing his extrajudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Opinions subscribed, and judgment given for Ship-money; and afterward, a Declaration in his charge at an Assize, That Ship-money was so Inherent a Right in the Crown, that it would not be in the power of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take it away.</hi>

               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:35838:59"/>MY LORDS, Not only my Wants, but my Affections render me less fit for this Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for though it has not been my happiness to have the Law a part of my breeding, there is no Man honours that Profession more, or has a greater reverence towards the Grave Judges, the Oracles thereof. Out of Parliament, all our Courts of Justice are governed or directed by them; and when a Parliament is call'd, if your Lordships were not assisted by them, and the House of Commons by other Gentlemen of that Robe, experience tells us, it might run a hazard of being stiled <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum indoctorum.</hi> But as all Posessions are obnoxious to the malice of the Professors, and by them most easily betrayed, so (my Lords) these Articles have told you how these Brothers of the Coyf are become <hi>fratres in malo</hi>; how these Sons of the Law have torn out the Bowels of their Mother. But this Judge (whose charge you last heard) in one expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his, excels no less his Fellows, than they have done the worst of their Predecessors, in this Conspiracy against the Commonwealth. Of the Judgment for Ship-money, and those extrajudicial Opinions preceding the same (wherein they are jointly concern'd) you have already heard, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and pernicious a proceeding that was in so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick a Cause, has been sufficiently express'd to your Lordships; but this man, adding despair to our misery, tells us from the Bench, that Ship-money
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35838:59"/>
was a Right so inherent in the Crown, that it would not be in the power of an Act of Parliament to take it away. Herein (my Lords) he did not only give as deep a wound to the Commonwealth as any of the rest, but dipt his Dart in such a Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that so far as in him lay, it might never receive a Cure. As by those abortive Opinions, subscribing to the Subversion of our Propriety, before he heard what could be said for it, he prevented his own, so by this Declaration of his, he endeavours to prevent the Judgment of your Lordships too, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the power of a Parliament, the only place where this mischief might be redress'd: Sure he is more Wise and Learned, than to believe himself in this Opinion, or not to know how ridiculous it would appear to a Parliament, and how dangerous to himself; and therefore, no doubt but by saying no Parliament could abolish this Judgment, his meaning was, that this Judgment had abolish'd Parliaments.</p>
            <p>This Imposition of Ship-money springing from a pretended Necessity, was it not enough that it was now grown Annual, but he must entail it upon the State for ever, at once making Necessity inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Crown, and Slavery to the Subject? Necessity, which dissolving all Law, is so much more prejudicial to His Majesty than to any of us, by how much the Law has invested his Royal State with a greater power, and ampler fortune; for so

undoubted a truth it has ever been, that Kings as well as Subjects, are involv'd in the confusion which Necessity produces, that the Heathen thought their Gods also obliged by the same, <hi>Pareamus necessitati quam nec homines nec dii superant</hi>: This Judge then having in his charge, at the Affize, declar'd the dissolution of the Law, by this suppos'd Necessity, with what Conscience could he at the same Assize, proceed to condemn and punish men, unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he meant the Law was still in force for our Destruction, and not for our Preservation, that it should have power to kill, but none to protect us; a thing no less horrid, than if the Sun should burn without lighting us, or the Earth serve only to bury, and not to feed and nourish us. But (my Lords) to demonstrate that this was a supposititious impos'd necessity, and such as they could remove when they pleas'd; at the last Convention in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, a price was set upon it, <hi>for twelve Subsidies you shall reverse this Sentence</hi>: It may be said that so much money would have removed the present Necessity, but here was a Rate set upon future Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; <hi>for twelve Subsidies you shall never suffer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity again, you shall for ever abolish that Iudgment.</hi> Here this Mystery is revealed, this Vizor of Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is pull'd off, and now it appears, that this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Judges had very frankly and bountifully, presented His Majesty with twelve Subsidies, to be levied on your Lordships, and the Commons.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35838:60"/>
Certainly, there is no Priviledge which more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to a Parliament, than to open the Purse of the Subject, and yet these Judges, who are neither capable of sitting among us in the House of Commons, nor with your Lordships, otherwise than your Assistants, have not only assum'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves this priviledge of Parliament, but presum'd at once to make a present to the Crown, of all that either your Lordships, or the Commons of <hi>England</hi> do, or shall hereafter possess.</p>
            <p>And because this man has had the boldness to put the power of Parliament in ballance with the opinion of the Judges, I shall intreat your Lordships to observe by way of comparison, the solemn and safe proceeding of the one, with the precipitate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of the other. In Parliament (as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships know well) no new Law can pass, or old be abrogated, till it has been thrice read with your Lordships, thrice in the Commous House, and then it receives the Royal Assent; so that 'tis like Gold seven times purified: Whereas, these Judges by this one resolution of theirs, would perswade His Majesty, that by naming <hi>Necessity,</hi> he might at once dissolve (at least suspend) the great Charter 32 times confirm'd by his Royal Progenitors, the Petition of Right, and all other Laws provided for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Right and Propriety of the Subject; a strange force (my Lords) in the sound of this word <hi>Necessity,</hi> that like a Charm it should silence the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35838:61"/>
Laws, while we are dispoyl'd of all we have, for that but a part of our goods was taken is owing to the grace and goodness of the King, for so much as concerns these Judges, we have no more left than they perhaps may deserve to have, when your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships shall have passed Judgment upon them: This for the neglect of their Oaths, and betraying that publick trust, which for the conservation of our Laws was reposed in them.</p>
            <p>Now for the cruelty and unmercifulness of this judgment, you may please to remember that in the old Law they were forbid to seeth a Kid in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers milk; of which the received interpretation is, that we should not use that to the destruction of any creature, which was intended for its preservation: Now (my Lords) God and Nature has given us the Sea as our best Guard against our Enemies, and our Ships as our greatest glory above other Nations, and how barbarously would these Men have let in the Sea upon us, at once to wash away our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to overwhelm, if not our Land, all the propriety we have therein, making the supply of our Navy, a pretence for the ruine of our Nation; for observe I beseech you the fruit and consequence of this judgment, how this Money has prospered, how contrary an effect it has had to the end, for which they pretended to take it: On every County a Ship is annually impos'd, and who would not expect, but our Seas by this time should be covered
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35838:61"/>
with the number of our Ships? Alas (my Lords) the daily complaints of the decay of our Navy tell us how ill Ship-Money has maintained the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of the Sea; and by the many Petitions which we receive from the Wives of those miserable Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives at <hi>Algier,</hi> (being between four or five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of our County-Men) it does too evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that to make us Slaves at home, is not the way to keep us from being made Slaves abroad; so far has this judgment been from relieving the present, or preventing the future necessity, that as it chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our real Propriety into the shadow of a Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, so of a feigned it has made a Real necessity.</p>
            <p>A little before the approach of the <hi>Gaules</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> while the <hi>Romans</hi> had yet no apprehension of that danger, there was heard a voice in the Air, lowder then ordinary, <hi>The Gaules are come,</hi> which voice af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had Sack'd the City, and Besieged the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol, was held so ominous, that <hi>Livie</hi> relates it as a Prodigy; This Anticipiation of necessity seems to have been no less ominous to us: These Judges like ill boding Birds have call'd necessity upon the State in a time when I dare say they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in greatest security; but if it seem Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to take this as an Omen, sure I am, we may look on it as a cause of the unfeigned necessity we now suffer, for what regret and discontent had this judgment bred among us? And as when the Noise and Tumult in a private House grows so loud as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35838:62"/>
to be heard into the Streets, it calls in the next dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers either kindly to appease, or to make their own use of domestick strife; so in all likelihood our known discontents at home have been a concurrent cause to Invite our Neighbours to visit us, so much to the expence and trouble of both these Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And here, My Lords, I cannot but take notice of the most sad effect of this oppression, the ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence it has had upon the Antient Reputation and Valour of of the <hi>English Nation</hi>: And no wonder, for if it be true that oppression makes a Wise Man Mad, it may well suspend the Courage of the Valiant: The same happened to the <hi>Romans,</hi> when for renown in Arms they most excell'd the rest of the World; the story is but short, 'twas in the time of the <hi>Decemviri</hi> (and I think the chief troubles of our State may make up that number,) The <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri,</hi> My Lords, had subverted the Laws, Suspended the Courts of Justice, and (which was the greatest grievance both to the Nobility and People) had for some years omitted to assemble the Senate, which was their Parliament: This, says the Historian, did not only deject the <hi>Romans,</hi> and make them despair of their Liberty, but caused them to be less valued by their Neighbours: The <hi>Sabines</hi> take the advantage and invade them; and now the <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri</hi> are forc'd to call the long desired Senate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the People were so glad, that <hi>Hostibus belloque gratiam habuerunt</hi>: This Assembly breaks up in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35838:62"/>
discontent, nevertheless the War proceeds; Forces are raised, led by some of the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> and with the <hi>Sabines</hi> they meet in the Field: I know your Lordships expect the event: My Authors words of his Country Men are these, <hi>Ne quid ductu aut auspicio Decemvirorum prospere gereretur, vinci se patiebantur,</hi> They chose rather to suffer a present diminution of their Honour, than by victory to confirm the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of their new Masters: At their return from this unfortunate expedition, after some distempers and expostulations of the people, another Senate, that is, a second Parliament, is call'd, and there the <hi>Decemviri</hi> are questioned, deprived of their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, imprisoned, banish'd, and some lose their lives; and soon after this vindication of their Liberties, the <hi>Romans</hi> by their better success, made it appear to the World, that Liberty and Courage dwell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the same breast, and are never to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced. No doubt, my Lords, but your Justice shall have the like effect upon this dispirited people; 'tis not the restitution of our ancient Laws alone, but the restauration of our ancient Courage which is expected from your Lordships: I need not say any thing to move your just indignation, that this Man should so Cheaply give away that which your Noble Ancestors with so much Courage and industry had so long maintain'd: You have often been told how careful they were, though with the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes, to derive those Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35838:63"/>
as entire to posterity as they received them from their Fathers; what they did with labour you may do with ease, what they did with danger you may do securely: the foundation of our Laws is not shaken with the Engine of War, they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blasted with the breath of these men, and by your breath they may be restored.</p>
            <p>What Judgments your Predecessors have given, and what punishments their Predecessors have suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for offences of this nature, your Lordships have already been so well informed, that I shall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with a repetition of those precedents: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (my Lords) something I shall take leave to observe of the person with whose charge I have presented you, that you may the less doubt of the wilfulness of his offence.</p>
            <p>His education in the Inns of Court, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practice as a Councellour, and his experience as a Judge (considered with the mischief he has done) makes it appear that this Progress of his through the Law, has been like that of a diligent Spie through a Country, into which he meant to conduct an enemy.</p>
            <p>To let you see he did not offend for company, there is one crime so peculiar to himself, and of such malignity, that it makes him at once unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of your Lordships favour, and his own subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence incompatible with the right and propriety of the Subject: for if you leave him in a capacity of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35838:63"/>
interpreting the Laws, has he not already declared his opinion, That your votes and resolutions against Ship-money are void, and that it is not in the power of a Parliament to abolish that Judgment? To him my Lords, that has thus play'd with the power of Parliament, wee may well apply what was once said to the Goat browsing on the Vine.
<q>
                  <l>Rode, caper, vitem, tamen hinc cum stabis ad aras</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He has cropt and infring'd the priviledges of a banish'd Parliament, but now it is returned, he may find it has power enough to make a Sacrifice of him, to the better establishment of our Laws; and in truth what other satisfaction can he make his injur'd Country, than to confirm by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple those Rights and Liberties which he had ruin'd by his opinion?</p>
            <p>For the proofs, my Lords, they are so manifest, that they will give you little trouble in the disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; his crimes are already upon Record, the Delinquent and the Witness is the same; having from several seats of Judicature proclaim'd himself an Enemy to our Laws and Nation, <hi>Ex ore suo judicabitur.</hi> To which purpose I am commanded

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Acknowledege it a great mercy of God, and a great favour from you, that I am once more suffered to behold this Honourable Assembly. I mean not to make use of it to say any thing in my own defence by justification or denyal of what I have done, I have already confessed enough to make me appear, worthy not only to be put out of this House, but out of the World too. All my humble request to you is, that if I seem to you as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35838:65"/>
unworthy to live, as I do to my self, I may have the honour to receive my death from your own hands, and not be exposed to a Tryal by the Council of War: what ever you shall think me worthy to suffer in a Parliamentary way, is not like to find stop any where else.</p>
            <p>This (Sir) I hope you will be pleased for your own sakes to grant me, who am already so miserable, that nothing can be added to my cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but to be made the occasion of creating a president to your own disadvantage; besides the right I may have to this, consider I beseech you, that the eyes of the World are upon you; you Govern in chief, and if you should expose your own Members to the punishment of others, it will be thought that you either want power, or leisure to chastize them your selves: Nor let any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the ill consequence of such a president as this would be, because he seeth not presently the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which may insue: You have many Armies on foot, and it is uncertain how long you may have occasion to use them. Souldiers and Commanders (though I know well they of the Parliaments Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, excel no less in Modesty than they do in Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage) are generally of a nature ready to pretend to the utmost power of this kind, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be due to them, and may be too apt upon any occasion of discontent to make use of such a president as this. In this very Parliament you
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35838:65"/>
have not been without some taste of the experience hereof; it is now somewhat more than two years since you had an Army in the North, paid and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by your selves, and yet you may be pleased to remember there was a considerable number of Officers in that Army, which joyned in a Petition or Remonstrance to this House, taking notice of what some of the Members had said here, as they supposed to their disadvantage, and did little less than require them of you; 'tis true, there had been some tampering with them; but what has happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at one time, may wisely thought possible to fall out again at another.</p>
            <p>Sir, I presume but to point you out the danger; if it be not just, I know you will not do me the wrong to expose me to this tryal; if it be just, your Army may another time require the same Justice of you, in their own behalf, against some other Member, whom perhaps you would be less willing to part with. Necessity has of late forced you into untrodden Paths; and in such a Case as this where you have no President of your own, you may not do amiss to look abroad upon other States and Senates, which exercise the supream Power, as you now do here.</p>
            <p>I dare confidently say you shall find none ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Antient or Modern, which ever exposed any of their own order to be Tryed for his Life by the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35838:66"/>
Officers of their Armies abroad, for what he did, while he resided among them in the Senate.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Romans</hi> the practice was so contrary, that some Inferiour Officers in the Army far from the City, having been Sentenced by their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or Commander in chief, as deserving Death by their Discipline of War, have nevertheless (because they were Senators) Appealed thither, and the Cause has received a new hearing in the Senate. Not to use more Words to perswade you to take heed that you Wound not your selves thorough my sides, in violating the Priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to your own Persons; I shall humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to consider likewise the Nature of my offence, (not but that I should be much ashamed to say any thing in diminution thereof: God knows 'tis Horrid enough, for the Evil it might have occasiooed) but if you look near it, it may perhaps appear to be rather a Civil than a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Crime, and so to have Title to a Trial at the Common Law of the Land; there may justly be some difference put between me and others in this business.</p>
            <p>I have had nothing to do with the other Army, or any intention to begin the offer of violence to any body. It was only a Civil pretence to that which I then Foolishly conceived to be the right of the Subject. I humbly refer it to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, and to your Consciences. I know you
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35838:66"/>
will take care not to shed the Blood of War in Peace, that Blood by the Law of War, which hath a right to be Tryed by the Law of Peace.</p>
            <p>For so much as concerns my self and my part in this business, (if I were worthy to have any thing spoken, or patiently heard in my behalf) this might truly be said, that I made not this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness but found it, it was in other mens hands long before it was brought to me, and when it came, I extended it not, but restrained it. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of letting in part of the Kings Army, or offering violence to the Members oi this House, I ever disallowed and utterly rejected them.</p>
            <p>What it was that moved me to entertain discourse of this business so far as I did, I will tell you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously, and that rather as a warning for others, than that it make any thing for my self; it was only an impatience of the inconveniences of the present War, looking on things with a carnal eye, and not minding that which chiefly (if not only) ought to have been considered, the inestimable value of the Cause you have in hand, the Cause of God and of Religion, and the necessities you are forced upon for the maintenance of the same; as a just punishment for this neglect, it pleased God to desert and suffer me with a fatal blindness, to be led on, and ingaged in such Councils as were wholly disproportioned to the rest of my life; this (Sir) my own Conscience tells me was the cause
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35838:67"/>
of my failing, and not malice, or any ill habit of mind, or disposition toward the Common-wealth, or to the Parliament: For from whence should I have it? If you look on my Birth, you will not find it in my Blood: I am of a Stock which hath Born you better Fruit: If you look on my Education, it hath been almost from my Child-hood in this House, and among the best sort of Men; and for the whole Practice of my Life till this time, if another were to speak for me, he might reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably say, that neither my Actions out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor in my Expressions in it, have savoured of Dis-affection or Malice to the Liberties of the People, or Priviledges of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir, I have set before your Eyes, both my Person and my Case, wherein I shall make no such Defence by denying, or Extenuating any thing, I have done, as ordinary Delinquents do, my Address to you, and all my Plea shall only be such as Children use to their Parents, I have offended; I confess it, I never did any thing like it before; it is a passage unsuitable to the whole Course of my Life beside, and for the time to come, as God that can bring Light out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, hath made this business in the event useful to you, so also hath he to me: You have by it made an happy discovery of your Enemies, and of my self, and the Evil Principles I walk'd by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35838:67"/>
so that if you look either on what I have been heretofore, or what I now am, and by Gods grace assisting me, shall always continue to be, you may perhaps think me fit to be an Example of your Compassion and Clemency.</p>
            <p>Sir, I shall no sooner leave you, but my Life will depend on your Breath, and not that alone, but the subsistence of some that are more Innocent. I might therefore shew you my Children, whom the rigour of your Justice would make compleat Orphans, being already Motherless. I might shew you a Family, wherein there are some unworthy to have their share in that mark of Infamy which now threatens us: But something there is, which if I could shew you, would move you more than all this, it is my Heart, which abhors what I have done, more, and is more severe to it self, than the severest Judge can be. A Heart (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) so awakned by this Affliction, and so intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Cause you maintain, that I earnestly desire of God to incline to you, so to dispose of me, whether for Life or for Death, as may most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Advancement thereof.</p>
            <p>Sir, not to trouble you any longer, if I Dye, I shall Dye Praying for you; if I Live, I shall Live serving you, and render you back the use and Imployment of all those Days you shall add to my Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:35838:68"/>After this, having withdrawn himself, he was called in again, and (being by the Speaker required thereto) gave them an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how he came first to the knowledge of this business, as also what Lords were acquainted therewith, or had ingaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therein.</p>
