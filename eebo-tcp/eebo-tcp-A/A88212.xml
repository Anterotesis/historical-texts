            <title>The legall fundamentall liberties of the people of England revived, asserted, and vindicated. Or, an epistle written the eighth day of June 1649, by Lieut. Colonel John Lilburn (arbitrary and aristocratical prisoner in the Tower of London) to Mr. William Lenthall Speaker to the remainder of those few knights, citizens, and burgesses that Col. Thomas Pride at his late purge thought convenient to leave sitting at Westminster ... who ... pretendedly stile themselves ... the Parliament of England, intrusted and authorised by the consent of all the people thereof, whose representatives by election ... they are; although they are never able to produce one bit of a law, or any piece of a commission to prove, that all the people of England, ... authorised Thomas Pride, ... to chuse them a Parliament, as indeed he hath de facto done by this pretended mock-Parliament: and therefore it cannot properly be called the nations or peoples Parliament, but Col. Pride's and his associates, whose really it is; who, although they have beheaded the King for a tyrant, yet walk in his oppressingest steps, if not worse and higher.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And being demanded by the then Chairman of this Committee whether I had cauſed ſuch an Action to be commenced, yea or no, I poſitively declared, I had, and that I had very good ground in Law ſo to do, conſidering that the Law of <hi>England</hi> (which is my Birth-right and Inheritance) requires, That I ſhall not be deprived of my Liberty but by due proceſſe of Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the Land; and that if any ſhall detain my body in priſon without legall Authority, he is liable in Law to make me ſatisfaction therefore: but Mr. <hi>Wollaſtone</hi> had kept me in priſon divers weeks by vertue of a pretended Warrant of the ſingle Houſe of Lords, who in Law, I will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, have not the leaſt power in the World to commit my body to priſon: yet they did (upon the tenth day of June 1646, laying no crime to my charge) command me to be kept for all my ſhort eternity in this world; for the Warrant is, during their pleaſures: and then by another illegall Warrant, within fourteen dayes after, dated the 23 of June 1646, they (for no cauſe in the world) commit me cloſe priſoner, and command that I be not permitted to have pen, ink nor paper, and that none ſhall have acceffe unto me in any kinde, but onely my Keeper, untill the Lords otherwiſe pleaſe. Which moſt illegall Warrant Mr. <hi>Wollaſtone</hi> executed upon me with a great deal of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie and barbariſm, not permitting my Wife to come into the priſon yard to ſpeak with me at a diſtance out of my grates, nor ſuffering me to receive either meat, drink, or money, or any other neceſſaries from the hands of my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116233:4"/>
Wife, ſervant, or friends, nor ſuffering me to ſee their faces when they ſent me in my diet: All which uſages are againſt the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom; and therefore I have cauſe and ground enough in Law, to ſeek for my remedy in Law againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Wollaſtone;</hi> and I hope the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Committee have taken too many Oaths to maintain the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Laws of the Land, and the Liberties of the People, then now to go about to deprive me of the benefit of them.</p>
            <p>It is true, you ſit here by verue of an Ordinance of both Houſes, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnifie all thoſe that have acted or done, or commanded to be acted ordone, any thing by ſea or land, by the Authority, or for the ſervice or benefit of this preſent Parliament: But under the favour of this Committee, I do conceive, That the ſaid Ordinance, which is your Commiſſion, doth not in the leaſt authoriſe you to meddle with my preſent caſe; foraſmuch as I do not proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Mr. <hi>Wollaſtone</hi> for actions done by the Command and Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but for actions done directly againſt their Authority publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Laws of the Kingdom, and their own Declarations: and I hope this Committee will not ſo much undervalue their own Houſe, as to adjudge the Houſe of Lords ſingly to be the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> nor their ſingle Order to be the Parliaments Authority of <hi>England:</hi> and if not, then I cleerly conceive, that upon your own principles, you have nothing to do with my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs before you; neither can I conceive, that you can in the leaſt judge Mr. <hi>Wollaſton's</hi> illegal and barbarous actions done upon me, to be for the ſervice and benefit of the Parliament, but rather the quite contrary, by rendering them odious and adominable in the eyes of the people, if they ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Whereupon, after a little debate amongſt the members of this Committee by themſelves, my L. <hi>Munſon</hi> the Chairman thereof was pleaſed to tell me, then the buſineſs was weighty, and did concern the Priviledges of the Lords Houſes; and therefore they judged it convenient to put it off till this day, and to acquaint the Lords with it, that ſo, if they pleaſed, ſome of them might here be preſent: and you alſo ordered me to fit my ſelf with a formall Anſwer to the Petition, which accordingly I have done, and with the favour of this Committee, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me free leave to ſpeak, I am ready to deliver unto you, and do deliver it unto you thus.</p>

            <p>Firſt, That they give a falſe and untrue Narrative of the original occaſion of that Agreement, to which by our importunate importunity they were neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and drawn unto that little they did in it as a Bear to the ſtake, as is truely by me before declared; and which, as the ſequell ſhews, they undertook meerly to quiet and pleaſe us <hi>(like children with rattles)</hi> till they had done their main work; <hi>(viz.</hi> either in an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, that which is done by one Parliament, as a Parliament, may be undone by the next Parliament: but an Agreement of the People begun and ended amongſt the People can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come juſtly within the Parliaments cognizance to deſtroy: which the Generall and the chief of his Councel knew well enough; and I dare ſafely ſay it upon my conſcience, that an Agreement of the People upon foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of juſt freedom gon through with, is a thing the Generall and the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his Councel as much hates, as they do honeſty, juſtice and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, (which they long ſince abandoned) againſt which in their own ſpirits they are abſolutely reſolved (I do verily beleeve) to ſpend their heart blouds, and not to leave a man breathing in Engliſh air, if poſſibly they can, that throughly and reſolutely proſecutes it; a new and juſt Parliament being more dreadful to them, then the great day of Judgement ſpoken ſo much of in the Scripture. And although they have beheaded the King, yet I am confidently perſwaded their enmity is ſuch at the Peoples Liberties, that they would ſooner run the hazard of letting the Prince in to reign in his Fathers ſtead, then further really a juſt Agreement, or endure the ſight of a new Parliament rightly conſtituted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Its plain to me out of their words, That they poſitively aver, that their Agreement was preſented to the Parliament before ours was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed

            <p>Thirdly, They poſitively hint, our diſſatisfaction was taken at them for preſenting theirs to the Parliament; which is alſo as falſe as the former: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>And whereas it is by experience found, that the not holding of Parliaments accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the two forementioned Acts, hath produced ſundry and great miſchiefs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences to the Kings Majeſty, the Church and Common-wealth; For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the like miſchiefs and inconveniences in time to come, Be it enacted by the Kings moſt excellent Majesty, with the conſent of the Lords Spirituall and Temporall. and the Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, That the ſaid</hi> [LAST FOREMENTIONED] <hi>Laws and Statutes be from henceforth duely kept and obſerved.</hi> And you there go on and enact, that in caſe the King perform not this part of his truſt in calling annuall Parliaments, <hi>that then a Trienniall one ſhall be</hi> CALLED BY THE LORD KEEPER, &amp;c. <hi>whether the King will or no.</hi>

            <p>Again, The King's Writ that ſummoned this Parliament, <hi>is the Baſis in law, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But if it be objected, The <hi>Law of Neceſſity</hi> requires the continuance of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the letter of the Law.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, Its neceſſrry to conſider whether the men that would have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as they pleaſe, be not thoſe that have created the neceſſities on purpoſe, that by the colour thereof they may make themſelves great and potent; and if ſo, then that Objection hath no weight, nor by any rules of Juſtice can they be allowed to gain this advantage by their own fault, as to make that a ground of their juſtification, which is a great part of their offence.
