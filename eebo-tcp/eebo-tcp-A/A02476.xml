            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Einge entred (worshipfull and</hi> my beeloued Cowsen) into the meditacion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rare gouernment of our renowmed Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> so high and so aboundaunte matter of admyration offered it selfe to the view of mine vnderstanding, that I felt my thoughts in such sorte surprised with the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thereof, that (for the solace of my minde) I yeelded my selfe a ioyfull man to set downe in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge some superfitiall discourse vpon the same: such, as (at the least within mine owne soule) might styrre vp and procure the prayses of God, and draw forwards a dewe thankfulnes vnto his maiesty for the wonderfull benefites that largely (thereby) haue accrewed to the whole body and to euery particuler member of this our Englishe Nacion. And loe, no sooner had I accomplished this mocion of my mind (in such sorte as you may see it heere set downe in printe) but another Cogitacion began with impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
<pb facs="tcp:6346:3"/>
to assayle me a freshe: for beholdinge (with the feruencye of my harte) the truthe of that matter which I had already compyled, and seeing yet (far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) so gloryous and so plentifull a treasourie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning to be discouered, and that, <hi>In perpetuam rei memoriam</hi>: I could not choose but so farre mislike with the sclendernes of that which I had alreadye done, as I wished (and not slightly) that it woulde please almighty God (to the eternall praises of his holy name) to stirre vp the zeale of some learned and well approued member to geue abroade for an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall view, to all Countreies and Nacions of Christendome, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heroyicall garnishment of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and truth, an exact historye and declaration of the same. And in this cogitacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, repairing vnto your house for the comforte of your friendlye confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, it was the good will of God that I shuld dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close mine affections (that way) vnto you, as also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shoulde offer vnto you the hearing of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it was at that time, thus vnlearnedly pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: where findyng by the like good fauour of god, your learned &amp; friendly neighbour, it was recokned for Gods diuine prouidence, that I should require him also to be a hearer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. Which learned man (as you know) vpon the hearinge thereof, so largely dispensed with al those wantes that by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning might (peraduenture) haue binne supplyed in this booke, as that by fauoryng &amp; chiefly regarding the vndoubted truth of the matter, he perswaded that it wold grow no blemysh at all vnto my credit, neither in respect of the breuitie of the woorke, nor yet for the playnesse and rudenes of the stile, yf I should agree to the publishing of the same in prynt:

comfort that you take by beholdyng the blisful daies of our sanctified <hi>DEBORA,</hi> as also so Ialous for the Regestryng of her highnesse prayses (or rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayses of our God) vnto posteritie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if I knew by what other meane, more acceptably, then thus by the first view of these my trauayles (employed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of god) I might manifest vnto you the sincerity of mine affection, vndoubtedly you shuld finde me so for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward to accomplishe the same, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deede it self, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vtmost limit of my poore degree, shuld be enough to make knowne what vnfayned loue I do beare you. And wheras the dedication of all other bookes (for the most part) doe seeme to craue countinaunce and defence at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> patron, this my small booke (assure your self) for the dignitie of the personage of whom it treateth, as also for the truth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it conteineth, shalbe able enough (besides the defence of it selfe) to geue both countinaunce and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to your person, being indeede, the verye man (amongst men of your place and calling) whose loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all harte and religious minde (besides the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion of priuate duties of loue) may challenge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me such affection as best of al beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a christian louer to his friend so wel approued. And though the booke be but litle, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> personage of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it treateth is great: and so great, as that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Booke may sooner be countenaunced with the royaltie of her highnesse name, than be able (by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thowsande parte) to show foorth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of her princely vertues, much lesse, of the large benefites that infinitely arise vnto our common wealth of <hi>England</hi> and to euery member of the same, by the goodnesse of her rarest gouernment: Some particuler partes whereof are (as before is
<pb facs="tcp:6346:4"/>
declared) in these Quaires, though brieflye, yet truely discoursed.</p>
            <p>But nowe, that you may some way answere the name of a Patron of this my Booke: although the matter of the same hath defence sufficient in it selfe, &amp; in the truth thereof, is able enough to stand against the faces of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimies of truth: Yet because there is a sorte of people, which I feare me, more of enuy, then of any true zeale or care of my well doynge (as hauyng an awstere regard vnto my vocation, which in deede, resteth in the Study, or rather in a meane place of practise of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawes of this Realme) will recken it a matter more then ordinary that I should after this sorte so transcende the limits of my sayd vocation, as spendyng my time, or at the least, some parte of the same, in thyngs by semblaunce, so far discrepaunte from my profession: let my defense be so made, I beseeche you, that it may in equall sort be considered, or at the least wise by you enforced, not only how muche and how largely <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ue and zeale are hable to woorke and brynge to passe in men other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whyles conuersaunt in the consideration of thynges high and precious, but also how seemely a thyng it is and how well agreeable with euery vocation to aduaunce and set foorth the high prayses of vertue and vertuous personages, as also to batter &amp; beate downe the enforcementes of vyce and vicious mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
            <p>And for my selfe, I haue boldly to affirme vnto all suche discontented myndes (especially vnto those that haue the common lawes for theyr profession) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the matter of this my littel booke is not so voyde of excuse, but that by view of the substaunce &amp; ful scope
<pb facs="tcp:6346:5"/>
therof, it may yeelde foorth a stronge and ryghtfull defense agaynst these nice and ouer curious repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: for, as it concerneth the speciall prayse of God in the <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the Queenes Maiesties most prosperous and peaceable gouernment: So, it is not vnknowne that touchinge the Regiment of Princes, the nature of Lawes, the office of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saylers, and the authorytie of Iudges, the volumes of our Lawes are not so barrein, but that they may and do minister matter aboundantlye to the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors and students of the same, whereby to discerne and to deeme indifferently of them all: for whether we would consider the good and godly gouernment of a Prince by often pardoning of offences in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye, or by sharplie punishing of offenders in iustice, by planting of good &amp; wholsome lawes, or by repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of euill and vnnecessary Statutes: Not onely <hi>Bracton,</hi> but also the worthy and worshipfull Knight master <hi>Forescue</hi> in sundrye places of his litle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, verie copiously geue foorth matter for the furtherynge of studious wittes in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracion thereof. And no lesse may be gathered tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng a difference and sownd censure of honourable Counsayllers: but especially of Iudges &amp; of lawes. Wherupon I trust I may inferre, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to praise and extolle the admirable gouernment of our renowmed Soueraigne, or to commende the sowndnes of her lawes, or to aduaunce and set forth the wonderfull vertues of her highnes counsayllers, or to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the rare learning &amp; holynesse of her reuerende Iudges: so far forth as they be matters (though but superfitially) to be discerned and descyphred by the Bookes of our Lawes, so farre, they are not to be
<pb facs="tcp:6346:5"/>
thought discrepaunt or impertinent for a student of the lawes to treat or to write of.</p>
            <p>But wherfore should I thus carefully seeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that, which I suppose, nedeth no reprehension? why shuld I not rather challenge that liberty that is graunted to euery vocation of learninge, yea to the lawyer himself? namely, to intermingle with painful trauayles of the minde, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleasures of some exercise more plausible and milde, especially, where the same may be practised to the glory of god &amp; to the profit of our brethren, as I trust, this is, or at the leastwyse was intended. Well, if all this notwithstanding, these curious carpers wil neuer be satisfied, let them at their pleasures blow abroade what they list, and holde on in their myslikings, vntyll in the vanytie of their purposes, and the rage of their enuie, they shal at the length be glutted with the fulnesse of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coure and vnciuill reproches.
