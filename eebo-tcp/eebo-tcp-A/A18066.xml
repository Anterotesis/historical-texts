            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE COMMON COVRSE OF MANS</hi> life (most venterous and no lesse wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Knight) and their daily dealings doe manifestlye declare, how variable they be, how wandering, how wauering, how vncertaine and insolent, if Fortune or rather God (to speake Christian like) by blessing them as abundantly, so extraordinarily: and raising them, <hi>Tanquam é puluere &amp; luto,</hi> aduaunce them to promotion. And no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell though this be incident to the manners of men, seeing that nature hir selfe in this point offendeth. For what is he, vnles he be mortified, that is not naturally of an aspiring mind: imitating heerin the propertie of the Iuie, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaseth climing by degrees, <hi>Donec ipsam summitatem attigerit,</hi> till it be come to the very top.</p>
            <p>This fault being generall, and as generall so hatefull, in the iudgment specially of the wise, might seeme so much the more tollerable, if that men placed in preeminence, and sitting like Hils, ouerlooking the Vallies below, with their high calling &amp; stately authoritie, had agreeable heartes. But some, notwithstanding their state be singular, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede such, as that they may sit downe, take their ease, and say, <hi>Hic terminus esto,</hi> doe carie so base a minde, as that if I should compare them to Aesops Cocke, preferring a barlie corne before a pretious pearle, I should not doe amisse. There is none but by diligent obseruation, may see this to be an vndoubted truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5155:3"/>In the taxing of which English, and outlandish fault, (for it is as common as the world is wide) I should shewe my selfe no cunning Archer, to ouershoote the marke of your deserued commendation. For although you haue had Fortune holding the bason, whiles you washed your hands, &amp; cast the best chaunce of the Dice: yet for all that, such is your contentment, you hoist not vp the loftie saile of selfe-loue, to swell with the winde of vainglory, as vaunting of any exploit which you haue atchieued, <hi>Per tot Cyclopea saxa, per mundi scopulos, Scyllam, vastam<expan>

            <p>Some one, hauing passed a Sea of sixe daies sailing, (or lesse, if lesse might be supposed) is so far in loue with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, &amp; so vndiscreetly doteth ouer his owne doings, at his returne, that he maketh his trauell ordinarie table talke, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauating the matter so mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strously, as if he had endured the very labours of olde <hi>Hercules.</hi> Another, <hi>Et terris iactatus &amp; alto,</hi> hauing seene the mightie workes of the Lord, &amp; his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the deepe, &amp; as it were measured with a paire of Compasses (be it spoken without offence) the globe of the whole world, <hi>Post multa discrimina rerum,</hi> arriueth in his natiue soyle meruailously blessed from aboue, and yet discouereth not the multitude of dangers, or rather deathes, wherewith he hath encountred. Which of these iudge you deserueth the trumpets plausible sound?</p>
            <p>I cannot therefore sufficiently wonder at the equalitie of your worships minde, which, notwithstanding so many tempestes of perturbations, and sharpe surges of inwarde motions, continueth calme. And it doeth me not a little good, first to see you so fortunate: &amp; secondly, though that were enough to make you insolent and disdainfull, the credite which you haue gotten (deserued no doubt) euen with the very best, that yet you contemne not the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the acquaintance, the familiaritie, &amp; conference euen of

            <p>This among other considerations of your curteous dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition &amp; friendly nature, being a mirrour in a Gentleman in this our proud &amp; arrogant age, like a right Loadstone drew me an yron lumpe, hauing in my hands a notable worke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The voyage of the wandering knight,</hi> to ouer-runne the same according to my superficiall skill &amp; slender knowledge, to polish and burnish it, to restore &amp; make it perfect in some such lims, whereon it seemed to halt, that it might with so much the more grace <hi>Proripere in publicum, &amp; in hominum manus innolare,</hi> for their larger delight: and in deed to procure the printing &amp; publishing thereof, that well disposed people might thereby reape some benefit.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY HISTORIOGRAPHERS</hi> both Poets and Orators, as well prophane as diuine, haue by writing notified diuers persons, with their voyages &amp; aduentures. First, <hi>Iustin</hi> and <hi>Diodore</hi> of <hi>Sicilie</hi> haue made mention of the <hi>Argonautes</hi> voyage by Sea: that is to say, of <hi>Iason</hi> and his alies, <hi>Castor, Pollux, Hercules</hi> &amp; other Péeres, to the Isle of <hi>Colchos,</hi> to win the golden Fliece, which a great Dragon kept. Also <hi>Homer</hi> a Gréeke Poet, writ in verse the wandring and Sea voyage of <hi>Vlisses</hi> &amp; his companions, at their return from the <hi>Troyan</hi> warres. After him, <hi>Virgil,</hi> a most eloquent Latine Poet, set downe in verse the voyage of <hi>Aeneas</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes after the subuersion of <hi>Troye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if we come to the sacred Histories, we shall finde first how <hi>Moses</hi> wrote of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> their going out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into the Land of promise, &amp; of the xlij. Mantions that they made in the Desart, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> space of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares. And how the foure Euangelists likewise most faithfully haue written of the holy peregrination of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sonne of God, our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, who tooke vpon him our fraile and humaine nature. The selfe same Sauiour hath set downe a Parable of the voluptuous voyage of the prodigall Childe, and his retourne. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> very notably and sincerely hath deliuered in writing, the painfull and holy perigrination of that great vessell of election Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> together with the great trauell hée
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:5155:6"/>
tooke to preach the Gospell, and the faith of Iesus Christ, to all the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>And now (by Gods grace) I mean to declare mine own voyage and aduentures, much like to that of the prodigall childe, who left his fathers house, and ranged into strange countries, wasting all his goods, liuing licentiously, but after he knew his lewdnesse, he returned backe to his father, of whom he was very louingly receiued. So I by great Folly counselled, in absenting my selfe far away, (not onely in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but also in minde) from God my Father &amp; Creator, haue wasted &amp; consumed all the goods which this same my God &amp; father had bountifully bestowed vpon me, in following the vaine pleasures of this life. But in the ende, I being inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Diuine grace, acknowledged mine offences, &amp; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the dark Region of sinne and vanitie, through the aide &amp; conduction of the diuine grace, am returned to mine eternal father, humbly requiring pardon &amp; mercie: who of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable mercie, hath louingly receiued me. But how all this hath ben done, I will declare all vnto you, praieng you patiently to giue me the hearing, &amp; attentiuely consider my talk, &amp; well to note the whole, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning to the ende.</p>
               <p>After I had passed in all folly and lasciuiousnesse thrée wéekes of the yeares of mine age: that is to say, my Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, childes age, and youth, which make together xxj. yeares: I entred into the age of a young man, which is the fourth wéeke of my age, which is betwéene xxij. and xxiiij. yeares. At xxv. I was minded to make a voiage by my foolish indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie to séeke where in this world I might finde true feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and happinesse, which séemed to my sottish sense, an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie matter, being young, strong, wilde, hardie and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously disposed. Me thought in my mind to liue in the world without felicitie, was a lyfe worse then death. But alas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plunged in the déepe darknesse of ignoraunce. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered not that true felicitie was the gifte of God from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and cannot be atteined without his helpe.</p>
               <p>Beeing robbed of reason, I thought it might come ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of my selfe, without the helpe of others: so that then I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:5155:6"/>
sought true felicitie, where she is not, was not, nor euer shall be: as in riches, worldly pleasure, strength, honour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the flesh. But I was in so thinking, as very a foole as he, who hopeth with anglyng lines, to take fishes in the Aire, or with Hounds to hunt the Hare in the Occean sea. Were it not thinke you, a great folly so to thinke? Euen the lyke is it, to thinke that true felycitie is to be found héere in this wretched world. And forsomuch as in perfect felicitie is comprehended all goodnesse, and that this world (as saith S. <hi>Iohn</hi>) is addicted and giuen to all euill, and subiect to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thirst, heate, colde, diseases, calamities, pride, ambition, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, and voluptuousnesse, it is euident that those which héere be liuing, supposing héere to finde true felicitie, are worse then fooles, and voyd of right reason.</p>
               <p>True felicitie is not without goodnesse and vertue, which commeth from God aboue. If it be so, why then is it not a most wicked and presumptuous opinion to thinke that by a mans owne industrie he is able to possesse and enioye the faire lot of true felicitie. Therefore euery one that thinketh in this world, he may come to perfect felicitie and true bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse, shall finde in fine as I found, for felicitie, vanitie: for good, euill.</p>

               <head>¶THE VVANDRING KNIGHT DECLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto Dame Folly his Gouernesse, what is his intent. The second Chapter.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ntending to take my iourney, I considered that it was necessarie to vse counsell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, knowing that whatsoeuer is done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aduise cannot haue good successe: as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, a matter discréetely attempted, is luckely ended. Then dwelt with me a damzell which ruled my house, whose proper name was <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only enimy to wisdome. For euery thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hateth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one, loueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. Ther is as much differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwéen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:5155:7"/>
betwéene white and blacke, hot and colde, moyst and drye, lyght and darknesse, God and the Diuell: all which be contraries, and can not bée in one bodie together. Wisedome gouernes the good, Folly the euill: Wisedome maketh the euill good, when they yéeld themselues to be hir subiects: Folly maketh the good euill, when they place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnder hir protection: Wisedome draweth men from hell, and bringeth them to heauen: Folly fetcheth Angels from heauen to dwell in hell.</p>
               <p>I doe not tearme that Wisedome to know the vij. libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sciences, the qualities of the Starres and Planets, but I count him wise that hath the true knowledge of God. For, as saith Saint <hi>Cyril, Wisedome is that true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, by the which the souereigne good, namely God, is seene, knowen and loued, with a chast loue and pure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> Folly, is very ignoraunce, and false worshipping of God. Wisdome maketh fooles, wise, &amp; Folly maketh wise men fooles. Tell me I pray you, can ther be greater wisdome then to serue God with a pure faith, and to obserue &amp; kéepe his holy lawe obediently? And contrariwise, can there be greater Folly then to commit sinne, and to disobey God, by transgressing his Commaundements? It is not possible. For whosoeuer committeth sinne, hurteth himselfe, and runs headlong to hell, which is a point of very great folly. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all those that faithfully serue God, and keepe his holye Commaundements, are wise and gouerned by Wisedome: and all those that transgresse the Commaundements of God, are fooles, and fettered to Follye, as slaues and Uas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls.</p>
               <p>When I wandered in wanton wayes, I wrought my will, estéeming my selfe wise, but I proued a flat foole. Thus fostered by Folly, to whome I vnfolded my intent, which was to take vpon me a voyage to finde felicitie and blessednesse, I requested hir counsell, who without regard whether it were profitable for me or no, did not onely lyke of the matter, but also forced mée forwardes, and with flattering phrase commended my enterprise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:5155:7"/>And to encourage me therein, she began to exalt my deuice, to commend my industrie and wit, to praise my strength, to aduance my vertue, to blaze my knowledge, to decipher my beautie, and to extoll all my qualities, saieng, that I was a second <hi>Salomon,</hi> to haue in my head such noble cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Héerevpon she promised to be my guide, and vowed, not to goe from mée in all my voyage, affirming that she had sundrie seasons made the lyke iourney, and that I should assure my selfe shortly to see the Pallaice of true felicitie. My sonne (quoth shée) I would not haue thée thinke, that anie euill or guile canne haue place in my heart. Thus comforted, or rather emboldened, I thought my selfe most happye to haue such a gouernesse, so wise, so graue, and so expert, for verye ioye whereof, my heart tickled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mée. But alas wretch that I was, my desire was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes after contrarye thinges: for I reiected whatsoeuer tended to my health: insomuch that to mée, sowre séemed swéete: blacke séemed white, euill séemed good, Follie sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wisdome, light séemed darknesse: And follye had so sore bewitched me, that I neglected to doe the good I should haue done: And I was too willing to playe the part I should not haue played.</p>
               <p>It is true that the wise man spake (saieng.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 32.</note>) <hi>There is health where many doth giue counsell, and he that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good aduise and counsell before, shall not repent him after.</hi> But it is forbidden to take counsell of fooles: For that they loue but what they lyke.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as men oftentimes do alter their intents, Folly was busie &amp; earnest to force me forward in the prosecuting my purpose, perswading me to put my selfe on the way, and saieng that such good meanings and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises should presently and without nay be put in execution, for feare of inconueniences that might ensue: and that to meane a matter without dooing it, was a reproch to anie person. Whereto I aunswered, that I would procéede, whatsoeuer followed therevppon: but my thought it was necessarie to haue companie, and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, as apparell, horses and armour fit for such a voyage. My sonne (quoth she) I will take charge vpon mée, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto trust: cast all care from thée, let nothing torment thée, be of good chéere, sléepe at thy ease, refuse no rest: for I will within few daies, bringe thée all such necessaries as thou shalt néede: and séeing thou hast submitted thy selfe to me, I will not faile thée. Béeing glad of those wordes, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refreed the whole matter to her discreation, and tooke my case.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Follie</hi> was acquainted with an armourer named <hi>Euill Will,</hi> whose companie she daylye frequented. This armourer was not alwaies occupied in forging armours: but also ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times he made shirts, hosen, doublets, &amp; medled in all matters that his friend Follye appointed him to doe.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5155:9"/>
To this armourer, Follye declared all my purpose, and he at her request made me a shirt of lasciuiousnesse, a doublet of lewde desire, hosen of vaine pleasures, armour of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauncie, a corselet of inconstancie, vanbraces of arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, gauntlets of idlenesse, a gorget of lycorousnesse, a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of lightnesse, a bucklar of shamelessnesse, a quilt cap of vaine-glorie, a girdle of intemperaunce, a swoorde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellion, &amp; a lawnce, named hope of long lyfe. Then <hi>Pride</hi> prepared me a galloping horse, called <hi>Temeritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these wicked weapons, with this prodigall apparell, and vnhonest armour, <hi>Euill Will</hi> prepared me, at Follies request. And what better seruice canne hée doe, séeinge he is depriued of truth and veritie? For, as good will is the worker of all goodnesse, so is euill will of wickednesse.

I slept when I listed, I laye as soft as silke, I past my time in pleasures, trusting to my gouernesse <hi>Folly,</hi> in al
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5155:10"/>
my affayres. After I passed thrée dayes in pleasure, vppon a morning, beeing in my golden sléepe, Dame Folly came to my beds side, accompanied with euill will, and with them they brought all my necessaries. When they sawe mée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe in my soft bed, at that time of the daye, tossing my selfe euerie waie wantonly, they sayd, What pretie one, are you yet in bed? It is late, arise. Ah my sweete friende (quoth I) I haue followed your aduice, I haue cast all care away, and taken mine ease in mine Inne: but I wonder how you are so soone returned.</p>
               <p>What man (quoth Follye) knowe not you howe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent I am in mine affaires? I neuer rest till all thinges bee brought about, that I once take in hand. Then she put on me my shirt of lasciuiousnesse, (most agréeable to my wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton will:) and then all my delight was to be delicatelye handeled, pompeouslye apparailed, and soft lodged. After that, on went my doublet of lewde desires, alwayes enimie to the good spirit: then my hosen of vaine pleasures, tide together with pointes of delightes. When I was full of lewde desires, I tooke pleasure in nothing but vanitie: and as my desires were dampnable, so were my pleasures daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>Then as I was (making me readie) Follye commaunded the Clarke of my kitchin, called ill gouernement, to prepare me my breakfast, of light and delicate meates, in dooing whereof my Cooke was more cunnning then euer <hi>Cicero</hi> was elloquent in speaking. And thus as Folly and I were merrily discoursing together, spending time till breakfast, I tooke occasion to aske of what age shee was, and also what iestes and fine feates she had, what people she had gouerned, and how she ruled them. Shée sayd that question was asked and aunswered long agoe. But as we rid on the waye, she would declare all, in the meane time she sayde, that she was aboue fiue thousand yeares olde. Howe can that be (quoth I) you doe not seeme to be fortie yeare olde. Yes (quoth she) thou must vnderstande, that I was borne at the present houre that the world was made, and haue euer since stoode
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5155:10"/>
in strength, alwayes in health, and neuer sicke. I shall neuer séeme olde, though I liue till domes daye. Fooles dye, but (Follye) neuer dyeth. Hauing euer bene in force, I forceablye doe reigne, in euerye corner of the worlde, and doe gouerne as well Princes, as poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Now to the purpose, after washing in swéete waters, in came my breakfast, so sumptuous, that Partriges were estéemed palterie for Pages, Phesauntes for common folke. Breakfast finished, on went mine armour: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once apparailed and armed, I cared not for my soules health. I had no desire to heare the worde of God, no feare to followe his commaundementes, or to doe anye thing fitte for a Christian, towardes his saluation. I did what I woulde, I sayde what I pleased. And after that I was couered with my stéele coate of ignorauncie, and my corcelet of inconstancie, I presentlye became inconstaunt and variable, oftentimes altering my intent, not for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but for worse, out of one ill, into an other: I neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to acquaint my selfe now with one sinne, then with an other: dooing nothing that seemed good or honest. For such is the nature of sinne, that vnlesse it bée soone subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will drawe vnto it an other sinne: as witnesseth Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in his first Chapter of his Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Follye put on my vanbraces of arrogancye, which made me become carelesse and presumptious, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king things in hand, farre passing my capacitie, strength, and abilitie, and not fearing to aduenture that which was aboue my reach, but beeing armed with arrogancye, vp went my curled haire, I aduaunced my selfe ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye aboue others: then on went my gorget of gluttonye and lycorousnesse, the bréeders of all fleshlye sinnes, and chieflye of lecherye. For when the bellye is full with lyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous meates and drinkes, it warmes and heates the other members excéedinglye, which by and by wrestle and striue against the good spirite. But if the bellye were brideled
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5155:11"/>
from gluttonye, those rebellious members woulde bée subdued, as sayth the Comicall Poet, <hi>Sine Cerere &amp; Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, Friget Venus.</hi> That is to saye.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>From Wine and good cheere, thy belly restraine,</l>
                  <l>And lust of the flesh small heate will containe.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Upon all this, <hi>Folly</hi> put me on an other armour, called <hi>Vaine glorie,</hi> which is of such a propertie, that the greater it grewe, the lesse I perceiued it: then on went my girdle of intemperauncie, which did let loose the bridle of lecherie, and all other fleshlye affections. To it was tyed my swoord of rebellion: so that then I rebelled against God, his holie commaundements, and all Magistrates and superiours. But if I had brideled my boldnesse, reprehending my selfe, my desires and affections, and had rested in reason, without rebellinge, then had I serued God, and obeyed my betters, with all duetifull reuerence. Dame <hi>Folly</hi> disguised mée with the helment of wantonnesse, vppon the toppe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was put a Pecockes tayle: so that then I might not suffer anye checke, for anie fault, but might and did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine my opinion against all men, giuing place to none whatsoeuer, learned, or in authoritie.</p>
               <p>After my gauntlettes of idlenesse were once on my handes, I greatlye gloried of the giftes which were in mée, vauntinge my selfe to bée more riche, more wise, more stronge, more hardye, more gratious, and in all respectes better then I was. Manye times I boasted of mine imperfections, as of Dronkennesse, Lecherie, and such lyke. After on went my bucklar of shamelesnesse, which béeing about my shoulders, I blushed not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit anye vilanye: I lead the lyfe of an Infidell, rather then a Christian. Unshamfullye I despised both God and man, nothing regardinge mine owne honour, renowne, or saluation.</p>
               <p>Then I mounted vppon <hi>Temeritie</hi> my horse, with a Lawnce in my hande, called Hope of long lyfe. O deceiptfull Lawnce, more rotten then a Réede. Howe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5155:11"/>
manye proper youthes haue trusted vnto thée, hopinge to haue béene safe and assured, and were deadlye decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>This Lawnce once béeing entered in me, I intertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all vices, it euer hindered me from imbracing repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, perswading me in this manner. Thou art young, make merrie whiles thou maist, for when thou art olde, all playe and pastime will bée past: then it will bee time inough for thée to repent. Béeing thus gouerned by <hi>Follye</hi> I thought neither of God, nor the Diuell, of lyfe, nor death, of heauen nor hell: but liued at my pleasure, dooing what I delyghted in. At last <hi>Folye</hi> apparailed her selfe lightlye, with a Cloake of feathers, and mounted vpon a Iennet, and opening her feathers and winges with the winde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye she flewe, and I also at a wilde aduenture, sette the spurres to my horse, and awaye we went both. Thus you sée that <hi>Follye</hi> is my guide, <hi>Temeritie</hi> my horse. Now, the first that shall repent this voyage must néedes bee my selfe, as you maye euidentlye iudge and gather before hande.</p>

and what people shée had gouerned. And thus with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering frase I beganne. My good Mistres, my louing Ladye, my heart, my ioye, my lyfe, my lust, my councell, my hope, my souereigne good, I desire thée most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye (if it please thée) to let mée vnderstande thine auncient procéedinges, and to rehearse what people thou hast go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, how they were ruled, lead, conducted, and counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>Mine exploites (quoth Follye) are innumerable. Ten dayes are not inough to repeate halfe of them. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to accomplish thy request, and to ease the tediousnesse of the waye, I will tell thee of the most principallest. First the worlde and I came together, and because I founde no man in the worlde, I ascended vp into heauen, and there assaulted the excellentest Angel of all the whole companie, called (<hi>Lucifer</hi>) who at my present arriuall, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteyned and receiued me for his gouernesse, and so dyd manie mo of his coequalls. By my counsell he aduaunced himselfe to be fellowe mate with God, for the which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption both he and his were thrust out of heauen, and throwne headlong into hel. That was the first of mine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites.</p>
               <p>Shortly after God made man, and of his ribbe fatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned woman, these two were husband and wife, with them both I had much a doe, because they were full of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and reason. I vsed the helpe and subtiltie of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, to tempt the woman, béeing the weaker, who with his deceiptefull wordes, wonne her to eate of the apple, which God forbadde to bée eaten. But after shee had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, in the presence of her husbande, (because he feared her sadnesse) hée did also eate, to fulfill her desire and lust: wherein they both committed greate follye, for the which they were depriued of innocencie, of GODS grace and glorie, yea, they were banished the place (appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by GOD for them to dwell in) and made (with all their posteritie) subiect to eternall death, it was my second principall exployt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:5155:12"/>Then began my raigne in the world, where I gouerned a number of fooles. I gouerned <hi>Cain</hi> the first borne, both of his father and mother: by my counsell he kild his good bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abel</hi> the innocent. I gouerned the greatest Gyaunts that euer were of the séede of man, as the daughters of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> and the sonnes of <hi>Seth,</hi> I made them trust in their owne strength, not onely touching feates of warre, but I caused them also to contemne the word of God, and the knowledge of the same: I perswaded them to vse their lybertie, and to liue according to their lusts, in lecherie, and all other abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, without regard of the vprightnesse of nature, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, or the feare of God.</p>

                  </note> Then I thought to haue lost my raigne in the world, but in short space they encreased wonderfully. Then I counselled them to builde an high Tower, which might reach as high as heauen, that in despight of God, they might saue themselues, if againe he meant to drowne the world. But God confounded their deuice: and where before all the world spake in one language, he deuided them, so that the Tower remained vnfinished, for the builders vnderstood not each others speach.</p>
               <p>Then the posterities of <hi>Noah,</hi> were dispersed throughout the world, and I raigned amongst them euery where, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selling many Nations to forsake the knowledge of God, and to worship the hoast of heauen, as the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres, the Planets, the Fire, the Water, the Aire, the Earth, and to make Idols, and honour them, in the likenesse of men, of beasts and birds, and to worship them, so that the true knowledge of God should be proper but vnto one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, descended from the loines of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and they are the Iewes.</p>

Marke what <hi>Austen</hi> saith in the tenth booke of the Citie of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:5155:14"/>
God: <hi>It is not lawfull</hi> (saith he) <hi>to offer any sacrifice to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saint, be it Man or Angell, but onely to God.</hi> After the destruction of <hi>Troye, Aeneas</hi> came into <hi>Italy,</hi> bringing with him his owne Idolls, and the Gods of <hi>Troye</hi>: héerevppon Idolatrie tooke force, and increased more and more. I thinke (quod Folly) that this which I haue tolde thée already may suffice to declare, how Idolarie entred the world first. Thou hast heard also, how I gouerned Angells &amp; Nations. Now thou shalt vnderstand how I haue ruled and ordered perticular persons.</p>
               <p>After the floud, I first ruled <hi>Cham, Noahs</hi> sonne, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly giuen to the Magicall Art, obtained and had the name of <hi>Zorastes.</hi> He hated his father, because he loued his other brother better then him. In reuenge whereof vppon a daye he found his father <hi>Noah</hi> drunke, lieng fast a sléepe vpon the ground, vnhonestly he discouered his fathers priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and (by my counsell) he presumed to touch those his secret parts, and inchaunted them by his Magicall Arte, so that euer after for want of abilitie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Berosus.</hi>
                  </note> he could not ioyne issue with any woman, to beget children. His Father being angry thereat, abandoned him for a season. After that, he became the first King and <hi>Saturne</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> insomuch as the holy Scriptures calleth <hi>Cham</hi> the first King of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, by my counsell he trained vp his people, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne nature, in all villany and filthinesse, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirming that men might lawfully vse and haue to doe with their owne mothers, daughters, and sisters, as was the custome before the floud, and also to commit many other vnlawfull déedes, which I am ashamed to declare: by the which doctrine, naturall virginitie was oftentimes violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assaulted and rauished. Then my friend <hi>Cham</hi> went into <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; vsurped the realme to himselfe. And whereas other Princes of his lynage in <hi>Germany, Spaine</hi> &amp; <hi>Fraunce</hi> gaue good examples to their subiects, instructing them in good and godly lawes: he contrariwise, spoyled all the youths in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> corrupting them with all kinds of vices, as vsurie, theft, murther, poysoning and inchauntment, whereof he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5155:14"/>
was the first inuentour, as all Historiographers hold opinion. But when his good father <hi>Noah</hi> vnderstood of it, he came into <hi>Italy,</hi> and hunted him from thence.</p>
               <p>If I should write all the euill déedes of <hi>Cham,</hi> it would be a waightie peece of worke, and the matter would seeme monstrous. But at the last he conueyed himselfe ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Bractiens,</hi> a people inhabiting towardes the <hi>Indians,</hi> where by his inchauntment, the people became his subiects, and he raigned ouer them with great force and power. Yet at the last, he was vanquished and slaine in battaile, by <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> king of <hi>Babilon,</hi> which descended of his race, by his son <hi>Chus.</hi> Thus (quod <hi>Folly</hi>) I lost my friend <hi>Cham,</hi> surnamed <hi>Zorastes, Saturne</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the common enimie of God &amp; man, and one of the most peruerse &amp; vntowardest Tyrants, that euer was in the world.</p>
               <p>I gouerned <hi>Bel</hi> the second king of <hi>Babilon,</hi> and his sonne <hi>Ninus</hi>: into whose heads I put a disordinate raging, so that they desired to liue alone in the world. And to bring this to passe, I counselled them to chaunge and cut off the golden age, which would haue all things common, peaceable, and in quyet. Héerevnto they armed themselues by all possible meanes, vndertaking to spoyle <hi>Sabatius Saga,</hi> surnamed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi> King and Patriarch of <hi>Armenia,</hi> so made and ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his grandfather <hi>Noah.</hi> The same <hi>Sabatius</hi> was son to <hi>Chus,</hi> and brother to <hi>Nemroth,</hi> whom <hi>Moses</hi> called <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> in Hebrue, which in Latine is <hi>Saturnus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the said <hi>Sabatius</hi> king of <hi>Armenia,</hi> hauing hardly escaped the hands of <hi>Bel</hi> &amp; <hi>Ninus,</hi> he went for refuge to his Grandfather <hi>Noah</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; made <hi>Noah</hi> king and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of the <hi>Aborigenes,</hi> &amp; founded him a Citie on the other side of <hi>Tiber,</hi> which he named <hi>Saturnia</hi>: As <hi>Virgil</hi> declareth in a Passage, where he saith thus:
<q>
                     <l>Primus ab aethereo, venit Saturnus Olympo,</l>
                     <l>Arma Iouis fugiens, &amp; regnis exsul ademptis.</l>
                  </q>
That is to say.
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Saturne the first from heauen did flie,</l>
                        <l>For feare of Ioues artillerie.</l>

                        <l>He lost his rule and regiment,</l>
                        <l>And lead his life in banishment.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Bel</hi> the sonne of <hi>Nemroth,</hi> was surnamed <hi>Iupiter.</hi> And it is not likely to be true that some saies, that the same <hi>Saturne</hi> that was chased away by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> was <hi>Nemroth</hi> the king of <hi>Crete</hi>: but the Bible saith, that he was king of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi> which was far distant from the Isle of <hi>Crete.</hi> In those daies, they tearmed the chiefe man in euery house, <hi>Saturne:</hi> their sonnes <hi>Iupiter</hi> or <hi>Ioues:</hi> their daughters <hi>Iunoes,</hi> and their nephewes, <hi>Hercules:</hi> so that we finde in auntient Records, many people named <hi>Saturnes, Ioues,</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to my purpose (quod <hi>Folly</hi>) the aboue named <hi>Ninus</hi> (by my counsell) after the death of his father <hi>Bel,</hi> caused his Picture and standing Image to be made, commaunding eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie manner of person, to doe homage vnto the Idolls of his father and mother, and to adore them with diuine worship: and so he was as you haue heard, the first inuentor of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. I gouerned <hi>Tiphon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cham,</hi> in whom all his fathers vices abounded. He malitiously enuied the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie of his brother <hi>Osiris,</hi> surnamed <hi>Iupiter</hi> the iust, who was a great persecutor of tyrants. It angred me (quod <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>) that so honest a man liued. Then I caused <hi>Typhon</hi> with other Giants to murder <hi>Osiris,</hi> insomuch that <hi>Typhon</hi> cut him in xxvj. péeces, and bestowed them vpon other Giants that helped him to worke his feate. But the good <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Lybia,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Osiris</hi> with the helpe of his other bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, in foughten fielde kilde <hi>Typhon</hi> the Gyant, and the other Tyraunts, which consented to his Fathers death.</p>
               <p>I gouerned (quod <hi>Folly</hi>) one <hi>Iupiter</hi> king of <hi>Crete,</hi> which countrie is now called <hi>Candie.</hi> But forasmuch as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke lyars, &amp; other writers both Latin &amp; French, to enlarge their lyes and dreames, attribute that vnto this <hi>Iupiter,</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, which appertaine not vnto him, I would haue you marke well, that in those daies, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings children &amp; fathers of families wer called <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Iouis,</hi> notwithstanding ther
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:5155:15"/>
are thrée of that name renowmed, as we finde in Histories. The first was <hi>Osiris</hi> the nephew of <hi>Noah,</hi> the son of <hi>Cham</hi>: who was no lesse good then his father was euill. That <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> begate great <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Lybia</hi>: who was King of <hi>Spaine, Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> This great <hi>Hercules</hi> was like vnto his father, a great persecutor of Tyraunts through-out all the world. He begate of <hi>Araxa,</hi> the young <hi>Tuscus,</hi> King of <hi>Tuscane,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Tuscus</hi> begate <hi>Altirus Blascon,</hi> of whom was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten <hi>Camboblascon,</hi> which was (as some say) surnamed the second <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and worshipped in the world. Now this <hi>Camboblascon</hi> surnamed <hi>Iupiter,</hi> begate vpon <hi>Electra</hi> the daughter of <hi>Atlas,</hi> surnamed <hi>Italus</hi> (of whome yet <hi>Italy</hi> beareth the name) <hi>Iasius</hi> and <hi>Dardanus.</hi> This the lyeng <hi>Grecians,</hi> and many other triflers, attribute vnto <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Crete</hi>: which matter is in controuersie, and may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. For <hi>Dardanus</hi> after he had killed his brother <hi>Iasius</hi> by enuie and treason, he fledde into the Isle of <hi>Samos,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Phrigia,</hi> where he founded a Citie called <hi>Dardania,</hi> where he begate a sonne called <hi>Erictonius,</hi> and of him lineally descended <hi>Tros,</hi> who gaue the Citie <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> the name of <hi>Troye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This same <hi>Tros</hi> had thrée children, <hi>Illius, Assaracus,</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> which <hi>Ganimedes</hi> was taken by <hi>Tantalus,</hi> the king of high <hi>Phrygia,</hi> &amp; sold vnto <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed like a Sodomit: which argueth that he begate not <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> the great grandfather of <hi>Ganimedes.</hi> The first <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> then you may perceiue, was <hi>Osiris,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Noah</hi>: whom <hi>Moses</hi> named <hi>Mesraim.</hi> The second <hi>Camboblascon,</hi> king of <hi>Italy,</hi> which some say also had bene king of <hi>Athens</hi> and of <hi>Arcadie</hi>: but I thinke that <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Arcadie,</hi> who begat <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> is some other beside <hi>Camboblascon.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the case standeth, certaine it is, that <hi>Iupiter, Ioues, Osiris,</hi> and <hi>Camboblascon,</hi> were contraries.</p>
               <p>The thirde <hi>Iupiter</hi> renowmed in the world, was Kinge of the Isle of <hi>Crete</hi>: who bare in his Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin and Coate-Armour, an Eagle: but in his manners
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5155:16"/>
he was altogether giuen to Folly. For he deflowred Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, he rauished wiues, abused young children, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all kinde of villanie that was possible, either to bée spoken or done. He committed adulterie with <hi>Alcmena</hi> the wife of <hi>Amphitrio,</hi> of whome he begate little <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi>: he did the like with <hi>Laeda</hi> the wife of <hi>Tindarus,</hi> of whom also he begate faire <hi>Helen.</hi> I loath to tell what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowrings and rapes, he offered &amp; thrust vpon diuers perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular maidens, &amp; faire young children. But notwithstanding his vile life (quod <hi>Folly</hi>) by my meanes the rude people made him a God, &amp; many false liars haue attributed vnto him, the noble deedes of the good Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Nephew <hi>Osiris,</hi> surnamed <hi>Iupiter</hi> the iust.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, they did not onely offer sacrifice vnto him, but also gaue him the title and name of <hi>Most excellent good,</hi> whereas indéed he was most euill: for he was an incestuous and Sodomitical person, and a common enimie to chastitie and honestie, insomuch that people openly in their stage-plaies, counterfetted, sung and descanted vpon the filthy le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and other villanies which he vsed, affirming that such Anticques and Pageaunts were most fit and agreeable vnto him. By meanes whereof, all his subiects gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the same, saieng, that it was as fit for them so to lyue, as for their great God <hi>Iupiter.</hi> I gouerned little <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Alceus,</hi> the bastard sonne vnto the same <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whom he had by <hi>Alcmena,</hi> the wife of <hi>Amphitrio.</hi> Unto this same <hi>Hercules,</hi> the lieng <hi>Greekes</hi> full of vaine eloquence giue the name &amp; title of great <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> of <hi>Lybia,</hi> which is most false. For that <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> was the first Pyrate that euer roued on the Seas, and abounded with all vice, following the steps of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iupiter</hi> the adulterer, in all respects: and as hée liued, euen so he died.</p>
               <p>For being mad (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) he slew his wife &amp; children, &amp; afterwards burned himselfe. But a litle before his death he made <hi>Philoctetes</hi> sweare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wold neuer disclose his death, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manner how he had bestowed himselfe: which thing he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5155:16"/>
did of a vaine, arrogant, proud, &amp; ambitious minde, euen to this end, that the people might report and beléeue that the Gods had drawne him vp to heauen inuisibly: but it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not as he desired. Yet notwithstanding (quoth <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>) I perswaded the lienge <hi>Greekes</hi> that it was so, &amp; made them worship him as a God.</p>
               <p>I gouerned faire <hi>Paris,</hi> king <hi>Priams</hi> sonne, whose sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name was <hi>Alexander.</hi> At the first he made no accompt of me, but leading a contemplatiue lyfe, he followed the lo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In that warres were killed many Princes and noble knights, as <hi>Hector, Achilles,</hi> &amp; <hi>Paris</hi> also was slaine by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loctetes</hi> (the companion of the lesse <hi>Hercules,</hi>) in a combat fought hande to hande.

               <p>I gouerned (quoth <hi>Folly</hi>) faire <hi>Helen</hi> the bastard daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the third <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> begotten of <hi>Laeda</hi> the wife of <hi>Tindarus,</hi> which <hi>Helen</hi> by my counsell, went from her husband <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and suffered her selfe to be rauished

of a yong lecherous <hi>Troyan</hi> named <hi>Paris,</hi> surnamed <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> the sonne of king <hi>Priam.</hi> She brought bloud &amp; death to <hi>Troye,</hi> in stéede of dowrie. For by her occasion <hi>Troye</hi> was destroyed, and <hi>Priam</hi> with the most part of his children killed. And to the ende, that her adulterous mate <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> should not leaue her, and goe to his owne lawfull wife <hi>Pegasis Enone,</hi> she bewitched him with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine drinkes, wherein she was her crafts Mistres: which tricke when one doth vse, he is in such case that he forgets all things past, and all sorrowes present. When she was thus arriued at <hi>Troye,</hi> the good man her husbande <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalaus,</hi> with <hi>Vlisses,</hi> and other <hi>Greeke</hi> ambassadours, came to fetch her awaye: and king <hi>Primamus</hi> commaunded that she should be brought into his presence, offering vnto her franklye with lowde voice, that she should (if she thought good) fréely and with full libertie depart againe into <hi>Greece,</hi> with all her retinue, people, and pelfe. Wherevnto she aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, in the hearing of her husband and king <hi>Priam,</hi> with the rest of his counsel, and commons, that she was not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to retire to her countrie, wishing also that her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Menelaus,</hi> that good man, might go to God, for she was none of his wife, neither would she haue to doe with him: and that she came not to <hi>Troy</hi> against her will, neither did she estéeme of his marriage.</p>
               <p>To conclude, at length <hi>Troy</hi> by treason was taken, and raunsackt .xviii. yeares after she had bene from her husband, and all that space had liued in lecherie with two adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, she grew to agreement, and made peace with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Menelaus.</hi> But when she waxed olde, she looked in a Glasse, and séeing her face farre from faire, she fel in a lowd laughter, and flouted at the fooles that fought ten years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for the loue of a thing that faded so soone away, but when her husband <hi>Menelaus</hi> was dead, two chiefe men of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of <hi>Sparta,</hi> named <hi>Nicostratus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Megapentus,</hi> men of great authoritie, hunted <hi>Helen</hi> out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie &amp; realme of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonia,</hi> without appointing vnto her any place or proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to kéep her.

In the ende we came into a straight, where we found two wayes, one lay on the left hand, which was faire, broad, and entring into a goodly gréene Meddow: the other on the right hand, which was narrow, rockie and full of Mountaines. Being then in a perplexitie, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full which of those waies I might take, <hi>Folly</hi> told me, that the way on the left hand was best and fairest, and <hi>Temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> my horse, kept a flinging to goe that way, so that I had much adoe to rayne him in. Then saide I to <hi>Folly,</hi> that I feared least the gréene grassie way would lead vs into some ditch and quagmire, where we should sticke fast. Besides that, I was more then half discouraged with hir tales which she had tolde me: and though I in heart hated them, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding custome caused me to vse them, not being able to doe otherwise, without Gods grace. Héerevpon I was resolued to take the way that lay on the left hand, <hi>Folly</hi> kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping me companie.</p>
               <p>But as we were thus talking together, I espied two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies comming towards the place where we stoode, (which made me very glad) One of these Ladies rode vpon a white horse, and went in a gowne of costly colours, brauely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered with néedle worke, in the which border, the thrée Diuine, and the foure Morall vertues were written. This Lady was very beautifull, and she séemed naturally to bée fraught with godly graces and gifts, she had a neate body, a

swéete countenaunce, a modest gesture: hir face was not painted, she was alwaies very courteous, she pretended au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and reuerence without flatterie, she was not sowre nor grim, but louely and amiable. The other Ladie rode vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a rats coloured horse, and went in a chaungeable colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red gowne, garnished with gold, and excessiue cost: she wore about hir necke a chaine of golde, with rich Iewells tyed vnto it: hir fingers wer decked with ring vpon ring: she sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue bene delicately brought vp, hir face was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, but I suspected she was painted: hir lookes were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and vnconstant, and she rolled hir eyes euery way.</p>
               <p>This Lady came vnto me before the other, and after sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations, I asked hir, which of the two wayes I shoulde take, to finde perfect felicitie. She aunswered me saieng: My sonne, if thou wilt followe me, I will bring thee a short and pleasant way through a greene Meddow. Be not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for I will lodge thée this night in the Pallaice of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie</hi>: into the which when thou art entred &amp; placed, thou néedest not thinke vpon any thing, but what may best please thy minde and procure thy delight: As fine fare, dauncing, singing, softe lodging, Ladies loue, laughing, hunting, haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, fishing, fowling, riding, running, shooting, bowling, rich araye, and all things also that can be deuised to please thy fantasie: all which pleasures, I will prouide thée with a thousand more. For it is in me to bestow such things vpon them that take me for their Mistresse.</p>
               <p>With these words I was bewitched, and longed to sée this pleasaunt Pallaice, not mistrusting that she was any other than she said and séemed to be. And being desirous to learne hir name, I began thus: my good Lady, may it not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, if I aske your name? My son (quod she) such as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, &amp; haue had experience of my goodnes, call me <hi>Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> and that deseruedly &amp; of good right.

               <p>Then approched the other Lady, which (after salutation done) vttered these words vnto me: Reason required, that I should haue spoken first, but this painted Pecocke, named <hi>Wicked Voluptuousnesse,</hi> puts foorth hir selfe to speake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me alwaies, and to take the tale out of my mouth: Take héede of hir, for doubtlesse hir communication corrupteth &amp; infecteth, euen the very best liuers, with the poyson of hir er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.

               <p>Were the Husband-man any better than a foole, if hée should hope in Harurst to reape Corne of his ground, where he hath sowed no seede, when season serued? Euen so is that man meruailously misinformed, that thinketh to atchieue perfect felicitie, or to reape true blessednesse, hauing not first fallowed his field with Uertue, Good déedes, Faith, Hope and Charitie, which is the High way to Heauen. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman doungeth his ground, soweth his séede, grafteth his trées, tarreth his shéepe, &amp; leadeth his life in labour, hoping to enioy the fruit, the grasse, the graine, the wooll, &amp; general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the profite: the expectation and full accompt whereof, maketh him to take paines with pleasure. Euen so, if thou wilt be content painfully to walke this way, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard either of Rockes or Mountaines, doubt not to finde true felicitie.</p>
               <p>Hauing heard this long and wise admonition, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Lady well, I could not be quyet till I knewe hir name. Wherefore I said, Madame (without offence be it spoken) I pray you what is your name? She aunswered, saieng: My sonne, I am great with God, I am acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints, I am all in all with Angells, I am much estéemed of good men. Without me nothing is done in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and without me no good thing can be done on Earth. I am commonly called, <hi>Felicitie, Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> I gouerne good Kings, Princes &amp; People: I rule Prelates and Ecclesiasticall persons: I stop the mouth of false Prophets and erronious teachers: I hinder their Heresies, and staye their wicked procéedings. I gouerne householders and their families in good order. I am a companion with the louers of learning. I am a husband to all chast wiues, widowes, &amp; vertuous virgins.

               <p>My friends had rather sing Psalmes, then vaine songs: they had rather fast, then be dronke: they had rather praye then cursse: they rise early, and goe to bed late: they haue care of the Common-wealth: <hi>Faith</hi> counselleth them, <hi>Hope</hi> assisteth them, <hi>Charitie</hi> inflameth them, <hi>Wisedome</hi> gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, <hi>Iustice</hi> guideth them: and I doe and wil inrich and incourage them, that all the world shall haue them in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, honour, and reuerence. Yea, though their bodies die, yet their fame shall liue, for others example: and their soules shall remaine immortall, like vnto the state of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells.

followed <hi>Vertue</hi> &amp; left <hi>Voluptuousnesse.</hi> But being amidst mine amaze, I requested my Gouernesse <hi>Folly,</hi> to teach mee quickly which of these two Ladies I were best to follow, for the finding of true felicitie. No sooner had I spoken the word, but sodainly she cast out this language, saieng, that <hi>Vertue</hi> was an Hypocrite, and that hir waye was painfull to passe. But (saith she) if thou follow <hi>Voluptuousnesse,</hi> thou séest hir waye is faire, swéete, gréene and pleasaunt.</p>
               <p>If thou follow <hi>Vertue,</hi> thou submittest thy selfe to colde, heate, hunger, thirst, trauell, paine and werinesse: thou must rise early, and go to bed late: stand in feare, weepe, take care, liue in sorrow: and yet in doubt to haue <hi>Felicitie</hi> at last. If thou offend hir neuer so little in word or déede, she will leaue thée, for she is too seuere, euen in small trifling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Whatsoeuer she saith to thée now, she wil deny when she hath thée among the Rockes and Mountaines: she will leaue thée alone among wilde beastes, to lead thy life in the Wildernesse. Wherefore I aduise thée beléeue hir not, and follow hir not. But let vs take this faire large way on the left hand, through which the greatest part of people do passe, and at night we will lodge in the Pallaice of <hi>Felicitie.</hi> And this I tell thée, that if thou chaunce to mislike of thine enterteinment there, within a daye or two thou maist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, for the way is but short, and then (if thou thinke it good) thou maist climbe ouer the Mountaines, &amp; ride through the way on the right hand.</p>
               <p>These delicate deuises of my friend <hi>Folly,</hi> dashed quite the aduertisements of <hi>Vertue,</hi> whom (with thanksgiuing) I bid farewell, desiring hir not to be offended in that I did not follow hir ouer the Mountaines. Then Lady <hi>Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi> led the way, my horse <hi>Temeritie</hi> trode his trace, <hi>Folly</hi> followed fast at my heeles, <hi>Vertue</hi> viewed vs very well, &amp; came sadly behind me, euen like one that mourned after a dead corse borne to be buried, crieng with a lowde voice: Ah thou arrant Asse, leaue <hi>Voluptuousnesse,</hi> for shee will lead thée to death and destruction.

hir, hir felicitie is false. The language of <hi>Voluptuousnesse,</hi> is a méere charme, with which she vseth to bewitch hir chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this exclamation and rebuke, I went on my waye, and could not away with hir Christian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: which when she saw, she gaue me a furious farewell, saieng: O monstrous man, O bedlam beast, O foole infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, O idiotly Idoll, O shadow of a man: Thou hast no more sense or reson then a Asse, thou showest thy selfe to be shamelesse, in thus framing thy fancie to follow <hi>Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> and to forsake <hi>Vertue.</hi> Wilt thou imbrace world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wealth, rather then heauenly grace?

After we had spent in sport two houres of the time, the Sun began to set, and so I espied the Pallaice of <hi>Worldly Felicite,</hi> wherat I was not a little glad.

respect of any after clap. His bowe and arrowes doe signifie the folly of fooles, which offer themselues to be his Butte, and standeth still while he doth shoote and hit them. His wings signifie the wauering minde of such as he hits, who are quiet in no place or time. For who is more mutable, vaine, light, inconstant, and variable, then the fleshly louer.

And as I ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the towre of <hi>Pride,</hi> which was the fir<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, I spide written this Posie ouer the Porch, <hi>PRIDE IS THE PRINCE AND ROOT OF ALL SINNES.</hi> For as a king is accompanied with a great traine of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitours, euen so hath <hi>Pride</hi> a sort of sinnes for her subiects, ouer whom she raignes Princelike. Againe, as Kings kéepe and holde their owne aright, euen so doth <hi>Pride</hi> behaue her selfe towardes the proude. It is a singular signe of a great reprobate and castaway, when a man liueth longe in <hi>Pride.</hi> For this same displeaseth God more then all other vices: as humilitie pleaseth him more then all other vertues And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the proude aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce themselues aboue all other, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell dealeth with them accordingly. For as the Crow when he is not able to cracke a hard Walnut with his bill, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his flight aloft right ouer some great stone, &amp; letting it fall, breaketh the same, &amp; then alighteth to eate the kirnell:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5155:27"/>
euen so plaieth the Diuel with the proud, for first he aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aloft, &amp; bringeth them to promotion in this world, but when they are in the top of their happinesse, and thinke vpon no daunger, then euen then, comes the diuell, and hée throwes them downe headlonge with a mischiefe, in-to hell.</p>
               <p>The difference betwéene the humble and the proud, may be knowne by that of corne and chaffe. For as chaffe being light, is puft vp aloft with the wind, and is sodeinly consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, wheras contrariwise good corne lieng low, is gathered from the ground, laide vp in garniers, and estéemed of euery body: euen so it falleth out with the pride of the proud, and the humilitie of the humble. Unto pride do apperteine these vices following, namely: <hi>Arrogancie, Presumption, Wrath, Contempt, Heresie, Hipocrisie, Disobedience, Vaine-glory, Ambition,</hi> and such like.</p>
               <p>In the second tower lodged <hi>Enuie,</hi> ouer whose entrie doore this deuise was written: <hi>A FIRE-BRAND OF HELL AND THE DIVELS DARLING.</hi> Now <hi>Enuie</hi> is a sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse &amp; heuinesse of hart, for an others prosperitie. This sin hath souereintie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bad, as <hi>Charitie</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good. <hi>Charitie</hi> is a badge of saluation, <hi>Enuie</hi> of damnation. The enuious man differs not from the diuell in any degrée, they are partners in gaine and in losse. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuell reape profit by doing euil, the enuious man will be sure to follow his trade, for lucre sake. And as the enuious man grudgeth at an others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and good name: so doth he delight in an others losse &amp; ill report. There cannot be a fowler &amp; more cruel sin then <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie</hi>: for she alwaies tormenteth and vexeth her fosterer, I meane the enuious, in whom she dwelleth. He that seeketh to get good by others euil, neuer amends in that mind. And he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> planteth his pleasure vpon an others paine, shall haue such fruit, as he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> grafs figs vpon thornes, or wold make fire to burne by powring water thereon. <hi>Enuie</hi> is a disease hard to be healed, because it lyeth hidden in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart, where the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition cannot come to cure it. There belongs vnto this vice, <hi>Backbiting, Treason, Disdaine,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:5155:27"/>In the third towre dwelt <hi>Wrath,</hi> ouer whose Porch this Posie was written, <hi>THE VERIE MVRTHERER OF HOLY LOVE.</hi> For as holy loue prepares y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conscience to dwell with God, so doth <hi>Wrath</hi> prepare it to dwell with the diuell. <hi>Wrath</hi> taketh away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearing of reason. The wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man will heare the counsel of none. Ther is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth the Image of God more then man, being in perfect loue. For God will be there where vnitie is kept, where people be at peace, and where countries be quiet: which cannot be in a wrathful wretch. A wrathful man is like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one possessed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel, who is euer tormented vntil he hath vomited him out. Wrath maketh men fight, wrath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth blasphemie, by wrath the diuell conquereth countries, wrath is like a musled dogge. For when he cannot bite, yet with snarling he makes others goe together by the eares. And as the Fisher-man troubleth the water because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fish should not see his nettes: euen so the Diuell by wrath trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth man, to the ende he shoulde not vnderstande nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his owne destruction. To the wrathfull man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, inflaming of the heart, indignation, disorder, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, contention, rankor, reuengement, murther, and such like.</p>
               <p>In the fourth towre dwelt <hi>Couetousnes,</hi> whose Posie is this, <hi>IDOLATRY AND A BOTTOMLESSE GOVLFE ARE INSATIABLE.</hi> The couetous man is forsaken of God, for he loues his gaine better then God: he had rather loose God then goods. For litle triflles that touch his profit, he sweares &amp; lyes, which is a thing most damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> which he should haue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, <hi>Couetousnes</hi> turnes it to riches. The couetous mans heart is all vppon his goods, and not vppon God: for where the heart is, there is also a mans loue. The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man offendeth in euill gettinge, in euill vsing, and in euill louinge his goods. The couetous man is gouerned by the Diuell, hazardinge his soule to eternall torment, for the lewde loue of temporall toyes. And as the Mouse is caught in the trappe, whilest shée hopeth to gette the Baite:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5155:28"/>
euen so is the couetous man by the diuell, in hunting after riches. The couetous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is like vnto a hog, whose life doth little good to anie man, but rather great harme, by reason of the noisomensse &amp; filthie stinke, which that nastie beast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth: but when the Butcher hath killed him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he yéelds profite, because he nourisheth, &amp;c. Euen so the couetous man whiles he liueth, doth good to none, but rather damnifies his neighbours, marie when Gods slaughter-man (<hi>Death,</hi> I meane) comes, and destroieth him, then those that liue, fares the better. The couetous man is like vnto a band dog, that féedeth vpon carrion, and will admit no companion to take part with him, but eating all alone, and filling his guttes till he burst, he dyeth, and the foules of the aire deuour him. The couetous man hoordeth vp his goods, and suffereth the néedie to starue. The couetous man croweth ouer the poore, the diuell croweth ouer him. And vppon Couetousnesse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend these monsters, <hi>Vserie, Simonie, Fraude, Periury,</hi> and all <hi>Sacriledge, Deceipt, Extortion, Oppression,</hi> &amp; the diuell.</p>
               <p>In the fift towre dwelt <hi>Guttony,</hi> ouer whose portall this posie was written. <hi>VENEMOVS WINE, AND DEADLY DAINTIES.</hi> Truth it is, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the throate is the gate of the body, you know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when an enimie would win a castle, if he once get in at the gate, he makes no doubt of winning the hold: euen so the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, when he hath entered in at the throate, it is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but he will winne both the head and bodie. Nowe, his custome is to enter with many sinnes, of whome <hi>Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> is the mother. For the drunkard &amp; immoderate féeder, consenteth to all vice. Therefore it is requisite to set a good porter to kéepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throat, least the diuel get in. For as a man may lead his horse when he hath him by the bridle: euen so may the diuell rule a man, hauing once gotten holde of his mouth by gluttonie, yea, he then possesseth him wholy. The seruant being corne fed, ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times rebelleth against his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body hauing receiued excesse, &amp; more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inough, is apt to rebell against the spirit. <hi>Gluttony</hi> kils more then the swoord of the enimie, it makes many die sooner then they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5155:28"/>
should by nature. Excessiue eating and drinking corrupteth the bodie, and ingendreth diseases. By <hi>Gluttonie</hi> men bee franked, as Capons are crammed. A Glutton is worse than a Hogge that féedeth filthely: and yet the Hogge is like his syre, of whom he takes his manners, and doth but his kinde. They y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> make Tauernes their Temples, are like a Hog wallowing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mire. For as the filthie hog tumbleth in mire &amp; durt, euen so do gluttons &amp; dronkards oftentimes wallow in damnable <hi>Dronkennesse</hi> and <hi>Gluttonie.</hi> Upon this fowle sinne, other sinnes doe depend, as namely Grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse of meate, Deuouring, Daintinesse, Excesse, Dulnesse of féeling, Foolish mirth, Uaine babling, Ribaudrie and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely beastlinesse.</p>
               <p>In the sixt Tower liued <hi>Lecherie,</hi> whose Posie was: <hi>A COMMON AND FILTHIE WHORE, DEFILETH BOTH BODY AND SOVLE</hi> For the filthines of a Harlot corrupteth a man within and without. Of all sinnes, this sin of <hi>Lecherie</hi> is the pleasan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to the Diuel, because it hurteth both bodie and soule and because he was neuer toucht with it, being a spirite, and no bodie. Were not the Marchant a flat foole to make any bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, knowing before that he shall repent it after? Euen so the Lechourer takes much paines, he spendes his goods to accomplish his desire: but afterwards he repenteth both his paines, his cost &amp; his purchase: neuerthelesse, with that repentance he is not forgiuen of God, vnlesse a full purpose and resolute intent of amendement insue and follow ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon. The Lechourer in his life is thrée waies tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: first with the heat of the harlot, secondly with the paine of his hurt, and thirdly with the worme of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. He burnes in concupiscence, he stinkes with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, his conscience accuses him for his offence. <hi>Lecherie</hi> is a ditche, wherein the Diuell hurles other sins. To behold a woman wantonly, is a great alluring to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie</hi>: so that good were it, not to looke vpon hir at all: but much better not to touch or meddle with hir carnally. Sixe other sinnes waite vpon <hi>Lecherie,</hi> to wit: <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

It is most fit to acknowledge a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor &amp; an encreaser of that good &amp; goodnes which we do daily receiue: as also to confesse our selues sinners, &amp; God the forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. But as people are dul to do good déeds, so are they swift to commit sinne. Many euills grow by <hi>Sloth,</hi> whereof two be perillous, and <hi>Sloth</hi> hir selfe confesseth no lesse: namely, to neglect a conuerting vnto Christ, and a carelesnesse of confessing sinne. Whereby it commeth to passe, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times many depart this life, not confessing themselues to haue offended God, neither yet conuerting or turning vnto him: in doing whereof they hazard both bodie and soule.

hils themselues, were very sightly &amp; seruiceable. For on the one side was a goodly vineyard, wherin grew grapes of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie sorts: on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other side it yéelded great quantitie of grain: another side were proper woods, which yéelded great store of good timber &amp; trées, wherin bred all manner of braue birds.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O long as the Knight continued in this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent Pallaice of worldly desire, following his owne fantasie, by vaine <hi>Voluptuousnes</hi> enticed, he did no other thing but playe the foole, daunce, leape, sing, eate, drinke, hawke, hunt, fish, fowle, haunt whores, and such like, (as did the prodigall sonne) and led a dissolute life, for the space of eleuen daies. Which signifies a meruailous mysterie, and vnfortunate. For the number eleuen, by the opinion of Christian Doctors and Philosophers, is a wicked and vnluckie number, for that the number of x. signifies the x. Commaundements of God: and the number xi. which is one more, prophecieth and foretelleth the transgressing of them. Wherefore the Knight hauing remained xi. dayes in that Pallaice, greuously transgressed the wil of God, letting loose the bridle to his lewd affections, without refraining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of them. If you note well the premises, and sée into the sequel, you shall find, that such as liue after the order of that Pallaice of worldly Felicitie, being giuen to followe the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5155:30"/>
pompe and pride of the world, with the plesures and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnesse of the same, and seeme willing to lead that life without purpose of change, nay rather, triumphing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioicing therein: I say, and I say truly, that such are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours of Gods Lawes. Contrariwise, such as accompt themselues héere to be but Pilgrimes, and fixe their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the other world, where royally raigneth Iesus Christ, reputing this lyfe an exile, &amp; desiring to be deliuered out of it, to the ende they may enter in at the Pallaice of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly King, shall enioy the fulnesse and happinesse thereof.</p>

And as the x. Commandements were written in two tables: euen so are they deuided into two parts. The first comprehendes thrée, concerning the loue of GOD.

And therefore who so leades his life worldling like, and fixeth his felicitie in <hi>Voluptuousnesse,</hi> is doubtlesse a vessell of the Diuell: and loueth not God, nor his neighbour, because he transgresseth the lawe of God, which followeth in due and conuenient order.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had soiourned xi. daies in the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, transgressing Gods commandements, &amp; leading a beastly life: I desired to ride into the forests therabouts, not intending to giue ouer voluptuous life, but for my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, because I was weary of making good chéere. For although worldlings delight to eate, drinke, daunce, leape, sing, ride, run, and such like: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they cannot continue in this trade of life, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingling it with some recreation. Wherfore they often leaue by that constraint, their pastimes, though they intend to returne therto againe. They do not vtterly abandon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but breake off for a season, to procure them better appetite. I then being weary was willing to sée the warrens &amp; other pleasures, which when my gouernesse <hi>Folly</hi> vnderstood, she told the tale to Lady <hi>Voluptuousnesse,</hi> and the consented to hunt or hawke with me, whereof I was right glad. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I apparailed my selfe in hunters guise, taking in stéede of my helmet, a hat ful of fethers, for mine armour, a horne: &amp; I lept vpon <hi>Temeritie</hi> my horse. <hi>Voluptuousnes</hi> had a hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, <hi>Folly</hi> a Ienet, &amp; the other Ladies euery one of them a Palfray. There came the huntsmen with greahounds &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiues, whooping hallowing &amp; galloping altogether, some one way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some another. The dogs wer at a beck, vp starts y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hare the crie was heuenly to heare. But in the midst of al our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime, I chaunced to breath my horse, &amp; turning towards the Pallaice of worldly felicitie, sodainly I saw it sinke into the earth, &amp; euery body therein. But what lamentable outcries they made, you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue reson, are to iudge. Then did ther rise amongst vs a whirlwinde with an earthquake, which set vs al asu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, insomuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I &amp; my horse, sunk in mire vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: only remained with me al this while, my mistres <hi>Folly.</hi> This earthquake yelded such an aire of brimstone, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the like hath not ben felt. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I perceiued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I was far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plesant pallaice, gardens, orchards, &amp; vineyards of <hi>Voluptuousnes,</hi> but rather in a beastly bog sticking fast: &amp; nothing neere me, but serpents, snakes, adders, toads, and venemous wormes.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:5155:32"/>
Such was my perplexitie in this case, that I fel in dispaire, being not able to speake one word, I was so sore amased.</p>
               <p>But when I came againe to my senses, reuiued from death to life, and found my selfe in that beastly bog, I tare my haire, I rent my clothes, I wept, I waild, I howld, I cride, I wrong my handes, I stroke my breast, I scratcht my face, I bit mine armes, and spake thus. O wretch, O Asse, O miserable soule, O caitiue, O fondlyng. Where is now thy Pallaice of worldly felicitie? Where are now thy braue chambers hanged with cloath of Arisse? Where are now thy gallant Gardens, thy Orchardes, thy Meddowes, thy Corne-fields, thy Cofers of coine, thy Ladies of Loue, thy Hawkes, thy Hounds, thy Horses, thy Oxen, thy seruaunts, thy softe beddes, thy good cheere, thy wines, thy Musicke, thy pleasures, and all the things which thou hast abused? Alas wicked wretch, how hast thou bene deceiued? Thou though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thou hadst bene in the Pallaice of true <hi>Felicitie,</hi> and for <hi>Felicitie</hi> thou findest <hi>Vanitie.</hi> Thou hast bene wickedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted, thus to finde euill in stéede of good. Héere withall I turned my selfe toward <hi>Folly,</hi> and railed at hir, saieng: O cursed, cruell, and deceiptfull beast, O monstrous moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of mankinde: O filthie bawde: O venemous Uiper: Is this the good hap I should haue? Is this the place of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie whether thou shouldest bring me?</p>
               <p>Cursed be the daye that euer I sawe thée, Cursed be the daye that euer I heard thee, Cursed be the daye that euer I beleeued thée, Cursed be the daye that euer I followed thee. Is it euen so, that thus thou gouernest, euen beastly and damnably? Is it euen so, that thus thou leadest people, euen to perdition? Where is the felicitie thou promisedst me? Where is the good hap I should haue by thee? It is chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to me euen as I doubted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, when thou discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedst thy filthie feates, beginnings and procéedings: howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, thine inchantments and thy flatterie caused me to kéepe thée companie, when full faine God wot, I would haue ben rid of thée. But such was mine arrogant ignorance, &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt arrogancie, that I followed thy daungerous counsell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:5155:32"/>When I had thus scowlded &amp; tooke on, the lewde lossell lowdly laught me to scorne. Whereat béeing in rage, I offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to draw my sword, but it would not be: then I spurred my horse, but he wold not lift vp his legges. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, I carried the minde still I might get out: not hauing helpe, euen by my owne strength and industrie. But be you sure of this, that after a man is once sunke in sin, &amp; drowned in fleshly voluptuousnesse, he shall sticke fast &amp; not be able to recouer himselfe, vnlesse he haue the help of Gods grace, which he of his goodnesse giue vs all, Amen.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as contrariwise, thou shewest thy selfe, vaine, cruel, vnquiet, vncerteine, cursed, and desperate. And because thou wouldest bestowe thy poisons and not be perceiued, thou couerest it ouer with a lyttle honnie of delight. O foolish worldlings, and louers of <hi>Voluptuousnesse,</hi> why suffer you your selues to be so fowlye abused? Why flye you not from her, since you knowe she is dampnable? Why doe you beléeue a lyar? Why doe you follow a deceiuer? Why become you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with such a murtherer? Why doe you not purge your vnderstandings of erronious opinions? Why consider you not what the world is, with a perfect iudgement? If you did all this, you should finde your selues out of the way. For worldly goods, voluptuousnesse, and pleasure, are mingled rather with sowre things, then with swéete.</p>

The eye, the flesh, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pompe of lyfe, is the worldlings felicitie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is their heauen. If all goodnes come of God (as most true it is) &amp; that concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence of the eie, of the flesh, &amp; the pride or pomp of lyfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of the diuell, are not they deceiued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thinks it good, or fixe their affection to follow it? I could saie, ther is a gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conscience to torment the worldlings. I could say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the voluptuous man hath the wrath of God hanging ouer his head. I could saie eternall death is reserued for his reward. After excessiue eating &amp; drinking comes surfets, agues, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, losse of wit, dropsies, losse of appetite, griping in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> guts, palsies, weakening of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, infamy, &amp; shame. Now to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nory,</hi> wherin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voluptuous man taketh such plesure, as in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more.

Their desire cannot be atchieued without losse. For we sée that lecherie and gluttonie bréedeth pouertie, which is a very heauy burthen. But I imagine it costeth nothing, as oftentimes it chaunceth, mouing such as be rich: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they féele euen what follows, namely, losse of body &amp; soule. Touching the sin of lecherie, a man therein is like vnto a beast. For in his blinde delight he is depriued of reason, &amp; therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deede declareth it selfe to bée damnable.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:5155:33"/>
This sin bringeth her reward in this world, as dropsies, palsies, leprosies, gowtes, burnings, botches, &amp; <hi>French</hi> poxe, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very worst, the commonnest, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loathsomest, &amp; the most infectious disease of al: besids y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al honest company, decay of strength, &amp; losse of good name &amp; fame.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse &amp; lechery, hauing heere so many hels. Abstinence or forbearance doth not warne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take héed therof, though it be their onely medicine. Now touching concupiscence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes, wherby couetousnesse &amp; desire of riches is vnderstood: First, though gold &amp; siluer be but carth, what vexation hath the couetous man to atchiue it? He saileth ouer tempestuous seas, he climbeth ouer monstrous mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains, he diggeth déepe into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bowels of the earth, he suffereth hunger, thirst, colde, heat, &amp; a thousand mischiefs. One is drowned, another kild, the third robbed, &amp; he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath obteined his purpose liueth in feare to lose it: the couetous man suspects euery body. It is not cofers ful of coine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can make men happy. Our Sauiour tearms it trash &amp; thornes, because it pricks y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart, &amp; corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth both body &amp; soule. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>He that wisheth wealth in the world, falleth into temptation.</hi> Is not <hi>Iudas</hi> an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who in a case of couetousnesse hanged himselfe. Now to concupiscence of pride. He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath honour, authoritie, might, estimation, &amp; dignitie in the world, thinketh he is happy: but such are loden w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnhappinesse. For what paines, labour &amp; vexation endures y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ambitious man, before he can come to dignitie, honour, &amp; authoritie? And when he hath it with all these vexations, he is not sure how long he shal enioy it. We see oftentimes Fortune turnes hir whéele, &amp; that the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ende their liues with infamye.

               <p>
                  <hi>Valerianus</hi> the great Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> euen he that persecuted the Christians, and did much mischiefe, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by his enimie the king of <hi>Persia,</hi> who against the lawe of armes, made him lye downe whiles he troad on his back to leape on his horse.</p>

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let this be a conclusion, that honour, authoritie &amp; digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is no heritage.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, what labours, trauailes, vexations, &amp; perills do Princes passe through, euen at this present, to mainteine themselues in their estates? What warres and slaughters haue bene committed, partly to get and partly to kéepe rule and regiment? whereby you may perceiue, that worldly fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie is ful of ficklenes. Ambitious worldlings cannot play with their pleasures, if they haue not first passed some of these vexations. In youth men runne their race without regard of conscience, but when age comes on, &amp; nothing left for lust, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> white haires, a walking staffe or crutch, a paire of spectacles, Cotton put in the eares: when none of these things can helpe him, then must he endeauour the gnawing of conscience, which <hi>Voluptuousnesse</hi> kept hidden, a long time.

               <p>What discomfort is it, when co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science accuses the old man of his young yeares wickedly wasted? But as the elect line in hope, so doe the reprobate in dispaire. He that followeth <hi>Voluptuousnesse</hi> is Gods enimie.

come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of his sins, &amp; confesse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same to God. All this is figured in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospel, wher our Lord Iesus raised y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> widows child, which was carried out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of <hi>Naim,</hi> to be buried: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bearers to stay, &amp; hauing touched the Cofin of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corps, with a loud voice he said, <hi>Young man arise,</hi> &amp; straight way the dead body rose vp &amp; spake: Which done, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord deliuered him to his sorowfull mother.

The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows child representeth soules dead in sin. The Cofin repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> naturall body, wherein lieth the sinfull soule. The foure bearers which carrie the dead soule to hell, represent hope of long life, custome of sinning, delaieng of repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; contempt of Gods word. Neuertheles, when our Lord will raise to life this dead soule, he commandeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bearers to stay, afterwards toucheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, sending vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinners aduersity, diseases, &amp; misfortunes.

These by impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie being vnable to arise of themselues, is it not necessary, that God say to the soule, <hi>Arise,</hi> there is no difference betwéene his saieng &amp; doing. For what he saith, he doth. And therfore if the Lord say once, <hi>Arise</hi> to the soule, she riseth, &amp; then hée diliuereth her to her mother the Church, which was sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for her sinnes. In like manner God to raise me from my sinnes, sendeth me aduersitie, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end I should acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge mine iniquitie, &amp; with humility turne vnto him, which I cannot do without his heauenly grace, much lesse atchiue true felicitie and blessednesse, vnlesse he helpe. Then was I warned by the scourges of God, that liuing worldling lyke, and following <hi>Voluptuousnesse</hi> I was not happie, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, being full of filthinesse and infection, tumbling in the mire of all iniquitie, from the which I could not withdrawe my selfe, for that the eies of reason were closed vp by <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnesse,</hi> which afterwards wer opened by <hi>Gods grace.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord God Father and maker of all things, I am not worthy to lift vp mine eyes towards thee, nor to aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the infinit sinnes, wherein I confesse my selfe guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

               <p>As I was thus praieng with a willing minde, shedding teares, striking my brest, conceiuing griefe &amp; sorow for my sins, sodeinly I sawe a Lady descending fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen downe, setting her self before me fast by the bog, wher I stuck fast.

In the end with all reuerence I made my

petition vnto her, saieng: O good &amp; gracious Lady, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou be, I most humbly beséech thée if thou canst, that it would please thée to help me out of this beastly bog of filthy infection. For nothing is néere me but venemous serpents &amp; noisome vermine. In the name of God therfore I craue thy help. To y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which my request she answered: O foole &amp; abused beast, thou séest now what reward <hi>Voluptuousnes</hi> yéeldeth thée for following hir. If thou hadst beléeued my daughter, thou hadst not bene in this miserie.</p>
               <p>Then I asked hir who was that daughter of hirs, she answered saieng, the swéete Gentlewoman that admonished thée a xi. daies past, to leaue <hi>Voluptuousnes,</hi> &amp; to follow hir: whom because thou beléeuedst not, but neglectedst hir coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, thou lyest in this vnhappinesse. By this speach of hirs, I knew she was <hi>Gods grace,</hi> and the mother of <hi>Vertue.</hi> Then fell I on my knées, &amp; weeping, thus I said: O deare Lady my cursed counseller <hi>Folly</hi> drew me from thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I most vnhappy wretch beléeued hir: which deede of mine grieues me greatly, and now I crie thée mercie, most humbly desiring thée of thy clemencie, to deliuer me out of this filthie infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; I promise &amp; vow vnto thee (henceforth) to follow thée.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5155:38"/>
haue brought to thy Schoole, that he might forget the euill which he hath learned abroade, and to be instructed in the good, which he neuer yet knew. And being receiued into the schoole of <hi>Repentance,</hi> I learned to liue wel, and forgot all the euill which I was taught in times past. And whereas before I learned to leape, daunce, eate, drinke, playe, haunt whores, and to do all villanie and mischiefe, now I learned a new lesson, namely: to knéele, to mourne, to fast, to pray, and to liue well: flat contrary to all that I vsed in the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice of worldly felicitie. Then <hi>Repentance</hi> said to <hi>Gods grace,</hi> that my hatte full of feathers, and all things els about me, must be put off, and cast away. Then at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of <hi>Gods grace, Repentance</hi> began to take off these toyes, and first she hurled my hat of hautinesse into the dungeon, then off went my girdle of intemperance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto was tyed my sword of rebellion, which being broken in peeces, with my coate of vaineglory, my hosen of lewde delight, and my dublet of ill desires, all were throwne into the lake, and there remained onely with me my shirt of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciuiousnesse, the which also she wold haue pluckt ouer mine eares: but I entreated hir earnestly not to leaue me naked. So I was for a while excused, but not altogether: for sayd <hi>Repentance,</hi> except thou cast of all the apparell of the olde man, thou canst not come to my Schoole. Then <hi>Repentance</hi> sayd vnto me: Sonne, thou must enter in at this straight hole, whereout I came. But when I complained and said, that it was vnpossible, because my head would not in, shée sayd there was no other waye nor entrance into hir schoole. Then I called to minde what our Lord said in the Gospell of <hi>Mathew, The waye is straight, which leadeth to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life, and very fewe walke that waye.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now as I stoode wondering at the narrow hole, I saw an olde Serpent enter in, who for lacke of roome, lefte his skinne behinde him, and presently returned all renued, and young. Whereat as I meruailed, <hi>Gods grace</hi> tolde me, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng, Thus thou must doe: for in entring the Schoole of <hi>Repentaunce,</hi> thou must leaue thy olde skin behinde thée,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:5155:39"/>
and afterwards thou shalt returne a new man. This is it which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle speaketh of,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.</note> saieng: <hi>Put off the old man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, corrupted with ill thoughts, and put on the new man, which is to be created according to God, in iustice and holinesse of truth.</hi> The olde man is the affection of sinne, and the former euill life, which is lefte behinde in the schoole of <hi>Repentaunce,</hi> and the new man is the good life, which is newly begun in holines &amp; truth. As <hi>Gods grace</hi> was thus teaching me, I saw an olde Eagle, heauie eied &amp; thicke fethered, fluttring aloft. This Eagle falling downe, diued thrée times into a faire fountaine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, &amp; presently returned young &amp; lustie, which miracle made me maruell more then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the Serpent. Then said <hi>Gods grace,</hi> Like as this Eagle is returned from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of water, young and lustie: euen so shalt thou after thou art come to Christ with sorrow for thy sinne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the same, which if thou doe, thou shalt receiue thy first innocencie, which I gaue thée in thy Baptisme.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Gods grace</hi> entered into the Schoole of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce</hi> before me, saieng: I will drawe thée in, for it is none but I that sheweth sinners the way to <hi>Repentaunce.</hi> With y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she pluckt me in, &amp; foorthwith I became an enimie to sin. Now therfore let no man glorifie himselfe, séeing it is <hi>Gods grace</hi> that goeth before mans will, &amp; that by it man is made good. Then I entering in after, &amp; being a little way in, the passage waxed wider, <hi>Gods grace</hi> plucking me in by the head, &amp; <hi>Repentaunce</hi> thrusting at my féete. So then in passing in at the narrow place, I left lasciuiousnes my shirt behinde me, torne in péeces, which she hurled into the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and all my body was scratched. This doth <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce</hi> prepare hir scholler, for if any by mouth doth confesse his former sinnes, not hauing inward sorrow &amp; hart-griefe for offending God, and good intent and full purpose to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his life, he is greatly abused. For thinking to haue Gods blessing, he shall be sure of curssing.</p>
               <p>But to my purpose, <hi>Repentaunce</hi> put on my naked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, such apparell as she hir selfe did weare, which when I

saw, I thought vpon the Apostles, not that I thought my selfe as good as they, but hoping to come (by <hi>Gods grace</hi>) to the place where they are, I was well content to doe as they did.</p>

               <p>In such sort God sendes to sinners, a winde of terrour, to breake the mightie Mountaine of pride, &amp; the heart more harde then the rocke. After that comes the troubling of the soule, after that comes the conscience, grudging the hart of the sinner, and accusing him of his euill life: but yet the Lord is not there with his quickening Grace. Neuerthelesse these be forerunners to prepare the way of the Lord. For when the peruerse will of man is mortified by seruile feare, and led almost to hell, after comes the swéete sound of <hi>Gods grace,</hi> which reuiueth the soule, saieng: <hi>Lazarus come forth.</hi> This is the voice that giueth consolation, at the hearing whereof we may be bold to depart in peace, with assurance of remission of our sinnes. But it séemes that <hi>Repentance</hi> began first (in the Knight) at loue, and that miraculously: for he being in the filth of his sinne, sodainly by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence confessed his folly, and loathing his lewde lyfe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired helpe and succour of <hi>Gods grace,</hi> who presently assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him and brought him out of the sinke of sinne. But this manner of conuersion is not ordinarily vsed.</p>
               <p>There are indéede certeine forerunners to the iustifieng of sinners, which prepare the way to Gods reuiuing or quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening grace, and offereth vnto God a renewed spirit, and a pure and vpright heart: which manner of conuersion, godly people onely doe vse. And héereof meaneth the Knight to speake, purposing also to shew how it digresseth from Gods grace. When <hi>Repentaunce</hi> had thus apparailed me, with haire &amp; sackcloth, I was set vpon a stoole, &amp; then <hi>Gods grace</hi> appeared vnto me, with two women, &amp; one man which was a preacher. Now one of the women held in hir right hand a sharp pricking yron rod, called the gnawing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conscience) and in hir left hande she had a red booke, whereat I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid. For as she beheld me, my thought she threatened me. The other woman was curteous milde and gentle, holding in hir right hand a booke of golde, couered with pearles, and she was called <hi>Remembrance.</hi>

                  <hi>Gods grace</hi> placed Conscience on my left hand, and Remembraunce on my right hand, the Preacher, <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,</hi> and her Damselles about me, and then comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Conscience to open the red booke, which when I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and sawe the wordes written with bloud, declaring all my offences, with tormentes vnto them belonging, for my following of <hi>Folly,</hi> I was amazed and became speachlesse. Then Conscience with hir yron rod toucht me, prickt mee, yea, pearced my heart, and cried aloud vnto me, saieng: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thou wretch, view this booke, &amp; thou shalt sée how thou hast liued, euen against God, and contrarie to right and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Thou hast bene a proud, arrogant, ambitious, spitefull at others prosperitie, a prolonger of time, wrathfull, a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter, iniurious, traiterous, hatefull, couetous of gold, more then of God, gluttonous, wanton, shamelesse, a stewes haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, giuen to all vices, &amp; hast transgressed al the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, leading a loathsome life, denieng God, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and blaspheming his name, an hainous offender, a false witnesse bearer, a lyar, a desirer of other mens goods, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to parents, cursing them and wishing their death. Furthermore, thou hast had neither faith nor hope in God, but rather in the force, riches, honour, and friendship of thy kinred, with their authoritie. I cannot recken vp the rest of thy sinnes, for they are vncountable. Uerie little care hast thou had of Christs merites, or of thy own soules helth, but alwaies yéelding to <hi>Voluptuousnesse,</hi> filthines, &amp; iniquitie.</p>
               <p>When Conscience had thus accused me, sorrow for sin fel bitterly a wéeping, and oftentimes stroke her brest. Then Conscience shewed me what torments I had deserued, for following voluptuous affections, and for louing them better then God. Thou oughtest sayd she, to burne in hell fire that neuer quencheth, &amp; to be nipped with torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts both of body and soule, for euer more.

Hearing my conscience thus speak, my thought I sawe hell open to swallowe me vp, and with sorrowfull sadnesse I fell to the ground, before <hi>Gods grace,</hi> speachlesse: but she had compassion vpon me, and bad me rise, the which I did, though halfe in dispaire, and to recomfort me, shée opned the booke which <hi>Remembraunce</hi> held in her hand.</p>

For of his great loue, he sent his onely son to take mans nature vpon him in the world, that in the same he might suffer death vpon the Crosse, for the remission of sinnes. Consequently he promised for the loue of his sonne, remission and pardon to all poore sinners, so often as they require it in faith, with a heauy and sorrowfull heart. Now God is as true of his promises, as he is of power able to performe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And as he is of power, so will he doe whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer pleaseth him.

hath promised to pardon their sinnes, he forgiueth. The truth héereof is written in plaine wordes, &amp; shewed by examples in many places of the holy Scripture, as well in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old testament as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new. First <hi>Esay</hi> saith, <hi>It is I my selfe,</hi>

               <p>IN the name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, of the son, &amp; of the holy Ghost, Amen. The great goodnes &amp; vnspeakable mercie which hath ben vsed in al ages &amp; times, of our Lord &amp; sauiour Iesus Christ towards all poore sinners, are in many places of the Gospel made manifest, &amp; cleerly notified: but chiefly in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vii. of <hi>Luke.</hi> Wherin mention is made of a sinful woman, lewd of life, &amp; ill of name, contemned, despised, &amp; abhorred of men, whom swéet Iesus, did not onely receiue to fauour, but also by inward &amp; secret inspiration drew her to repentance, how &amp; in what sort, heare &amp; vnderstand. The Gospell saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther was a Pharesie furnished with false faith, &amp; misled with a vaine opinion of holinesse: he was a great doctour of law, &amp; a renowmed Iusticiarie, howbeit weak in faith, &amp; yet verie high minded.

The proud Pharesie praied him to come into his house &amp; to dine with him. The good Lord which had taken vpon him mans nature, and was borne for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saluation of all, denied not this proud fellows re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, neither refused to enter into his house, although hée was ambitious, but down at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table sat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> son of God, made man, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men.

Now he being set at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table, ther came one vnto him in shape like a woman, but in courage a man, who by the bruite of the whole Citie, was counted a greate sinner,

and very il reported of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, &amp; such a one indéed as euery body mocked &amp; pointed at with their fingers.

               <p>This woman hearing by report, the renowne of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemer, &amp; that he shewed himselfe swéete and bountiful to all sinners, defending them against the malitious slaunders &amp; mocks of the proud and arrogant Pharesies, &amp; promising to euery one that beleeued in him the kingdome of heuen: this woman was inspired both outwardly and inwardly by our Lord &amp; Sauiour Iesus Christ, to sée &amp; heare him preach. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did she by outward speach expresse, how she was inwardly affected &amp; moued in minde, &amp; séeing her soule sore sicke &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased, her heart full of iniquitie and sinne, her conscience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with all kinde of vice, her selfe frustrate and void of all hope of health, &amp; deuising how to recouer this malady, adres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her selfe to séeke him, who is the onely Surgeon of all sicke soules: she sought for grace at the Well of mercie, and though she was a shamefull sinner, yet she was receiued of him which came into the world to saue sinners. She came not pompeously araied, nor yet came with a train, she came alone, and not emptie handed: For she brought with her a boxe full of most pretious ointment, of a swéete smell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> lodged in her heart.</p>
               <p>What could this be but the swéete smell of vertue? For what represented the boxe of Alabaster stone, but holy faith founded vpon the true cornerd stone, Iesus Christ, wherin is conserued all vertues, &amp; without which it is vnpossible to please God. Came she alone, being accompanied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

She entred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house vncalled, wher was her phisition, &amp; putting a part al shame, which leadeth to perdition, together with the mockes of the proud Pharesies, which sat at the table, she craued comfort and health for her sicke soule, acknowledging her griefe,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5155:44"/>
and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being certein he to whom she came, had power to help hir. Unto this phisition she could not haue come w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out faith, she was not so bold &amp; hardy as to look Iesus in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> face, but fel at his féete vpon hir knées, lamentably: weeping and with the floude of hir teares washing his féete, and wiping and drieng them with hir hairie looks. Then she kissed them, and with hir precious ointment, she anoynted them.</p>
               <p>All this while hir voice was not heard, but hir heart spake vnto the true Sonne of God, saieng: I haue no need to declare with my tongue my inward griefes, or to expresse the cause of my comming hether, séeing thou knowest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the heart. Unto thée I come, O Christ, for remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my sinnes, offering to thee my sorrowfull heart for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Surely this womans working, well waied, giueth euidence; that she was right heartely sorie, for hir offences. For hir Christall eies, and hir faire face, which was wont to be painted with costly coulours for the adourning of hir beautie, to allure licentious louers, and so lyke voluptuous worldlings, is now turned into teares. Hir body which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time was giuen to delights, is now afflicted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fasting: hir laughing, is turned to wéeping: and as hir first life, was wholy bent to please the world, so now it is more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earnestly disposed to please God.</p>
               <p>With hir faire flaxen haire which she was wont to kéepe daintely, she hath dried our Sauiours feete: hir swéete lips, wherewith she vsed to kisse hir louers, haue kissed his feete: hir odoriferous oyntment, wherwith she beautified hir face, in wantonnes, hath anointed our Sauiours feete. Now all this was a sure signe of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> &amp; <hi>Charitie,</hi> &amp; thus you sée how we ought to repent. Surely, we shuld doe according to S. <hi>Paules</hi> doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Euery me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, which hath consented to commit iniquitie, shuld be offered vnto the Lord,</hi>

Hast thou bene blasphemous? Be now fearefull to speake any thing but truth. And so consequently to euery vilde vice, laye a méete medicine, which may serue for thy sicknesse, and expel the poyson of sinne.</p>
               <p>But now let vs sée, what may be thought and iudged of this Pharesie, who so sawcely besought our Lord and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to come into his house. Surely he seemed as he was, a vainglorious Hypocrite. For when he saw the wofull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man falne at the feete of our Sauiour, with hir teares wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing them, with hir haire wiping them, with hir mouth kissing them, &amp; with hir precious ointment anointing them, he blamed not onely hir, in his heart: but also our Lord for suffering hir. Then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord tooke the sick woman, healed hir of hir sicknes, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> presence of this proud Pharesie, &amp; with held phisick from him, whose hart was wounded to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death, with the dart of vain-glory. Then he shewed himselfe fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, and as one that had lost his vnderstanding, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his griefe, nor what medicine would doe him good. But what said he in his foolish hart? <hi>If this man</hi> (quod he) <hi>were a Prophet, he would know quickly what woman this is that touched him, for she is a great sinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Pharesie is of the race of the vainglorious, of whom the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh in their person, saieng: <hi>Come not neere me, for I am cleane:</hi> or as another translation saith. <hi>Get thee hence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esa.</hi> 61.</note> 
                  <hi>meddle not with mee, for I am holier then thou.</hi> Euen so surely it is not vnlike if the woman hadde come néere the Pharesie, he would haue vsed these words, &amp; haue said, <hi>Stand backe and touch me not, for I am holy, but thou art a knowne and a hainous sinner.</hi> Certainelye, true righteousnes and holinesse hath compassion vpon poore sinners, whereas on the contrarie, false righteousnesse and hypocrisie hath them in hatred and disdaine. But let vs ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten, with what sentence this fond Pharesie was conuinced and proued by our Sauiour, to be worse then this sinfull
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:5155:45"/>
woman, The Lord then to shewe that he was not onely a Prophet, but also the Lord and God of Prophets, aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the thought of this proud Pharesie: saieng, <hi>Symon</hi> I haue some thing to tell thee. Then said he, speake on Master.</p>
               <p>A Creditour (quoth the Lorde) hadde two Debters, whereof the one ought him 500. pence, the other but 50. now they both hauing nothing to pay, the creditor forgiues them the debt. Now tell me which of those debtours loueth the creditour most, <hi>Simon</hi> said, I thinke he to whome most was forgiuen. Iesus aunswered, thou hast rightly spoken.</p>
               <p>Our Lord in propounding this question, desired also to heale this Pharesie. For if he had denied it, Iesus woulde haue eaten none of his meate. These two debtours were <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and the sinfull woman. The sinfull woman not onely by the iudgement of the standers by, but also by hir owne confession, acknowledged hir self more indebted than <hi>Simon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Simon</hi> lesse indebted then she, because he thought himself to haue lesse sinned then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman: yea, he reputed himself righteous in respect of hir. The creditour is our Lord God, who lendes and giues vs his giftes both temporall and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall to interest, disburssing to one fiue talents, to another two, and to another one. Now then is signified by the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Simon,</hi> that the woman was most in debt to God, vnto whom he forgaue most. And because she loued God bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Simon</hi> did, she deserued againe of him to be better beloued, in that she did more good seruice to God, then <hi>Simon</hi> did, notwithstanding his meate.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Lord valued the loue &amp; good will of this woman, &amp; preferred it before <hi>Simons,</hi> reprehending him of his arrogancie, &amp; saieng, <hi>Doest thou see this woman whom thou iudgest more in debt then thy selfe? I entred into thy house, and thou hast not giuen me water to wash my feete, but she hath washt them with teares, &amp; wipt them with hir haire, though water was easier to be found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teares. Thou hast not kist my mouth, but she hath kist my feet. Thou hast not anointed my head with common oyle, but she hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted my feete with fine oyntment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:5155:46"/>
                  <hi>So that by these signes thou seest, that she loues me better then thou doest. Therefore I tell thee that manye sinnes are forgiuen hir, because shee loued much. For to him is least forgiuen, that hath least loued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord said this, to beate downe the prowde opinion of the fond Pharisie, not that he was but little forgiuen: but because <hi>Simon</hi> might knowe that he thought so. For truly, who so committeth most sinnes, he is most indebted to God: and so likewise of him that least offended. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, both the lesse &amp; the great stand in néede of Gods grace, vnto whom they cannot come of their owne strength &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And as the greatest sinner referreth to God the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his sinnes: euen so ought the iustest man to doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. For there is no sinne which one man committeth, but an other would commit the like, if God who made man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne, did not kéepe him from sinne, as witnesseth Saint <hi>Austen.</hi> But perchaunce one will say: I haue not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Adulterie as this man hath. To whome I aunswere. Thou hast not had such occasion ministred as he hath had: and he hath not had the grace to auoid it, as thou hast had. It was Gods doing, and no will of thine, if thou hast had no occasion nor conuenient time, nor fit opportunitie, to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that sinne.</p>
               <p>Suppose thou hast had occasion offered, with opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and all things fit, and yet hast refrained. Well, it is God then that hath guided and gouerned thée, that thou shuldest not doe it. Acknowledge then the grace of God, as thou art bound, because thou hast not committed such a sinne. For as he who hath committed most sins, is most indebted to God: euen so is he who neuer sinned, Gods debter. For were not the grace of God his guide, he woulde doe ill inough. Now to our purpose.</p>
               <p>After the Lord had conuinced the Pharesie of his prowd opinion, to comfort the sorowfull woman lyeng at his féet, he said thus: <hi>Woman, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi> O ioifull voice, O happy woman, that art worthye to heare the Sonne of God speake to thée, and vnto forgiue thée thy
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5155:46"/>
sinnes. But those comfortable words of the Lord, greatly offended the proud Pharisies at the feast, who turned them to blasphemie, saieng: <hi>What fellowe is this that also forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth sinnes? It is apparent inough that he is a blasphemer, for to pardon and forgiue sinnes, belongeth onelye to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No doubt our Lord Iesus Christ was taken to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poore man, of him that requested him to dinner, and to those which were at the table. It was knowen that man could not forgiue sinnes, but they beléeued not that Iesus Christ was God: and therefore say they, <hi>What fellowe is this that forgiueth sinnes?</hi> These feasters were sicke of a deadly disease, which they neither knew, nor yet the remedy to heale and doe them good. Is it not a madnesse that such as are sicke should fall a laughing at them that are sounde and in good health? So did the Pharesies laugh at Iesus Christ, and the woman, who were not sicke: or if she were sicke, she acknowledged hir sicknesse, and sought helpe of the Phisition. It is most true, that a man cannot forgiue sins: but this woman, which beleeued that Christ coulde forgiue sinnes, beléeued also that he was God, and therefore able to forgiue sinnes.</p>
               <p>But why did not our Sauiour Christ aunswere these murmuring Pharesies, and say: <hi>I am the Sonne of God,</hi> when they asked the question saieng: <hi>What fellowe is this that forgiueth sinnes?</hi> No, he let them murmure, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himselfe towards the woman, and said: <hi>Thy faith hath saued thee, depart in peace.</hi> Though she heard him say vnto the Pharesies, these men murmure, and estéeme of me as it pleaseth them: neuerthelesse be thou assured that thy faith hath saued thee, and therefore depart in peace, and enioy full rest and tranquilitie of conscience, iustified by a liuely faith, and fulfilled with loue. Let all sicke soules, that are laden with sinnes, if they will be healed, let them (I say) come in faith and assured hope to the true Phisition of soules, which is Iesus Christ, let them confesse their offences with sorow and wéeping, let them wipe the féete of our Lord, with their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:5155:47"/>
haire, and they shall be restored, made whole, and recouer their health.</p>
               <p>Let your superfluous riches be giuen among the poore, and not spent in feasting, dronkennes, and pompeous appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raile. And after that the sinner with great loue and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie hath thought vppon the poore, speaking to them with great gentlenesse, helping them in their néede, as well with good counsell, as with almes déedes: and liuing as the rule of Gods word requireth, in holinesse and righteousnesse, he shall be sure to receiue peace and quietnesse of conscience, and be reconciled to God the father, for the merites of his deare Sonne Iesus Christ his death and passion, to whom be all honour and glory for euer and euer. Amen.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I HAD A THOVSANDE</hi> tongues, to tell the truth of all the goods and pleasures, which I found in the pallaice of <hi>Vertue</hi>: and if I should liue a thousande yeares, to report this matter, al were too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in euery point to decipher it. For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not in Angelical knowledge, much lesse in mans wit, wholy to comprehend so notable a mysterie, none knows it but he who hath proued it. You may be sure, that there are not, as in the pallaice of worldly pleasure, Chambers han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about with silke Tapestry, and euerie corner sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and superfluously adorned: no, no: but there were histories of the olde &amp; new Testament to view &amp; marke. I found not there cofers full of gold &amp; siluer, cuberds of plate, presses of silke, all manner of mercery ware, neither daintie dishes, delicate drinkes, bawdie songs, wanton musike, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of loue, her son <hi>Cupid,</hi> nor anie thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worldlings em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace: but I found a thing farre surpassing all that is in the world.</p>
               <p>This good, this ioyfull, this comfortable, this vnspeakable, this incomprehensible thing, cannot be named worthely inough: but of good &amp; bad he is called (<hi>God</hi>) euen he who is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only souereigne good aboue al things, reasonable, &amp; vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Peraduenture you wil say, This is strange newes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you sir knight should sée God, in the pallaice of <hi>Vertue.</hi> How
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5155:49"/>
How is it straunge, séeing he is euerie where, not onelye in heauen but also in earth, &amp; in hell. Truly I confesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God is euerie where, but I denie him to dwel euerie where, &amp; yet I know that by his power &amp; inuisible presence he is euerye where, though not euerie where by the fulnesse of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; his gifts: it follows then that he dwelleth not euerye where. I pray you what profiteth it the dampned, that he is in hell, by his power, iustice, &amp; vengeaunce? Surely by such presence of God they haue no ioye, no consolation, no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, nor felicitie, for that all are curssed, in whome GOD dwelleth not by his grace, whatsoeuer they be, be they kings, Princes, or Popes, who haue all other riches and delights in the world.</p>
               <p>But all they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue the grace of God are happie, at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in hope, though they liue euen in a loathsome prison, &amp; are poorer then <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which desired to be refreshed with the crums that fell from the euill rich mans table. Nowe, when we praye to God, we saye not: <hi>Our Father which art euerie where,</hi> but <hi>Our Father which art in heauen</hi>: and that is the place where God giues the enioyeng and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing of himselfe to his elect, and that is their dwelling, prepared by the grace of God: That is it that God spake of by the Prophet <hi>Esaie,</hi> sayeng: <hi>Heauen is my seat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay.</hi> 66.</note> 
                  <hi>and earth is my foote-stoole.</hi> Forasmuch, sayth God, as I dwell in mine elect by grace, I will tumble at my féet those that loue <hi>Voluptuousnesse,</hi> rather then their maker. In the booke of <hi>Wisedome,</hi> it is written: <hi>That the seate of wisedome is the soule of the iust</hi>: God is Wisedome,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>VVis.</hi> 7.</note> and the iust soule his seate. God is in euerie place where hée dwelleth, but he dwelleth not in euery place where he is. This is most true, though meruailous, for the euill are alwaies where GOD is, but yet God dwelleth not in them.</p>
               <p>Wheresoeuer the wicked, are they cannot hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from GOD, and yet they are not dwellers with GOD, nor GOD a dweller with them. They are where GOD is: as the blinde man in the light of the Sunne. The light is not in him, because hée hath not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:5155:50"/>
the vse of it. But the good are alwaies with God, and God dwelleth in them as in his temple. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> saith, <hi>That the Temple of God is holy.</hi> And therefore if you liue as he commaundes you,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> you are his Temple: and God himselfe saith, <hi>I will be in them, I will walke amongest them, I will be their God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and they shall be my people.</hi> Now therefore you sée, that although God be euerie where by his power, yet he dwelleth no where, but where he is by grace. It is plaine, that where vertue is, there God dwelleth. Tell mée what displeasure can the soule haue, where God inhabiteth by grace, which is the onely consolation of all reasonable creatures.</p>
               <p>Is it possible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> anie man can finde in heauen or in earth such souereigne good, as is in God, who is the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentest and chiefest good, and the true ioy of all reasonable creatures? How can that bodie faile of anie goodnesse, which hath God by his grace resting in his heart, who is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly author of all goodnesse, and the giuer of all true ioye, and perfect felicitie?</p>
               <p>But some will saie that they sée good people in the world oftentimes, suffer miserie, depriued of their goods, and put by the pleasures of this world, which appeareth in the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their countenaunces: for they séeme to be conceiued with sorrow, and as it were, to labour and trauaile in heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as a woman in child-birth. I confesse it to be so, but yet if you say that they are not furnished with all good &amp; true ioye and felicitie, you erre greatly. For the souereigne good which is God, dwelleth in the iust soule euermore: although foolish worldlings say in their hearts and thoughts, <hi>Can it be, that those miserable men, which are afflicted with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie or imprisonment, haue more possession of true fely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, then wee that wallowe in wealth, and are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out want of any worldly pleasures?</hi> But they consider not that true ioy consisteth in the soule. But be ye sure that as the soule is the most precioust part of the bodie: euen so ought the goodnesse of the soule, to be greater then the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the bodie. The ioye of the iust &amp; righteous is more
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:5155:50"/>
inward then outward, for all his goodnesse is in the soule: as the ioye of the wanton worldling is outwardlye in the bodie.</p>
               <p>The iust man suffereth outward extremities, but yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly he hath more ioye then the voluptuous man. And though the iust man being alwaies afflicted, maketh shew of sadnesse all his lyfe time, yet at the houre of death their ioye and consolation appeareth with hope of eternall lyfe: whereas contrariwise the worldling goeth his waye with grudging and dispaire. The iust man esteemes golde and siluer to be couloured earth: worldly wealth, and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feeding, to be famine and filth: honour, dignitie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, to be smoake, which the aire consumeth sodeinly: to be short, he maketh all the world no better then an exile: and although his bodie be deteined heere for a season, yet all his thoughts, cares, desires and meditations, are conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant among the orders of holy Angels, and the happy assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Saintes in heauen, singing Psalmes and praises incessantlye. So that whatsoeuer we esteeme euill in this world, God turnes it to good. For he makes vs reioyce in tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, taking them for medicines to purge our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not accompting our persecutors as our enimies: but rather as helpers to saluation.</p>
               <p>The iust man esteemes simple fare sufficing nature bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then abundance of delicates, and excessiue dronkennesse or gluttonie. They take more pleasure in kneeling, praieng, and fasting, then worldlinges doe in dauncing and singing wanton songs. Finally, all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they doe or suffer, God turnes it to good. And therfore S. <hi>Paule</hi> saith, <hi>That all things turne to the good of those that loue God:</hi> The eye neuer séeth, the eare neuer heareth, the heart of man neuer vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the great goodnesse and the ioye that God brings into the bodie, when he commeth by grace to dwell in it onely he that hath had experience once, knoweth it. Worldlings doe wonder to see the iust man weepe and lament, to suffer tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, &amp; to be depriued of all worldly pleasure: they esteeme the goods of this world to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true felicitie: much like vnto
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5155:51"/>
a blinde man, taking vpon him to iudge of coulours. For they compare false felicitie &amp; worldly wealth, with heauenly riches and perfect happinesse, whereas indéede they are but shadowes. Nothing displeaseth the elect more then sinne, &amp; that which leadeth to sinne: nothing pleaseth the elect but God, and that which leadeth to God.</p>
               <p>As concerning the soule, no man can denie, if he hate sin, and loue vertue, but that he had rather loose all that is in the worlde, then loose vertue, and suffer all manner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then to commit sinne: he had rather descende into hell with vertue, then mount vp into heauen with sinne. For where vertue is, there is quietnesse: Contrariwise, where sinne is, there can be no rest. Let euerie one therefore labour to loose worldly happinesse, if he meane to atchieue vertue, wherein consisteth so much goodnesse.</p>
               <p>But many make no account to come thether, and so care not for louing vertue, because indéede they know not vertue. Wherefore <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> describeth her, and her seauen daughters, namely: <hi>Faith, Hope, Charitie, Wisedome, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Temperaunce,</hi> in manner and forme following.</p>

The inferiour parte we call <hi>Sense,</hi> which is common to man and beast. Now this called in Latine <hi>Mens,</hi> is not a part of the soule sensitiue, which is the inferiour part: but it is that part of the soule, where reason and vnderstanding doe sit, which is the superiour part. By the soule then we doe meane the Fréewill of man, which is nothing els as Philosophers say,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5155:51"/>
but the franke iudgement of the minde and will. For when we say <hi>Freewill,</hi> we vtter and pronounce two words, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>(Free)</hi> and <hi>(Will.)</hi> It is tearmed <hi>(Free)</hi> because that freely and without constraint, the will worketh his feats at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And it is called Frée will, because of the iudgement of the soule, therefore Frée will is in the superiour part of the soule, for thereby we differ from brute beasts, who haue a sense as well as we, but no iudgement of Frée will. Nowe, when we say that vertue is a good qualitie of the soule, that is to saie, of Frée will. For vertue qualifies <hi>(Free-will)</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth and prepareth it to doe and will well, neither of which cannot be done, without the aide and grace of God.</p>
               <p>The second part of the definition is, <hi>Wherby a man liueth rightly.</hi> But no man liueth rightly vnles he liue iustly, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liueth iustly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out vertue: <hi>Ergo</hi> no man liueth rightly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vertue. Who so liueth rightly liueth wel: &amp; who so liueth well, if he continue in so doing, atchiueth true felicitie. It followeth then, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by vertue we atchiue true felicitie: for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue prepares Frée will, which is corrupt &amp; depraued, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnapt either for well willing or well doing: but the grace of God reseruing it by vertue, it is made capable of perfect blessednesse.</p>
               <p>The third part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> definition is, <hi>And committeth none euill.</hi> Wherein is comprehended the excellencie of vertue &amp; great goodnes, by the which none can do il. Men may abuse al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> arts &amp; sciences in the world, as indéed very often they are ill vsed, as with monie, wine, &amp; women: but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue they be neuer abused: who vseth vertue, he doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> works of vertue. Who so vseth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deeds of vertue, he doth wel: &amp; if by vertue none doth ill, thou oughtest rather to loose all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in the world, then to lose vertue, seeing, she excels in goodnesse all things in the world.</p>
               <p>The fourth part of the definition is, <hi>Which thing indeed is the only work of God in man</hi>

more then he sawe, for he sawe a man, and he belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the same man was God also, which he sawe not: for he said, <hi>Thou art my God, and my Lord.</hi> In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the merite of faith, when a man at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commandement of God beleeueth that thing which he séeth not. To beleeue (saith Saint <hi>Austen</hi>) is to thinke vppon a thing, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to that thought: as when thou thinkest the Son of God was borne of a Uirgin, &amp; had tooke mans nature vpon him, &amp; consentest to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thought, it is properly called beliefe. This thought may come often by séeing, and often by hearing.</p>
               <p>And therefore Saint <hi>Paule</hi> saith, that <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> He vnderstands that by hearing,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith</hi> comes into the minde and thought, if we consent therevnto. For we maye beholde a Preacher, without consenting to that he saith, because men doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beleeue what the Preacher speaketh, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the consent wherin consisteth the perfection of <hi>Faith,</hi> comes of the méere gift of God, &amp; not from séeing nor hearing, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the light of grace speking in the soule of the beleeuer, beléeuing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal truth, which is God, &amp; working in him a consent &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that principal &amp; souereign trurh aboue al other things. So that <hi>Faith</hi> is a foundation vnmoueable, both of beleeuers, and of truth, by the which <hi>Faith,</hi> when it is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Charitie,</hi> our Lord Iesus Christ, who is the onely foundation of true blessednesse, dwelleth in the hearts of the beleeuers, and so long as <hi>Faith</hi> is in man, he shal be sure not to perish, but <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>Charitie</hi> is no foundation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such <hi>Faith</hi> is vaine and vnprofitable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> then ioyned with <hi>Loue</hi> or <hi>Charitie</hi> belongs to good Christians: and <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>Loue</hi> belongs to euill Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. It is necessarie therfore, that we note the difference in these three saiengs or speaches, namely: <hi>To beleeue a God, to beleeue of God,</hi> and <hi>to beleeue in God,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To beleeue of God, is to beléeue that all is true which God saith, &amp; so beleeue the euill Christians as well as the good: vnlesse they be Heretikes.</p>
               <p>To beleeue a God, is to beléeue that he is the onely true and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:5155:52"/>
almightie God, and so the Diuells doe beléeue, as well as the euill Christians. But to beléeue in God, is to loue God, and to trust in God, and in beléeuing to ioyne thy selfe to God, by loue and obedience, incorporating thée with his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that is to say, his Church.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Faith</hi> iustifieth and maketh righteous the sinner, and this <hi>Faith</hi> being knit with <hi>Loue</hi> and with <hi>Charitie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to doe good deedes, which cannot be done without <hi>Loue.</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> which euill Christians haue, is indéede a qualy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of fréewill, but it is not knit with <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> which is the bonde of perfection, and the life of <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>Faith</hi> is the life of the soule. And yet such an vnshapen <hi>Faith</hi> being naked and voide of <hi>Charitie,</hi> may be termed a gift of God: for that the euill man may haue some gifte of God: but that cannot properly be called <hi>Vertue,</hi> because that by <hi>Vertue,</hi> we learne to liue rightly: and for that the Diuels and euill Christians doe liue wickedly, it is a signe that the faith which they haue is dead, and therefore is not properly <hi>Vertue,</hi> nor yet a worke of <hi>Vertue.</hi> If thou wilt then haue thy <hi>Faith</hi> to be good and wholesome, it must haue foure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, that is to say, it must be plaine and simple, it must be whole and sound, it must be constant and vnmouable, it must be quicke and liuely. Touching the first, that it must be plaine and simple, that teacheth thée thus much in effect, that thou must beléeue the word of God plainly &amp; simply, &amp; whatsoeuer is therein contained, without enquiring or sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in Gods mysticall matters by humaine reasons: but simply beléeuing in thy heart, that euery thing contained in the holy Bible is most true. Secondly, thy <hi>Faith</hi> must be whole and sound: that is to say, thou must not take parte with heretikes, or leane to the erronious opinions of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Gods truth: for this is no good or wholesome <hi>Faith.</hi> And therefore for a testimonie of thy <hi>Faith,</hi> be not ashamed to make open confession in the congregation of thy beliefe, saieng with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> felowship &amp; communion of Saints, I beleeue in the holy Trinitie. &amp; as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Church founded by Christ, whereof he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head hath taught me, so do I frame my faith·
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5155:53"/>
Thirdly, it must be constant and vnmouable, that is to say, without doubting for any reson of mans braine that séemeth contrarie, nor for any temptation, promises or threatnings, either of torment or of death. And let not the obstinacie of such as inchaunt with the vaine pleasures of this life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they liue most ioyfully, allure thee to leane to their opinion, which is flat heresie. For that is a work of Satans, who wholly possesses them, and can transfigure and chaunge himselfe into an Angell of light to deceiue the simple and innocent, whom God permits to be tempted for the triall of their constancie. Not that he is ignoraunt of the issue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but because he would haue it appeare to others, that he crowns vs with his glorie, for our constancie and perseueraunce.</p>
               <p>This is clearely set downe by <hi>Moses</hi> in the xiij. of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie,</hi> and by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his second Epistle and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter, and by our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ in the 24. of <hi>Mathew.</hi> And though we liue in the latter times, when manie sects and errours doe abound, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and truth in many places doth faile: Yet let vs listen what our Lord and Sauiour saith: <hi>Whosoeuer beleueth to the ende sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll be saued.</hi> Fourthly and lastly, thy <hi>Faith</hi> must be quicke and liuely, that is to saye, it must be linked with <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> which is the life of <hi>Faith,</hi> as the soule is the life of the body. And therefore abuse not thy selfe, as some doe, saieng: I haue <hi>Faith,</hi> and I shall be saued whatsoeuer chaunce. No, no: assure thy selfe, that if thy <hi>Faith</hi> be not quickned with <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> it is nothing woorth, and therefore vnable to atchieue true blessedndsse: as S. <hi>Paule</hi> wel noteth in the first Epistle the xiij. chapter to the <hi>Corinths.</hi> Euen so, when our Lord in the Gospel attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth saluation vnto <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; S <hi>Paule</hi> iustification: this is to be vnderstood of an holy liuely and Euangelicall <hi>Faith,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Charitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise, our Lord and Sauiour, saith in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that, <hi>Hee which beleeueth, and will be baptised, shall bee saued</hi>: this is meant of such a <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>Loue</hi> quickeneth, and <hi>Charitie</hi> reuiueth. The holy Scripture in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:5155:53"/>
many places expresseth: that <hi>None shall be saued,</hi> vnlesse he obserue and kéepe the Commaundements of God. Now, none can kéepe the Commaundements without <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Charitie, Ergo</hi> none can be saued without <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> The summe and effect of all is this, that whosoeuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth sinne and wickednesse, imbraceth a quicke and liuely <hi>Faith,</hi> and liueth in <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> he cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish: but shall finde in the end true, perfect, and euerlasting <hi>Felicitie,</hi> in the kingdome of Heauen.</p>

                     </gap>.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we haue possession of it already. It is common to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> to be of things vnséene: and yet <hi>Hope</hi> is distinguished from <hi>Faith,</hi> not onely by name, but also by reason. For by <hi>Faith</hi> we beleeue as well euill things as good, that is to say, Heauen and Hell. We beléeue that Adulterie is a verie wicked sinne, we beléeue also <hi>Charitie</hi> is a very good thing: all these things good and bad we beléeue, but we hope onely for good things, and not for bad. Againe, <hi>Faith</hi> is of things past, present, and to come: For we beleeue the death of Iesus Christ, which is past: we beleeue also that at this present he sits at the right hand of God the Father in Heauen, and we beléeue that Christ shall come to iudge the quicke and the dead.</p>
               <p>But vnder correction, I thinke that <hi>Hope</hi> is of things
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:5155:54"/>
present, as when I hope that I am in GODS fauour: and of things past, as when I hope my sinnes be forgiuen me: and of things to come, as when I hope to haue eternall life.</p>
               <p>This is true that <hi>Faith</hi> hath an eye generallye vnto that, which is spoken in holy Scripture, beléeuing that all the promises, without exception, which God made, shall bee accomplished, without descending to particular or speciall persons: but <hi>Hope</hi> applieth vnto hir selfe those same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, waiting and hoping for the accomplishment of that which God hath promised. And therefore it is requisite for assured saluation, that thou beleeue thou shalt be saued, and but to hope so is sufficient. For <hi>Faith</hi> of and in it selfe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth an infallible assuraunce and certaintie of things, as when we firmely beléeue all the Articles of our true and Christian <hi>Faith,</hi> and all things conteined in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be more certaine than man is man: but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of it is not so requisite. For if we haue a firme affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce in the goodnesse of God touching our saluation, and doubt not a whitte of the remission of our sinnes, it is enough.</p>
               <p>Ther be two degrées in <hi>Hope,</hi> which are two contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. The one being the most highest is most perfect &amp; infailable assuraunce of eternall blessednesse. The other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the basest and lowest is to despaire of saluation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene these two extremities consisteth <hi>Hope.</hi> But the more y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man approcheth to the highest extremitie, which is an infaileable assuraunce of eternall life, and the more he recoileth from the basest and lowest extremitie, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration the more perfect is he in <hi>Hope.</hi> It sufficeth the hoping man, that beléeues &amp; loues God, that he haue a firme affiaunce &amp; confidence, that God of his good grace will giue him, whatsoeuer he hath promised vnto his elect, hoping that he is of their number. So it is necessarily requisite, that we haue a perfect and an infaileable certaintie of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:5155:54"/>Now, for that in the definition of <hi>Hope,</hi> it is said, that by hir we looke and hope for the spirituall and eternall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: it is to be noted, that <hi>Hope</hi> hath two obiects, the first and the principall, is God himselfe, and the perfect inioying of his presence. The other, is all the necessarie meanes, to come vnto the cleare séeing and inioying of God: and these meanes are, the remission of our sinnes, iustification, the help of <hi>Gods grace, Faith</hi> vnfained, and charitable deedes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeablenes vnto God. Now all that we hope for, we ought with praier deuoutly to craue of God, as his Kingdome, the remission of our sinnes, iustification, increase of grace and vertue, déedes of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But concerning goodes temporall: forasmuch as we may vse them well and ill, they may be saide to hinder the saluation of man, rather then to further it. And therfore the good Christian ought not to aske them nor to couet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely: indéed so much as wil necessarily serue him for suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce in this life, he may lawfully aske. And héere by the waye, it is a lesson worthy the learning, namely: that it is necessarie for vs to do good workes, because it hath ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to inrich vs with goods, which goodes ought well to be employed. Now vnto him properly belongeth the merits of the workes which he worketh in vs. For all our good workes are the gifts of God: howbeit, he doth not denie vs his grace, whereby we consent to doe the good works, which he onely moueth in vs.</p>
               <p>And therefore euery one ought to the vttermost that he is able, to do good works, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they come from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is the Author of all good woorks, &amp; without who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are not able to think so much as one good thought, much lesse do a good déed. For otherwise to hope in doing ill to goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, without good workes springing from a firme <hi>Faith,</hi> is no <hi>Hope,</hi> but a flat presumption. And therefore thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to enforce thy selfe to do good works, hoping that thou &amp; thy works may be acceptable vnto God: neuertheles thou must not in any case trust vpon thy merits or good works,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:5155:55"/>
but altogether vpon the infinite loue and goodnesse of God, For otherwise thou fallest into that cursse, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaketh of,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iere.</hi> 17.</note> saieng: <hi>Curssed is the man, that trusteth in man: and contrariwise, happie is the man that trusteth in God.</hi> We ought alwayes to doe well, to delight in well doing, and to hope in the goodnesse of God, that he wil giue vs that which he hath promised. But this <hi>Hope</hi> ought to bée firme, and as an Anker constantly to hold thy conscience, that by the floatings of temptations it mooue not.</p>
               <p>But some will aske, by what testimonie or witnesse, can the conscience rest assured of remission of sinnes, of Gods adoption, and of heauenly blessednesse, I aunswere. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>There bee three things that giue wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in earth, that is to say, the Spirite, Water, and Bloud.</hi> These thrée testifie vnto the spirite of the beléeuing man, that Christ is the infallible truth, who fulfilleth in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuing man the whole summe of his promises.</p>
               <p>The first witnesse then that assureth man in <hi>Hope,</hi> is the precious bloud of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, which was shedde for the remission of our sinnes. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond witnesse is the water of Baptisme, by the which also our sinnes are forgiuen. But these two witnesses put not the conscience in full and perfect <hi>Hope</hi> and assuraunce. And therefore there must bée annexed vnto them a thirde, which thirde is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The holye Spirite, which beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with our spirite, that wee are the sonnes and heires of God.</hi> Who so hath not this witnesse, he cannot be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his saluation.

               <p>If thou aske mée what those workes are, I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere thée, that they are these and such lyke that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, namelye: Sorrowe for sinnes, Hatred of all things which displeaseth GOD, and are contrarie to his Commaundements, taking pleasure to read and heare

Gods word, mourning for thy imperfections, and little <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charitie</hi>: an affection, desire, intent, and purpose to loue God aboue all thinges, and to doe thy indeauour to fulfill his commandements. But all these things springs not from the corrupt nature of man, vnlesse his minde and hart be moistened with the dew of Gods grace: without the which we féele not in our selues any good affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor desire to do good works, which are signs of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghost in vs. Wherefore we ought with great sighings and grones to praie vnto God, and to beseech him most humbly, that it would please him of his vnspeakable pitie to sende vs his holy spirit, which may assure vs of the redemption of our sinnes: to vouchsafe his heauenly adoption, and the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng of euerlasting blessednesse.

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Haritie</hi> is a vertue, by the which God is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the loue of himselfe: &amp; our neighbour, for the loue of God, or in God. It is said in the first part of this definition, that <hi>Charitie</hi> is a vertue. Let vs see how? Certeinly <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> is the excellentest vertue that is, euen the mother and nurse of all the rest. For he that hath not <hi>Charitie,</hi> hath nothing in him to obteine euerlasting life. This <hi>Charitie</hi> is giuen when the holy spirit is giuen. For the holy spirit being resident in the soule, makes vs to loue God for the loue of himselfe, and our neighbour, for the loue of God. To loue God for the loue of himselfe, is to loue him for his owne sake, and because he is God. And that is to be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:5155:56"/>
done thrée waies, that is to say, to loue God aboue all things entirely, aboue all things orderly, aboue all thinges preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslye. We will declare these thrée waies of louinge GOD the more plainlye, that euerye one maye knowe how to loue God.</p>
               <p>To loue God entirely, is to haue a good will to God; and to reioyce greatly that he is such a one as he is. But for the better vnderstanding héereof, it shall not be amisse to shew what it is to loue. To loue is nothing else, but to wish well to euery body, as when I loue a man, I wish as well to him as to himself. Now there are two manners of loue, one is called a couetous loue, as when a man loues anye thing for his own profits sake, or his perticular honour: and in such sort men loue their horses, their victualles, and all other worldlye necessaries. The other loue is called the loue of friendshippe, or of good will, as when one loues a thinge for the loue of it selfe, without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular honour, or profite: as when I sée a man wise and vertuous, I take pleasure in him, and wishe that the vertues which are in him, maye not onely bée conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued but also increased in him, and this doe I béeinge to him well affectionated, and louinge him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghtes.</p>
               <p>There is not in GOD anye good that is not lyke himselfe. For his might, his wisedome, his iustice, his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye, his riches and his goodnesse are heauenlye, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is, who is all wise, all iust, all mercifull, all riche, and almightye. So that we loue God aboue all things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, when we reioyce and be glad that he is as he is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding our proper profite or honour.</p>
               <p>Thou oughtest not to loue GOD with a couetous loue, that is to saye, thou must not loue GOD onelye because he giues thée all thinges profitable for thée: for in so dooing thou louest thy selfe better then thou louest God. If thou loue GOD rightlye, he will rewarde thee great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, but this loue must be single, and it must be pure, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:5155:56"/>
not depending vppon an other thinge: For who so loueth God for gaine, loueth him, but as his horse in whome hée delyghtes, because he serues his turne. GOD ought to be loued louinglye, without respect of particular profite. But thou maist aske mée a question, Maye I not loue God to this ende, and vnder this condition, that he maye giue me heauen: which is the souereigne good and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallest thinge that man canne wish for after this lyfe. The Doctours saye (<hi>No.</hi>) If wée consider well of the thing beloued, which is GOD: For in so dooing thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest thy selfe better then thou louest GOD. Thou maist come to heauen by this meanes, as namely, by keeping his commaundements, by giuing almes, and by dooing other good déedes, and yet giue God his due and single loue. Nowe these things are not <hi>Charitie</hi> it selfe, but the works of <hi>Charitie.</hi> We say then that God ought to bée loued in doing good deedes, and in kéeping his commaundements, but this loue ought to be entyre, without respect of profite or reward.</p>
               <p>To loue GOD orderlye aboue all thinges, is to referre thy selfe and all thy goods to GOD: so that all which thou louest, wishest, doest, and leauest vndone, thou oughtest to loue, to wishe, to doe, and leaue vndone, for the loue of GOD and his glorie. Thus referringe all to the honour and glorye of GOD, thou louest GOD aboue all things orderly: and accomplishest as much as in thée lyeth. What is written in <hi>Deutronomie</hi> and in Saint <hi>Mathewe,</hi> where it is sayde. <hi>Thou shalt loue the Lord thy GOD with all thy heart, with all thy soule, and with all thy strength.</hi> For what other thinge is it to loue GOD with all thine hearte, with all thy soule, and with all thy strength, but to referre all things to GOD and to his glorye, all our thoughts, all our wordes, all our works, all our wayes, all our purposes, and all our intents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:5155:57"/>To loue God therfore aboue all things orderly, is to referre to God and his glorie our selues, and all that is within &amp; without vs, which we cannot well doe, if our thoughts, if our wordes, if our workes, and our wayes be not good and acceptable vnto God.</p>
               <p>To loue God preciously, is to loue him so déerely and so much to esteeme of him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for no cause thou wouldest loose him, nor his loue: but wish rather to loose thy goods, thy lands, thy lims, thy life, and the loue of all the world. This indéede is to loue God louingly, when without respect of profit, we referre to God and his glorie all that we haue, our hearts, our hands, our lips, to praise and magnifie him, and to set foorth the greatnesse of his diuine maiestie, &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie. To loue God then for the loue of himselfe, is to loue God because he is good. And he that loueth God in this sort, shall be sure neuer to miscarrie or perish.</p>
               <p>Do loue thy neighbour it is required that thou doe it in God, or for the loue of God. Now thou must vnderstand that euerie man is thy neighbour, when either thou to them, or they to thée can shew mercie, or relieue by succour &amp; helpe. So that euerie reasonable creature is thy neighbour, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he dwell in the world. Thus are the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thy neighbours, by whose example thou art helped and taught to liue godly, wherefore thou oughtest to loue them and all mankinde, for the loue of God, or in God. Thou oughtest to loue thy neighbour, because he is good, or because he should be good: then thou louest him indéede for the loue of God: euerie man which is a sinner thou oughtest to loue, not because he is a sinner, but because he is a man, for the loue of God.</p>
               <p>Thou oughtest to loue in the sinfull man that which he hateth, and to hate that which he loueth. The sinfull man loues sinne, filthynesse, and iniquitie, which thou oughtest to hate: The sinfull man hateth his soule, and the puritie of nature, which thou oughtest to loue. For sinne is against nature, it defileth nature, it oppresseth nature, yea, it quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nature, and he that committeth sinne killeth his owne
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:5155:57"/>
soule, and corrupteth nature.</p>
               <p>Thou oughtest then to loue the soule and the nature of the sinner, but not his sinne. And when thou giuest almes to a sinner, being in néede, thou oughtest not to do it because he is a sinner: but because he is a man of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which thou art, some be thy friends, and some thine enimies.</p>
               <p>Thy friends thou oughtest loue, in God: least louing them otherwise, thou shouldest offend God.</p>
               <p>Thy enimies thou oughtest to loue, for the loue of God, as if he offend thée by word or déede, and doth repent him, and asketh thée forgiuenesse, thou oughtest for the loue of God to forgiue him with all thy heart, &amp; to receiue him into true friendshippe and familiaritie.</p>
               <p>Againe, if thy enimie be obstinate, and wil not cease to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute and trouble thée: although thou canst not presentlye forgiue him, yet thou oughtest not to hate him, but rather to doe him good, &amp; to be readie alwaies to pardon him, and then chiefly when he shall require it. Yea, thou oughtest to do him what good thou canst in his néede.</p>
               <p>By that which we haue spoken already, it appeareth that thou oughtest to loue all men liuing, both good and badde, friendes, and foes, no worse then thy selfe. Our Lorde and Sauiour had an eye to the loue of our neighbour, when he said in the 7. of <hi>Mathew, All things that thou wouldest thy neighbour shoulde doe vnto thee, doe thou the lyke to him.</hi> Whosoeuer then doth to his neighbour, as he wold his neighbour shuld do to him, loueth his neighbour as himself. But this is to bée vnderstood according to God and reason. For if one offering to pleasure thée, bring thée a Wench to lye with thée, or lende thée a sworde to fight and kill an other, as reason shoulde instruct thée to refuse such offers: so the loue according to GOD shoulde teach thée obedience: and they both ought to be rule of thy lyfe, and the lights to guide thée in darke places.</p>
               <p>Thus farre haue wée declared in as much breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:5155:58"/>

Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>That God is Charitie,</hi> wherby no doubt, he meaneth the Father, the sonne, and the holy Ghost, the three persons in trinitie, God the father is <hi>Charitie,</hi> God the sonne is <hi>Charitie,</hi> and God the holy Ghost is <hi>Charitie.</hi> This <hi>Loue or Charitie</hi> requireth in the same such likely things, namely, <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> by the which, as by some spiritual affinity, thou art ioyned vnto God, which <hi>Loue</hi> also boldly commeth vnto God, &amp; familiarly speaketh with him, without any doubt or feare.</p>
               <p>He that loueth not shall loose his lyfe: but he that loueth, alwayes lyfteth his eyes to GOD, whome he loueth, whom he desireth, on whome he museth, in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5155:59"/>
whome he is refreshed, and by whome he is preserued, such a louing, deuoute, and relygious soule, doth so singe, so saye, so reade, so dispose all his businesse, and so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly foreseeth all things, as if GOD were euer present with him, as doubtlesse in spirite he is. The man in whose soule the loue of GOD is lodged, so prayeth, as if God were personallye present with him.</p>
               <p>The loue of (<hi>Charitie</hi>) awaketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule, when she is a sléepe, it puts him in minde of his saluation, it softeneth and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneth the heart, Loue or Charitie setteth the colde heart on fire, Loue maketh the froward soule gentle. Loue chaseth awaye sinne, Loue kepeth the affections of fleshe and, bloude vnder, Loue amendeth lewde mennes manners, Loue reneweth the spirite, Loue brideleth the light motions of wanton youth, all this worketh Loue or Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie where she is present.</p>
               <p>Contrarywise, where Loue or Charitie is absent, there the soule doth languysh and waxeth colde: euen as a Chaldron of water doth, when the fire is taken from vnder it, and raked abroade. <hi>Charitie</hi> is the onely thinge whereby the soule boldlye approcheth vnto GOD: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantlye cleaueth vnto him, famyliarlye speaketh with him, and in all affayres asketh counsell of him.</p>
               <p>The Soule that loueth GOD, cannot but thinke and talke of GOD, insomuch that he hateth all vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye thinges. Who so will knowe GOD, must loue GOD, the more that one loues God the more he growes in the knowledge of God. To Read, to write, and to Study of God, yéeldeth no true knowledge of God without Loue. In vaine do we read, in vaine doe we talke, in vaine doe we preach, in vaine doe we praye to GOD, if we doe not loue God.</p>
               <p>The loue of God engendereth the loue of thine owne soule, and maketh it attentiue alwaies to God. God loueth to be beloued againe: and when he loueth, he requireth nothing but loue: happie therefore is he that loueth God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:5155:59"/>The soule which loueth God, reiecteth all his affections, being attentiuely giuen to his loue. The soule that loueth, hath no feare: the soule that loueth not, is euer in feare. The soule that loueth, is caried by promises and drawen by desires vnto heauen: the soule that hath in it the presence of Gods loue, is tickeled with ioye, &amp; with rauishings lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vp to heauen, hauing by contemplation exceeding great ioyfulnesse. <hi>Loue</hi> bréedes familiaritie with God, familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bréedes boldnesse with God, boldnesse bréedes the taste of God, and taste bréedeth an hunger after God.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y these foure Morall vertues man liueth well and orderly in this mortall life. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, that the Christian man, by these iiij. liueth wel in this mortalitie, &amp; by them after death, commeth to euerlasting life. <hi>Prudence</hi> knoweth the good we should doe, and the euill we should leaue. <hi>Iustice</hi> doth good. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> leaueth the euill. <hi>Fortitude</hi> is constant, without loosing courage in aduersitie, or waxing proud in prosperitie. <hi>Prudence</hi> disposeth man, and teacheth him how to approch vnto God, <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi> how to gouerne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Iustice</hi> how to vse his neighbour. These are the foure things which Satan shooteth at, to destroye the soule. By <hi>Prudence,</hi> which is the rule of right reason, we gouerne our selues wisely, we order our affaires discréetly, doing nothing but right and reason.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Prudence</hi> consisteth reason, knowledge, foresight, apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to teach and giue good counsell. A prudent man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth afore hande the ende of his counsell. <hi>Plato</hi> saith, that <hi>Prudence</hi> is the Duchesse of all morall vertues, showing vs how we should vnderstand and vse the rest. For as <hi>Faith</hi> informeth vs, and telleth vs what we should hope after, and what we ought to loue: euen so <hi>Prudence</hi> instructeth &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, how we should vse <hi>Iustice, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Aristotle</hi> saith, that it is vnpossible but a prudent man should be good. If he meane Morall goodnesse, it is most true: for a wise man doth nothing but that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But yet without <hi>Loue</hi> or <hi>Charitie, Prudence</hi> is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue no more meritorious then <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi> But if the prudent man loue God with all his hart, it is vnpossible but he shuld do good, and consequently be good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustice</hi> is a vertue vsed in two sorts, sometimes it is a general vertue, &amp; comprehends in hir selfe all vertue: as the man that liueth well &amp; iustly, is therefore called, good, vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and iust. Otherwise it is vnderstood a perticular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, called <hi>Iustice</hi> distributiue, yéelding to euerye one that which vnto him belongeth. This vertue <hi>Iustice</hi> distributiue

is conuenient for all men, and principally for Emperours, Kings, Princes, &amp; such as haue the administration and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Common-wealths: to the ende that they may yeeld to euery one their right, defending y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> innocent, &amp; puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the offender: honoring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good, &amp; abasing the euill: doing Iustice &amp; right according to equitie, as well to little as great &amp; to poore as rich.

                  <hi>Fortitude</hi> is a vertue, vnto the which belongs a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent courage, not fearing any thing but vnlawfull actions. He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath this vertue, keepes himselfe constant in aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; waxeth not proud in prosperitie. <hi>Fortitude</hi> giues a man magnanimitie, constancie, hope, assurance, sufferaunce, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; perseuerance.

Moreouer such as extraordinarily and desperately dispatch themselues, as wretches weary of life, they doe it not by fortitude, but by the temptation of the Diuell, who is permitted by Gods sufferaunce, to tempt some, euen to the making away of themselues. Such people are weake hearted and not valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant: for valyantnesse, which is <hi>Fortitude,</hi> is not named no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, vnlesse it be in lawfull actions and déeds, as in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thine owne person, thy Prince, thy Countrie, or the faith of Iesus Christ, for the which to suffer death, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Fortitude.</hi>

                  <hi>Temperance</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Austen</hi>) is an affection to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine the appetite, whervnto a man is excessiuely inclined. <hi>Temperance</hi> hath rule and dominion ouer pleasures and delights, refusing to meddle in any thing, which can not be done without offending God: and not falling in anye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse whatsoeuer, wherein a man may passe the rule of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

               <p>These foure vertues haue foure vices cleane contrarie vnto them, by the which vices, the vertues are corrupted and destroyed. <hi>Prudence</hi> by <hi>Folly, Iustice</hi> by <hi>Couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Fortitude</hi> by <hi>Pride,</hi> &amp; <hi>Temperance</hi> by <hi>Incontinence,</hi> defaced.

Being in that maze, <hi>Vertue</hi> tolde me that in hir Pallaice neuer came night, and that darknesse had nothing to doe where she dwelt. Then <hi>Memory</hi> put me in minde what <hi>Gods grace</hi> tolde me by the way: saieng that by the workes of <hi>Faith,</hi> which are the fruits of the same I might perceiue and sée the Citie of Heauen, wherein is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the true and blessed <hi>Felicitie.</hi> Then <hi>Faith</hi> led me to hir Tower, and all the other vertues kept vs company. For <hi>Faith</hi> properly is not without <hi>Hope,</hi> nor <hi>Hope</hi> without <hi>Charitie,</hi> and therfore they must go altogether. And though these vertues haue distinct and seuerall properties: yet they ioyne hands and are neuer asunder. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> saith that <hi>Abraham</hi> was furnished with <hi>Faith, Iob</hi> with <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Patience, Dauid</hi> with <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and so consequently of other holy men recorded in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Faith</hi> from hir high Tower, showed mée a high hill, whereon was builded a meruailous sumptuous Citie, and she tolde me it was the Citie of Heauen, wherein is comprehended true blessednesse, and perfect felicitie. In that Citie I sawe neuer a Temple, which made me meruaile, vntill that <hi>Faith</hi> told me, that the Lord God almightie was the Temple of that Citie. There needes no shining of Sun, nor brightnes of Moone, nor glittering of stars, to giue them light, for the almightie God is their true light himselfe.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:5155:62"/>
None enters into this Citie, but such as are written in the booke of life. Furthermore <hi>Faith</hi> tolde me that there was no discord, no aduersitie, no sinne, no reproch, no iniquitie, no feare, no sorrow, no shame, no tumult, no darknes, no paine, no mistrust, no violence, no vnquietnes, no ill, no grudging, finally, nothing that fauoured of mortalitie: but there was concord, prosperitie, perfection, vnitie, loue, gladnesse, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, staiednesse, charitie, sure rest, perpetuall felicitie, and euerlasting ioye in God, with eternall life and happinesse.</p>
               <p>There was mirth without sadnesse, rest without labor, gaine without losse, health without paine, abundance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out want, life without death, cleannesse without corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, happinesse without hinderaunce. In this Citie God is seene face to face, there is the endlesse lyght shining, the Saints alwaies singing, blessed soules reioycing and euer beholding God, yet still coueting to sée him without dulnesse of desire. The Citizens of this Citie of heauen are coheires of the eternall Deitie, the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost. They are made incorruptible and immortall, according to the promise of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, saieng. <hi>Father those that thou hast giuen me, I will that they bee with me where I am, that they may see my brightnesse.</hi>

                  <hi>That I may be made meet for this so great a blessing, grant I beseech thee O gratious God, that I neuer loke backe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this shadowe or valley of teares, that I remember not the false plesures of this wicked worlde, that I esteeme not this corruptible &amp; euil lyfe. O how can we (here) be happie where the Diuell alwayes assalts vs? Where the world flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vs? Where the soule is blinded? And where al men sin? After which greate euils death doth followe, as the verie end of al vaine pleasures, &amp; then they are esteemed as if they had neuer ben.

Beholde me miserable wretch, filled with sadnesse, wherein I consider my sinnes when I feare thy iudgement, when I thinke on the houre of death, when I remember the paines of hell, when I am ignorant what punishment I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, when I knowe not where nor in what estate I shall end my dayes. In all these things and many other I appeale to thy gratious goodnesse, knowing that thou art readye to giue me consolation against all these sorrowes.

               <p>This praier ended, I vtterly forgat all my miseries, and rested my soule vpon the anchor of <hi>Hope.</hi> Then as I was kneeling, <hi>Gods grace</hi> appered vnto me, accompanied with an other Lady which I had not séene before. And after I had giuen her thanks for all her benefits, she deliuered mée this Lady named <hi>Perseueraunce,</hi> to continue with me, charging me to kéepe her euer with me, if I meant to be a Citizen of heauen. For (sayd she) all other vertues without her are as nothing, to winne heauen. For it is written,<note place="margin">

He was vanquished of his enimies, and béeing giuen ouer of God, he killed himselfe vppon the mount <hi>Gelboë.</hi> Againe touching the same matter, <hi>Iudas</hi> at the first when God made him an Apostle, was good and duetifull, but when he had put <hi>Perseueraunce</hi> away, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a théefe, &amp; by couetousnesse, hée betraied and solde his Maister Christ. But what was his ende?

               <p>MY sonne, the last point of thy soules health, (quoth <hi>Good vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,</hi>) is to learne &amp; know how to tarrie wher thou art now, without going back, which if thou desire, then must <hi>Perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> neuer leaue thée, for if she forsake thée once,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:5155:64"/>
then must thou néeds loose the pleasure of lady <hi>Vertues</hi> pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, wherin thou art now. From whence if thou go backe, thou shalt be sure to loose her and the ioyes of heauen. Thou must therfore remaine constant in thy good minde, without wauering, the which to do, thou must by deuout &amp; continual praier, faithfully craue helpe of <hi>Gods grace,</hi> without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which no man can continue in goodnes. And to accomplish all this, thou must remember thrée things: the first is, thy life past: the second, thy life present, &amp; the third thy life to come. These thrée considerations will encourage thée to stay where thou art, and as it were with a bridle will kéepe thee from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiling.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Think what thou hast done &amp; séene before time, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Folly,</hi> how thou liuedst vaine &amp; worldling like, yéelding to euery vaine concupiscence &amp; lust, wherby thou diddest fall into the filth of sin, diddest indaunger both thy body and thy soule, &amp; hadst thy conscience accusing thée. Oh where haddest thou ben, if <hi>Gods grace</hi> had not taken compassion vpon thée? Where be the worldlinges that wold not be sorrie for their sinnes? Wher are they become? Are they not condempned to euerlasting torments in hell fire? Oh thinke then that sinne doth greatly offende God: thinke what punishment God hath ordeined for sinne, which makes man an enimye to God, and a friende to the diuel: thinke that sinne hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued thee of thy first innocencie and vertue, making thee meate for hell-hounds, amongest whome thou haddest bene numbred and counted, if God of his grace had not pittied thée.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Thinke that at this present time thou art in Gods fauour, by the meanes of his grace, who hath made thee a childe of God, and an heire of heauen by hope, so that now thy conscience is quiet. Thinke what good consolations thou hast receiued by deuout praieng: thinke what spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual instructions <hi>Gods grace</hi> hath giuen to thee: think all the pleasures of the world are mingled with sorows: think that thou shalt haue no hurt, if thou remaine where thou art, for thou art in Gods kéepinge: thinke that this worlde

shall passe away with all the pompes and pleasures of the same: thinke that thy present state is the high-waie to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and so shalt thou kéepe <hi>Perseueraunce.</hi>

               <p n="3">3 Thirdly thinke that the iust iudgement of God is to come: which is to the good to giue Heauen, and to the euill Hell. Thinke thou must dye, and that at thy death thou shalt not receiue so good consolation as thou hast had of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> and <hi>Gods grace,</hi> in whose wholsome counsailes and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishments thou oughtest to perseuer to the end. Thinke that at thy death thou must leaue behinde thée, wife, children, goods, and monie. Whether thou doe good or euill, thinke that thou must goe to a region vnknowne, and to a place where thou hast neuer bene: and if thou be founde to haue dyed in sinne, without repentaunce, the Diuells will attend to take thy cursed bodie, and thy dampned soule, and will carrie both into the dungeon of darknesse, there to féele eternall torments. But if thou be found with <hi>Perseuerance,</hi> in the Pallaice of <hi>Vertue,</hi> millions of Angelles will goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thée, and with greate ioye will bringe thée to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>O thinke vpon the iust iudgement of God to come, when euery one shal be iudged according to his déeds. For God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth neither king nor kaiser, prince, nor people, high nor lowe, rich, nor poore, without respect of person, he wil crown the good, and condempne the euill, at that day of dome, when we must appeare personally without excuse or exception be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.

But will be gentle, iust, &amp; good, vnto those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue bene sorrie for their offences.

               </p>
               <p>Besides all this, thou must also most heartely humble thy selfe before God, acknowledging thy selfe a sinner, and that thou canst do nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is righteous: but if ther be any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in thée, either of nature or of <hi>Gods grace,</hi> thou must freely confesse that all comes from aboue. Repute not thy selfe better then another, but rather the least of all. If anie despise thee, mocke thee, or iniure thée, suffer it not onely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, but also willingly &amp; gladly, euen for the loue of God. For the scaling ladder of heauen is humilitie, &amp; a full deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng of thy selfe in al worldly causes. Thinke not wel of thy selfe for anie thing that thou doest, hast done, or maist do: but if thou hast anie goodnes in thy body, or in thy soule, be not ashamed to confesse that it is not thine, because it comes not from thée but of God: from him whom indéede it procéeds.</p>
               <p>If thou humble not thy selfe, there is no hope of thy soules helth. For to this effect our Lord said,<note place="margin">

Wherefore thou must often pray to God &amp; say. <hi>Lorde God, giue mee whatsoeuer thou wilt, do with me alwaies what thou wilt.</hi> And when at any time thou findest thy selfe as it were left of God, voide of deuotion, or destitute of consolation, whether it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlye or outwardlye, bee not discouraged for it,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:5155:67"/>
neither thinke that God hath forgotten thée, but heartelye humble thy selfe before God, accounting thée vnworthy of consolation, and putting all thy confidence in God, as in one that knowes how to saue his elect. If thou receiue any bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing inwardly, as wisdome, or anie other gift, exalt not thy selfe in pride, neither discommend others y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue not receiued of God such grace: but vse that which thou hast to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Againe, if thou see thy neighbours fall, take héed thou hate him not, iudge him not, &amp; condemne him not, but think that God permits thée to sée his offence for thy profit. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thou wast neuer touched with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crime: wel, it is much, but yet thou hast bene culpable in some other as bad, or els worse: vpon this examinatin reforme thy selfe, suppose thou art in no fault, thou must not therfore estéeme thy self better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in fault, knowing thou art of such a nature as he is, &amp; made of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same stuffe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is, &amp; therfore notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding thy supposition, a sinner, &amp; offender, as well as he: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both néed amending. Be thou sure, that if God had prouided no better for thée then thy selfe deserued, thou hadst committed the like offence, or els greater: &amp; thanke God that he hath kept thée so, &amp; pray for him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth amisse, &amp; is not yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou séest a sinner openly led to his last end to lose his life by law, know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dest a sinner before god as wel as he, although before the world thou be estéemed better. The life and death of our Lord &amp; sauiour Iesus Christ, is a glasse for all faithfull Christians to looke in. Wherefore with a good deuotion lead thou an holye life by his example, take paines to follow his humilitie, his sobrietie, his chastitie, his goondnesse, his charitie, his patience, his compassion, and all his other vertues. Ther is no schoole wherein a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an maye so well learne to liue well, as in the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs life &amp; conuersation: thou must oftentimes think on thy last end, as death, iudgement, hell, &amp; heauen: perseuer in praier &amp; in goodnes to the death, so thou shalt please God, &amp; not be loth to dye. <hi>Remember the end</hi> (saith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wise) <hi>&amp; thou shalt neuer sin</hi>: thou must often pray deuoutly to God, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou wilt so do,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7</note> thou must draw thy selfe from all affaires.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:5155:67"/>
For praier is a lifting vp of the hart to God, and a priuate speach or communication of the soule with God, If it be so, were there any reason that a man shuld withdraw his cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from God, or rather all outward busines put apart, with all reuerence to submit thy soule before him. All this notwithstanding it is not forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all our affairs to pray &amp; sing psalmes to Gods glorie, and oftentimes with teares to saie the Lordes praier, or anie other praier to that effect. And heere by the way thou must vnderstand, that the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est praier is not most profitablest, because of the multitude of cogitations &amp; thoughts rising in the minde. Besides that, they must be deuout, for the praiers which are done with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, with loue &amp; humilitie of the hart, doth profit most, as for all other praiers, they are vaine and to no purpose.</p>

doe more aduaunce Gods glory, then thy prosperitie doeth, yéelding thy will to GODS will, thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to aske patience, and saie with a meeke heart, <hi>Lord thy will bee done and not mine.</hi> Euermore haue the feare of GOD before thine eyes, iudgeing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempning thy selfe for thy sinne, and thou shalt not be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged nor condempned of God. Let no sinne so raigne in thée, as to depriue thee of Gods grace, and to tumble thée to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death. Better it is to dye in trouble without sinne, then to liue in prosperitie in sinne, and better it is to loose thy life for Gods cause, then to liue at ease, and loose God and thy life too.</p>
               <p>If thy senses be inclined to sinne, be not dismaid: for ther is a God, to whom if thou pray, will, by the power of his grace, suppresse that inclination. Wherefore take courage when thou art tempted, aske for helpe at God, saieng: <hi>O God make speede to saue me, O Lord make hast to helpe me: Lord God leaue me not but be my help, O thou Lord God of my health.</hi> Doe what thou canst to resist the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and he shall goe from thée: approch to God by Faith, and he will drawe néere vnto vs by his spirite. If the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell assault thée, defie him: and make thy mone to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour (saieng) <hi>Lord helpe me,</hi> and he will helpe thee. Doe thou thine indeuour, and assure thy selfe, that God wil make thée strong, he will aide thée, he will ease thée, and in the end will set thee free from all vexations, placing thée in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of heauens, the portion and inheritaunce of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts. To this God, and to Iesus Christ, with the holy Ghost, be all glorie, honour and praise, worlds without end. Amen.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thanke almightie God of his goodnes, that I am come to the ende of the voyage of the wandring Knight: by the which thou maist vnderstand, that in following <hi>Folly</hi> and vaine. <hi>Voluptuousnesse,</hi> he forsooke God, to the preiudice and hurt of his soule, yea, to the daunger of euerlasting damnation. Héere thou maist learne that al voluptuous worldlings are the very subiects of Satan, and that earthly goods and worldly pleasure, shal quickly consume. Thou art taught likewise what great clemencie God vsed to him, drawing him by his <hi>Grace,</hi> from the sinke of sinne, wherein he was sunke: how he was led to the place of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and from thence to the Pallaice of <hi>Vertue,</hi> where by <hi>Gods grace</hi> he is now, and what goodnesse he hath found there, thou hast heard at large. The Lord graunt vs to lande where he is landed, euen in the lande of promise, promised to the Elect.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude, I beséech your good courtesies, that if any thing in this my labour mislike you, interpret the same to the best, and to lay nothing to my charge in the waye of presumption: but commending my good meaning and allowing my will, not to contemne, but to speak well, and esteeme of this my worke, and to vse it for thy benefite and edification, for the which ende I made and compiled the same.</p>
               <p>And now I exhort you all (in Christian loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that if by Gods grace you be resident in <hi>Vertues</hi> Pallaice, to perseuer and continue there to the ende, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling your selues before God and alwaies trusting vnto his goodnesse, not vnto your owne strength or merites: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging also Gods grace, by the which you are as you are, and of whome you haue, that you haue. Let all your confidence be in his mercie and in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:5155:69"/>Furthermore, if any féele and perceiue himselfe out of <hi>Vertues</hi> Pallaice, by meanes of worldly vanities, let him consider the great perill he is in, and spéedely tourne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, with a contrite and sorrowfull heart, requiring pardon of God, and trusting wholly to the merites and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ. Let him not be ashamed to acknowledge his sinnes, which if he doe, he shall finde at Gods hands grace and mercie. And now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech our Lord God to giue vs all grace, to do according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which heere is spoken (for otherwise of our selues it is not possible) that leading a life acceptable and agréeable vnto his holy wil, we may in the end after the voyage which we haue to passe in this world, sée and enioye, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse and haue the full fruition of that glorious Citie of Paradise, where true blessednesse and perfect felicitie dwelleth, euen in the habitation of God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vnto whom be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, glory, power &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
