            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

but prefer the care of the Soul before all the World,
for it is more to be valued than Ten Thouſand Worlds:
Wherefore take heed to your ſelves, and be Wiſe in

what the Soul is, becauſe you ſee it not, neither can
you feel it; yet it is a Particle which came from
Heaven, and when it goes out of the Body it goes to
God, to Live for ever; it ſleeps not, neither doth it
die, for it is Immortal and of an Immortal Nature,
and ſo impoſſible to be deſtroy'd, for we have our

               </gap>
Grace, cauſing us to incline to the ſecret Study of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
that we may be even now poſſeſſed with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and pure delights; for Godlineſs is a kind of
God-likeneſs, a Divine Habit or Frame of Soul, that
may fitly be accounted the fulneſs of the Stature of
the inward Man. For 'tis an Inclination to be like
God, to pleaſe him, and injoy him; and he may be
ſaid to be God-like, that is High and Serious in all
his Thoughts, Humble and Condeſcending in all his
Actions, full of Love and good Will to all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and bright in the Knowledge of all their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Covering all the Treaſures of God, and Breaths
after the Joys of Heaven. Recollecting all his broken
and ſcattered Thoughts, nothing leſs than the Wiſdom
of God will pleaſe the God-like Man, for God-likeneſs
is the comment of Amity betwixt God and Man,
Eternity and Immenſity are the Sphere of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and are often frequented and filled: With his
Thoughts he muſt injoy God, or he can enjoy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor himſelf; for nothing will ſatisfie him but
the Glory of his great Creator, the great Counſellor
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60559:21"/>
of Nature, and the perfect Beauty of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.
And to be exalted to this frame is a very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime
and glorious perfection; and Bleſſed are all thoſe
that are thus Beautified in their Minds, and are Bleſſed
with ſuch an Angelical Soul, and are thus curiouſly
acquainted with theſe things: I heartily wiſh, that all
that ſhall happen to peruſe theſe things, may be a
little higher elevated with the true inward Senſe of
what is here deſcribed, and with the ſecret Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Decrees of God, and the Nature of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Eſſence, that they may be worthy to partake of his
ſublimity; and hereby aſpire to dwell with him for
ever, and covet the Treaſure of his Immenſity, and
be able to expaciate therein, by being Bleſſed with the
Wiſdom of an Angel, in being as Divine and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lly,
by being truly eminent in inward and outward
Worth; not being either weak or defective: For
Virtue is baſe and not Virtue while it is remiſs, or not
carried to the higheſt pitch 'tis poſſible, for then it is
that their Glory ſhall ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mount the rage of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and their true worth continue Immortally ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
throughout all Kingdoms and Ages for ever, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting
the benefits of their own Virtues, in the
Peace and Tranquility of their own happy Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and this becauſe they have been prepoſſed with
true gratitude and felicity; and in all their actions been
Cloathed with Meekneſs, and a condeſcending beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
having been highly kind and ſerviceable in their
Generation, free from the ſpots and blemiſhes of the
World; having frequently arrived to an univerſal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
and truly deſerved to be exceedingly Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all People; for it's a very hard matter to Hate
a very excellent Perſon. No Man was ever uppraided
for being a Wiſe and Gallant Man; but it often happens
that for ſome Infirmity that a good Man have, he may
ſuffer the misfortune of being cenſured; but meerly
for being Good or Wiſe, 'tis not uſual to ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
contempt, or ſlander, for it would be cruel,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60559:21"/>
for being Wiſe and Good, Holy and Chaſt, Juſt and
Liberal, Honeſt and Merciful, Meek and Couragious
to be vilified: Perhaps he may be cenſured and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

proficiency in Goodneſs, he will be ſure to overcome
the rage and malice of his Enemy, becauſe he have
made himſelf Eminent and Conſpicuous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is admired by all that love Virtue; becauſe he is
a Man of intire and approved Virtue, well known
for a Perſon of Honour and Worth, and therefore the
firſt envies and cenſures abate, becauſe he hath long
exerciſed Virtue and Goodneſs, with great Activity
and Courage, Prudence and Wiſdom: Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> after
his long Meekneſs and invincible Fidelity to the Jewiſh
Nation, was in the cloſe of his Life moſt exceedingly
Honoured by all People, and injoyed a veneration of
high Degree; for his Glory ſurmounted the rage of his
Enemies; and he will for ever continue Immortally,
ſhining throughout all Kingdoms and Ages. All good
Men delight in his Eternal Praiſes; for he is now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and admired for his Sanctity: He therefore is a full
and adequate Object of our early humble Imitation
not in working Miracles, but in Meekneſs, Love and
Magnanimous Actions, enriched with Liberality, and
made bright by Knowledge, guided by Wiſdom to
the higheſt end; every action being mixt with Gravity
and Chearfulneſs, for in the due uſe of theſe means we

of Eſteem and Honour, and is feed by its own Beauty
and Glory, yet Fooliſhly undermineth the Perſon it
would advance, with the greateſt baſeneſs and ſhame
imaginable; it devours the Beauty which ought to feed
it, and deſtroys the Glory in which it delights. The
higher the greater, the more perfectly Glorious and
Bleſſed the Perſon is that is exalted, is the baſeneſs and
ingratitude of Pride, and is therefore the dregs of
Impiety; and forfits and renounces all delights, and
blackens whatſoever might appear auſpicious, which
provokes deteſtation in all that delight in the Truth,
for this turns the brigthneſs of Seraphims into the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations

Many eminent Scholars have been eminently Poor;
ſome by choice, and more by chance and the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
decrees of Providence; wherefore the Rich may
ſupport the Poor, by his Wealth; and, perhaps the
Poor may inſtruct the Rich in Learning and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
for it may be obſerved, no Man had all Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and Felicity in this one Perſon or Power: Therefore
there is but few Wiſe and Good Men that would change
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60559:27"/>
Conditions entirely with any Man in the World, for
though ſome there are that would deſire the Wealth
of one Man added to himſelf, or the Power of another,
and the Learning of a third; yet, ſtill he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
theſe in his own Perſon, becauſe he loves that
beſt, and therefore eſteems that moſt, tho we deſire
the Wealthy to Inrich us, the Powerful to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
us, and the Witty to Delight us. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that in the Fortune of a Prince, there is not the
courſe Robes of Beggary, but there is infinite Cares,
Fears and Dangers; therefore the State of Affliction
is a School of Virtue, wherein there is the Exerciſe of
Wiſdom, the Tryal of Patience, and the wining a
Crown; for this may be ſaid to be the Gate of
Glory.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Therefore we may not expect to be better
treated than the Apoſtles, and Saints; nay, than the
Son of the Eternal God, the Heir of both the Worlds.
Affliction is oftentime the occaſions of Temporal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
as well as Spiritual; and if we imploy our
Grace and Reaſon well it will deliver us from extream
Neceſſitys, and if you will not otherwiſe be Cured:
If you improve your time w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll, God will deliver you
in his due time, if it be for his Glory and your Good,
for his Power can Sanctifie Poverty to you, and make
it become as neceſſary as Riches; for tho Poverty
makes a Man diſpiſed, and contemptable, and expoſed
to a Thouſand Inſolencies of evil Perſons, and leaves
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em defenceleſs; yet, it may make them look up
to God, and truſt more firmly in him the Rock of
their Strength, who will moſt certainly deliver them
from the cruelty of all Wicked Perſons: Wherefore
it is ſaid of Poverty, that it is the Siſter of a good
Mind, the Parent of ſober Councel, the Nurſe of all
Virtue; and this is really true, a great Eſtate has great
Croſes, and a mean Fortune has ſmall ones; for Riches
often bread a Diſeaſe in the Souls of them that long
after them, and admire them with too much egar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60559:27"/>

by Learning the Duty, when he receives the Reward,
Poverty is therefore in ſome ſenſe eligible, and to be

            <p>Sixthly, But to return to a further inquiry into the

that the Soul of Man is capable of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Where this Love is, if it meet with hard Precepts

with the ſhining Beauty of Soul, raviſhing delights by
Divine Reſpiration, giving it true Repoſe, cauſing the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60559:29"/>
Delights and Pleaſures to be as Capacious as the Soul,
that lovely Creature of God, whom his Majeſty is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
pleaſed to fill with an Ineffable Pleaſure; in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
extending their Knowledge of Intellection,
by Conſequences and Lights always New, which they
draw from their Light and their Knowledge, always
acquired, they always find ſomething to be diſcovered
in the Immenſe Spaces of Truth, they always find ſome-Shing
to be enlightned with of the Perfection of the
aupream Eſſence, which they always ſee all entire, and
ill expoſed to their Eyes, and, which they never
knew ſo perfectly; but that there always remains
ſomething further to be known and diſcovered, they
always Drink of this Lively and Eternal Spring, and
are always a Thirſt; they drein from thence every
moment, by a full and entire Knowledge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive
Viſion, but they always find it full and inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
to Reaſon and Intellection, which they always
make a further Progreſs into, and further ſtill find
ſomething to be known in the Fountain of its infinite
Incomprehenſibility. The Reprobate Souls do alſo
find by the exerciſe of their reaſonings, a Thouſand;
and a Thouſand New diſpairs in their State of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
and Miſery: The Prophets ſay, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
remain awake to the End; they may always
ſee their Miſery and Woe, which does expreſs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of the active Faculty in Unhappy Souls, which
proves that all Souls have out of the Body, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of the Faculties, of Perceiving, of Imagining,
and of Recollecting, which they do not exerciſe here,
but dependent upon the Body: For thus we ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty, that they may compare one thing with
another, that they Conceive the Nature of Bodies
by pure Intellection, by which they form Univerſal
Notions; from whence they draw Conſequences, and
frame Ideas; but theſe Ideas do not cauſe us to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Body and the Soul can be united like
two Liquors, or like two Metalls, which are melted
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60559:29"/>
one with the other, which are made either by an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous
or Viſcous Humor, which binds the Parts of
them together, nor by Nails, Pegs and Joynts. We
may not imagine here any thing material, for we
are to cut off every thing that preſents it ſelf Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
to our Spirits, for we are to conceive preciſely
only a mutual and neceſſary Dependance, in ſuch a
manner, as God has directed and diſpoſed; which is
the way to conceive the manner how our Souls are
in our Bodies, as well as we are capable to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend:
They are not in us by a Local and Corporeal
Circumſcription, they are not there as Liquor is in a
Veſſel, or as a Bird is in the Neſt or Cage, or as the
Body is in the Air, which environs it; but they are
in us as God is in the World, in which we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, as ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin, Much more contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than contained;</hi> for we may remember, that tho
the Nature of the Soul is a Spiritual Nature, which
doth as Eſſentially exclude Local extention, and by
Conſequence all ſorts of Ideas of Local Preſence,
ſuch as we commonly conceive under Corporeal
Images of Immediation, of Preportions, and of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extention,
of Subſtances, as it doth Eſſentially include
the Grounds and the Acts of the knowing Faculty.
Bodies have their proper Faſhion of being within
Places, and Spirits have theirs likewiſe; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of likeneſs betwixt one and the other, for to
think otherways, were to ſubvert and deſtroy both
Corporeal and Spiritual Nature; for it is with the
manner how the Soul is in the Body, as it is with the
Soul it ſelf: We cannot comprehend it as oft as we
conceive it by Imagination, what Corporeal Image
ſo ever we make of it, or under what material Form
ſoever we may conceive of it; for the manner how
the Soul is in the Body is altogether as Spiritual, as
is the Subſtance of the Soul; if it be demanded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, in what Part of the Body the Soul is, or
whether ſhe is in all the Body; the Queſtion will
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60559:30"/>
be difficult to reſolve: However, the Learned ſay,
that all the Soul is in all the Body, and all of it in
the Eſſential and Integral Parts of it, as God is in
all the World, and in all the Parts of the World;
not by that Co-extenſion and Local Chimerical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
which groſs Spirits do imagine, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Preſence of his Eſſence, Eſſentially operating
in all the World. We muſt ſay the ſame of the
Soul, that it is in all the Body, by relation of its
dependance and activity; but this does not hinder,
but that we may ſay ſhe is more properly, and more
particularly in the Brain, ſince it is by that Part,
that the action of the Soul upon the Body imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
Commences; and that all the actions of the
Body upon the Soul termin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tes wholly in that Part,
as it ſenſibly appears, by that which interrupts and
ſuſpends the action of the Soul upon the Body, and
the action of the Body upon the Soul; for as often
as it happens that the action of the Body upon the
Soul is interrupted, it is becauſe there is ſome relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſome obſtruction in ſome of the Nerves,
which hinders the motion from being continued in
the Part affected of the Body, as far as the Brain,
which is the Seat and Organ of the Senſes, becauſe
the impreſſion have ſome palpable let or hindereance,
and cannot be carried, or arrive through the exterior
Senſes of the Brain, which are called Internal. But
our Souls Naturally, like other-Created Spirits, ought
not to have any dependance upon our Bodies, for to
have the Ideas of things, they ought only to have
immediately dependance upon God, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
ought only to have Union with him; but this
Supreame Spirit having been pleaſed, for the reaſons
we have ſaid, and for many others which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and for more, yet apparently, perhaps, which
we do not conceive, that our Souls ſhould have their
Thoughts and their Sentiments, their Deſires and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
upon the occaſion of the Body, to the end,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60559:30"/>
that they ſhould be a continual Subject of Victory,
and Meritorious Exerciſe, by the aſſiſtance of Divine
Grace, which is of it ſelf Victorious over the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
delectation of Concupiſcence; whereof it invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
ſuſpends the Charm, by the Heavenly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Taſte, which it gives us of God, of our Duty,
and of Eternal Happineſs; for Divine Grace cauſes

which he cauſes us to Love; which is as it were, the

in the abſtracted Idea of our Duties, or in the real

Spirits knowing by themſelves, or in themſelves, the

               </gap>
which God makes tryal off in the Body, to which he
ſubjects it before he Crowns it with Eternity: But the
Soul of Man if God had not diſpoſed of it, after that
manner, would have had no need of a Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Union of Souls with Bodies is a hard and
difficult Empire, which God doth exerciſe over them,
and which if his Majeſty would not ſweeten the rigo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
and difficulty of it, by the Pleaſures of agreeable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
which he hath annexed to the Acts and
Operations of Souls in Bodies. It could not be a tryal,
but a Miſery; nay, the Fathers maintain, that if God
ſhould not Spiritualize Bodies, that is to ſay, take
away from Souls the dependance which their preſent
State gives them upon Bodies, they could not have ſo
firm a hope of being raiſed again, as now they have,
becauſe he would not put the Juſt Souls, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Fidelity deſerves to be Crowned into Bodies
that ſhould conſtrain them, and which enſlaved their
Thoughts; which is what Spiritualized Bodies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear, becauſe Spiritualization of Bodies will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in this preciſely, that they ſhould no longer exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
an Empire over the Souls, and that they ſhould
be no longer a Charge, an Obſtacle and an Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
to them; for the Body cannot in any manner
act upon the Soul, ſo as to Illuminate it, or Affect
it Phyſically, or Immediately by it ſelf; for the Body
cannot ſubject the Soul to be United to it, nor can
the Soul be willing to ſubmit to the Body, which
humbleth and conſtraineth it. It is therefore God
the Author of univerſal Nature, that is the Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and Efficient Principle, and Cauſe of the Union of
Souls and Bodies; for his Wiſdom acteth as univerſal
Cauſe in the whole frame of Nature; 'tis evident then
that none but God alone can give the Soul the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
and Ideas which ſhe hath, from the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Impreſſions which are made upon the
Body, for 'tis the Author of Nature which enlightens
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60559:33"/>
us, by the Ideas which we receive upon the occaſion
of the Impreſſion, of exterior Objects; and who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionates
to the Converſation of the Body, by the
agreeable or diſagreeable Sentiments which he gives
us, to make us know by way of inſtinct, that which
is profitable or hurtful, for the Conver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ation of our
Bodies and of Humane Species. This action he joyns
to that, by which he moves our Bodies, when our
Thoughts and Wills require it, and is properly the
action, by the which he Unites our Bodies to our Souls,
and our Souls to our Bodies. This is the active or
actual Union, which the Schools call the Unitive
action of God, which is joyned to the Immutable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
and Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the which he hath determined to
continue it, ſo long as the ſtructure of the Body
ſhall ſubſiſt, and makes in the Soul and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Body
that Eſtate of Union, which is called Paſſive and
Formal Union; and this the Almighty doth by the
Eſſential act of his Supreame Nature, for his Eſſence
and Nature is infinitly pleaſed to act thus continually,
eſteeming it his Pleaſure and his Glory, by which,
alſo he is the occaſional Cauſe of all the Eneffable

of the Reprobates, for each of theſe he is pleaſed

            <p>4 Our Body is a Structure full of Harmony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all the Parts are United to one common Center,
which is the Brain wrapt up in Membranes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
and divided into divers Compartments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

which the Divine Image ſhall in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the Body, but we take
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60559:33"/>
care not to conceive it. For all that as truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
contain'd in the Body, it is United to the Body;
but we may not conceive her as poured into, and
mingled with the Body; or, as adjuſted to its extent
by a co-extention and immediation of Greatneſs, of
Figure, or of Subſtance; but they have the greateſt
part of their Thoughts, and of their Ideas, and of all
their Sentiments of Pleaſure, and of Pain, by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of their Body, becauſe they act upon the Body
by the action of the Will, which removes them and
moves them, in the manner as have been already ſaid.
The Learned ſay, that they are no otherways in the
Body, therefore every thing we conceive beyond this,
will be falſe, contradictory and extreamly dubious.
That which we call good Senſe and Judgment, is
nothing but the Power and Faculty which the Soul
hath, to Order and Regulate our Thoughts, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
and ſtay them, that ſhe may conſider and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Connexion and Dependence: But ſhe is ſaid,
ſometimes to looſe this Faculty and Power, when
the Motion of the Blood, Humours, and of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits, or of the Fibres of the Brain, which is
the Organ of the Internal Senſe, which are annexed

which remains of the Objects, are diſordered and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled
in ſuch ſort, that the Natural Order and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of theſe Species cannot be obſerved and kept,
but are confuſedly and tumultuouſly excited and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, by a tumultuous and irregular agitation of the
Organ, in which they reſide; from whence comes
neceſſarily, that kind of Folly which conſiſts in a

nicities of Nature, or the manner how our Soul acts
in our Body; for better it is that the Soul and Body be
free from pollution, than to underſtand all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

rather to Suffer any Indignity, than that we ſhould
continue in the Guilt of Sin; becauſe any pollution
unquallifies us for his Kingdom, and Robs us of the
Happineſs of being meet to be Citizens thereof. For

            <p>Our Soul is ſaid to commence when it goes out of
the Body. That which we call time is taken either
by relation to the duration of the abode of every
Soul in its Body, or by relation to the duration of
the whole preſent Oeconomy of the viſible World,
deſtined to the Tryal of the Souls in the Bodys;
and in whatſoever ſignification we take Time, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to Eternity, it ſignifies preciſely a State of
Inſtability, of Change and Viciſſitude, <hi>i. e.</hi> a State
which ought to have an end; for theſe are two
things which enter Eſſentially into the Idea, which
is called Time Viciſſitude, and End; the ſpace of the
duration that our Souls are in our Bodies, is called
Time, for theſe two Reaſons. Firſt, becauſe it is to
have an end. And Secondly, becauſe in the interim,
ſo long as it endures, it holds us expoſed to a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Chainges and Viciſſitudes; and, which is to be
lamented, that Viciſſitude of being obnoxious to paſs
from Good to Evil, from Virtue to Sin, to Crimes
or Vice; but on the contrary, Eternity is Immutable
and an Interminable State and Order of things: As
much as Time includes Inſtability and End, ſo much
does Eternity excludes both; Time ſpeaks Change<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and End, Eternity ſpeaks the Being always the ſame
and never ending. Thus as our preſent State in the
Body is Time, ſo our future State out of the Bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

otherways we ſhall be tormented with the contriety
of our deſires. The happineſs of a contented Spirit
conſiſts not only in the fruition of its Bliſs, but in the
Fruits and Effects it produceth in our Lives, which
makes every Virtuous Man truly Great within, and
Glorious in his retirements, Magnanimity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
are very near aly'd, they ſpring from the ſame
Parents, but are of ſeveral Features. Fortitude and
Patience are Kindred too, to this incomparable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
for theſe fill a Man with true Pleaſure and great
Treaſure, which makes him Magnanimous and truly
Great, not in his own Thoughts but in the ſight of
God: The Magnanimous Soul is always awake, the
whole Globe of Earth is but a Nut-ſhel in compariſon
of his Injoyments; for God alone is his Sovereign
delight and Supreame complacency: So that nothing
is great if compared to a Magnanimous Soul, but the
Sovereign Lord of all Worlds. But Man divided from
God is a weak and inconſiderable Creature: But every
Soul united to God is a Tranſcendent and Celeſtial
thing, for God is its Life, its Greatneſs, and its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
its Bleſſedneſs and Perfection; for he that is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and Eternity fills the Holy Soul, and makes
it able to contain all heights, and depths, and lenghts,
and breadths whatſoever. In a Word, it's the deſire
of every ſuch Soul to be filled with the fulneſs of
God. Magnanimous deſires are the Natural reſults of
a Magnanimous Capacity, the deſire of being like
God, of knowing Good and Evil. But in a groſſer
ſence, this was the deſtruction of the Old World:
Not that it is Unlawful to deſire to be like God, but
to aſpire to the Perfection in a forbidden way, by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60559:42"/>
Diſobedience and following our own Inventions, by
ſeeking to the Creatures in oppoſition to the great
Creator. A Magnanimous Soul if we reſpect its Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
is an immovable Sphere of Power and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
far greater than all Worlds, by its Virtue and
Power that it paſſeth through all things, the Centre
of the Earth, and through all exiſtencies; and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch
Creatures as theſe he counteth but Vanity and
Trifles in compariſon of his true Object, the great
Almighty, whoſe Tranſcendent Goodneſs deſendeth
in full Showers upon all Men, by his communitive
Goodneſs which is freely extended to every Man.</p>
