         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The worthy, learned and most accomplished <hi>Edward Sherburne</hi> Esquire, Clerk of His Majesties Ordnance, having been pleased to convert the Ancient Astronomical <hi>Latin</hi> Poem of <hi>Manilius</hi> on the Sphere into a polite and elegant <hi>English</hi> one, hath more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over interlaced the same with Annotations concerning the Discoveries and Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Moderns, and hath subjoyned a large Catalogue of Astronomers and their Writings, amongst which he takes notice of Mr. <hi>John Collins;</hi> in the Narrative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom, there is an account of many excellent Mathematical Treatises lost through want of due encouragement to print the same, and there being affairs of that nature proposed to my self and others to undertake, which will be too heavy a burden without the advice, assistance and encouragement of Learned and Noble Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages; concerning which perchance there may be particular Proposals hereafter print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: however to shew my willingness to promote such Designs, and the ill consequences of letting them sink, I have caused so much out of that Book, as concerns the said Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and the abovementioned Narratvie to be printed apart, as followeth:</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MAster JOHN COLLINS Accomptant, and a Member of the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, published in the year 1658. his Treatise entituled <hi>The Sector on a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,</hi> in which there are very curious Prints of two great <hi>Quadrants,</hi> and of two small <hi>Quadrants</hi> with particular <hi>Projections</hi> on them, serving for the <hi>Latitude</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> Albeit by Aid of other Lines each of those <hi>Quadrants</hi> is rendred Universal for <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical</hi> Use, as, finding the Hour and <hi>Azimuth,</hi> and other <hi>Spherical Proportions;</hi> The <hi>Author</hi>'s chief Design in publishing such Prints, was to shew the World that the said Prints might be pasted on Copper or Brass, and so varnished, as to be rendred preservable from Dirt, or sullying, and sold at a cheap Rate, as now they are.</p>
            <p>In 1659. he published his <hi>Treatise of Navigation,</hi> entituled the <hi>Mariners Plain Scale new Plained.</hi> In which, besides <hi>Projections</hi> of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> there are <hi>Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> for many <hi>Astronomical Problems,</hi> and <hi>Spherical Proportions.</hi> The Book hath found good Acceptance, and is now like to become a Common Theme to the <hi>Scholars of Christ's Hospital London,</hi> whereof forty (by <hi>His Majesty's Bounty,</hi> and to <hi>His Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Renown</hi> in Establishing a <hi>Lecturer</hi> to instruct them) are constantly to be taught <hi>Navigation,</hi> and e're long 'tis to be hoped the Author will reprint the same with considerable <hi>Additions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same year he published a <hi>Treatise of Geometrical Dyalling,</hi> of good Esteem, both for the Newness and easiness of Method in situating the <hi>Requisites,</hi> and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Hour-Lines.</hi> In which there being <hi>Spherical Proportions,</hi> and some <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Problems,</hi> it deserves to be remembred in this Catalogue.</p>
            <p>In the year 1667. he published in the <hi>Philosophical Transactions</hi> the <hi>Solution of a Problem concerning Time,</hi> to wit, about the <hi>Iulian Period,</hi> with divers <hi>Perpetual Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manacks</hi> in <hi>single Verses;</hi> a <hi>Chorographical Problem,</hi> and divers other Things since, in the said <hi>Transactions,</hi> which we mention not, as being irrelative to the <hi>Sphere</hi> or <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy (viz.</hi> concerning <hi>Merchants Accompts, compound Interest,</hi> and <hi>Annuities, &amp;c.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We should be injurious to him, if we did not farther inlarge, by telling the World how much it is obliged for his Pains in exciting the Learned to publish their Works, and in acting the Part of an <hi>Ingenious Obstetrix</hi> at the Press, in correcting and in drawing of <hi>Schemes;</hi> So that he hath been Instrumental in furnishing the World with the many learned <hi>Mathematical Books</hi> here lately published
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98857:2"/>
(for which, his chief Reward hitherto hath been to obtain from the Learned the Title of <hi>Mersennus Anglicanus)</hi> and many more may be expected, if moderate Encouragements towards Printing such Works, and Leisure for such an Affair be not impeded through the necessary Avocations for a livelyhood, and though it be besides my Design, yet I cannot but digress in giving <hi>him</hi> and <hi>others like minded</hi> (which are very rate to be found) their due commendations, in promoting the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Design of getting <hi>Learned Men</hi> to impart their <hi>Labours</hi> to be Printed; and exciting others to encourage the same, as being of singular Use and advantage to the <hi>Republick</hi> of Learning; through the want whereof many Learned Mens Works of much worth have been lost, suppressed or long delayed. As those of <hi>Maurolycus, Abbot of Messina,</hi> a large Catalogue whereof is to be seen at the End of <hi>his Opuscula,</hi> but by the Care of the learned Mathematician <hi>Alphonsus Borellius</hi> some of them have been published in this Age, ninety years after the Author's Death; as his <hi>Apollonius</hi> at <hi>Messina</hi> in 1656. containing the substance of the four first Books of the <hi>Apollonius</hi> of <hi>Commandinus,</hi> and two more Additional Books of <hi>Maurolycus,</hi> and all in less Room, and at a much cheaper price. And now by the like Diligence the said <hi>Borellius</hi> is publishing <hi>Maurolycus</hi> his <hi>Archimedes</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>a Good one,</hi> after we have been long tired with the <hi>Common Latin bad one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Through want of such care the many learned Works of <hi>Vernalion</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> Master to <hi>Iosephus Auria,</hi> have not hitherto come to light, as his Commentaries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all <hi>Archimedes, Apollonius, Serenus, Euclid, Ptolemaeus,</hi> and divers others of the Ancients; which is much to be lamented; seeing he was, according to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the said <hi>Auria, Vir, Divinitate quadam Ingenii Ornatus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor those of the learned <hi>Bernardinus Baldus, Abbot of Guastalla,</hi> mentioned at the End of his Comment on <hi>Aristotle's Mechanicks,</hi> amongst which are two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums of the <hi>Lives of Mathematicians,</hi> whereof <hi>Bartholinus</hi> in his Preface to the <hi>Edition of the Optick Fragments of Heliodorus Larissaeus,</hi> Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> 1657. gives an honourable <hi>Elogium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Varenius</hi> could find no Stationer or Printer in <hi>Holland</hi> to undertake his <hi>Treatise of Conicks and curved Lines.</hi> See the Preface to his <hi>History of Iapan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish</hi> deceased, Brother to the present <hi>Duke of Newcastle,</hi> had not (as 'tis credibly reported) given liberally toward the Printing of <hi>Mydorgius</hi> his four first Books of <hi>Conicks,</hi> they had never come to publick view; the four last, as likewise those <hi>of Paschal the Younger,</hi> yet remaining unprinted upon the same Accompt, of whom <hi>Mersennus</hi> gives this Censure, <hi>quòd Unicâ Propositione Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versalissimâ, quadringentis Corrolariis armatâ, totum Apollonium complexus est.</hi> The <hi>Manuscript</hi> as yet remaining unprinted (as I am informed) in the Hands, or at the Disposal of <hi>Monsieur Du Prez</hi> a Bookseller in <hi>Paris;</hi> the want whereof is the more considerable in regard the Author (besides the ordinary method) treats of <hi>the Conick Sections,</hi> as projected from lesser Circles of the Sphere-</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Erasmius Bartholinus</hi> well known by his Additions to the second <hi>Volume of Des Cartes,</hi> as it is commonly termed; could find none to undertake the Printing of <hi>De Beaunes Treatise De Angulo solido,</hi> and other <hi>Treatises</hi> both of that <hi>Authors,</hi> and his own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iungius</hi> his <hi>Phoranomicks,</hi> and <hi>Treatise De locis Planis, &amp;c.</hi> and other <hi>Algebrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tractates;</hi> have remained at <hi>Hamborough</hi> above ten years since the Author's Death unprinted, for want of due Encouragement: Albeit a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> who writes his Life, makes him, although a <hi>Physician,</hi> equal in Mathematical Knowledge to <hi>Des Cartes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the like Reasons we may conceive we want the many learned <hi>Algebraical
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98857:2"/>
Works</hi> of our famous Countryman Mr. <hi>Thomas Harriot,</hi> (and of Mr. <hi>Warner,</hi> into whose Hands they fell) who is esteemed by some of the most knowing Persons alive to have been much Superiour to all that ever writ; and, that equivalent to what of his might have been forty or fifty years since known, is not readily to be expected.</p>
            <p>For want of the like Encouragement, we have lost that most excellent Piece of the incomparable <hi>Vieta,</hi> his <hi>Harmonicon Coeleste;</hi> as likewise the Remains of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Anderson</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> as his <hi>Conicks, Stereometria Solidorum, &amp; Triangul. Sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric.</hi> the want whereof <hi>Guldinus</hi> much bewails and excites the ingenious to enquire after them.</p>
            <p>On the same Accompt the Remains of <hi>Griembergerus,</hi> as his <hi>Conicks, Dialling,</hi> and <hi>Projections</hi> of the Sphere have not come to light; and for the very same Reason the second Tome of <hi>Galilaeus</hi> in <hi>English</hi> doth, and is like to remain, unprinted. And for the same Reason the <hi>English</hi> Tongue is barren of Mathematical (and divers other) Books in respect of the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> there being little or nothing yet extant of <hi>Catoptricks, Dioptricks, Staticks, Mechanicks, &amp;c.</hi> and not much of Perspective and other Kinds, the number of Students in these Sciences, as yet scarce being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to take off 500 Books, or so small an Impression as may give a Bookseller a Prospect of moderate gain in a competent time by his undertaking.</p>
            <p>With the like <hi>Remora</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> have met the Works of the Excellent <hi>Monsieur Fermat, viz. Euclidis Porismata restituta;</hi> his <hi>Treatise De Locis Planis Solidis Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nearibus &amp; ad Superficiem,</hi> and his <hi>Treatise De Contactibus Sphaericis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As also the Remains of the much knowing <hi>Lalovera,</hi> as his <hi>Geometrical Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, sive Explicatio vocum Geometricarum,</hi> four Books <hi>Problematum Illustrium,</hi> four Books <hi>Problematum Physico-Mathematicorum,</hi> and a <hi>Collection of Letters</hi> between <hi>him</hi> and the <hi>learned,</hi> containing the <hi>Solution of many Problems of great Curiosity and Difficulty,</hi> which seeing they are not like to get Printed there, they have written over to know if they would be undertaken here; promising to send the <hi>MS. Copies.</hi> And having hinted thus much at the Instance of this <hi>Ingenious</hi> and <hi>Industrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> to the <hi>Curious,</hi> and <hi>Generously learned;</hi> I come now again further to acquaint the Reader, that we have more particularly obtained from him an Accompt of two of his own <hi>Designs,</hi> relative to the <hi>Sphere</hi> and <hi>Astronomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one of <hi>Geometrical Dialling,</hi> whereby <hi>reflex Dyalling</hi> is rendred <hi>Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and reduced to a Method of Calculation;</hi> so that if a <hi>Glass</hi> were placed at <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and Lines drawn on the <hi>Plain</hi> by chance, by either Method, <hi>Points</hi> might be found in the said <hi>Lines</hi> which joyned should be the <hi>Hour Lines;</hi> and the like when the <hi>Glass</hi> is so placed, that the Hour Lines may be drawn in that Part of the Room which is most capable of them; and as a <hi>Corollary</hi> of this Doctrine a <hi>Dial</hi> for any <hi>Latitude</hi> may be suddainly divided from a Line of <hi>Tangents</hi> parallel to any Line proposed, and that without any <hi>Calculation</hi> for the <hi>Horary Divisions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other a <hi>Treatise of Projections of the Sphere,</hi> and <hi>concerning Spherical Trigono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry;</hi> in which many extraordinary Cases will be solved; those <hi>Proportions</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before in the <hi>Narrative</hi> concerning Mr. <hi>William Oughtred,</hi> several wayes more easily demonstrated, and all Spherical Triangles measured by a new Method (not by him formerly insisted on) after the manner of <hi>Plain Triangles;</hi> all which perchance may be handled in some little <hi>Tractates</hi> concerning the Use of <hi>Prints</hi> of several other <hi>Instruments</hi> designed to be cut, pasted, and varnished, as before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Analemma,</hi> the <hi>double Horizontal Dial,</hi> the <hi>Logarithmical Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Line,</hi> Prints <hi>of Logarithmical Rulers;</hi> whereof if there be three, they may be so placed as to lie still all Day, and as fast as the Height of the Sun is given, shall find either the <hi>Hour</hi> or <hi>Azimuth</hi> universally by bare <hi>Inspection.</hi>
