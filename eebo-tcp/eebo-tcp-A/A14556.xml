            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE VOYCE OF THE LORD IN THE TEMPLE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD in all ages hath given Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his power, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of that power which is able in flaming fire to take vengeance on them that do not know and obey him, even the power which the Excellent Singer of <hi>Israel</hi> thus expresseth,<note place="margin">Psal. 29.</note> 
               <hi>The voyce of the Lord is powerfull; The voyce of the Lord is full of Majesty, The voyce of the Lord divides the flames of fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here have we notice, not only of his power but his goodnesse; so as wee may say with the Prophet, <hi>The Lord is jealous, and the Lord reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth</hi>;<note place="margin">Nahum 1.</note>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:15292:3"/>
yet withall, <hi>the Lord is slowe to anger, and great in power, his way is in the whirle wind and in the storme, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</hi> For here we see God in the storme, threatning judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet shewing mercy; yea, Mercy trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing over judgement: And indeed his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment leads to Mercy by leading to Repentance; For whiles it calls to Repentance, it forewarnes to flye the wrath to come: Whereas without Repentance, this will be but a patterne and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of eternall fire. But if like wise children burnt with this temporall fire, sinners by peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence escape the everlasting burnings of eternall fire; then may they sing Mercy and judgement, even judgement turned into Mercy: And then may they breake out into thanksgivings, for the judgement which hath brought them by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to Mercy, and did now terrifie them, but not destroy them; and did terrifie them now, that it might not hereafter eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them.</p>
            <p>On Whitsunday last a faire morning began, but by the desert of sinne, turned into blacke darknesse, and was shadowed about 8. or 9. of the clocke with a cloud, and this cloud was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with some (not extraordinary) darknesse, claps of Thunder, and flashes of Lightning; but afterwards vvhen Divine Prayers and Sermon were ended, and Administration of the blessed Sacrament of the Lords Supper was neere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, there came a very vehement fire, farre more bright than Lightning; and this fire
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15292:3"/>
was suddenly attended with a terrible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable sound, to the great amazement and astonishment of the people then present in the Church. The terrour of this strange fire and fearefull sound, drew from some pittifull cryes, caused in others a dead silence, their senses being stupified and overcome by that which they saw, heard, and felt.</p>
            <p>More particularly, while the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was administring, and when as many as came to a first and second Table had received, and those that came to a third had received the bread, Light came in at the Chancell window, and was seene in the Chancell by divers persons, in the forme of a fiery Ball, the bignesse of a Bowle, and did strike divers persons which were kneeling and expecting the Cup.</p>
            <p>Divers hurts by divers persons were then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, of which my selfe was one, who thought I had the haire of mine head burnt off, and the outside of my left legge scalded, and could not in minde be otherwise perswaded, untill I was informed the contray of the one, and mine owne eyes saw the contrary of the other. In which give me leave to expresse unto the Reader (and that with hearty thankes to my mighty Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) my great deliverance, and that onely by Gods good providence toward me; I received the blow at my very turning towards the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table, to take the Cup to administer the Wine, and I was no sooner removed from the place, but instantly a Ball of Fire came into
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15292:4"/>
the same place vvhere I stood before, as is testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by divers persons then present.</p>
            <p>For my owne part I call to minde that I saw a great flaming fire about my body, and heard a terible sound in mine eares; and the blow which came vvith it (according to our sense) if it had lighted on my person, must needs have proved mortall. And my wife <hi>Elizabeth Bache,</hi> sitting in her seate after the receiving of that holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, being astonished, partly with the greatnesse of the sound, partly vvith the terror of the fire, and partly vith the cry of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, supposing some one had beene strucke dead, asked of some of her neighbours by her, vvhether that vvere her husband vvhich vvas killed? Reply vvas made her; not, thankes be to God, for hee is comforting <hi>Iohn Hodge,</hi> one of the distressed, and astonished persons. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Antony Furlong</hi> the yonger, vvas stricken in the soles of his feete, and likewise in the legges as it had beene with Gunpower, and so he saw the fire vanish away in the manner of sparkles. <hi>Iohn Brusie</hi> likewise saw at the same time, as it were a Ball of fire desending from above; which when it came to the ground, dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with a deadly Sound; and hee felt his legges and toes extraodinary hot therewith; but when hee returned home, and looked upon them, they were onely very red, but hee had no other harme. <hi>William Sargent,</hi> a Masters mate of a ship, kneeling under the Chauncell window, was stricken on the chine, as seemed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15292:4"/>
to him with a bullet: The blow was so grievous, as that hee thought his body had beene cut in two peeces; yea such was the violence of the blow, that it caused his water forthwith to issue from his body; and for a time lost his sight and sences, but soone recovered them againe; which <hi>Sargeant</hi> for two or three yeares before feeling oftimes a great paine in his chine, was hereby so cured, as that hee felt no paine there since. <hi>John Gendle</hi> a servant vnto <hi>Richard Carew</hi> Esq. was smitten against the fore part of the right shoulder, where hee kneeled upon his knees, with a great violence, that (hearing as it were the hissing of a great shot) hee thought hee had beene stricken therewith, and his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had beene carried cleane away: hee was turned almost round about where hee kneeled, and exceedingly astonisht with the blow. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Peeke</hi> was fearefully smitten, in all the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer part of his body, as if it had beene made dead; and felt the water in his bladder, as it were boyling hot; hee supposed hee had beene shot thorow; he vvas set up upon the forme, by vvhich he vvas kneeling, himselfe not knowing how. <hi>Dorothy Tubbe</hi> vvho vvas then kneeling to receive the Communion, vvas so smitten vvith this Lightning, that it seemed to her that her legs and knees vvere stricken off from her body, vvherevvith shee vvas astonisht for a vvhile, but afterwards recovering her senses, felt extraordinarie paine, and heate therein, vvhich by little and little vvent so avvay, as it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15292:5"/>
left onely a little numnesse in them, during the most part of that day; but in the end shee vvas (by the blessing of God) perfectly freed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Ferdinando Reepe</hi> of the Church-towne, vvas stricken in the sole of his left foote, vvith such violence, as he thought it had been split in peeces; and vvith the same blow vvas for the time deprived of his senses. <hi>Iohn Hodge</hi> vvas smitten in his knees, and thighes; and so as if every joynt of the lovver part of his body had beene unjoynted; hee feared greatly hee should never have beene able to stand againe; it forced from him, a bitter and most pittifull cry; hee likevvise savv the ball of fire. <hi>Susanna Collings</hi> also received a greeuous blovv, as if shee had beene strucke with fire, and the under part of her body seem'd, as if it had beene severed from the upper; it scalded the vvrest of her right arme, as broad as a peece of three pence, vvhich vvas not vvhole in a fortnight after; though she nor any of the rest felt any of the greater hurts, after the same day; shee vvas so astonisht with the blow, as that shee fell sidewayes therewith, as shee kneeled by the forme: who being seene so falne, there came one <hi>Iohn Burt</hi> of our parish, who being weake in respect of age, and so not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lift her up; forthwith came likewise one Master <hi>Oliver Deeble,</hi> to assist him with his hands, as hee did my selfe, and the rest with his Christian comfortable words. As likewise Mistris <hi>Grace Carew,</hi> the wife of the foresaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Richard Carew</hi> did (her husband being then
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15292:5"/>
absent, by reason of his grievous sicknesse;) perswading them to continue in, and not to goe out of the Church: vvhich counsell vvas so hearkened unto and embraced, as that none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Temple.</p>
            <p>There came in at the North vvindow (being a little behind the aforesaid Master <hi>Carewes</hi> seate) a great fire much redder then ordinary Lightning; vvhich vvas seene by Misteris <hi>Pearse</hi> vviddow, daughter unto the said Master <hi>Carew</hi>; and by <hi>Degory Moyse</hi> the elder his Tenant; and strake <hi>Nicholas Skelton,</hi> one of his house, with such violence, as if he had beene stricken with two flat stones, or two trenchers, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side of his head, and withall shooke his body, as if it should have beene shaken in pieces, whereby for a time he lost his sight and his sences. This fire then passed downe by Master <hi>Carewes</hi> seate into the path before it, and so went on unto the end thereof upon the ground, and passed up by the fore-part of his seate in the Chancell, and there instantly kill'd a Dogge, which Mistris <hi>Pearse's</hi> Daughter heard onely once to screech.</p>
            <p>This Lightning or fearefull fire (terme it as you please) entred likewise in the same time at a window in the West end of the Church, where it brake off pieces of the hard Moore stone, and rent one of the Arches of the window three foot long; and likewise brake some of the glasse, and left the lead of the same pressed inwards, and made an hole in the stones and the lime of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15292:6"/>
the side wall adjoyning thereunto as big as a scaffold hole, and then strucke one <hi>Roger Nile</hi> on the pinbone of his right side, and on the ankle on the inside of his left legge, as if the blow had beene given by a Bowle; so as for a while hee was not able to stand. <hi>John Cowle</hi> also (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Cowling</hi>) sitting in the South Ile of our Church, as high up as the lower end of the Chancell, was so stricken with Lightning in the face, that he thought all the haire thereon had beene burnt; yet by the mercy of God, though hee were feared, had no hurt. <hi>Nicholas Wilcock,</hi> a servant unto the foresaid Master <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew</hi> likewise saith, that he saw fire come downe from aloft, and a small piece of Lime therewith being throwne downe, strake him on the cheeke, which made his cheeke continue in a burning heat all that day. In this Agony one cryed as the childe to his Father, Mine head, mine head, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 4.19. Another, My belly, My belly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.19. A third, like a lame <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> My leg, My leg, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.4. All, like the Prince in <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 5.6. (troubled, yea trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled) whose face was changed at such a dismall sight.</p>
            <p>After this fire (which it should seeme came from divers places; as appeares by the blowes of severall persons, received in severall places, and all at one instant) there was heard in the Church, as it were the hissing of a great shot; and withall such a noise, as rather resembled di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Canons shot off at an instant to make one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15292:6"/>
single terrible report, then usuall long ratling thunder: Which fearefull sound was not heard till the Ball of Fire was seene to breake in pieces; neither did the noise descend from above, but was heard, and seem'd to begin in Church first: And as I for mine owne part doe verily thinke, close at the North side of the Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and as neere as might be, to mine owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; with which terrible noise the Church see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to shake, and the lyme fell on the persons of two, who sate in one Pue, so as their Hats and clothes were vvhite therewith, as if they had beene vvhited vvith Meale; so as many feared the falling of the Roofe, as it did at <hi>Withicombe,</hi> vvhere one vvas killed with the same, and divers others hurt, and the Church so ruined, as they were forced to have a contribution for the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof. After this fire and sound, there followed a loathsome smell of Gunpowder and Brimstone, but the savour of the Gunpowder by the judgement of all, was stronger then that of the Brimstone. There was a great smoake in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of the Church, which many saw and many saw not.</p>
            <p>The fearefull hearing of this noise, and seeing of this fire, astonisht and even mortified most of those who were smitten therewith, and greatly terrified the whole Congregation (which were about two hundred soules) as appeared in their faces; yet notwithstanding the storme (praised be the Name of God) we all went safely home, as the Sea-men did to land, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.44. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

it pleased God to shew us his poore Christian servants such favour, as though it wrought for a whilè on them who were most fearefully smitten, losing their speech, and being deprived of their senses, so as they resembled dead, or dying men, more then the living; yet God so limited the force and burning of the Lightning, that it hurt neither their clothes nor persons; much like unto that mighty worke of God in <hi>Daniel</hi> upon the three children,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.27:</note> the womans small scald only excepted; (which also expressed how it wanted not power in its owne naturall strength to have done mischiefe.) But then first in a confused manner, betweene crying and speaking, their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and speeches began to revive; and within a little space they so recovered themselves, as that none departed out of his place, till (after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bread when they were smitten) they had every one of them their senses so well resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them, that they likewise received the Cup at the same Table; and all returned at the afternoone (as there was great cause) to give thankes unto Almighty God for so great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. Which appeared plainely to be farre the greater, in that the same Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning instantly kill'd a Dogge, at the feet of those who were kneeling in the Chancell to receive the Sacrament, and likewise another without the Church at the Bell-free doore.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Anthony Furlong</hi> the elder had a Mare killed in the field, and another horse fearefully stricken the same time with his head on one side,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15292:7"/>
and so continues; and the ground of the same Field, for the space of three or foure foot, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as vvith a Plough: And likewise made seven or eight holes and rents in the walls of our To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; some on the inside, some on the outside; and made impressions on the stones thereof in divers places, as if it had been done by the force of shot discharged out of great Ordnance; so as in divers places, the light might be seen through the walls.</p>
            <p>Thus have beene represented to you terrible sounds; even sounds, containing many Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at once; a Fiery Ball flying from Heaven to Earth; Fire walking upon the Earth; Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone kindled with fire, thicke darknesse, Storme and tempest; The blowes and scourges of an hand from on high; Astonishment, hurrying and tumbling of Bodies, shaking and distracting of senses, spirits, and hearts of men.

            <p>Lastly, you have seene flames scorching, but not consuming: A Ball of Fire shot, and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but not killing; yea killing of Beasts, and unreasonable creatures, but sparing the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; casting downe, but not destroying; Men astonished and driven out of their senses, yet soone restored; A Communion divided and cut in pieces, but healed againe and perfected: Those that in the House of God received the sentence of death, in the forenoone, returning to the same House in the afternoone,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.9, 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Was it not some few yeares past, <hi>Archadius</hi> being Emperour at Constantinople (what I speake some have heard, and perchance knowne, for there are among this people, those that were present there) that God intending to terrifie the Citie, &amp; by terrifing to amend it, by terrifing to convert it, by terrifing to cleanse it, by terrifing to change it, came to a certain faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full servant of his (a military man, as is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) in a Revelation, and told him; That the Citie should perish by fire comming from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and willed him to tell it to the Bishop. It was told, and the Bishop despised it not, but spake to the people; The Citie was turned into the wayling of penitents, like the auncient Niniue. But then lest men should thinke, that he who reported it, was deceived himselfe with a falshood, or had deceived others, the day came which God threatned. All being intent, and expecting the issue with great feare, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the night, the world now growing darke, a fierie cloud was seene from the East; first small, but by little, as it drew neere over the Citie, it did so increase, that being very great, it did lye fearefully over the whole Citie. A horrible flame seemed to hang there, neither was there wanting the savour of Brimstone: All
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15292:11"/>
fled to the Church, the place could not containe the multitude: Every one unbaptized extorted Baptisme from such as they might; not onely in the Church, but in houses and streets, the safety accompanying the Sacrament was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the wrath, not so much present as to come, might be avoided. But after that great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, when God had given trust to his words, and the Revelation of his servant, the cloud began to diminish, even as first it increased. The people now secure, yet heard againe, that they must by all meanes depart, because the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was to perish the next saturday; then depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (together with the Emperour) the whole City: No man staid in his house, no man did shut his house, but going farre from the walls, and looking backe to their sweet dwellings, and leaving their beloved Mansions, with a pittifull voyce they bid them farewell. This great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude going some miles forth, yet gathering together in one place to poure out prayers unto God, suddenly saw a great smoake, and sent up a great cry unto God. At length tranquillity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seene, and some sent to bring backe notice (the sad houre which was foretold being past) they bringing back word that all the walls and houses were safe, every one returned with great rejoycing. No man lost any thing out of his house, though left open; every man found it as he left it. What shall we say? was this a wrath, or rather a Mercy of God? Who can doubt but
