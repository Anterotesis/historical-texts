            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE CONSIDERATIONS Which obliged <hi>Peter Manby</hi> Dean of <hi>Derry</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Communion of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church.</head>
            <head>CHAP. 1.</head>
            <head>To the Preface.</head>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>PEter Manby</hi> Dean of <hi>Derry</hi> has chosen this time, (for what reasons he knows best) to declare himself of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whoever doth so in the present circumstances, must run the hazard of being cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, for having too great a value for the Favours and worldly Advantages that some late Converts have met with. In order therefore to satisfie the World that he had some other Reasons besides this prospect (I suppose) he published this Pamphlet that I now answer. Whoever reads it, will find so little Method or Connexion between the parts of it, that he must conclude the Writer was never acquainted with close thinking; and that the loosness and immethodicalness of it, is the greatest trouble lyes on the Answerer: the truth is, it sticks chiesly on Formalities and Preliminaries, which no Advocate ever insisted much upon, that was confident of the merits of his Cause: and therefore to answer it can hardly be worth any ones labour. I confess I should have thought so too, if I had not found some of his own party boasting of it; and I do now assure him that I do not Answer it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99496:5"/>
out of any apprehension I have of its seducing any of ours; and that it had been answered long ago, if I had been possessed with any such Suspicion.</p>
            <p>It consists of three parts, and each of these do in effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the same things, and except a man give a distinct Answer to each, he may pretend that part is unanswered. I shall therefore follow him in his own method, and consider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>first,</hi> his Preface to the Reader: <hi>secondly,</hi> the Pamphlet it self: and <hi>thirdly,</hi> his Latine Queries, and beg the Readers Pardon, if he find the Answers sometimes repeated, when Mr. <hi>M.</hi> repeats the questions so often.</p>
            <p>§ 2. His Preface has huddled together some Questions and Dilemma's concerning the Catholick Church, and raised some doubts, concerning which he professes himself to be at a loss, and so desires information—Thus pag. 1. <hi>When a Protestant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearses this Article of his Creed; I believe one Catholick Church, I would fain understand what Church he means?</hi> Again, <hi>this makes Protestancy so wandring and uncertain a thing, that I for my part cannot understand it:</hi> Pag. 3. <hi>He shall find me pressing for an Answer to such Questions as these.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. of the Pamphlet, <hi>There are three points wherein I could never satisfie my self;</hi> a little after, <hi>I could never find any satisfactory Answer to this Question.</hi> Pag. 2. <hi>pronouncing the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>Idolatrous, I would fain know by what Authority?</hi>—A little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>by whose Authority—I cannot tell.</hi> Pag. 3 <hi>there was no Answer to be had.</hi>—A little after, <hi>I cannot find.</hi> l. 9. <hi>I do not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</hi> l. 15. <hi>I could never understand.</hi> Pag. 4. <hi>I would know.</hi> Pag. 7. l. 13 <hi>I confess my dullness understands not.</hi>—Pag 8. line. 16. <hi>I would fain know.</hi> line 25. <hi>Which Answer I confess I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi>—pag. 11. line 15. <hi>I desire to be informed.</hi> l. the last. <hi>I cannot imagine.</hi> Pag. 12. line 15. <hi>I cannot understand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if he was so very ignorant as he makes himself, and so desirous of information, he ought to have consulted some of his Spiritual Guides on these heads, and not trusted altogether to his own Judgement; or else he ought in all reason to have printed these Questions, before he resolv'd them unanswerable: for how
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99496:5"/>
did he know, but some body might have had more to say to them than he was aware of, and have given him satisfaction? If he had designed to be counted either a prudent or honest man, this had been his method; but I have enquired and cannot find that ever he proposed them seriously to one Divine, or applyed himself to any in this weighty affair, before he deserted our Communion; and therefore though perhaps he may be ignorant enough, yet I think it apparent that he only pretends want of understanding, and desire of information; or that he has very little care of his Soul, or of what Communion he is.</p>
            <p>§ 3. To give his Questions proposed in his Preface a distinct Answer, I shall first rank them in method.</p>

            </list>
            <p>All these we have in the first page of his Preface, and all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the same root, even ignorance of what is meant by the Catholick Church: If Mr. <hi>M.</hi> had designed to deal ingenuously and like a Scholar that desired to clear things, (which ought to be the design of every honest writer,) he ought to have laid down a definition of the Catholick Church, and then examined to whom it belonged, and shewn the Church as established here by Law to be no part of it; for, till that be done, all that is said is ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for we mean not the same thing by the Church. I never saw any Romanist take this method, and therefore I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed that they rather designed to gain Proselytes by confounding their Heads, than by clear Reason and Information;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99496:6"/>
I will therefore tell him what I mean by the one Catholick Church in the Creed; and if he do not like the description, let him mend it.</p>
            <p>The Catholick Church is the whole body of men, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Religion of Christ, and living under their lawful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Governours. This body of Christians is one, because it has, according to St. <hi>Paul Ephes.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God,</hi> and according to Saint<note place="margin">Multae gentes, modo una gens, quare una gens? quia una fides, quia una spes, quia una charitas, quia una expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatio; postremo quare non una <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <hi>Augustine, many Churches are one Church, because there is one Faith, one Hope, one Charity, one Expectation; and lastly, one heavenly Country;</hi> now if he had been as much concerned to understand this a right, as he would have his <hi>Dear Reader,</hi> he might easily have seen who it is that fancy to themselves a Church divided from all the rest of the world, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bonds of Charity, and coyning new Articles, distinct from those of the Catholick Faith, which we received from Christ and his Apostles; and that the Answers to his Questions are very easie.</p>
            <p>§. 4. For to the First, when he would know <hi>what Church we mean when we rehearse that Article of our Creed, I</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 1. Pref.</note> 
               <hi>believe one holy Catholick and Apostolick Church?</hi> the Answer is, that we mean, not any particular Church, nor any party of Christians of any one denomination; but all those that hold the Catholick Faith, and live under their lawful Pastors: while they have those marks I have laid down from the Scripture and St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> they are still of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, though by the peevishness and mistake of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, they may be engaged in Quarrels; as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time with the Church of <hi>Africa,</hi> about the allowing the Baptism of Hereticks; and the Quarrel came to that height, that when the <hi>Africans</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> not only the peace of the Church and Communion was denyed them, but even the common kindness of Hospitality; as we may see in <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milians</hi>

This<note place="margin">Preciperet fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati universae, ne quis %os in domum suam reciperet, &amp; venienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus non solum pax &amp; communio, sed etiam tectum &amp; hospitium ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetur. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Ep. 75.</note> being supposed, it is no hard matter to find out the parts of this Catholick Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever one comes, it is only Examining whether any Church hold the Catholick Faith, and whether they live under their lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; and so far as they do so, it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to joyn with them, as true parts thereof. Whereas he who with the Donatists, will unchurch three parts of four of the Christian World; or fancy a Church divided from all others, though as sound in Faith and as obedient to their Governours as possible; is like for ever to be <hi>tossed too and fro upon the unstable waters of Schism,</hi> and <hi>dwindles the Church into a Faction;</hi> and this gives a full Answer.</p>
            <p>§ 5. To his second Question, <hi>whether we mean by the Catholick Church, the Church of</hi> England <hi>alone, or the Church of</hi> England <hi>as in Communion with other Churches;</hi> for by this it appears, that the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are no more the Catholick Church, than the English Seas are the whole Ocean; but they are a part thereof, because they hold the Catholick Faith intirely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are governed by their lawful and Catholick Bishops, who have not had for many years, so much as a Rival appearing to contest their Title and Succession.</p>
            <p>§ 6. But then he urges in the third place, <hi>with what other Church doth the Church of</hi> England <hi>Communicate in Sacraments and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, Unity of Liturgy is no part of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Churches; let him shew, if he can, that the Catholick Church ever had any such Unity; Unity in Faith, Sacraments &amp; in worshipping God she has with all true Churches on the face of the Earth, insomuch that there is not one Article in her Creeds, nor one Petition in her Liturgy, that even Mr. <hi>M.</hi> can condemn; nor is there any Office wanting, in which the Ancient Liturgies agreed; and then let him shew why all Churches hold not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her? and who is guilty of the breach thereof? If he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99496:7"/>
say that we hold indeed the Catholick Faith, but not intire, let him make it appear: but if he cannot prove that we deny any part of this Catholick Faith, he acquits us from Heresie, and owns our union in Faith with the Catholick Church. To prove this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was chiefly incumbent on him, but he has not so much as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it. He has indeed made an attempt against the lawfulness of our Governours that is, to prove us Schismaticks; but how unsuccessfully we shall see by and by.</p>
            <p>§. 7. In the mean time to his fourth Demand, Whether by the <hi>one Catholick Church be understood the variety of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, since they want her essential mark,</hi> even <hi>Unity?</hi> I answer, that neither all Protestants are Catholick members of the Church, nor are Protestants only; those amongst Protestants, that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Catholick Faith, and make no Separation from their lawful Governours, and that live in unity of Faith and charity with their neighbour Churches are Catholick members, and have that Unity, which is essential to the Catholick Church; but these are not to be confounded with <hi>Presbyterians, Independants, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, Fifth Monarchy-men, Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> since these have sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themselves from their lawful Governours, as much as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> himself; though their Crime be less than his: as he is less guilty that makes a Rebellion, than he who joyns with a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner to enslave his native Countrey.</p>
            <p>But he has an Excuse even for these, that he has <hi>heard out of the mouths of some Protestants, that God had his people amongst all sorts of Protestants;</hi> and what if some charitable people say with Saint <hi>Augustine; that they who</hi>

               <hi>find it; are not at all to be reckoned Hereticks?</hi> is he sure that there are not some such amongst every sort of Protestants, nay of Christians? I am sure, the passage he quotes out of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Paper</hi> mentioned by him, is no Confutation of this; nor any thing to the purpose, except he hath a mind to prove the Words true by his own example: For, what Reason has he given why he quitted the Church in which he was baptized, educated and preferred (whether above his Deserts, let the World judge by this Paper;) but <hi>because the Discipline</hi> and Devotions of the Church of <hi>Rome suit his present Fancy better than what he left;</hi> because he was not able to answer some few Questions that have no great difficulty in them, his private Judgment or Interest told him he ought to change his Church. And if he changed his Church on the confidence of a Judgment he acknowledges suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently weak, why will he not allow the same liberty to others? If he say that the Church he has chosen is a Church from whence there <hi>can be no appeal;</hi> I answer, he has only his own Judgment for believing so; and when that Judgment alters, he may be of any other Church, and so he is fallen in spite of his endeavours into the same mistake he would avoid. He brings in (to what purpose he knows perhaps himself) a Story of a passionate <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,</hi> who said, that <hi>he cared not what his Son was, so he was not a Papist:</hi> which may pass for a Reason to those that build their Faith on Stories and Legends, and use to give the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of their Enemies only from their peevish Sayings, but is nothing to our Church.</p>
            <p>He argues against Schism, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>I beseech you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no Schisms among you:</hi> as if the Church of which he pretended to be a Member did not abhor Schism as much as he; and as if the first Schism from her Communion had not been by Papists about the <hi>10th</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Now the same St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. advises them to <hi>slee fornication,</hi> and that as a thing contrary to our Union with God: Mr. <hi>M.</hi> had best try his Logick, and see if he can from the first place, which forbids Schism, prove that it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99496:8"/>
makes a Man more cease to be a Member of the Church than Fornication doth, which is forbidden in the second.</p>
            <p>He produces out of <hi>Romans</hi> 15. 6. <hi>that ye glorifie God with one Mind and one Mouth,</hi> to prove that we ought not only <hi>say the same things, but the same words, especially about Sacraments and Liturgy, for by one Spirit we (meaning all Christians) are Baptized into one body; therefore he exhorts them to take heed of such Teachers as have no mission or authority for what they say, but only good words and fair speeches to deceive the hearts of the simple.</hi> By the <hi>for</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> in this sentence one would expect that one part should be a consequence of another, but there is not the least affinity between them: but you must excuse him, for his talent never lay much, as has been observed by his Friends, in drawing consequences.</p>
            <p>Those, that by <hi>good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple,</hi> are not said to want Mission, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therefore they had it; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives very different marks to know them by, even teaching contrary to the Doctrine they had already received, serving their own bellies—not our Lord Jesus. Nonconformity therefore to the Doctrine taught by the Apostles, and too eager a concern for the riches and interest of the Clergy are the signs of a false Teacher, though he have never so Authentick Mission, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> nay, though he were an Angel from Heaven. But if he had been of Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s opinion, the <hi>Romans</hi> must not have judged of their Pastours, or attempted to discover Seducers by their Doctrine, but only by calling for their Letters of Orders and Titles from the Apostles.</p>
            <p>§. 8. His fifth Question concerning the Catholick Church is, <hi>whether we and the Lutherans are the same in all material points; the Lutherans holding a corporal Presence in the Sacrament, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it?</hi> to which I answer, that a difference may be material, and yet not essential to Faith, so as to necessitate a division of Church Unity; there is a very material difference between those in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that hold the deposing Power, and those that deny it; between those that hold the Pope infallible, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99496:8"/>
those that deny it, &amp; so in many other points, as material as those in dispute between Protestant Churches; yet, inasmuch as they are not reckoned by all to be the Essentials of Faith, they do not break Communion; and indeed, he understands very little that knows not there may be difference of understanding about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to Sacraments, and yet Unity of Communion. As to his Objection against the Calvinists, that <hi>they have no Order of Priests or Bishops,</hi> I leave him to dispute it with them. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consequently they <hi>have no true Sacraments,</hi> which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, I leave him to dispute it with his new Church, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows their Baptism; we are concerned in neither.</p>
            <p>§. 9. There is only one thing more he objects on this Head against our Church, and that is, that she, as established by Law, is <hi>Catholick neither as to time nor place,</hi> because not <hi>visible any where for many Ages before</hi> Edward <hi>the sixth.</hi> This is the old Question, <hi>Where was your Church before</hi> Luther? And has been often answered, by shewing that we made no new Church by the Reformation, that we kept all the Essentials of Faith &amp; Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship received by our Ancestors, had the same Creeds, the same God, Christ, Baptism, and Eucharist; and lastly, were governed by the same Bishops and other Governours, before and after the Reformation; and therefore it is a wild thought in Mr. <hi>M.</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that our Church was not visible before <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth It is true, it was not established by Law in all points as it is now, no more was the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> before the Reformation by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> (for that also pretended to Reform) but the establishing by Law is accidental altogether to a Church, and a Church may be visible long before it is so established.</p>
            <p>This is all in his Preface that any way relates to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>
            <p>§. 10. The second part relates to the Mission of our Bishops, and is reduced to four Queries, which shall have their full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, when I come to consider the first point that he lays down in his Book.</p>
            <p>§. 11. The rest is spent in comparing two Historians of the Reformation, that is Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> and Doctor <hi>Burnet,</hi> of whom
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99496:9"/>
he gives this Character, that <hi>Burnet strains all his wit to palliate the doings of the Reformers, and paint them out to advantage;</hi> Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin <hi>represents them honestly for the most part, and in their own co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours:</hi> Whereas in truth the first doth generally lay down naked matter of Fact only, and leaves the Reader to judge; and the other passes his own Censures, and gives his own Gloss on them; as may be seen by the very passages Mr. <hi>M.</hi> quotes out of Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Preface. The truth is he abuses both Historians; <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> by producing that for matter of Fact, which is all his own Inferences and Conjectures, and so exprest to be in the very words: <hi>all that was done in order to a Reformation, seemed to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental only,</hi> then—<hi>I cannot reckon his Death an infelicity,—it is not to be thought,</hi> to the next clause, <hi>nor was it like to happen,</hi> to the next—<hi>might easily have done,</hi> to the next—<hi>was in all probability</hi> to the last.</p>
            <p>Are not these Conjectures strong Arguments to prove the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation unjustifiable? But he abuses him yet more in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage concerning the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> by reporting that as Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Opinion, which he records only as the Opinion of others, <hi>pag.</hi> 116. of his History; where among three or four Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, why the Duke did not claim the benefit of his Clergy; he sets down this last, <hi>Finally whether it were some secret judgment on him from above (as some men conceived) that he, who had destroyed so many Churches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>should want the benefit of Clergy in his greatest extremity;</hi> where Mr. <hi>M.</hi> leaves out the Parenthesis (<hi>as some Men conceived</hi>) and falsifies him (perhaps to make him recompence) by adding another of his own, <hi>he</hi> (the Duke of <hi>Sommerset</hi>) <hi>deprived many learned men of their means and livelyhood,</hi> (<hi>for being Papists</hi> adds Mr. <hi>M.</hi>) a most notorious falshood; since it appears from all Histories of the Reformation, that there was an universal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance of the Clergy; few making any Opposition, and none almost absolutely refusing Conformity; his Papists at that time loved their Means so well, or found so little amiss in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that they readily complyed with all Changes. And as he thus abuses and falsifies <hi>Heylin,</hi> so he doth <hi>Burnet;</hi> he saith, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99496:9"/>
               <hi>the worst</hi> Burnet <hi>can charge</hi> Heylin <hi>with, is his not vouching Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for what he says;</hi> and he affirms, that <hi>it is an untruth, that</hi> Heylin <hi>writ upon uncertain grounds, as</hi> Burnet <hi>would insinuate.</hi> But <hi>Burnet</hi> in that place insinuates no such thing, but only says he ought to have vouched them, that people might have judged of their certainty. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s own Testimony for his fidelity is not to be taken in his own Cause; and therefore Mr. <hi>M.</hi> vindicates him very ill, when he produces nothing else for him. He saith <hi>Doctor</hi> Burnet <hi>doth not produce one instance of any moment, wherein he dares say, Doctor</hi> Heylin <hi>is false.</hi> I hope Mr. <hi>M.</hi> would not quote any passage out of <hi>Heylin</hi> that was not of moment; what if that passage that relates to the Duke of <hi>Sommerset</hi> here quoted, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded falsly by <hi>Heylin,</hi> and taxt as false by <hi>Burnet?</hi> then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every body will judge Mr. <hi>M.</hi> either very ignorant or very malicious; and yet thus it is. Says Mr. <hi>M.</hi> from <hi>Heylin, The Duke of</hi> Sommerset <hi>was so defective in his Judgment, as not to crave the benefit of his Clergy, which might have saved his Life.</hi> Now look into <hi>Burnet ad Ann.</hi> 1531. <hi>pag.</hi> 186. 2 <hi>vol.</hi> and see whether he have not these words, <hi>Some late Writers have made an Inference upon his not claiming the benefit of Clergy, that he was thus left of God, not to plead that benefit; since he had so much invaded the Rights and Revenues of the Church; but in this they shewed their Ignorance; for by the Statute, That Felony, of which he was found Guilty, was not to be purged by Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most likely excuse I can make for Mr. <hi>M.</hi> is, that he neither read <hi>Burnet</hi> nor <hi>Heylin;</hi> if he did, he neither knew this, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd it; which makes him very disingenuous: or did not observe it; and so he falls under the Character of a thoughtless Reader, that could neither by his own Observation, nor the Admonition of Friends avoid picking out, and repeating such an uncharitable falshood. It were easie to shew several falshoods (even in those things that are most invidious to the Reformation) in <hi>Heylin</hi>'s History, observed and confuted by <hi>Burnet:</hi> one more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in his saying, that the Father of Queen <hi>Ann Boleyne</hi> was one of the Jury that condemned her; with which, as a falshood,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99496:10"/>
he taxes <hi>Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Addenda<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p.</hi> 363. first Volume, where he says, that Doctor <hi>Heylin took this, as he did many other things, too easily upon</hi> Sanders's <hi>credit;</hi> which (if true) is enough to blast the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his Book with all Protestants, nay with all Men of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that know what an infamous Lyar and Rebel <hi>Sanders</hi> was.</p>
            <p>Whereas therefore he intreats the Protestant Reader to peruse Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi>'s History of the Reformation, we are content he should do so; and let him at the same time peruse the History of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> written by Father <hi>Paul,</hi> and let him impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially judge which was carried on by the worst Men and worst Arts; the Reformation, or the Council.</p>
            <p>What Mr. <hi>M.</hi> objects further in his Preface against <hi>Cranmer</hi> and the other Reformers, shall be considered in its proper place.</p>

            <p>I Come now to examin the Pamphlet it self, which consists of Three parts.</p>

            </p>
            <p>2. Of Three points wherein he could not satisfie himself.</p>
            <p>And 3dly. A confused heap of particulars at the latter end.</p>
            <p>As to the Letter; it is a little ambiguous to whom it is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if to his old Patron, as a civil Compliment at taking leave, he had done well to have told the true Reason why he forsook him. Your Grace would not get me a Bishoprick, though often prest and sollicited by me; therefore I beg your leave to seek a new Patron, whose Mediation may be more effectual. But perhaps Mr. <hi>M.</hi> means another man, and then we may reckon this as the first Fruits of his Conversion. Are you taught already the Art of Equivocation? We shall learn from this what sincerity we may expect from you; and shall hardly believe you when you tell us that it was not <hi>any consideration of Temporal Interest inclined you to be reconciled.</hi> If you valued Temporal Interest so little, why were you so earnest for a Protestant Bishoprick? Why did you repine and murmur so much that you were not preferred? Why
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99496:10"/>
did you declare to several about a year ago, that you was no Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick, but yet would not appear against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> because you hoped to rise by help of Roman Catholicks? Why did you endeavour to ingratiate your self by mean Arts, and condescend even to the Office of an Informer? Why did you defer publishing this Paper (such as it is) which was ready sometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, till you thought you might be sure of keeping the Profits of your Deanery? Either you are a Lay or Clergy-man? If a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; are not you abominably Sacrilegious, to have possessed, and still retain the Revenue of a Clergy-man? Why do you retain the Title of Dean in the Frontispiece of a Book, which is designed to prove you to be no Priest, and consequently incapable of it? If your Orders had yielded you as much <hi>per annum</hi> as your Deanery doth, Have we not reason to believe, you would no more have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the one than the other? For shame, resign our Church her own, since you have deserted her, or never talk of Conscience. Till this be done, it is in vain for you to pretend that your hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>reflected on the uncertainty and variety if the Protestant Spirit,</hi> or <hi>perused Catholick Books have undeceived you.</hi> Did you never reflect on the uncertainty or variety of the Protestant Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it should have such a mighty influence on you just at this time? sure there was greater variety when you was first educated in the Colledge, and when you first entred into Orders than now. They talk'd much of the Spirit then, and you yet retain their language; if instead of that Cant you had well studied and considered the Principles of the Church which you have left, you would have found that there neither are nor can be any more certain and steady Principles of any Religion, than hers are. You make your self a great Novice, that at this time a day pretend to be converted by <hi>perusing the Mass.</hi> In good earnest, did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read it before? if you did, how comes it to have such influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on you in King <hi>James</hi> the Second's time, and so little in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's?

Dean after near 30 years study had his Religion by hear-says, wanted Honesty to be impartial, and either Industry or Means to inform himself concerning the most material Controversies that are on foot in the Church.

            </p>
            <p>§. 2. The second part of Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Paper consists of three points, wherein he professes, that <hi>he could never satisfie himself since he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to study the Controversies between the two Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first was, <hi>The Mission or Authority of the first Reformers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second, The <hi>Want of Confession in the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>And the third, <hi>Where is that one holy Catholick Church we do profess to believe in the two Creeds?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the first of these points I shall reply in this method.</p>
            <p>1. I will put together all the Questions that he asks on this Head.</p>
            <p>2. Consider the Answers he produces to them.</p>
            <p>And 3. The Objections he has raised against the Reformation or Reformers.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning our Mission he asks in his Preface, pag. 3. <hi>What Priesthood or Holy Orders had the first Reformers, but what they received from the hands of Roman Catholick Bishops?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What Priesthood or Holy Orders have Protestants, but what they confess to have received from Roman Catholick Bishops?</hi> Pag. 12. of the Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99496:11"/>2. <hi>Who authorized the first Reformers to preach their Protestant Doctrine, and administer their Protestant Sacraments?</hi> Pag. 1. of his Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am not now disputing what Doctrine he preached; but who sent him to preach his Protestant Doctrine, and administer his Protestant Sacraments? 'Tis not his Doctrine, but Mission I am now enquiring after.</hi> Pag. 3.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Whether</hi> Cranmer <hi>and his Associates could condemn the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>by pretence of the Mission they received from her Bishops?</hi> Pag. 3. of his Preface.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I understand not—how any man can justifie his Protestant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by authority of the Popish Mission.</hi> Pag. 2. of his Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I must still ask the old Question; By whose Authority did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that Church, from whom he received his Mission?</hi> Pag. 3. of his Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury, &amp;c. <hi>at the time of their Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were professed Roman Catholicks—But afterwards turning Protestants, and pronouncing the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>Idolatrous, I would fain know by whose Authority?</hi> Pag. 2. of his Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At the time of their Consecration they professed Seven Sacraments,</hi> Anno 1536. <hi>they retrencht them to three—then to two,</hi> Anno 1549.—<hi>By whose Authority or Mission I cannot tell.</hi> Ibid. pag. 2.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Who gave them Authority to pronounce themselves sound Members, and the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>a corrupt Arm of the Catholick Church?</hi> Pag. 12.</p>
            <p>The fourth Sett of Questions concerning Mission is on this Head; Preface, p. 3 <hi>Whether a Presbyterian Minister having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders from a Protestant Bishop, can, by virtue of such Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, pronounce the Church of</hi> England <hi>a corrupt Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I understand not how a man can forsake the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and preach Presbyterian Doctrine by vertue of his Protestant Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Pag. 2. of his Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Presbyterians being Interrogated,—Did that Church authorize you to preach against the Sacraments or Liturgy? there was no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to be had.</hi> Pag. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99496:12"/>
               <hi>I desire to know, whether an honest man can preach against the Liturgy, Sacraments, or Constitution of any Church, by vertue of any Commission he received from it?</hi> Ibid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that no honest man can turn Presbyterian or Independant Preacher by vertue of his Protestant Mission.</hi> p. 4.</p>
            <p>The fifth Sett of Questions relating to Mission is, <hi>Pref. pag. 3. Whether an Act of Parliament in</hi> France, Spain <hi>or</hi> Germany, <hi>be not as good an Authority for Popery there, as in</hi> England <hi>for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Parliamentary Mission then our first Reformers had, and no other that I can find.</hi> p. 3.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Before I come to a distinct consideration of each of these, I must observe that he waves the Dispute concerning our <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Episcopal Orders, whether valid or no;</hi> (<hi>Pamphl. pag.</hi> 1.) Now, if these are valid, either let him shew one Sacrament <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred by Protestants,</hi> which these Characters do not give them Power to celebrate: or one Article of Faith that they teach, which the same do not oblige them to teach: or else let him ask no more for their Mission, and Authority, to teach their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and administer their Sacraments. If their Doctrine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are not <hi>Theirs</hi> but Christs; they are not only sent, but obliged by their Orders to administer the one, and teach the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Churches wherein they are appointed Pastors.</p>
            <p>I observe further, that he manifestly contradicts himself in this matter; for he makes <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Latimer the first Protestant Bishops</hi> and owns their Consecration (<hi>p.</hi> 2.) and yet alledges (<hi>p.</hi> 3.) that <hi>it is no easie matter to find out who consecrated the first Protestant Bishops;</hi> because, for sooth, there were none to do it, <hi>but Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Bishops, who never use to consecrate any Protestants.</hi> But if he had read <hi>Mason,</hi> and Archbishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> he might have seen who ordained the first Reformers, and their Succession to this day: and if he had consulted Sir <hi>James Ware de Proesulibus,</hi> he might have seen that there wanted not Bishops in <hi>Ireland</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to consecrate Protestants; Primate <hi>Loftus</hi> being consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the then Archbishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Curwin,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99496:12"/>
in his Archiepiscopal See near six years after, and then by reason of his great Age was translated to the Bishoprick of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> at his own desire. <hi>Antiquit. Oxon. de Aede Christi. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 291. <hi>Ware de Proesulibus, Hib. in Archiepiscopis Dubliniensibus,</hi> p. 120.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Testimony he produces out of <hi>Burnet</hi> from Queen <hi>Mary</hi> at all pertinent; all that appears from that Testimony is, that they who were ordained according to the Form in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Books are not lookt upon by the Queen <hi>to be ordered in every Deed,</hi> but there is no reason alledged for it, nor indeed can any be given, but because it was not done according to the Pontifical; an ignorance excusable at that time, when perhaps she was informed that something Essential was left out in our Form of Orders, or that the Pontifical with its Tricks was not a new thing; whereas our Form of Ordination is more full then any of the ancient Forms, both in Substance and Ceremony; and therefore either the ancient Priests and Bishops had no sufficient Ordination, or Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was mis-informed when she did not reckon Ordination by the Common-prayer-book <hi>ordering indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. Having premised this, I answer to his first Question, <hi>What Priesthood or holy Orders had the first Reformers, but what they confess to have received from Roman Catholick Bishops?</hi> If he mean by Roman Catholick Bishops, such as own'd the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the supream universal Pastor of the Catholick Church by Divine right, to whom themselves were by God made unappeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably accountable, which is the Essential Character of a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick; the first Reformers received their Orders from no such Roman Catholicks. Whatever Roman Catholicks hold now, he will never prove this to have been the declared sence of the Church of <hi>England</hi> before the Reformation: and therefore the first Reformers cannot properly be said to have received their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Roman Catholicks, but from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things to be distinguished in the Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; one is, the Power or Capacity of governing the Church, interpreting Scripture, Consecrating other Bishops, Ordaining Priests and Deacons, Offering, Baptizing, and Confirming: the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99496:13"/>
other is, the admitting the Bishop so impowered to the exercise of that Power within certain Limits, which we call a Diocess. The first of these is a Divine, and the second a Canonical Right. Now the first Reformers received the first of these, that is, their Orders from Christ, by the hands of their Consecrators, who were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>England,</hi> for <hi>Rome.</hi> The second of these they received likewise from the Laws and Constitutions of the Church and Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> And it is to be observed that the Laws of the one were directly contrary to the Laws of the other, and that the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> had their proper and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Mission to their Churches by an Authority maintained in opposition to the Popes Power, which he endeavoured as much as he could to abolish, but was not able; as may be seen in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests with <hi>Chichley,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth's time. Although therefore the first Reformers had their Orders from Bishops in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet it was as Christian Bishops they Ordained, and as English Bishops that they admitted the first Reformers to their Charges.</p>
            <p>But suppose they had no other Orders but what they received from the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> himself; all that can be concluded from thence is, that we are obliged to own, that the Orders of Priest and Bishop given by Roman Catholicks are valid, and capacitate a man to perform all the Duties belonging to those Offices in a Christian Church, which we readily acknowledge, and charge the Popish Priests and Bishops not with want of Orders, but with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing the Orders they have, to ill intents and purposes: The Roman Catholick Bishops do not confer Orders as Roman, but Christian Bishops their Orders are Christian Orders, and those we hold sufficient to all intents and purposes of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and must do so, till Mr. <hi>M.</hi> or some body else prove them insufficient.</p>
            <p>He objects, pag. 2. <hi>That the first Reformers were Ordained Roman Catholick Bishops, and made themselves Protestants,</hi> which proceeds on an ignorant supposition, that every man is ordained to preach the Tenents of his Ordainers, or else must have no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99496:13"/>
Mission: whereas the Ordainers are only Instruments, but the Power is from Christ; and they are no more accountable to their Ordainers upon the account of being Ordained by them, then a man is accountable to a Lord Chancellor for the use of his Power, because he set the Seal to his Patent by which he claims his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. In short, a man is Ordained neither a Protestant nor a Papist, but a Christian Bishop; his Mission is a Christian Mission, let him be sent by whom he will; and whoever gave him his Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he teach any Doctrine but Christs, he is accursed. Hence when the <hi>Donatists</hi> were very earnest to know the Ordainers of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> and<note place="margin">Quid ad causam pertineat veritatis, uniuscujus<expan>

            </p>
            <p>'Twas on this Principle that Baptism and Ordination by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks were allowed in the Catholick Church, to such as came e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from those Hereticks, even because they were Baptized Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Proselytes, and Ordained Christian Bishops; and they were never thought to go beyond their Mission, because they renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Errors of their Ordainers.</p>
            <p>If it be replied, that Hereticks making themselves, of Hereticks, Catholick Bishops, change for the better; but Papists making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Protestant Bishops, change for the worse. I answer, this quits the Plea of Mission, and brings the Mission to the trial of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. If then <hi>Cranmer</hi> and the rest of the Roman Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops made themselves only truly Catholicks; they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves nothing but what Christ had obliged them to in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration.

            <p>§. 6. To his second Question, <hi>Who authorized the first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to Teach their Protestant Doctrine, and Administer their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Sacraments?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, No body but himself would have asked such a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Question; since the Protestants pretend to no Doctrine or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments peculiar to themselves, or that may be called Theirs, but only to the Doctrine &amp; Sacraments of Christ received in the Catholick Church: If the Protestants were guilty of any fault, it was not making new Doctrines or Sacraments, but rejecting those that some counted old; and so their Crime was not the want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mission or Authority to do what they did, but not using their Authority to its full extent, to do and teach more: If they had power given them to Administer seven Sacraments, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred only two, as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> says, then it is a foolish thing to doubt their Authority to Minister those two; whereas they are rather accountable for their not Holding and Administring the other five: but the truth is, they received in their Ordination power from Christ, to <hi>administer neither Protestant nor Popish,</hi> but Christian <hi>Sacraments;</hi> and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> neither has, nor can make it appear, that they Administer any other, or omit any that Christ has commanded.</p>
            <p>He is aware of this Answer in his fifth Page, and gives a reply to it; <hi>I pray</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Reader to remember that this was the very Answer of</hi> Luther, Socinus, Zuinglius, Calvin, <hi>and most other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers:</hi> Let me pray the Reader to observe, that this is nothing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99496:14"/>
to the purpose, if it were true; since we are not to believe every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they be of God. The false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets pretended to Revelation as well as the true, was neither therefore to be believed? the false Reformers, as well as the true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pretended to preach no new Doctrine, or administer new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but only the Doctrine and Sacraments of Jesus Christ: Are neither therefore in the right? May not a good Answer be abused and misapplyed? To clear therefore this matter, we own what he contends for, <hi>that both true Doctrine and external and lawful Mission are generally necessary to a</hi> regular <hi>preacher of the Gospel,</hi> pag. 5. and if either of these are wanting, the person is not to be received. Which appears in the Prophets he mentions from <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. <hi>ibid.</hi> who wanted not an external Mission, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mr. <hi>M.</hi> imagines; for the Prophets are the Pastors of the people, against whom God pronounces a Woe, <hi>verse</hi> 1. and 2. of that Chapter; they are joyned with the Priests, <hi>verse</hi> the 11. and 34. and their fault was not preaching without any Mission at all, but preaching false Doctrine; for which no man can have a Mission, but even the Pope himself when he doth so, is to be rejected as a Seducer. If these very Prophets whom Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to have had no Mission had taught true Doctrine, God would have approved them, <hi>verse</hi> 22. <hi>But if they had stood in my Councel, and caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil ways;</hi> that is, God would have given them success: and when God says, verse 32. <hi>I sent them not, nor commanded them,</hi> it doth not relate to preaching, for God had commanded the Priests and Prophets to preach; but it relates to the causing <hi>my people to err by their Lyes and Lightness,</hi> which is a good Argument against those that seduce the people with Legends and Lyes, and Revelations, and false Miracles, and Doctrines of Profit and Gain, whatever their Mission be.</p>
            <p>Now these two things being necessary to a true Teacher, we affirm, that the first Reformers in <hi>England</hi> had both; not only the <hi>Licence and Approbation of the Church</hi> as he states it, <hi>pag.</hi> 15. but her Ordination &amp; Appointment also according to the known
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99496:15"/>
rules of constituting Pastors, which some other Reformers do not pretend to; and therefore all the Question is, concerning the other Character of a true Pastor, preaching true Doctrine. If the first Reformers had preached <hi>Popish Doctrine</hi> and administred <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Sacraments,</hi> I do not find but Mr. <hi>M.</hi> would have thought they had Mission enough: but I Answer, that was not Christs design in appointing Bishops, but his design was that they should administer <hi>his</hi> Sacraments and teach <hi>his</hi> Doctrine. This all Bishops are impowered and obliged to do; and therefore till he shew that there is a difference between Christs Doctrine and Sacraments, and those that Protestants Teach and Administer, their Episcopal Orders are sufficient to warrant them.</p>
            <p>§. 7. And so I proceed to his third Sett of Questions, <hi>Whether</hi> Cranmer <hi>and his Associates could condemn the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>by pretence of the Mission received from her Bishops?</hi> To which I answer, That if by condemning the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> be meant anathematizing her, and cutting her off from the Body of Christ by a judicial Sentence, as if we were her Superiors; (which condemning only is by authority.) We never thus condemned the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Faults we believe to be in her that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly need Reformation; but that Work we leave to her lawful Governours; our Church having declared in her Preface to her Liturgy, <hi>that in these her doings she condemns no other Nation, nor prescribes any thing but to her own People only; Cranmer</hi> therefore and his Associates did not condemn the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor could he or his Fellows do it by pretence of a Mission received from her Bishops, for they received no Mission from her Bishops, but from the Bishops of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then he proceeds to ask <hi>by whose Authority did they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Church from whom they received their Mission?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To give the World an account of this matter; it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that the supream Government of our Church has always been in a National Councel or Convocation of our Clergy; and that not only We but every National Church hath the same pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of altering all Rites and Ceremonies, of abrogating and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99496:15"/>
all Ecclesiastical Constitutions, and lastly of reforming all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses and Corruptions crept into the Church; which the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Civil Power hath of altering the Civil Constitutions; the Fundamental Laws of Religion being preserved inviolable in the one, and of the State in the other.</p>
            <p>The Supream Ecclesiastical Power being lodged here, the next thing requisite is a certain Rule and Method, according to which, Laws were to be past by it; and in the proceedings about the Reformation all alterations being made by this Power, and in this Method, it follows that they were all made legally; and that our Churches retrenching such Ceremonies out of the Service of God as were judged Useless, Burdensome, or Superstitious; and such Opinions as were no part of the Christian Faith, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it, was no more to make a new Faith or Church, then to to reform Abuses in the State by Act of Parliament is to make a new Kingdom. Nor do they that thus make a Reformation any more condemn their Predecessors, because they reform what was amiss in their time; then Parliament Men condemn their Ancestors when they make a new Law.</p>
            <p>I do confess <hi>an honest Man cannot preach against the Liturgy, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or Constitution of a Church by vertue of any Commission from it;</hi> and that no Church ought to be presumed <hi>to Authorize her Priests or Bishops to go and preach the Gospel after their private Sence or Conscience, in contradiction to her declared Doctrine and Worship;</hi> and that the <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>gives no such power at this day.</hi> But I deny this to be the case of the first Reformers, who did not act as private men in the Church when they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but as representing her in her Convocation, and by her Authority. Although therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> oblige private Men not to contradict her allowed Orders; yet she doth not bind her self from making such Alteration in a Canonical way, as she sees convenient, or is convinced to be necessary.</p>
            <p>If therefore Mr. <hi>M.</hi> can shew, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> and his Associate made the Alterations without consulting her, he went indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Commission from her; but if she assented to all he did
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99496:16"/>
and to this day approves the Reformation, how did <hi>Cranmer</hi> condemn that Church from whence he had his Mission?</p>
            <p>If the Alteration was good, and those things that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved were really Errors and Corruptions, did <hi>Cranmer</hi> and his Associates any more than what they were obliged to do by the very <hi>Roman</hi> Pontifical in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination?<note place="margin">Episcopum oportet judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, interpretari, consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ordinare, offerre, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zare &amp; confirmare. <hi>Pontif. de Consecrat. elect. in Episc.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>It belongs</hi> (saith the Pontifical) <hi>to a Bishop to judge, to interpret, to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, ordain, offer, baptize and confirm.</hi> Did they do any more? This Answer he owns, and ascribes to <hi>Burnet,</hi> pag. 3. <hi>The Pastors</hi>

               <hi>and Bishops of the Church are ordained to instruct the people in the Faith of Iesus Christ, according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: and the Nature of their Office is a sacred Trust that obliges them to this, and therefore if they find Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Church, they are obliged to remove them, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> would do well to answer, on this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, Whether they are, or are not obliged? If they are, then they have Mission enough to remove, in a legal way, all Corruptions, even those of their Ordainers. If they are not, how do they answer the Engagement made in their Orders, to teach the people according to the Scriptures? But Mr. <hi>M.</hi> waves any Answer to this, and in effect owns it, only he denies or seems to deny the Supposition; where he tells us, Cranmer <hi>and one or two Bishops pretended Errors and Corruptions, and drove on the Reformation against the major Vote of the</hi> English <hi>Bishops;</hi> p. 3. that is, he had Power &amp; Mission enough, but abused it: and so to know whether <hi>Cranmer</hi> exceeded his Commission or no, we must know whether the Corruptions he reformed were real or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For if they were real, there is no doubt but he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to reform them; none else being under a deeper Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than he. So then Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Question is out of doors, <hi>Who sent him?</hi> and another substituted in the room thereof by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and that is, Whether there were Corruptions in the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Worship and Faith of the Church at that time? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99496:16"/>
               <hi>He, and the other Men of Abilities were manifestly intoxicated with mistakes of Holy Scripture, with a Spirit of Perverseness and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Change?</hi> (pag. 4.) And we are content to joyn issue with him on these head<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when he pleases.</p>
            <p>But perhaps though <hi>Cranmer</hi> was obliged to reform what was amiss; yet he ought to have done it in a regular way: Whereas if we believe Mr. <hi>M be drove on a Reformation against the major vote of the English Bishops.</hi> If by this, he means establishing any thing without their consent, 'tis a most notorious falshood; for in all he did, he had the unanimous vote and consent of the major part of the Convocation, the Universal submission of the Clergy, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the People. If they complyed against their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, then by this we may see how excellently the <hi>Mass</hi> and <hi>Confessing</hi> had instructed them in the Knowledge and Conscience of their Duty; when they so readily complied with all Alterations. Let him try, if he can bring a Protestant Convocation to an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous repeal of these things by such motives. But if the Clergy in a National Councel, and the People in obedience to them, or from their own inclinations did comply in earnest: what an idle Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is it to ask, <hi>By what Authority</hi> Cranmer <hi>condemned that Church from whom he received his Mission and Holy Order?</hi> When she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in all he did, and approved, nay, made all the Alterations in her Liturgy, Sacraments, and Constitutions that were made.</p>
            <p>The true Question therefore is, <hi>Whether the Church of</hi> England <hi>had full power to Reform her self without the consent of the</hi> Pope?</p>
            <p>For it is into his Supremacy all this Banter of Mission, and indeed the whole Faith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as distinct from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick is resolved. If the Church of <hi>England</hi> was not subject to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> she had sufficient power to Reform her self: and the only thing for which she is accountable to God, the World, and her Subjects, is the Goodnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Reformation. If that was a good work, <hi>Cranmer</hi> did well in advising, and she in decreeing it: but if the Errors removed by the Reformation were not real, but only pretended, as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> would perswade us, (but will never be able to prove) <hi>Cranmer</hi> indeed was answerable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99496:17"/>
for giving her ill Councel: but she her self is accountable for the removal of them, for it was Her Act. 'Twas by Her <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Mission,</hi> though Mr. <hi>M. cannot tell it,</hi> Page 2. that <hi>Anno</hi> 154<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. the word Sacrament, in the sence which the Church then gave of it, was restrained to Baptism and the Lords Supper; and sure the Church of <hi>England</hi> had Authority enough to explain her meaning, by what words she thought fit. Let him shew if he can, that there were more Sacraments (as she understands the word Sacrament) ever owned in the Catholick Church, than those two allowed by her.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to shew that it was not <hi>Cranmer's</hi> private Opinion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced the Church; 'tis observable first that he had several private Opinions, (two whereof Mr. <hi>M.</hi> lays to his charge in his Preface) which were absolutely condemned by the Church, and the contrary established as her Doctrine, which he himself signed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That the Bishops and Clergy of <hi>England</hi> had unanimously entred upon the Business of the Reformation in the time of <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s Predecessor Arch-Bishop <hi>Warham, Anno</hi> 1531. by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Clergy to the King, and acknowledging his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy: and again <hi>Anno</hi> 1533, by consenting to an Act against Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein the Nation was declared to be an entire Body within it self with full Power to do Justice in all Causes, Spiritual as well as Temporal. And this before <hi>Cranmer</hi> was Arch-Bishop, so far was he from condemning or imposing on the Church from whence he had his Mission.</p>
            <p>§. 8. The fourth set of Questions concerning Mission is on this head, <hi>whether a Presbyterian Minister having received Orders from a Protestant Bishop can by vertue of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch Orders pronounce the Church of</hi> England <hi>a corrupt Church, or Preach against her Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Liturgy, notwithstanding her Censures?</hi> His design in this Question, is to shew that the first Reformers had no more Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Preach against the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, then such a <hi>Presbyter</hi> has to Preach against our Church: <hi>I cannot understand how a man can forsake the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and Preach Presbyterian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:99496:17"/>
               <hi>by vertue of his Protestant Mission; nor consequently how any Man can justifie his Protestant Doctrine by vertue of his Popish Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> pag. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why may not a Presbyterian, having the same Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which</hi> Cranmer <hi>pretended to, Preach against the Superstition of the</hi> Common Prayer, <hi>as well as he against the Idolatry of the</hi> Mass pag. 6. and more to the same purpose, pag. 12.</p>
            <p>In Answer to this, I will shew first, why a Presbyter or Bishop, ought not to Preach against the Constitution of the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is a Member in contradiction to her Censures. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this was not the first Reformers Case.</p>
            <p>1. A Presbyter or Bishop ought not to Preach against the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Church of which they are Members: Because there is a Regular way in which they may endeavour a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If they find any thing amiss in her Discipline or Doctrine, they may make their Application for redress of it to those that have power to reform it; but must not presume being Subjects to usu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p their Governors Power: For this is the case of private mens reforming abuses in the State in spight of the King; a remedy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally worse than the disease. However, in both Cases private men may sue for Redress, and in their proper Stations endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it. But if such a Bishop or Presbyter be <hi>Censured</hi> and Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, he is thereby discharged from the Execution of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and he must no more make a Schism to regain it, then one must make a Rebellion in the State to re-gain a Civil Office. This we urge, and I think with reason against the Presbyterians and other Sects amongst us, that either have no Ordination or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to their Offices from the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or else abuse the Power against her, which was once given them by her, and from which they are again legally suspended.</p>
            <p>And as we urge this against them, so likewise against M. <hi>M.</hi> and his Party, who without any Mission from these Churches, do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their private sence take a Commission from a Foreign Bishop and Church, to Preach against the declared Doctrine of that Church, to which by the Law of Christ they are Subjects.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99496:18"/>
Them we count those <hi>Rebels,</hi> who when censured and condemned by their own Churches and Governors against all the known Laws of our Church, flee from her Tribunal, and appeal to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, And what <hi>Rebels or Hereticks will ever be convicted,</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 4.) if they may chuse their own Judges, as those do? We do not deny the Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> we own that she can make Priests &amp; Bishops; but let Mr. <hi>M.</hi> shew that the Pope could ever give them Power to exercise their Office in these Kingdoms; since it is directly against the ancient Laws and Practice observed and enacted by our Ancestors, and in force at the Reformation. If a man like not the Orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore of his own Church, he must be without Orders, except he would be a Schismatick and Deserter, as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has made himself.</p>
            <p>And this is sufficient to shew that the Case of the first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers was vastly different from the Case of the present Dissenters, which is the second thing I am to prove. The whole strength of Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Paper doth really depend on this Parallel, and whoever reads it, will find that the only considerable Argument he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, is, that the first Reformers Mission could not be good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have as much to say for <hi>Theirs:</hi> And that he can find no difference between these two, only that the <hi>first Reformers were Authorized by Act of Parliament.</hi> I have heard it given as the Character of wit, that it finds out the likeness of things: whereas it is the work of Judgment to find out the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences: Now Mr. <hi>M.</hi> having (whatever his Judgment may be) a great wit, no wonder if he could find no other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those two Cases. His W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t could serve him to find the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness between the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Case and Ours, but his Judgment doth not serve him to find the Difference, Now, if he had been very inquisitive, he might have been informed in this by one of the late <hi>London</hi> Cases, printed for <hi>Thomas Bassett, London</hi> 1683. and written purposely to shew this Difference; and 'tis a wonder that Mr. <hi>M.</hi> whose study lay much in Pamphlets, mist it. If he saw it, he ought to have shown those Differences there assigned to be none, before he parallell'd the Cases. But to help his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99496:18"/>
I will shew three material Differences, besides that of an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> and besides the truth of the Doctrine, which was really on the Reformers side, and is only pretended to by Dissenters.</p>
            <p>1. In the condition of the Persons that pretended to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> In the manner of their proceeding.</p>
            <p>And <hi>3ly.</hi> In the Principles they took for their Rule.</p>
            <p>First, Therefore there is a great difference in the condition of the first Reformers, and the present Dissenters; these being only private persons, at the best <hi>Presbyters</hi> over-voted by the major part of their Brethren: Whereas the first Reformers were Bishops, and the chief Governors of the Church; who had a Canonical as well as Parliamentary Mission, and to which of right it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Govern and Reform the Church, over whom they were made Overseers by the Holy Ghost. Furthermore, the present Dissenters were the Bishops Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accountable to them as their Superiors, and liable to be discharged from their Office, and the Benefits of the Communion of the Church by their Censure; and so their Separation from their Bishops is a Schism; that is, an Ecclesiastical Rebellion: But the first Reformers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to no Superior but Jesus Christ; they were his immediate Vicars, not the Pope's; and therefore could not be guilty of any Rebellion against him.</p>
            <p>2. And as they were thus different in their Condition, so they were likewise in the manner of their Proceedings: for the first Reformers did strictly forbid private persons doing any thing of their own Head, as may be seen by the Proclamation set out <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>Anno</hi> 2. and accordingly they managed the whole matter by publick Authority in a Regular way, according to the ancient Forms of passing Laws, and making Alterations in the Church. Whereas both <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Papists;</hi> that is, all Dissenters, proceed on their own Heads in s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight of their Lawful Governors. Let a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> take the same way to remove the pretended <hi>Superstition of the Common-Prayer-Book</hi> that the first
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99496:19"/>
Reformers took to remove the <hi>Idolatry of the Mass;</hi> or let the <hi>Papists</hi> take the same way to Establish the <hi>Mass,</hi> that our first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers took to Abolish it, and do it, if they can: But if they will make use of another way never allowed in the Church, and yet pretend to the same Power that the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> had, he must be blind that doth not see the vanity of their Pretences.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> observes well, <hi>That the not considering this Matter, hath brought a world of Confusion on these Kingdoms, and till the People understand it, we are never like to see an end of Religious distractions;</hi> (pag. 6.) for while men <hi>without ordinary Mission</hi> from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of a Church, or <hi>without extraordinary Mission testified by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> shall be received by the people upon pretence they are sent by a Foreign Church, or that the People themselves can declare them Commissionated by Christ, which are the pretences of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> and <hi>Dissenters;</hi> what more peace can be hoped for in the Church, than in a State where such things were allowed to be practised? Why may not the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> resist their Lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, as well as the <hi>Papists</hi> deny their Power, and question their Succession, though they have none to oppose to it?</p>
            <p>The third Difference between the <hi>Dissenters</hi> Case in respect of Us, and our Case in respect of <hi>Papists,</hi> is in the Principles on which our first Reformers proceeded. They did not pretend as he slanders them in his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Preface <hi>to justifie their Separation</hi> (for they never made any) <hi>by the Scriptures only as interpreted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, not only without, but against the Authority of the present Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</hi> For on the contrary, except he mean by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the Catholick Church was for the Reformers, as they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and the greater part of visible Christians concurred with them in their sence of Scripture, as to the most material controversies between our Church and <hi>Rome.</hi> But the true Principles of the Reformation were such as these, That the Catholick Faith ought to be always the same in all Ages, and could not receive Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or grow by time; that nothing should be an Article of Faith to day that was not yesterday; and therefore nothing was to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99496:19"/>
be reckoned as Catholick Faith, but what was received <hi>semper, ubique &amp; ab omnibus,</hi> according to <hi>Vincentius</hi>'s Rule; and that nothing was thus Catholik, but what might be proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taken in that sence which hath not been contradicted by Catholick Fathers. These were the Principles of the Reformers Faith.</p>
            <p>And in other things belonging to the Government and Polity of the Church, to Rites, Ceremonies, and Liturgies: 'T was their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that every National Church was at her own choice, how she would order them; and her Subjects ow'd her Obedience. These are truly Catholick Principles founded on a Rock, the word of God interpreted by Catholick Tradition, and not on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sentiments of any party of Men, and are a sufficient hedge against Heresie and Schism, sufficient to secure the good corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence of neighbouring, and the peace of particular Churches. Let any one compare this <hi>Basis</hi> with that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, and let him judge which is most solid; whether that which is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Scriptures as interpreted by all Ages of the Church, or that which has only <hi>the Voice</hi> of a part of the <hi>Visible Church,</hi> and the greater part against it. These are the <hi>two Bases</hi> of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Popery.</p>
            <p>To this Justification no Sectary can pretend, and though <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> had really this Warrant to reject the super-added Articles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they differed in this, at least some of them, that they did not think it necessary to wait the concurrence of their Governors, but concluded the major part of the Peoples joyning with them was sufficient, without regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Forms and Process: and whether that may be allowed in any case I leave Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and them to dispute, for we are not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, and they are of full Age to answer for themselves, and he will find they can do it.</p>
            <p>Only he is not to be pardoned when he brings in <hi>Socinus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering amongst other Reformers, that <hi>he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These are sufficient to shew the vast difference between the pretences of the present Dissenters, and the ground of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. And that the Argument he draws from the Obligation in Ordination laid on the Presb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>§. 9. And so I proceed to his fifth Query: <hi>Whether an Act of Parliament in</hi> France, Spain, <hi>or</hi> Germany, <hi>be not as good an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for Popery there, as in</hi> England <hi>for Protestancy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I suppose by an Act of Parliament, he means the Laws enacted regularly by the Supream Powers of those Nations (which he ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly expresses by an Act of Parliament) and to this I answer, That if any Religion is to be established in any Kingdom by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Rewards or Punishments, to encourage the Obedient, and terrifie the disobedient; the supream Powers of every Nation only can thus establish that Religion; &amp; they themselves are sole Judges with what temporal Rewards and Punishments, and how far they will establish it: and they are answerable only to God for their actings herein. If therefore the Supream Civil Government in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> set up Popery, a Man must submit to it, or burn for it, if the Law be so: and such a Law, though it is unjust, is as forcible for a false Religion as a true.</p>
            <p>But there is another way of establishing a Religion, and that is by convincing Mens Minds that the Religion is true; and that, according as men cordially embrace it, the shall be secured of the Divine Favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be happy in the next World. And if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99496:20"/>
this be the Christian Religion of which they are so convinced, one Principle of it is, that the Professors thereof ought to associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themselves into a Body, and that Christ the Author thereof has appointed Governors who are to descend in Succession; and that to these, regularly appointed, a due Obedience is to be paid, as Men value the Rewards or Punishments of the next life. Now Men, thus perswaded, cannot think an Act of the Civil Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors alone, a sufficient Commission for any one to undertake the Function of a Spiritual Pastor, any more than an Act of these Spiritual Pastors is sufficient to capacitate and commissionate a Man to discharge a Civil Function: and therfore Mr. <hi>M.</hi> argues very unnecessarily against the Parliaments Power <hi>to preach or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Sacraments,</hi> pag. 3. since the <hi>27th.</hi> Article of our Church denies expresly that Power to the Civil Governors. I suppose I have sufficiently shewn that our first Reformers had a Canonical as well as Parliamentary Mission, and I suppose that this Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Mission is nothing the less valid, because the other goes along with it.</p>
            <p>But then it may be objected; Have not <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> an Act of the Church, as well as State, for establishing their Religion? I answer, they have; and so has Mahometism in <hi>Turkey</hi> an Act of what they count the Church, for its establishment. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not sufficient that the Power that establishes a Religion be competent; and the Methods regular by which it is settled: but likewise it is necessary that the Religion be true in it self: and therefore a man must examine whether the Christian Religion be more purely &amp; truly taught &amp; established in <hi>England,</hi> or in <hi>Spain,</hi> before he either reject or embrace the one or the other. For a false Religion may have all the regular settlements that a true can have and the Professors thereof being conscious of its weakness, are often more industrious to make the accidental security the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And I do affirm that there is not one Argument in this Paper urged by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> against Protestants, but might with equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage be urged <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> against convert Christians in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan Country; &amp; this alone is sufficient to shew them all to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99496:21"/>
unconclusive. The way therefore for every man to be satisfied in his Religion, is to examine it apart from the accidental advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of it, and chuse that which has best reasons to recommend it: for a man ought to chuse his Church by his Religion, and not his Religion by his Church.</p>
            <p>But he asks <hi>in case there be no Judge to determine who have the true sence of Scripture,</hi> Roman Catholicks <hi>or</hi> Protestants, <hi>whether the Catholick sence be not as good as the Protestants?</hi> (Pref. <hi>p.</hi> 3.) It were a sufficient Answer to this, to put another case like it to him in the person of a <hi>Turk:</hi> And it is this, in case there is no Judge to determine (as I know of none, saith the <hi>Turk</hi>) which is the Word of God, the <hi>Bible,</hi> or the <hi>Alchoran.</hi> Why should not the Affirmation of us <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>slelmans</hi> (who are ready to vouch to the death for the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and are twice the number of you <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>) be as good authority for Men to believe the <hi>Alchoran</hi> came from God, as your vouching for your <hi>Bibles</hi> is sufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men to believe that they came from him.</p>
            <p>But I do not love to shift off a Question, and therefore tell him that the sence put by <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks on the Scripture, is not so good as the sence put on them by the <hi>Protestants.</hi> If it were, they would not be afraid to put it to the World, and let every person that is equally concerned judge for himself: but they had rather appeal to themselves as Judges, and then they are sure of the cause.</p>
            <p>But then he tells us, <hi>that he could never understand what Unity of Spirit, or agreement in Faith Christians are like to have</hi> (page 3.) upon these Principles.</p>
            <p>To which I Answer, more than they have now. If National Churches were left to be govern'd by themselves, &amp; the Subjects of each Church bound to adhere to their immediate Governors in all quarrels with neighbouring Churches, those contentions must soon come to an end, as the quarrel between St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> &amp; <hi>Stephen</hi> did. For when the Governours of differing Churches find that they cannot hurt one another, or advantage themselves by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of Communion (as it must be when the one Church doth not raise a Faction to side with it in the other) the quarrel must
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99496:21"/>
soon cease; for the thing that makes quarrels endless is interest. But if it once be counted Lawful for one Church to get a Party in the others Precincts, and set up Altar against Altar in the same place, this will continue the Schism, and is the very fundamental reason of the breaches of Charity amongst Christians that now pester Christendom, which are much worse than Divisions in Faith. And thus I have answered all his Questions, and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Replies he made to these Answers he himself was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to observe, which were the two first things I undertook on this Head.</p>
            <p>§. 10. I shall in the third place consider the objections he makes against the Reformers as to their Lives and Principles. If I had a mind to shuffle as he does, I would answer with him, <hi>page</hi> 13. <hi>As for the ill practice of some, and the ill Opinions of other</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, <hi>which</hi> Papists <hi>are wont to charge upon the</hi> Reformation, <hi>I pass them over as no Argument at all. In our</hi> Articles and Canons <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Reader shall find nothing but what is judicious and pious.</hi> But his slanders are so malicious that they ought not to be pass'd over without Animadversion.</p>
            <p>First therefore against <hi>Somerset</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> whom he calls <hi>grand Reformers,</hi> he objects <hi>Sacrilege and Plundering the Church.</hi> But as for <hi>Dudley,</hi> we are not obliged to defend him: he was a false Brother; being as he professed at his death al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Papist in his heart: and no wonder such Villains should pervert the most innocent design to their own advantage; since there was a <hi>Judas</hi> even among the Apostles, who minded only the Bag. <hi>Somerset</hi> was not clear from the same vice. But it is to be considered that the Pope had taught them all this Lesson by his example and wicked management of the Goods of the Church. 'T was he first gave the proper Patrimony of the Church, even Tithes to Lay-men, to useless and idle Monks and Fryars; it was he that by making a Trade of Simony and Sacrilege took off men's Veneration for Holy things, and made Noble-Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Estates were as well bestow'd in their hands as to enrich a Foreigner. Whoever reads our Chronicles will find this to be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99496:22"/>
the true Ground of the Dilapidation of the Goods of the Church, and that this took off the Conscience of Robbing her.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Cranmer</hi> and the Bishops, they did what they could to hinder it, but were forced to <hi>buy</hi> God's <hi>truth</hi> and the estalishment thereof at the rate of some of their wordly Goods; a bargain Mr. <hi>M.</hi> would never have made, nor any one that values the Church only for her outward splendour. But the Reformers hearts were not so full of the World, and yet they never establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Article or Canon that allows Sacriledge.</p>
            <p>§. 12. But he proceeds and objects against <hi>Cranmer:</hi> 1. his <hi>Opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 2. his <hi>Recantation,</hi> 3. his <hi>Treason,</hi> 4. his <hi>Divorcing Queen</hi> Katherine, 5. his <hi>Destroying Religious Houses, and hanging up poor Abbots,</hi> 6. <hi>Setting the People a madding after New Lights,</hi> and 7. <hi>All the Confusion and Mischiefs that have since broke out upon the Stage of</hi> Great Britain.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Cranmer's</hi> Opinions: In his Preface Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Objects to him, that he said <hi>by the Scriptures no Consecration is necessary to a Priest or Bishop; only Appointment:</hi> and then, that the power of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication <hi>depended only on the Laws of the Land:</hi> but he doth not observe that <hi>Cranmer</hi> did only humbly propose these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did not define them, as may be seen expresly in his Subscription; nay, upon better information, retracted them, as appears by his signing Dr. <hi>Leighton's</hi> Opinion to the contrary. I confess it looks like a Providence that <hi>Cranmer</hi> should embrace some of these O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions: For by this it plainly appears that he did not influence the Reformation so much as to make his private Opinions pass for the Doctrine of the Church, as some have with confidence enough pretended; and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> amongst the rest, who doth dissemble (or considering his reading doth probably not know) the original of these mistakes in <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and some others at that time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the distinction of Civil and Ecclesiastical Power, which was this; The Pope had made a confusion of the Civil and Spiritual Power, by assuming to himself the erecting Kingdoms, transferring Rights, Dispensing with Oaths, and Deposing Princes: of all which there were fresh instances at that time particularly, the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99496:22"/>
Deposing <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and Absolving his Subjects from their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance by <hi>Paul</hi> III. This having confounded the two Powers; no wonder that men could not on a sudden clear their eyes so as exactly to see the limits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if <hi>Cranmer,</hi> being well assured of the Pope's usurpation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did on the other hand at first give too much to the Prince; which yet on second thoughts, finding himself sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in it, he recalled, and joyned with the rest in subscribing the publick Doctrine directly contrary to his former private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s first Volumn, <hi>Addenda pag.</hi> 327.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Pope the Head of Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Church was in as great an Error as <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and for which there was less ground, and yet neither He nor His Successors have retracted it to this day. Let the World judge of the Discretion of this Man who forsakes a Church, because one of the Reformers had an odd Opinion, which he Retracted and established the contrary in the Church; and yet joyns with a Church; whose Head at the same time profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and imposed as great an Error, and which stands yet unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted.</p>
            <p>§. 13. The second Objection against <hi>Cranmer,</hi> is his <hi>Recantation for fear of Death;</hi> but let the World consider whether he or they that put him to that fear for his Religion were most guilty: and let Mr. <hi>M.</hi> say, whether he be so sure of his constancy in his new Religion, that he would be contented to be counted a Villain, if fear of Death should make him dissert it; and then why should not he allow something to humane frailty?</p>
            <p>§. 14. But he Objects in the third place, that <hi>Cranmer subscribed a Letter for the Exclusion of his Lawful Princess:</hi> But whoever reads the History will find that he was brought with greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty then any to subscribe to her Exclusion, and not till after the King, the whole Privy-Council and Judges had Signed it; this then was a point of Law in which he was not singular. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> takes the liberty to question Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Title, and sure it was no greater fault in <hi>Cranmer</hi> to question, Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s after the Opinion of the Judges given against her, There is great difference between Rebellion against a King of undoubted Title;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99496:23"/>
and being engaged on a side where the Title is really doubtful. The first is a great wickedness, and the last a great infelicity.</p>
            <p>§. 16. His fourth Objection is the <hi>Divorcing Queen Katherine;</hi> but it was not only <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Opinion, but the Opinion of most learned Men in <hi>Europe,</hi> that her Marriage to the King was null. How <hi>Vertuous or Innocent soever</hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> reckons her, <hi>Cranmer</hi> was in the right when he and all the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> so judged it. The scruple was first raised in the King by the Ambassadors of <hi>Spain,</hi> and further confirmed by those of <hi>France</hi> before any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue with <hi>Anne Boleyn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 16. His fifth Objection is <hi>dissolving Religious Houses and Hanging up the Abbots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to his dissolving Religious Houses, if his Councel had been taken, it had turned to the advantage of Religion and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and I do not find that either have lost by it as it is. As for his Hanging up the Abbots, this is one of <hi>Sanders</hi>'s lyes tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Heylin,</hi> in his History, who tells us<note place="margin">ad An. pag. 9. 1537.</note> of the <hi>Executing of some Abbots and other Religious Persons for their stiffness, (if I may not call it perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) in opposing the Kings desires:</hi> but this is confuted by <hi>Burnet.</hi> Who shews that the Abbots were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted<note place="margin">ad An. 1538. <hi>v.</hi> 1. pag. 236.</note> neither for <hi>stiffness</hi> nor <hi>perverseness,</hi> but downright actual Rebellion, that is taking Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Sovereign, or sending Money to those that did.</p>
            <p>§. 17. Sixthly, His <hi>setting People a madding after new Lights;</hi> that is, he allowed People the use of their Eyes and Ears, and did not think Ignorance the Mother of Devotion, or that Peoples De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion or Religion was more acceptable to God, because they did not understand it; of any other setting People a madding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter New Lights, <hi>Cranmer</hi> never was Guilty: And thus Christianity set the World near 1700 years ago a madding, and was accused by the Heathen for it.</p>
            <p>§. 18, But he objects, lastly, <hi>That</hi> Cromwel <hi>and</hi> Cranmer <hi>were the Ringle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ders of all that Confusion and Mischief, which has since broke out on the Stage of</hi> Britain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99496:23"/>This is to charge them home, &amp; would do their work in earnest, if true; but the best of it is, that it wants proof &amp; Truth: for the Times since the Reformation have been as signal for Piety and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as any like tract of time before, and blessed with the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most flourishing Peace, that, perhaps ever was seen in <hi>England</hi> for the space of, at least, 80 years, in which it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the highest pitch of Glory that ever it reached.</p>
            <p>And besides all this, many Confusions and Mischiefs that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened since in these Kingdoms proceeded clearly from other hands. Pray, were <hi>Cranm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> the Ring-leaders of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>'s Wars? and of the Massacre of the Protestants in 1641? which were the greatest Confusions in <hi>Ireland</hi> since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Were they the Ringleaders of four Rebellions in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time? of the Four in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's, or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Plots in Queen <hi>Elizabeths?</hi> These were neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less some of the Confusions since on the Stage of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a great many Sects have risen since, of which the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was the occasion, if we believe Mr. <hi>M.</hi> I answer, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity was the cause of as many, and the Grace of God it self was abused. But it is to be observed, that the first Sect that opened the Gap, and introduced all the rest was POPERY, planted among us by the Emissaries of <hi>Rome.</hi> These broke the Hedge, and shewed the way of Separation; others only imitated them, and transcribed their Practices and Principles, thinking they might as well teach men by their own Authority, as by a Foreign Commission; and it is like, that such as favour them now, set them on at first, purposely to make them a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>log and Objection to the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Two means we do own Papists have to prevent Sects, that we want, Ignorance and the Inquisition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a profound Ignorance, as in a dark night all things are silent; but there will be a bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and stir among men, while the Sun shines. And for the Inquisition, it is <hi>the true Ram</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99496:24"/>
But we beg his Holiness's Pardon; we had rather suffer all our Sects, if they were more, than admit these Remedies; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all are not effectual, as we may see from the new Sects in <hi>Italy;</hi> and we cannot think those the only fit means to prevent Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Christianity, which may as well be applied to keep it out, and preserve Union amongst Infidels.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III.</head>
            <p>§. 1. AND now I come to the second Point, wherein Mr. <hi>M.</hi> was dissatisfied, which he tells us, was <hi>the Want of Confession to a Priest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is so little looks like Reason on this Head, that it is harder to find out what he intends for Argument in it; than to answer it. I will do him Justice, and consider even that little he has said. And that in this method.</p>
            <p>1. I will lay down the Doctrine of our Church concerning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. How far she declares it necessary, and how far expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent only: from whence it will appear, that Confession is not wanting in her.</p>
            <p>2. I will consider what he has produced in favour of its neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, or expediency.</p>
            <p>The first of these seems necessary to be handled; because he tells us, that he <hi>divers times discoursed with Protestant Ministers, and some Protestant Bishops, about this matter; and was sorry to find no Harmony in their Opinions,</hi> p. 6. Now let us suppose it were true, that private men differ'd in their Opinions about some matters relating to Confession: yet it were nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: at least, it could be no reasonable motive to go from us to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> since her private Doctors differ as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Some of which say, that the Priest ought to take the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents word, and grant him Absolution; although he do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Profession of Repentance to be sincere. Others hold, that the Confessor ought to be satisfied of the Penitents sincerity
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99496:24"/>
before he absolve him. Some say <hi>Attrition</hi> with Absolution is sufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o obtain Remission of Sins; others say <hi>Contrition</hi> is necessary; which is as material a difference as almost can be. Many such differences there are amongst them, and the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty accuses the other of Heresie for their dissering Opinions; and yet it seems this want of Harmony amongst the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors and Bishops did not hinder Mr. <hi>M.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom embracing their Religion. It was therefore very partially done to leave Our Church for a pretended difference amongst our Doctors: For let us take the Difference as he represents it, and it is really no more. <hi>Some said'twas a thing allowed by the Church of</hi> England <hi>as very expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in some Cases, but no matter of necessity; others thought it but a Picklock of Secrets, and a matter of ill consequence.</hi> Methinks there is a very good Harmony between these, and that the same Men might have said both: at least the Opinions are easily reconciled, since both agree that in all cases <hi>it is no matter of necessity;</hi> and neither deny, <hi>that in some cases it is very expedient:</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which it may be in other cases, <hi>but a Pick-lock of Secrets, and matter of ill consequence.</hi> Where is the disagreement or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction between these two? To give Mr. <hi>M.</hi> back one of his own Arguments, <hi>for my part I do not understand it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. I have read a great many Protestant Books, and consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both Divines and Bishops; and do profess that I have found them very well agreed in these things.</p>
            <p>First, That every Sinner ought to be heartily sensible of every Sin he has committed, and acknowledge it before God with shame and sorrow; and that he can expect no Pardon from God till he actually abhor and forsake the Sin. Wherever Confession is mentioned in Scripture, it is to be understood of this kind of Confession; except the Circumstances manifestly determine the sence otherwise. This Confession alone was sufficient to obtain Remission of Sins under the Old Law, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 5. without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confession to a Priest.</p>
            <p>2. It is necessary to Confess and Acknowledge such Sins as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure our Neighbours, not only to God, but likewise to the injured
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99496:25"/>
person; where that Confession may be an Advantage or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to him. Restitution must also go along with Confession if it be possible: If the injured person, or they who have a title to what was his, are not to be found; the Restitution is to be made to God for some Charitable use, according to the advice of the Priest. This case is thus determined by God himself, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. and by Our Church in her Exhortation to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>3. Where a Sin is notorious or publick, in as much as the Church is injured by it, and the Fact falls under her Cognizance and Jurisdiction, she may call the Sinner to an account, oblige him to make publick Confession of his Guilt, and to submit to such Discipline as she judges most probable to reform him. Her Sentence of Absolution is necessary to a person thus called to an account by her, where it may be had; neither can he be absolved from his Sin without submitting to her Orders. This appears to be the sence of our Church, from the Rubrick to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and 33. Article.</p>
            <p>4. Where theee is any doubt or scruple in a Man's mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of an Action, whether it be good or evil; concerning his own Repentance, whether it be sincere and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: or concerning the means and way to attain to this true Repentance: In these and the like cases the Sinner is obliged to repair to his Spiritual Guide for his Resolution, Counsel and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. This is commanded by Our Church in the Exhortation that gives warning for the Communion.</p>
            <p>5. Where the sence of Guilt lyes heavy on the Conscience of a Sinner, so that there is danger of his being swallowed up by too much Grief; he who finds his Spirit thus wounded is required to have recourse to his Spiritual Physician; that <hi>by the Ministry of Gods word, he may receive the benefit of Absolution.</hi> As Our Church has exprest it in her Exhortation, whose words Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has corrupted (that he might find an occasion to cavil,) first by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Proviso</hi> as hers in the matter of Confession; <hi>if a Man be troubled with any doubts or scruples;</hi> whereas she uses no such

words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either <hi>in her Office for Communion, or Visitation of the Sick:</hi> which are the two places he alledges for them. And Secondly, by leaving out these words, <hi>but</hi> if any one <hi>requires far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort or counsel,</hi> in this following Sentence; <hi>If there be any of you, who by this means cannot quiet his own Conscience herein,</hi> but requires farther comfort or counsel: <hi>let him come to me, or some other discreet and learned Minister, and open his grief.</hi> Where the words he has left out make her sence plain, that she requires men to come to a Priest, not only in cases of Scruples and Doubts, but likewise of Grief for the sence of Guilt: and that she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses Advice and Counsel as a remedy for the one, and Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a remedy for the other. Which clearly destroys Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s surmise; as if <hi>Confession</hi> in our Church were for <hi>nothing else but to be resolved in our Scruples and Doubts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Confession to a Priest, even of secret Sins, is counted with us an act of Mortification, and of great uses in most cases: as it is of great use and safety to consult a Physician at any time when one finds himself sick: this is prescribed by the <hi>19th</hi> Canon of the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi> It is counted a great Wickedness for the Priest to reveal any such Confession. And it is forbidden <hi>under the pain of irregularity,</hi> by the 64<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Canon.</p>
            <p>7. It is not necessary by any Divine Command, that a man should discover every Sin to a Priest, though he may be had, any more than it is necessary every time a man is sick to send for a Physician. And therefore Auricular Confession is not the only way for obtaining Pardon of Sins committed after Baptism.</p>
            <p>From these things, in which our Bishops and Divines are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, though Mr. <hi>M.</hi> slanders them for want <hi>of harmony,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that neither publick nor private Confession is wanting in our Church, and it can no more be said that Confession to a Priest is wanting in her, because she doth not oblige all People to it under penalty of Damnation, then a City can be said to want Water, where the Fountains are full and open, only because Men are not obliged under pain of Death to use them.</p>
            <p>If therefore Mr. <hi>M.</hi> means any thing when he professes himself
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99496:26"/>
               <hi>dissatisfied</hi> with <hi>the want of Confession to a Priest;</hi> he must mean, the want of a Law to oblige all men who hope for pardon of any sin, to confess it in particular to the Priest, and receive his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution for it. We must own that we have no such Law in our Church. But the reason of that want is, because neither Christ nor his Apostles left us any such.</p>
            <p>§ 3. It was incumbent on him, before he left our Church on that account, to produce this Law, and shew Confession to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise necessary than is taught and practised by her. Let us us therefore examine what he has said on this head.</p>
            <p>And here the only thing produced by him for the necessity of Confession to a Priest, which looks like an Argument, is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in these words. <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>If we confess our Sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our Sins,</hi> saith St. <hi>John. Faithful and Just, to what? even to his own promise which he hath thrice repeated in the Gospel; whosesoever Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; but other promise that he will do it without the Ministry of his Priests, we read not in the New Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In answer to this Argument, I will shew, 1. That the words <hi>If we confess our Sins,</hi> do not concern Confession to a Priest. 2. When God is said to be <hi>Faithful and Just,</hi> it doth not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly respect that promise, <hi>John</hi> 20. 23. <hi>Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them.</hi> 3. If it did respect this Promise, and the <hi>Ministry of a Priest</hi> were granted to be absolutely necessary to the pardon of Sins; yet it would not follow that Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession were necessary.</p>
            <p>§ 4. First, the words of St. <hi>John</hi> 1 Ep. 1. 9. <hi>If we confess our sins,</hi> do not concern Confession to a Priest: but were designed by the Apostle to oblige every man to acknowledge and confess that he is a sinner, and that he needs Repentance and the Blood of Christ for his salvation; which will appear from the occasion and circumstances of this place. I think it is agreed that St. <hi>John</hi> wrote these words in opposition to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples<note place="margin">St. Iren. lib. 1. cap. 1. p. 29. <hi>Paris</hi> 1679.</note> of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who taught, as St. <hi>Irenoeus</hi> informs us, that such <hi>as were perfect among them,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:99496:26"/>
and had that Principle they called <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lt and Light</hi> could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in: Not but that they were guilty of the greatest villanies: but they reckoned nothing in themselves sin, because they walked in <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> while the rest of the world were in <hi>Darkness,</hi> as they pretended. In opposition to these, St. <hi>John</hi> shews us, <hi>v.</hi> 8. that if we pretend thus to be without <hi>sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> but if we own and acknowledge our sins, and heartily endeavour to avoid them; then the Blood of Christ cleanses us from all sin, according to Gods promise, who <hi>gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him might not perish.</hi> It is plain, from vers. 10. that such as refused to confess their sins, according to St. <hi>John, made God a lyar.</hi> Now this is litterally true of those who deny that they are sinners, as those Hereticks did: but to deny the necessity of a particular enumeration of sins to a Priest, doth no ways impeach Gods truth: and therefore the Confession required by these words, <hi>if we confess our sins</hi> is not Auricular.</p>
            <p>This is farther manifest from the ancient Fathers of the Church, not one of which understand these words of Confession to a Priest.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Augustine</hi> has written a Comment on this Epistle, and he thus explains this place. <hi>If thou confess that thou</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ergo si te confessus fueris peccatorem, est in te veritas.—.—dic homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quid e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Occumenius</hi> refers this whole passage to the Jews. <hi>If we who said his Blood be on us, and on our Children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Occumenius in locum.</note> 
               <hi>should impudently say that we have not sinned, we deceive our selves—but if we acknowledge and confess this sin, he will forgive us.</hi> Which sufficiently shews, that by confessing our sins here, is meant the acknowledging our selves to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in opposition to those who plead innocency: And that this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99496:27"/>
has no relation to a particular Confession of Sins to a Priest.</p>
            <p>Sect. 5. But 2. When God is said to be <hi>Faithful and Just,</hi> it doth not particularly respect that Promise, John 20. 23. <hi>Whose Sins you remit they are remitted;</hi> which is sufficiently proved from this Argument that no ancient interpreter has thus applyed them; but on the contrary have referred them<note place="margin">St. Cyprian de orat. dom. <hi>p.</hi> 149. Oxon.</note> to other Promises. Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> refers them to that Petition in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Forgive us our Trespasses,</hi> and interprets Confessing in St. <hi>John</hi> by this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Prayer; to which he saith, Forgiveness is promised, St. <hi>John</hi> therefore saith, <hi>that God who keeps his Promise is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to forgive Sins, because he who hath taught us to pray for our sins, hath promised, that his Fatherly Mercy and Pardon shall follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Roman Gloss saith, <hi>God is faithful, who promised Grace to the humble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oecumenius</hi> refers this to <hi>Isaiah</hi> 43. 26. Where<note place="margin">Oecum. in Loc.</note> according to the Septuagint Translation, the words are, <hi>tell thy sins first, that thou mayest be justified.</hi> Which is usher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in with that promise, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy Transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lyra saith, <hi>God is faithful to forgive us our Sins, because he promised so,</hi> Mat. 3. 2. <hi>Repent ye for the Kingdom of God is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You see that the ancient Interpreters could find other Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses both in the Old and New Testament, which obliged God to forgive Sins before Auricular Confession is pretended to be insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; and not one of them dreamed that St. <hi>John</hi> had relation to that promise; beside which Mr, <hi>M.</hi> affirms there is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the New Testament. How will he reconcile this to his profession of Faith, in which he promises never to interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers? When there is not one Father to vouch his sence of this place, and several against him.</p>
            <p>§ 6. But 3. Suppose, that consequence followed from this place
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99496:27"/>
which he infers that <hi>God will not</hi> remit Sins under the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>without the Ministry of his Priests:</hi> Yet it would not follow that Auricular Confession is necessary; because under the old Law the Sins of the People were not pardoned without the Ministry of Gods Priests, and yet it is confessed that Auricular Confession was not then instituted. Besides if the Ministry of the Priest be necessary, why should that be understood rather of their private than publick Ministry? And lastly, their Ministry may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary on other accounts than hearing Confessions and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Absolutions. Thus <hi>Oecumenius</hi> makes the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness<note place="margin">Oecum in Loc.</note> of Sins here promised to be that Remission which is obtained in Baptism. <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>God doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly remit Sins to them that come to his holy Baptism.</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. Chrys. lib. 3. De Sacerdotio.</note> St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> who wrote his Books <hi>De Sacerdotio,</hi> purposely to magnisie the Priests Office, interprets the promise in St. <hi>John</hi> 20. 23. by the power of admitting to Baptism, and the Lords Supper: together with the Priests Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession and Prayers for Sinners; but he says not one word of their remitting by an Absolution or Judicial Sentence. Who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever knows St. <hi>Chrisostom,</hi> must own that if he had known or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved such a magnificent power in the Priests, he wou'd never have omitted it, in Books written designedly to magnifie their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. I conclude therefore that although the Ministry of the Priests under the Gospel is necessary to the pardon of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Sins: Yet that Ministry may consist in the use of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, Prayers, Intercession, and Sacraments; and I believe Mr. <hi>M.</hi> will hardly be able to shew any other way of Absolution used by the ancient Church.

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. The second thing Mr. <hi>M.</hi> intends for an Argument in favour of Confession, is what he alledges, <hi>p.</hi> 7. that Confession is <hi>approved and frequented by all the Christian World, except the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:99496:28"/>
               <hi>of our Islands, and some few others that call themselves reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and further <hi>p.</hi> 8. that it <hi>was never heard of in the Catholick Church that Christians may receive the communion of Christs Body and Blood without a previous confession and Absolution.</hi> Which if true, proves this Doctrine to be Catholick both as, to time and place; but the best of it is, that we are not bound to take his word. And that upon Examination this will be found false in both the parts of it. For neither do all other Christians beside the Reformed frequent and approve Auricular Confession otherwise than our Church doth: Nor is it any new thing in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church for Men to come to the Communion without pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Confession and Absolution by a Priest.</p>
            <p>The whole Greek Church <hi>denies Auricular Confession to be of divine Right, pretending it only to be a positive and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical constitution: And they give the Communion to Laicks both in health and sickness, though they have not before confest their Sins to a Priest; and that because they are perswaded that Confession is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and that Faith is the only and true preparative for receiving the Eucharist.</hi> So Father <hi>Simon</hi> shews from <hi>Caucus Venetus</hi> in his Religion and Customs of the Eastern Nations, <hi>p.</hi> 8. <hi>Lond. Ed.</hi> 1685. and he owns that <hi>Caucus has asserted nothing as to that point which doth not agree to the real belief of the Greeks,</hi> p. 13.</p>
            <p>Of the Christians of St. <hi>Thomas in India,</hi> he relates from <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> that <hi>they abominate Auricular Confession, p.</hi> 94. And though he pretends this <hi>to be an abuse introduced into that Church,</hi> p. 102. yet he produces nothing but his own conjecture to prove it so, and acknowledges, that <hi>most in the East think not themselves obliged to it by Divine Right:</hi> and consequently it may either be used or laid aside as the Church thinks convenient. We learn the same from the Gloss of their own Canon Law; where<note place="margin">Decret de poenit. Dist. 5. Can 1.</note> we are told, <hi>that Confession to a Priest is better said to be instituted by a certain Tradition of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church, then from the Authority of the Old or new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Tradition of the Church obliges as a Command, and therefore with us</hi> (he means the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) <hi>Confession of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:99496:28"/>
               <hi>Sins is necessary. But is not necessary with the</hi> Greeks, <hi>because they have no such Tradition.</hi> Here is a Tradition pretended of the Universal Church, and yet an acknowledgment, that at least one half of that Church has no such Tradition: which is as good sence as <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi> However I take this to be a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that Confession is no otherways approved and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Christian World; (except the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) than it is by the Reformed. That is, it is looked on by all, but Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Church, as a piece of Ecclesiastical Discipline only, and then it may be used or dispensed with, as the Church sees most for her Edification.</p>
            <p>§ 8. This is not only the Opinion of the greater part of the present Visible, but it was so likewise of the Ancient Church: Though Mr. <hi>M.</hi> tells us with confidence enough, that <hi>it was never heard in the Catholick Church till</hi> Henry VIII. <hi>that any was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Communion without Confession.</hi>

on that is very remarkable. <hi>In the year</hi> 1150. <hi>in the time of</hi> Gratian, <hi>nothing was defined or commanded concerning the necessity of Confession by the Church: For if there had,</hi> Gratian <hi>had not been ignorant of it nor omitted it, but Confession with the Mouth was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced near an hundred years after by</hi> Innocent III. Thus the <hi>Roman</hi> Gloss, and the Reader must judge, whether he will believe Mr. <hi>M.</hi> who affirms, that Auricular Confession was always neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, or the Canon Law and Gloss, that says, it was made necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about the year 1215: That is not full three hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. so late is this Sacrament even in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the Doctrine of its necessity.</p>
            <p>§ 9. The third Argument Mr. <hi>M.</hi> produces for Confession, is grounded on the inconveniencies that arise from the want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: He tells us, <hi>that Protestant Sermons have some Authority upon the People, but not much for lack of this curb on their Vices, p.</hi> 6. Now whether Sermons or Auricular Confession are the greatest curb to Vice; can only be judged by Experience; and let that determine whether Protestants or Papists are most Licentious: Let us compare Protestant Countries with Popish, and see where Vice doth most abound. Let us look into <hi>Germany, Denmark, Switzerland,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries, England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and let any one judge which are most corrupt in their Morals, or most happy in their Government. Among our selves, Let us compare the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants who have lived in prosperity these last thirty years, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently have been most lyable to corruption, with the Papists that have been in adversity, and consequently are at the best: and from these, we shall discern what a mighty curb Confession is on the Vices of Men. Lastly, Compare the times before the Reformation, with what has been since, and we shall find even <hi>Rome</hi> it self at this day reformed to what it was: which shews that the Light of Truth, which we propose to our People is not so weak a curb on Men's Vices, as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> would persuade us.</p>
            <p>This second inconveniency he alledges from the wont of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99496:29"/>
is the encouragement it must needs give People to sin, when they consider they are not obliged to give an account for their Sins. So (<hi>p.</hi> 6.) <hi>Catholiques commit sin, 'tis true; but call themselves to an account for it by Confession and Submission to their ghostly Fathers. Protestants sin likewise without calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to any such reckoning; because they can make a shift without it.</hi> And again (<hi>p.</hi> 7.) <hi>I pray the Reader to consider whether private Sinners in the Church of</hi> England <hi>do not offend God at a cheaper rate than in the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>since in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>they are bound to some Penance; but in the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>they may confess to their Ministers, and do Penance if they will, or if they will not, they may let it alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath no <hi>Tax</hi> of Sins, nor doth She promise Pardon of Sins upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any external action whatsoever, whether it cost the performer dear or cheap. But she tells her People, according to the Scriptures, that there is no other way to be forgiven our sins, but be heartily turning from them; that a good Life, and sincere Obedience to the Commandments of God through Faith in Christ are the only means to escape Damnation. And that according as every one is certain of the sincerity of his own heart, he may be certain of Heaven, and no otherwise.</p>
            <p>Let us then compare the Doctrine of the two Churches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and let the Reader judge, who teaches the easiest method for Pardon of Sins. Saith the<note place="margin">Si quis ita animo affectus sit ut peccata admissa doleat, simul<expan>

And it will be found that Men do not come to Confession so much to help them to live well for the future, as to ease themselves from the Trouble that the memory of their Sins past create them, and when by Absolution they are eased of the sense of their former Guilt, they are apt to think they may begin on a new score. And hence it often happens, that Men are more negligent after Confession than before. And let never so much care be taken to prevent this abuse<note place="margin">De la Freq.

                  <hi>item part.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 16.</note> which Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> confesses almost Universal: while People believe that the Priest can forgive them their sins, as soon as they are sorry for them, and purpose to forsake them, it is impossible it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. Whereas when a Man is referred to his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the final judge of his own Condition; and told that he damns himself if he be partial. And that no other Sorrow or Repentance for Sin can save him, but such as will in earnest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him to forsake his Sins, and live a good Life. In this case a Man will find it much easier to satisfie the Priest, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Absolution from him; than to satisfie his own Conscience. Nay, after all, the Priest can only judge of a Mans Repentance from his own Mouth, and if the Man be partial, or mistaken in his own sincerity, the Priest must be so too, and his Absolution
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99496:30"/>
insignificant. And therefore our Church, who lays the efficacy of Absolution on the sincerity of the Penitents Contrition and Faith, and tells her People, that her Absolution is only Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, deals more severely, and sincerely too, with her Penitents, than the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who lays the chief stress on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Absolution of the Priest. The Matter of Fact appears to be really thus, from the practice of the lewdest Livers amongstus, who often take Sanctuary in that Church, and without any amendment of Life, live in hopes of that Salvation in her, which they know they could not hope for in ours.</p>
            <p>§ 11. The last Argument Mr. <hi>M.</hi> urges for Confession, is the Interest of the Priest; faith he, <hi>The Church of</hi> England, for want of Confession, <hi>appears to me to have lost that Interest in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of the People, which both the</hi> Roman <hi>and the</hi> Greek <hi>Priests are happy in at this day.</hi> I do believei n my Conscience this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment goes a great way with Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and not only with him, but with all those Priests who value their Interest as he does. But he would have done well to have told us, what that interest is, in which the Priests count themselves happy. For the Priests have counted themselves happy sometimes in an interest, which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted very little to the happiness of the People. In short, we neither do, nor ought to covet any other interest with our People, than the power of doing and making them good; and God be thanked, we have as much of that interest, as any Clergy of the World; and dare compare the Lives of our People, with the Lives of either <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans.</hi> It was therefore some other interest which brought in Auricular Confession, &amp; in which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> would count himself happy. I shall not determine what that may be, which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> could not find in our Church; only he must know, that among us truly mortified, diligent, sober, prudent Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men, who continually reside on their Cures, and shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves an Example to their Flocks in meekness, humility, watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and charity, have no reason to complain that they want interest with their People. But there are some that think it too dear a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase at that rate, and therefore had rather come at it another
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99496:31"/>
way. That is, by perswading people that they can forgive them their Sins, though perhaps they are nothing bettered by Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Thus Mr. <hi>M.</hi> seems to state the case: <hi>What if some Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks are never the better for it? What are many Protestants the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for all the Sermons they hear, and Sacraments they receive? If we confess our Sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our Sins.</hi> What? though we are never the <hi>better for</hi> Confessing. If that be Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s meaning, and he believes himself, he had reason in earnest to change his Church: For he may be sure we have no such Catholick Doctrine.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
            <p>§ 1. MR. <hi>M.</hi> tells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>us, that <hi>the third difficulty</hi> that stuck with him, <hi>was the Answer given by Protestants to that Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Where is that one Holy Catholick Church which we do profess to believe in the two Creeds?</hi> To this he adds several other Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Was there any such Society as one Holy Catholick Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant upon the face of the Earth, when</hi> Cranmer <hi>began his Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What Provinces of the Earth did this Church inhabit? Did</hi> Cranmer <hi>believe himself a Member of it? Who gave him Authority to Reform this one Catholick and Apostolick Church? To set up Altar against Altar,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>To each of these Questions I will give a distinct Answer, and shew how little Reason any one has to make a difficulty of them.</p>
            <p>To the first, <hi>Where is that one Holy Catholick and Apostolick Church which we profess to believe in the two Creeds?</hi> I Answer, not in any one place or Province exclusively to the rest, but in all places where Men professing the Faith of Christ, live under their Lawful Pastors or Spiritual Governors. 'Tis by these two marks we must find the Catholick Church, if we would not mistake the Society of Schismaticks and Hereticks, nay of Heathens for her. Where-ever we find the Faith of Christ, and the Persons professing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99496:31"/>
it, living in submission to their Regular Pastors; there we have found a branch of the Catholick Church; and to that Society we ought to be ready to unite ourselves in this Profession and Submission.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>M.</hi> by his eagerness to have us assign the <hi>ubi, or place where to find this Church,</hi> seems to imagine, that there is some one <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>ubi,</hi> where she is always to be found. At least, that there is some where a Head and Principle of Unity, by union to which, the Society is made one. But we deny any other Head or Principle of unity to this Society, besides Christ Jesus. And we believe, that to assign any such on Earth, is to destroy the very notion of the Catholick Church, and make her as particular as the Jewish Synagogue, out of which no Person or Nation was excluded, so they would turn Proselytes, any more than they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if they will embrace her Faith, and submit to her Government. But the Church is called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, in opposition to such a particular Society; because she consists of many such Societies, which have in every Nation the same Priviledges, which were before peculiar to the Jews. And these particular Churches are intire Bodies in themselves, not made accountable by Christ or his Apostles to any Foreign Church, as to a Head, but only as to a Sister. Neither is the union of these particular Churches into one Catholick Church, an union of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to one visible Head, but an union of Faith and Charity under our visible Head Christ. When therefore Mr. <hi>M.</hi> asks in <hi>what Provinces of the Earth this Church doth inhabit?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, in most Provinces of the World; in more by many than he or his Church will allow. Let him read St. <hi>Augustine</hi> on the 85 <hi>Psalm,</hi> and he will tell him the sin of those that confine the Church to a Province, or corner of the World, to a Sect or Party of Christians.</p>
            <p>§ 2. To this second Question, <hi>Was there any such Society upon the face of the Earth, when</hi> Cranmer <hi>began his Reformation?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, there was, and the several branches of it were dispersed through many Provinces in <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> The Church
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99496:32"/>
of <hi>England</hi> was one branch thereof, such she has continued ever since, and we hope will continue to the end of the World: And therefore he might have spared the labour which he has spent to prove that there <hi>was extant such a Church on the face of the Earth;</hi> since we believe as firmly as he can desire, that according to our Saviour's Prediction, <hi>the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against the</hi> Catholick <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. To this third Question, <hi>Did</hi> Cranmer <hi>believe himself a Member of this Church?</hi> I answer, He did. And being placed by Providence in an eminent station in the Church, and the Care and Government of so considerable a part thereof being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his charge, he found himself obliged by the Laws of God and Man to remove those things he apprehended to be Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Abuses. And if they were really such, who but Mr. <hi>M.</hi> can doubt his Authority do do it in a regular way?</p>
            <p>And therefore to his fourth Question, <hi>Who gave him Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Reform this one Holy Catholick Church, and to set up Altar against Altar?</hi> I answer, No body; he never attempted the one or the other. He never attempted to Reform the Catholick Church, because he had neither Power or Inspection over her. Nor did he ever pretend to make any Law to oblige her. He only endeavoured to cultivate and reform that part of her that was committed to his Care. And he must have lost his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or renounced it, that doth not see that this is the Duty of every Bishop, nay of every Parish-Priest in his sphere; and therefore except Mr. <hi>M.</hi> can shew that <hi>Cranmer</hi> went beyond his sphere, he talks and asks questions to no purpose.</p>
            <p>I suppose that I have already shewn that <hi>Cranmer</hi> did not exceed his Authority in his proceedings at the Reformation. And as he did not pretend to reform the Catholick Church, so neither did he set up Altar against Altar. There was no Schism made by him in <hi>England;</hi> the Division of Communion was made long after, about the Tenth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> on the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> V. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin ad Ann.</hi> 1564. &amp; 1565. <hi>p.</hi> 172.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> seems to have nothing to object against all this;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99496:32"/>
only he insinuates that the Reformation supposes the Catholick Church <hi>to be lapsed into Idolatry: And if she were guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, she should be no Christian Church: And then there is an end of the Episcopal Succession of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and consequently of the Church it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not one step in this Argument, but is justly liable to exception. I shall only desire the Reader to consider these few things, and then judge, whether Mr. <hi>M.</hi> can be supposed to have examined this matter, either diligently or impartially. 1. The Reformation may be justified without charging the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Christian Church with Idolatry. 2. The Idolatry with which we commonly charge that Church, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Being of a Church, or Succession of Bishops. 3. The Argument Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has produced, to prove the Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a Christian Churches teaching and practising <hi>Idolatry,</hi> is weak and inconclusive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. First, The Reformation may be justified without charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Christian Church with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: Because there were many confessed and notorious Abuses in the Church that needed Reformation, besides what we count Idolatrous. And the Governors of the Church were obliged to reform them whether they were Idolatrous or no; except Mr. <hi>M.</hi> thinks that nothing but Idolatry can need Reformation. Prayer in an unknown Tongue, the half Communion, the ludicrous and antique Ceremonies of the Mass, private Masses and Indulgences, Appeals and Foreign Jurisdiction, with many other things were removed by the Reformers; not because they counted them Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, but because they were great Abuses and Deviations from the Primitive Rules and Practice of the Church. The things in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which we commonly charge with Idolatry, are the Worship of Images, the Invocation of Saints, and Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Host: Now the <hi>Reformation</hi> would neither be unjustisia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor unnecessary, <hi>tho</hi> we should reckon these practises only in the same rank of abuses with the former. We need not therefore charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with Idolatry, to justifie our first Reformers.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99496:33"/>
But whatever be said as to that, he may assure himself we never did, nor will charge the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> with any such Crime. She never decreed either worship of Images, or adoration of the Host.</p>
            <p>§ 6. But secondly, the Idolatry with which we charge the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not inconsistent with the being of a Church, or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Bishops. I do consess there is an Idolatry, inconsistent with all true Religion; that is, when Men renounce the true God, and worship a false one in his stead. But there is another Idolatry, that consisteth in worshipping a false God with, or in Subordination to the true. And a third, which Men incurr by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving some part of that honour to a Creature, which God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served sor himself; or asking those things of Creatures, which God only can give: And 'tis with this last the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> stands charged.</p>
            <p>Now not only Doctor <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> whom he confesses he never read, but <note n="*" place="margin">Just. Vindic. <hi>p.</hi> 171.</note> Primate <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> also, (whom he pretends to have seen) have proved that some practice of this kind of Idolatry, as well as some other Sins, may consist with the Being of a Church. But what shall we say to a Man who understands but little himself, and will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to read those who can inform him. Who takes this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>by hear say,</hi> as if it were peculiar to one Author; whereas it is the common sense of our Controvertists. Which I think is a Demonstration, that not withstanding what he pretends (<hi>p.</hi> 1.) he is yet to <hi>begin to study the Controversie between both Churches.</hi> He confesses he did <hi>not understand this matter;</hi> and then let the World judge, whether it was done like a Man who either loved, or designed truth, to write against a thing before he undrstood it.</p>
            <p>§ 7. In order to help his understanding, he would do well to consider, 1. Whether to teach and practice Idolatry, destroy the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Being of a Christian, more then of a Jewish Church. Now it is plain that the Jewish Church both taught and practised Idolatry, and is charged as Idolatrous; 1. When <hi>Aaron</hi> with the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, sacrificed to the Calf: and afterwards, when the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> establish'd Idolatry in the very Temple of God: In which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99496:33"/>
Idolatry the Priests, Prophets, Princes and People concurr'd; as we may see, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 26. and yet neither their succession nor Church fail'd</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. 2. The Primitive Church did not look on all Idolatry as destructive of the Being and Succession of a Church: Because she allowed the Succession of those she counted Idolaters. Such she reckoned the <hi>Arians,</hi> as we may learn from <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nyssen;</hi> and yet the Succession of the <hi>Arians</hi> was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <note n="a" place="margin">Soc. lib. 2. cap. 37.

And if we believe him, <hi>surely that destroys the very Being of a Christian Church.</hi> But neither these Bishops, nor the Church of that Age were of his Mind. And therefore they went on in their Business, and settled their Church without troubling any body to assist them. And though they had no other Ordination or Sacraments, than what they had received from <hi>Arians,</hi> (that is from much worse Idolaters than the Papists are counted) yet no body ever questioned their Church or Succession. But Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and his party, love to cut short God's Church and Inheritance, and seem afraid too many should go to Heaven. And therefore when any thing in a Church doth not please them, they immediately un Church her, and send her Members to Hell: Imitating exactly in this, as they do in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, the Heretical Donatists.

Mr. <hi>M.</hi> is the more inexcusable; because the Argument he brings, to prove the Inconsistency of Idolatry and a Christian Church, is so very trisling and inconclusive. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols, and what concord hath Christ with</hi> Belial? <hi>For ye are the Temple of the Living God; what Communion hath Light with Darkness?</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16. <hi>What! Idolaters, and yet a true Church? 'Tis as much as to say, they are in the way to Heaven and Hell at the same time,</hi> p. 8. In answer to this, I must desire the Reader to look into the place of Scripture here quoted, and observe that the Sentences are broken, and mangled, and transposed; either out of Design, or, as I am apt to think, out of meer thoughtlessness. If he had given it whole, the Reader would easily have perceived its weakness; for it is not only said, <hi>What agreement hath the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God with Idols?</hi> v. 16. but likewise, <hi>What Fellowship hath Righteousness with Unrighteousness?</hi> and, <hi>What Communion hath Light with Darkness?</hi> v. 14. If then, according to Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry destroy the very Being of a Church, because there is no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between the Temple of God and Idols: why shall not every Unrighteousness or Sin destroy likewise the Being of a Church? Since there is no fellowship between Righteousness and Unrighteousness; no communion between Light and Darkness. May not I argue as he doth, <hi>What!</hi> Unrighteousness <hi>and a true Church? 'Tis as much as to say, they are in the way to Heaven and Hell at the same time.</hi> This is the very Argument by which <note n="*" place="margin">Aug. <hi>Tom.</hi> 7. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. contra Literas Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liani.</note> 
               <hi>Petilian</hi> the Donatist endeavoured to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church all other Christians besides his own Sect, and annul all other Baptism besides his own parties: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he pretended they communicated with wicked Men; and there could be no fellowship between Righteousness and Unrighteousness, between Believers and Unbelievers. How then could an Unbeliever regenerate a Believer in Baptism? There is indeed no agreement between Idolatry and a true Church; no more is there between her and any other Sin. But things that have no agreement do not immediately destroy one
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99496:34"/>
another. It doth not follow therefore, that to teach &amp; practice any Sin, destroys the very Being of a true Church. Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft, that is, equal to one of the worst kinds of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; shall therefore every Society of Men, that teaches &amp; practices Rebellion, cease to be a Church? I hope Mr. <hi>M.</hi> will not say it. I do not say any Society of Men ever taught Treason, or Rebellion, or Idolatry to be lawful; for this would indeed un-church them: But many have comanded such practices, &amp; taught them to be lawful, which being put in execution, were really treasonable, rebellious, or idolatrous.

            <p>§ 1. THe third part of Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Pamphlet, consists of a confused mass of particulars, without any order or connexion; one would think it had been taken from the mouth of one who had spoken it <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and had never been allowed the liberty to revise it. There are at least five offers at a conclusion. Saith he,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99496:35"/>
p. 9. <hi>to conclude,</hi> p. 10. <hi>in a word,</hi> p. 11. <hi>in sine,</hi> next paragraph <hi>on the whole matter,</hi> p. 12. after all his concluding, he <hi>must have a word or two before he make an end,</hi> p. 13. he promises to <hi>say no more,</hi> and yet he cannot forbear adding two or three things, nothing to the purpose. Thus he says and unsays, and labours in a heap of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. And when all is done, he puts things in a less advantageous Light, than has been done by many of his Brethren before him. I shall bring what he says, such as it is, into this method. <hi>1st.</hi> I will consider what he says in order to vindicate, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his new Church. And <hi>2ly.</hi> Wherein he criminates ours.</p>
            <p>§ 2. He endeavours to vindicate his new Church in her Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as to the Direction of them: as to their being in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue; and as to their being made before Images. He endeavours to recommend her, from the excellency of her Prayers, and from the Devotion and Unity of her People.</p>
            <p>As to the direction of her Prayers; he tells us, That <hi>instead of Idolatry, he found most elevated and judicious Prayers to the Holy Trinity; concluding in the Name of our Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> p. 9. and he asks, <hi>Do</hi> Roman Catholicks <hi>ever say</hi> Mass <hi>to any other object but the living Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?</hi> p. 12. Now if all the Prayers in the <hi>Mass</hi> be so very <hi>elevated</hi> and <hi>judicious,</hi> and all said to the <hi>Trinity</hi> only; then God forgive <hi>the wickedness of those People who quarrel at this, and persecute it with so blind and furious Aversion.</hi> But soft and fair Mr. <hi>M.</hi> consider they are Hereticks you pray for, and ten to one either do not deserve, or do not need your Charity. For suppose the Prayers in the <hi>Mass</hi> were never so judicious, and never so well directed; yet for ought the People know, or any assurance they have besides the honesty of the Priest, the Prayers may be Conjuring, or Cursing; directed to <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and therefore 'tis your own Fault that people persecute them with so blind and furious Aversion; since you keep the people in that blindness, and will not let them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their Prayers, that they may admire their Judicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>§ 3. But <hi>2ly.</hi> It is to be considered, that the <hi>Mass</hi> was patched
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99496:35"/>
up in a barbarous and ignorant Age, though many of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials are old; and the composition is such, that all, even of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, are not satisfied concerning the Judicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Prayers in it.

               <hi>Cassander</hi> was no <hi>perverse ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured Phanatick,</hi> but a learned and ingenuous <hi>Roman Catholick:</hi> and yet he finds fault with this Prayer Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has produc'd, and others of the like importance in the <hi>Mass;</hi> because they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly used as <hi>Masses</hi> are now celebrated: for these Prayers have respect (as he tells us) to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient custom in the Church now gone out of use; and agree chiefly to a Solemn <hi>Mass,</hi> in which there is supposed to be a Communion and Congregation of the people that have offered Bread and Wine. This Bread and Wine offered by the People, is that <hi>immaculate Sacrifice</hi> offered up by the Priest in the Prayer mentioned by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> And where neither People are present, nor any Offering is made by them, this Prayer, and several others in the <hi>Mass,</hi> make a hard shift to gain the Estimation of either Sence or Truth, much less of Judiciousness. And has given occasion to some, to abuse the <hi>Mass</hi> to Superstition; and to others, to condemn it as Impious. How can a Priest, with either Judgment or Truth, offer a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for all present, as the Prayers direct him to do; even in a solitary <hi>Mass,</hi> when none is present or near him?</p>

               </note> up for the Honour of Saints and Angels, and to obtain of them their Intercession: besides several Prayers made to them for the same purpose, directly contrary to what we learn from Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> to have been the Practice of the ancient Church.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> seems aware of this Objection, and hints at three Answers to it. <hi>1st.</hi> That Presbyterians object as much against that Canticle in the Common-Prayer-Book, called <hi>Benidecite. 2dly.</hi> That the Roman Catholick ascribe nothing to Angels or Saints, but as the Ministers of God And <hi>3dly.</hi> That the Angels must know our affairs, and the Saints have intelligence from them; and therefore we pray to them.</p>
            <p>1. He assures us, That the Reader <hi>shall find Protestants objecting nothing against Consessing, and Praying to Saints and Angels; but what Presbyterians do against that Canticle in the Common-Prayer-Book, called</hi> Benedicite omnia opera. O Ananias, Azarias <hi>and</hi> Misael, <hi>praise ye the Lord, is as rank Popery with Presbyterians, as any thing in the Mass, or Litanies of our Lady,</hi> p. 9. Now except he be able to shew where the Presbyterians have declared this as their sence, we can count him no better than a Slanderer. For my part I do prosess, that I never yet met with one single Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian so silly as to make this Apostrophe for an Invocation <hi>of dead Men, who do not hear us.</hi> The disparity of the case is so manifest between <hi>our</hi> Church and the <hi>Roman,</hi> that it is hardly possible any should mistake. <note n="*" place="margin">Consil.

               <note n="a" place="margin">Article 22.</note> Our Church has declared <hi>Invocation of Saints to be a fond thing, vainly invented.</hi> To parallel therefore the Presbyterian Objection
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99496:36"/>
(if any such there be) against us; with ours against the Papists on this Head, is to shift off an Objection, which did not easily admit of an Answer.</p>
            <p>§ 5. Let us see if this second Answer be any better; which is, that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> attribute nothing <hi>to Angels or Saints, but as the Ministers and Favourites of the Living God, receiving from him whatever understanding they have of our affairs,</hi> p. 12. But what then? May not Men ascribe more to Favourites than the King allows them, and is not that an encroachment on his Prerogative? If Mr. <hi>M.</hi> will shew us, where God allows us to make Prayers to Saints, to erect Images for their Worship, burn Incense before them, dedicate Churches to their Honour, make Vows to them, or devote Orders and Societies of Men as slaves to their Service, he will indeed vindicate his Church against the Reformation: for in possession of all these, the first Reformers found them, and justly concluded it safest to lay them aside, as too much to be allowed Favourites out of our own head, without the express Declaration of the Princes Will. But if he cannot shew that God allows them these things, it will be the safest way, and no hurt for him or us, to lot them alone.</p>
            <p>§ 6. His third Answer or pretence is no less insufficient: where he alledges, that <hi>the Angels must know our affairs, because they are ministring Spirits, sent forth for the good of those who shall be heirs of Salvation; and because they rejoice at the Conversion of sinners: and have glorified Saints no Communication or Intelligence with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</hi> p. 13. To which I answer, That these allegations neither justifie the Invocation, nor the worship of Angels or Saints. It is true, the Angels are ministring Spirits; but we neither know which of them are assigned to minister unto us, nor when they are present. These things depend altogether on the immediate Will of God; and therefore it is to Him not Them we are to apply our selves, if we would obtain their Care and Ministry for our good. 'Tis true likewise, that <hi>the Saints and Angels rejoyce at our Conversion,</hi> when that Conversion comes to their knowledge. But that place in St. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 7. <hi>I say unto you, Joy shall be in Heaven over on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:99496:37"/>
               <hi>that repents, more than over ninety nine just Persons,</hi> doth no more prove that the Angels in Heaven know all the Conversions on Earth, or that we ought to pray to them; than my saying, That there is more joy in <hi>Rome</hi> over one such Proselite as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> than over ninety nine born <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> doth prove that I believe such Conversions are all known there; and that therefore Mr. <hi>M.</hi> may go into his Closet, and pray to the Cardinals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is plain his Affairs are known at <hi>Rome.</hi> Lastly, 'Tis true, that the glorified Saints have Communication with the Angels, and may receive intelligence of our Affairs from them; and therefore I would advise Mr. <hi>M.</hi> to send his Service and Requests to them by the next Angel he meets going that way. But because Angels pass and repass from Heaven to Earth, to conclude that we may at all times, and in all places, with mind and voice pray to Saints, is as foolish, as to conclude, because we have Posts pass from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> that therefore a Man here may beg the assistance of his Friends Prayers who are in <hi>London,</hi> every time he goes to his knees. This is the wise Vindication Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has made for his Church, as to the Direction of some of her Prayers.</p>
            <p>§ 7. The second thing which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> undertakes to vindicate in his Church, is her using a Tongue unknown to the People in all her publick Devotions, and Services. And it happens to him in this, as it does in most other things; if all that he says were granted him, it would neither justifie his Church, nor condemn the Reformation; since not one of his Arguments so much as pretend, to prove a known Tongue unlawful in the publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, or an unknown Tongue expedient: which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the Examination. He alledges therefore, 1. <hi>That the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of its being said in the</hi> Latin <hi>Tongue, allows every one to hear it that understands</hi> Latin. A great favour indeed. Who can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, accuse the <hi>Roman</hi> Church of keeping Men ignorant of her Service? It is plain from our very Objection that they may hear it, if they but understand <hi>Latin;</hi> and 'tis their own fault if they do not understand it: 'Tis only spending seven or eight years to acquire the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, and then they may undestand some
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99496:37"/>
part of her Service. But pray what is this to the illiterate World, who are past the age of learning <hi>Latin?</hi> What is this to the Poor, who are the bulk of the World, and have the best and most pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Title to the Gospel; and yet have neither capacity nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to learn <hi>Latin?</hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> bids them be of good chear: <hi>For unlearned Catholicks, if the truth were known, understand as much or more of the Mass, than illiterate Protestants do of the Common Prayer.</hi> If a Man were apt to give ill words, the confidence and palpable falshood of this Assertion would certainly provoke him. It were better surely to believe <hi>nothing but our Senses,</hi> which he falsly imputes to some Protestants, than to undertake to face down Sense and Experience, in a matter in which the meanest, most illiterate Protestant in the World, will be a Demonstration against him. We are content our People should believe all Mr. <hi>M.</hi> says, according as they find this true. But he objects farther, <hi>What does the Protestant Multitude understand of the Predictions of</hi> Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, &amp;c. <hi>read in their Churches by appointment of the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</hi> Suppose they understood not one word of them: how doth it follow, that unlearned Catholicks understand more of the Mass, than illiterate Protestants do of the Common-Prayer Book? This is a new Instance of Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s old Infirmity, in drawing Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. We are now talking of Common Prayers, in which the People ought to joyn: and he talks of the Lessons, which are no part of them. There are commonly in every Congregation, persons of better and of meaner capacity; 'tis fit both should be instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Those Lessons out of <hi>Isaiah</hi> are for the better capacities, and are read so, as may make them most easie to them. And what great matter, if the weaker, for whom they are not intended, do not understand them, since they are sufficiently provided for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. Their obscurity might be some reason against reading them at all; but if they ought to be read, as is ordered both by the Common-Prayer Book and Breviary, I hope they will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understood in <hi>English</hi> than <hi>Latin:</hi> And yet after all, there is not one Lesson ordered to be read by the Common-Prayer Book, but the meanest of the Protestant Multitude understands more of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99496:38"/>
it, then a whole illiterate Popish Congregation understands of the Breviary, or Mass; and of this he may make an Experiment when he pleases.</p>
            <p>His second Allegation in behalf of his Church is, that she has set forth Expositions of the <hi>Mass</hi> in Print. <hi>How many Evpositions of the Mass</hi> (says he) <hi>are extant in Print by Commandment of the Church? So that no Man can be ignorant of it that desires to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> To this I answer, That if by an Exposition be meant a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of the Mass, there is not one extant in Print by Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Church. On the contrary, the Congregation of the Index have Damned the very hours of the blessed Virgin, for being in the Vulgar Tongue; as may be seen at large in Saint <hi>Amours Journal, Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. There is indeed a Translation stolen out of late in English, but it is without any Authority, which may be called a Commandment of their Church. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if it were set out by her Authority, what could it signifie to the greater part of the People, who are neither able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure nor read that Translation? And if they could read it, yet would no more be able by help of it to joyn with the Priest, then by any other Devotional Book. Lastly, What is this to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which found not one Exposition in Print by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Church, nor any counted necessary? I will venture to put one Question to Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and having askt so many, I hope he will not take it ill. Ought the Mass to be understood by the People, or no? If it ought to be understood, why is not the best method taken to make them understand it; even to read it in a Tongue understood by them? If it matters not, whether it be understood by the People or no; to what purpose doth he talk of an Exposition?</p>
            <p>His third Argument in behalf of the practice of his Church, is taken from the Example of the Jewish Church. <hi>Had not</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Jewish Church almost all her Scriptures and publick Service for fourteen Generations, that is to say, from the Captivity unto Christ in the old Hebrew? A Language not then understood by the the common People.</hi> I Answer, she had some of them in old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99496:38"/>
but not only in it. They were read in the Synagogues, first in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for the use of the Learned; and then in the Vulgar, for the common People. This he might have learnt from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="a" place="margin">Critical History of the Old Testament <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 18 <hi>p.</hi> 123. <hi>London,</hi> 1682.</note>

Et plenius ad Iterat. p. Simonis obj.

'Tis probable, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> had respect to this custom among the Jews, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Prophet that spake with Tongues <hi>to keep silence in the Church, if</hi> there was <hi>no Interpreter,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 28. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has quite mistaken his Argument, when he asks, <hi>Did our Saviour or his Apostles ever reprehend the Jews—for not translating the Scripture into the vulgar Language?</hi> There was no ground for such a Reprehension, since the Jews had done it three hundred years before; &amp; therefore will rise up in Judgment against the absurd practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, &amp; will condemn her; who is more unkind to her Subjects than the very Jews, &amp; has provided worse for their Edisication in this point. It is to no purpose to say as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> doth, that the <hi>Latine is more vulgar than the English:</hi> Since this is a manifest falshood, and must be owned to be such, by all men who consider that the <hi>Latine</hi> is not vulgar in any place of the World.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell whether I can call it a fourth Argument which offers, in these words, <hi>If the Service of God must be said in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal tongue of every Nation, where shall an English man in</hi> France <hi>or</hi> Spain, <hi>that understands not the language, go to serve God on the Lords day?</hi> I answer, To Church, and joyn his presence and private Devotion with the Congregation; since he cannot joyn in the publick Prayers. In case of necessity, a man is accepted by God according to what he can do; and what is not in his power, is not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99496:39"/>
required of him. In a Country where there are no Christians, he must go no where; and in a strange Country, he must go to the publick Devotions, though he do no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> understand them: For that is better then not going at all.</p>
            <p>His last Argument for the vindication of the publick Service of the Church in an unknown Tongue is, <hi>That this would destroy all Community of Sacraments and Lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rgie, between the Members of the Catholick Church; which being one Body or Society of Men, cannot be like the Builders of</hi> Babel, <hi>who could not understand one anothers Language.</hi> Now if they that understand not one anothers language are Builders of <hi>Babel;</hi> then the Priest and People, where the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is in an unknown Tongue, are plainly such Builders: For they do not understand one another. Two Cities may very well be Built, and conveniently Governed by two People of different Languages; and these Cities may likewise manage all their common Business, and keep a good Correspondence, by the help of a few Men that understand both Languages. But two Languages in the same City is very inconvenient, and cannot be so remedied, It is so in the Church: Distant Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations may have a very good Communion with one another by the help of their Priests who understand a common Language: But to have a Language spoken to a Congregation, or in it, that the Members cannot understand, is to bring in a great confusion, and directly opposite to the Apostles command, which he himself here produces, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16. that we should <hi>with one mind and mouth glorifie God:</hi> For how can a Congregation glorifie God with one mouth, if they do not understand the words in which they are to joyn? Thus Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s. Arguments constantly make against himself. If want of a common Language destroys unity of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Liturgy, in distant Churches, it destroys that unity much more where there is wanting a common Language between the Priest &amp; People in the same Church. But the truth is, the unity of the Sacraments and Liturgies, have no dependency on the unity of Language; but are the same in whatever language they are used or administred. And so it was in the Primitive Church, where every
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99496:39"/>
People had their own Liturgy in their own Language. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> foresaw that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. would be objected against him: And he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 11. <hi>That he humbly thinks it not well understood by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</hi> This is a main point; and one would have expected a substantial Reason for his Opinion, some Determination of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Council, or a whole shoal of Fathers at least: But instead of that, he pretends to cut the throat of the Objection out of that very Chapter, in which Protestants glory. <hi>If any be Ignorant</hi> (saith he) <hi>let him be Ignorant. Wherefore Brethren, covet to Prophesie, and forbid not to speak with Tongues,</hi> v. 39. <hi>God is not the Author of Confusion but Peace,</hi> v. 33. I shall not trouble the Reader with an Answer to these Arguments; if Mr. <hi>M.</hi> designed in earnest to prove by them, that we do not well understand the Apostle in this Chapter, I would advise him to take the Opinion of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, whether all be right about his Head.</p>
            <p>§ 8. The third thing wherein Mr. <hi>M.</hi> endeavours to vindicate his Church is the Worship of Images. And to this purpose he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, First, <hi>That the Council of</hi> Trent hath commanded <hi>all Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition to be taken away in the use of Images; and then gives it in charge to all Bishops to look to it,</hi> p. 12. If they had reckoned the Worship of Images Superstition, this had indeed taken away our Objection, but on the contrary; the Council decreed that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <hi>of Christ, not of his Human Nature,</hi> (as he improperly expresses it) and likewise of the Blessed Virgin, and other Saints, are to be had and retained, especially in Churches, and due Honour and Worship is to be paid them. And that we ought to kiss, uncover our Heads, and fall prostrate before them.</p>
            <p>§ 9. But then, Secondly, He bids us <hi>enquire whether Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks pay any more respect to them, than Protestants do to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine, which (say they) are but a Figure or Image of Christs Body and Blood.</hi> To which I answer, That this Enquiry supposes two notorious Falshoods: First, That Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants pay any other respects to the Elements of Bread and Wine, then that of not diverting them from their Sacramental use. And Secondly, That they say the Elements <hi>are but a Figure or Image of</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:99496:40"/>
               <hi>Christs Body and Blood.</hi> Our Curch having declared in her Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick after the Communion, that the kneeling at the Reception of the Sacrament, is only to Christ; and that <hi>no Adoration is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or ought to be done unto the Sacramental Bread and Wine:</hi> and likewise concerning the Elements, that they are not <hi>only Signs</hi> or <hi>Images,</hi> but <hi>effectual means</hi> of conveying <hi>the Body and Blood of Christ to the Faithful.</hi> Which I hope no <hi>Papist</hi> will say of his Images. And now I must refer it to the Reader, whether he will suppose Mr. <hi>M.</hi> to have been ignorant of our Doctrine in this point, or to have knowingly, and against his Conscience, suggested these falshoods.</p>
            <p>§ 10. His third attempt for the Defence of his Church in this Practice, is from his old Friends the Presbyterians. <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>Protestants are every jot as offensive to us</hi> (say the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>) <hi>kneeling before the Elements of Bread and Wine, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists kneeling before the Image of Christ.</hi> To which I answer, That if the Matter of Fact here alledged, were true, (which I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,) yet it were no Argument; because the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or whosoever are thus offended, are manifestly unreasonable in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleling these two cases. The Disparity is apparent, and the very same that there is between receiving a Pardon, or any other signal Favour from the Kings own Hand on my knees; and falling down every time I see his Pictuure on a Sign-post.</p>
            <p>But once for all, let Mr. <hi>M.</hi> know, (for he professes to need Information,) that it is is no Anwer to an Argument, to pretend that others urge it against the Proponents themselves; except the Answerer shew that both urge it with equal Reason. For so the Apostles might have been answered by a Heathen. You would perswade us, that we are under the <hi>Power of Satan,</hi> and <hi>Aliens to the Life of God:</hi> Do not the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> say the same of you? Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence them, and we will believe you. So a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> may be answered by an <hi>Indian,</hi> You would have us renounce our Idols and Heroes; whereas there is a People amongst yourselves, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Protestants,</hi> to whom your <hi>kneeling before the Images of Christ,</hi> and praying to Saints, <hi>are every jot as offensive</hi> as our praying to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99496:40"/>
our subordinate Celestial Powers and Kneeling before their Images. If this would signifie nothing to Mr <hi>M.</hi> why should it signifie any thing to us what Presbyterians object against our Kneeling at the Reception of the Sacrament? or how are we concerned, what <hi>they pretended in</hi> 41, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Reformation, or <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> in 47, against theirs? except he will undertake to justifie their Pretences, which is a Task themselves could never perform.</p>
            <p>§ 11. There is onely one thing more he says in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Church; and that <hi>concerns the ill Practices</hi> we charge on <hi>some</hi> Roman Catholicks, and <hi>the ill Opinions of others.</hi> He doth not deny that there are some such, but <hi>he looks on it as no Argument at all.</hi> If so, he wrote his Book to very little purpose; for why are we more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ill Practices or ill Opinions of some who pretend to Reform, than he is in the ill Practices and Opinions of the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome?</hi> Yet these pretended faults of the Reformers, make up the greatest part of what he Objects against our Church; which shews that he has one Rule for us, and another for his own Party. But the truth is, we charge the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it self with some <hi>ill Practices and Opinions.</hi> For thô we take <hi>Popery</hi> as the most judicious Papists <hi>represent it;</hi> (and they who bring the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> nearest to Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, I find are at present counted such) yet still there needs better Vouchers than Mr <hi>M.</hi> to make us believe all things in it <hi>Judicious and Pious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 12. Having thus examined all that he has said in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Church, let us next consider what he has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to recommend Her: And of this nature he produces three instances: The Excellency of her Books of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Devotion of her People; and the Unity of her Members. He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 9. that, <hi>that which obliged him most of all to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>was the perusal of her Books of Devotion; such as St.</hi> Francis Sales—Neirem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergius
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99496:41"/>
—Lewis Granatensis—<hi>especially the Mass it self.</hi> If these obliged him most of all, had he lived at the Reformation, he had wanted some of the strongest obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to keep him in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion; three of these four he mentions being written after the Reformation, and the other but a few years before. And now they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he was not debarred the use of them in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which he lived. The Spirit of the Reformation, which he says he compared without prejudice, with the Spirit of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, allowing the use of all Books that may advance Piety, by whomsoever they are written, which the Spirit of his Church doth not: But what is this to the Reformation, which did not find, much less condemn these Books? Let him shew one Book of Devotion, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Mass, or Breviary, extant in <hi>English</hi> before the Reformation, if he can; and remember what has been done since, to the eternal shame of those, who never troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themselves with Devotion, till meer necessity of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their interest among the People put them on it. As for the Piety of the Prayers in the Mass, let him who understands, both compare any Prayer <hi>there</hi> with our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> and 'tis hardly possible Prejudice should so blind him, as not to see which has the advantage.</p>
            <p>§ 13. But, nevertheless, he alledges, that the Devotion of their People exceeds ours. <hi>Let the Reader compare that Devotion which Catholics pay to the Sacrifice of the Mass, with that which most Protestants shew to the Common-Prayer, and then see how much better we are by Reforming the Mass into</hi> English, <hi>p.</hi> 11. To which I answer, That if it were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Papists appear to be more devote at Mass, than Protestants at Church (for that I suppose he means by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Devotion to the <hi>Mass,</hi> and shewing it to the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>) yet it would not follow that the Mass were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Common-Prayer, or a fitter means of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; since that difference might arise from other motives,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99496:41"/>
as it manifestly doth. The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics place much more Religion in outward shew, than the Protestants, and therefore no wonder if they be more diligent in it.</p>
            <p>2. If the appearance of Devotion at publick Service be an Argument of the goodness of the Service, the <hi>Turks</hi> who out do the generality of Christians in frequency, seeming Devotion, and Reverence at their Prayers, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Travellers, must be concluded to have the best Service: and he would do ill on Mr <hi>M.</hi>'s Principles that would Reform the <hi>Alcoran</hi> into the <hi>Mass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The matter of Fact is not true, as I am informed by those that have seen their Communicants and ours. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants have according to Mr <hi>M.</hi>'s desire, compared the Devotions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in a Discourse designed for that very purpose, and Printed, <hi>London,</hi> 1685: In which it is shewn, <hi>That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Romanists pretend, there is not so true Devotion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, nor such rational provision for it, nor encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, as in the Church established by Law among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It is not material what their Devotions appear to be, if their Lives are not better than ours, which I am sure they are not. Open Prophaneness is hardly more provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to God, than shew of Devotion without proportional Sanctity of Life, as we learn from the Case of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. and in many other places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>§ 14. The third thing whereby he endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend his Church, is the Unity of her Members: <hi>In the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>he shall find variety of Religious Orders, but no Schism, nor Discord about their Sacraments or Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: In the Garment of the Church, there is Variety, but no Rent: No confusion of Sects, nor Disobedience to Superios.</hi> p. 14. If this be true, she is the happiest Church that ever was in the World; much happier than the Church of the Apostles time: for there were Schisms and Discords about Sacraments and Liturgy in her. Witness the Apostle, 1
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99496:42"/>
               <hi>Corin.</hi> 1. 11. also 11. 18. Nay, there was Disobedience too, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. It is therefore strange we should be able to find none in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> May we not rather conclude that Mr <hi>M.</hi> has either partially, or negligently sought for these Schisms and Discords? Since really there has hardly been greater Schisms and Discords in any Church than in her, thô he affirms we shall find none. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>this, would not think God had forgotten his Church?</hi> Behold the Mission of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops, and their Unity. And if notwithstanding these Schisms and Intrusions, which continued for many years, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a true Church, and her Ordinations valid; let the Reader judge, what there is so Horrid or Irregular in our Reformation, that should void our Orders, or make us cease to be a Church.</p>
            <p>§ 15. I suppose Mr. <hi>M.</hi> counts Confirmation another Sacrament; and there have been no less discords about it of late in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The Regulars of <hi>England</hi> on one side, and the Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> with the <hi>Sorborn</hi> on the other. And <hi>those of each party charge the other with Heresie, not without the disturbance of the publick Peace, and a rent of brotherly Charity.</hi> So the Congregation of the <hi>Index</hi> tells us: which Congregation made a Decree to suppress the Writings of both Parties, <hi>May</hi> 19. 1633. And here we do not find that <hi>Obedience to Superiors</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> boasts: for immediately there came out at <hi>Paris</hi> a Disquisition against the Decree, the Jesuits Reply, and the Bishops of <hi>France</hi> renew their Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Censure, <hi>Nov.</hi> 29. 1643. and I do not find that they are yet agreed. Mr. <hi>M</hi> affirms we shall find <hi>no Rent,</hi> no <hi>Confusion of Sects, no Disobedience to Superiors</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But whosoever will read the Decrees and passages about this matter, in St. <hi>Amours</hi>'s Collection at the end of his <hi>Journal, p</hi> 26. or in <hi>Petrus Aurelius</hi>'s <hi>Vindiciae Censurae,</hi> will find a great rent of brotherly Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, much Confusion, and great Disobedience in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing Parties; and these about no less things, <hi>than the Sacrament of Confirmation, the Hierarchy of the Church, and Supremacy of St.</hi> Peter.</p>
            <p>§ 16. Confession is no less a Sacrament with Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and the Disputes in his Church have of late been as high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, as about the former; one Party charging the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99496:43"/>
with no less than Heresie: as may be seen at large in the Bishops of <hi>France</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Innocent</hi> the X. at the end of Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s Book of Frequent Communion. If their publick Acts are to be believed, there are Rents, <hi>Scissurae fraternae Charitatis</hi> in their Church. But if we believe Mr. <hi>M.</hi> there is no Rent, <hi>Scissura non est.</hi> I shall say nothing of the Dispute concerning the Regale in <hi>France</hi> at this day; I need not put him in mind of what Obedincee has been paid to the Pope, or to his Excommunications of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> and Regalists. He may see the whole in a Book intitled, <hi>Regale Sacerdotum,</hi> 1684. I do not see but the King and Church of <hi>France</hi> make themselves <hi>Judge, Witness,</hi> and <hi>Accuser</hi> in this Affair with the Pope, as much as <hi>Henry</hi> VIII<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>English</hi> Church did.</p>
            <p>§ 17. This is all that Mr. <hi>M.</hi> seems to say, either to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate or recommend his Church. Let us see next what he objects against ours. And in all this last part I can find only three things of this nature: One is <hi>P.</hi> 10. That <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>is beholding to the Mass for the best Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in her Communion Service.</hi> The second is, that <hi>the Protestant Church has no other Foundation, than every man's Reason.</hi> And the third is, That we do not pay a due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Church. As to the first of these, I suspect the chief reason, why some of his Party object the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Service, being taken out of the Mass; is not that they think it any fault if it were; but because they bel eve it may gratifie and incense their Friends, the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, against the publick Service of the Church. But I answer, That the Model of our Service, and Materials thereof, are not taken out of the Mass, but out of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Liturgies of the Church, to which it is much more conformable than to the Mass.</p>
            <p>§ 18. The second Objection he brings against our Church is, That she hath no sufficient Foundation: P. 11, <hi>I desire to be informed whether the Protestant Church had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:99496:43"/>
               <hi>other Foundation (setting aside an Act of Parliament) than every Man's own Reason; or which is the same thing, the Scriptures Interpreted by every Man's Reason? There are but two Bases whereupon to settle our selves, the Scriptures and Fathers expounded by my own Reason; or the Scriptures and Fathers expounded by the voice of the present visible Church. This later is Popish, and cannot support a Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fabrick.</hi> In answer to this, I will shew, first, in what Sence every Man's Reason, may be said to be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church. Secondly, That our Church has trusted her Reason in the expounding Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, no farther than she ought to have done. And Thirdly, That she has not Expounded them so as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the sence of the present visible Church.</p>
            <p>First therefore, When Mr. <hi>M.</hi> alledges that our Church has no other Foundation than every Man's Reason, he may mean that she has no other Foundation for her Religion, than what natural Reason, without the assistance of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and other helps God has afforded her, doth sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest. And this is a manifest Calumny, because she has, besides what natural Reason of it self suggests, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Fathers, the universal Tradition of all Ages past, and present, for every Article of her Faith. Let him shew one Article that wants any one of these, and we will strike it out of our Creeds; or any other Article that has this testimony for its necessity, and it shall be inserted.</p>
            <p>There may be another sence of these words, The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church has no other Foundation than every man's Reason: and 'tis this, The Protestants make use of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faculties, to find out the sence of Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of the former and present Church, but their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Senses: and consequently rely on them with God's assistance, to find out the true Religion and Church. This Sence we allow, and except Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and his Party, will shew us some other faculties, given us by God, whereby we
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99496:44"/>
may choose our Religion; they ought not to blame us for using these only. When they find out another faculty of the Soul, besides these two, whereby we may distinguish Truth from Falshood, we promise them to use it also. And though Mr. <hi>M.</hi> confesses his <hi>own Reason, to be as weak as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body can think it</hi> and pretends <hi>not to assert it, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church:</hi> yet, till he tells us by what faculties he judges himself obliged to submit to the Authority of the Church, and by what faculties he comes to know that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is she, to whose Authority he ought to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; we must tell him, that the Authority of his Church, as to him, is founded meerly and solely on his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, how weak soever he own it. And so must the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of every Church, to every man in the World. And therefore it is foolish to object, That the Protestant Church has no other Foundation than every Man's Reason and Sences; for no Church, no not Christianity, has or can have any other.</p>
            <p>§ 19. But Secondly, Perhaps Mr. <hi>M.</hi> means only that we do not allow the voice of the present visible Church a due regard in our Determination, concerning Faith and Religion. In Answer to which, in the second place, I say, our Church trusted her reason no further in expounding Scripture than she ought to have done. And here it is to be remembred, that she is a compleat Church, associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated together in one intire Ecclesiastical Body, with full power to Interpret and Teach her Subjects, all things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Faith and Discipline: As these Kingdoms are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Common-wealth, associated into one civil Body, with full power to Interpret and Enact all things relating to the Law of Nature, and the Civil Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. As therefore these Kingdoms do not trust their Reason too far, when they determine concerning the Laws of Nature without Appeal; so neither did our Church trust her Reason too far, when she determined without
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99496:44"/>
Appeal, concerning matters relating to Faith. And there is no more inconvenience can befal her Subjects, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her this power in this case, than can befal them, by allowing their Civil Majestrates the like power in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>§ 20. And third, to shew that she did not intend to contradict the general voice of the visible Church, with which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> seems to charge her; she was content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all difference between her and her Neighbour Churches, to the Arbitration of a general Council, even of the <hi>West.</hi> And to this she Appealed, when the Pope pretended to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate her. And not only she, but other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches did the same. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conscious, that the general Voice and Sense of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, was against her Usurpation, durst not stand this Tryal; but without any Authority from God, or the visible Church (if we understand by that the general Body of Christians) took on her self to be <hi>Judge, Witness, and Accuser.</hi> Which was more than <hi>Luther</hi> did; for he referred himself, and Appealed to a general Council.</p>
            <p>§ 21. The third Objection Mr. <hi>M.</hi> alledges against the Reformers, is, their not yielding a due Submission to the Church. For after all his clamour against Reason, he allows us to <hi>make use</hi> of it <hi>with Submission;</hi> he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed his meaning in this, so as it is not easie to guess, whether he means by submitting our reason, an intire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation of it, to beleive whatsoever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by a Priest, or a Council tells us, and then the only use of reason will be to find out Arguments to defend what she has taught us; or whether by Submission he means only a due regard to her Determinations, so that a Man of her Communion shall not allow himself publickly to oppose and contradict her Doctrine. This last he seems to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by Submission; because he opposes it to <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Petulancy.</hi> And then why is not this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99496:45"/>
due as much to the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> as <hi>Rome?</hi> Did not Christ say to the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland, He that hears you hears me;</hi> as well at to the Bishop of <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 22. But to clear this matter a little, I will shew that we pay all due Submission to the Church. And, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Examine what Submission Mr <hi>M.</hi> has paid her. When we talk of Submission to the Church, by the Church may be meant either the Universal Church, or the Particular Church wherein we were Born, Baptized, and Educated: and to both these we profess and pay due Submission. Witness of the Doctrine of Christ, and we receive her Testimony. The onely Question with us is, What Doctrine Christ and his Apostles Taught? And this we believe contained in the Scriptures. Concerning the Sence of any Word in them, we receive likewise the Testimony of the Catholick Church. Every Doctor approved by her, is a Witness, and every Council recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by her, is as the Deposition of Witnesses. By this means we know her Sence in former Ages, as well as in this Age, and are able to compare them together. Where these agree, we have no reason to doubt her Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity; but where one Age of her says one thing, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Age says another thing; we count our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no obligation to believe either of their Testimonies to be a necessary part of the Doctrine of Christ. 'Tis therefore the Church of all Ages, and places, that we reckon the <hi>Ground and Pillar of Truth.</hi> Whereas Mr <hi>M.</hi> con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ines us to the Visible Church, and pretends we are to take the Sence of all former Ages, from the present. But pray why may not I as well understand the Sence of the Church of the fourth Age from the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as I can understand the Sence of the last Age from the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> It was therefore by this Rule, and with Submission to his Church, that our Reformers
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99496:45"/>
proceeded in their Reformation: and except Mr <hi>M.</hi> can shew (which he has not so much as endeavoured to do) that they deviated from this Rule, he has done nothing to prove that they had not a due Deference and Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Catholick Church. And as she thus submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Sence of the Universal Church, so she requires all her Subjects to submit to her, to receive the Faith, to which she, with the Catholick Church, bears Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to own her Laws of Discipline, submit to her Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and conform to her Constitutions. But she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to no Dominion over mens Faith, or to oblige them to believe any thing, because she has decreed it: Her Authority is to propose as a Witness, not to define as a Judge. If any one dissent from her, he must not make a Schism, or turn Preacher in contradiction to her Authority: If any one be otherwise minded, he must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Apostle's Rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. he must conform as far as he can, and yield a Passive Obedience to her Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, where he cannot give an Active to her Commands. While he walks by this Rule, he can neither be a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick nor Heretick; and may expect, if he use due means, that God will either reveal to him what he wants, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his Errour if he mistake.</p>
            <p>§ 23. This Submission is coherent even with <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Principles: And though I am not concerned for any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Divine, yet since Mr <hi>M.</hi> has troubled us with so few Quotations, I will pay him so much Respect as to take notice of this; and the Reader may from it learn how faithfully he Transcribes and <hi>Englisheth</hi> his Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

            <p>§ 24. Let us now take a view of his Submission to the Church. 1. For the Catholick Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the liberty to cut off from her, what Members he thought fit; and has reduced her to a fourth part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: He has obtruded Articles of Faith on her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which she never gave Testimony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and has subjected her to a Head at <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom God never subjected her; that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He has created a Catholick Church out of his own head, and rejected that of Christ's Planting.</p>
            <p>2. As for the Particular Church, which made him a Member of Christ by Baptism, this his spiritual Mother, he has pronounced a Harlot, and her Children <hi>By-blows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> He has condemned <hi>her Sacraments,</hi> degraded <hi>her Bishops,</hi> to whom he sware Obedience, renounced <hi>her Orders,</hi> and given her the Title of an <hi>unsanctified Nation.</hi> In short, as far as lay in his Power, he has exposed the Nackedness of his Mother. Behold the <hi>Petulancy and Contradiction</hi> of an undutiful Son. But thanks be to God, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his feeble Attempts, <hi>Her Bow abides in strength, and the Arms of her Hands are made strong, by the Hands of the Mighty God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 24.</p>
