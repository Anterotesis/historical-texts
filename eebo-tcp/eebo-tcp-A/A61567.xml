            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
To Mr. G.
Giving a True Account of a Late
CONFERENCE
At the D. of P.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was very much surprised at the sight of several
Copies you have given out of the Conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us at my House in <hi>Ianuary</hi> last. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
you took great care in the Conference it self
to keep me from expecting any great Ingenuity from
you after it; yet I could hardly believe you would
have ventured so far as to have given out such false
and imperfect Copies of what past as all those have
been which came to my hands, and were all said
to be dispersed by you. You know very well that
the Gentleman who wrote for you never read his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55950:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Papers in the Conclusion, that we might judge how fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he had represented both sides: and when they were
neither Read, nor Compared, nor Signed as they ought
to have been, with what Ingenuity can these be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
through so many hands for true and Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Copies? At least you ought to have sent them
to me and to have answered my Objections against
them before you had read them in <hi>Coffee-houses,</hi> and
made such Descants upon them in places where you
were sure I would not be present to contradict you.
But when nothing was done to make your Copy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be good, they must be of very easie faith
and understanding who would take your word in this
matter, without so much as any <hi>Motives of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hear you made great boasts of your Victory
after the Conference, which I onely smiled at, and
thought you hoped to make your self considerable
by your Vanity. If you gain no greater Victories,
you will very little increase the Number of your
Converts: For the Gentleman for whose sake the
Conference was, declared immediately after it, <hi>that
he was much more confirmed in the Communion of
our Church by it, and resolved to continue in it;</hi>
which he hath since repeated several times to me.
But of all the Persons of your Church, I have yet
met with, you had least Reason to go away with the
boast of a Victory.</p>
            <p>For I pray call but to mind how the Conference
ended, and I think you will be ashamed of your
boasting. When you came to your Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Infallibility in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
came to this in short, <hi>That all Traditionary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55950:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
believe the same to day which they did ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday,
and so up to the time of our Blessed Saviour
and if they follow this Rule they can never err in
faith, therefore are infallible; And you proved they
could not innovate in Faith unless they did forget what
they held the day before, or out of malice alter it;</hi>
I thought the best way to shew the Vanity of this
rare Demonstration was to produce an Instance of such
as followed Tradition and yet you could not deny to
have erred, and that was of the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> which
went <hi>upon Tradition from Father to Son,</hi> as much
as ever the <hi>Roman</hi> did: And I desired to know of
you whether the <hi>Greek Church</hi> notwithstanding did
not err in matters of Faith; And if it did, then a
Church holding to Tradition was not infallible.
Your answer was, <hi>That the Greek Church followed
Tradition, till the Arians left that Rule and took up
a new one,</hi> i. e. <hi>Scripture privately interpreted.</hi> I
told you I did not mean the <hi>Arians,</hi> but the present
<hi>Greek Church</hi> (which you charge with Heresie) and
yet they follow Tradition from Father to Son. This
I was forced to repeat over and over, but no answer
could I get from you, but you still ran back to the
<hi>Arians,</hi> and compared them and the <hi>Calvinists,</hi>
which I told you was not at all to the purpose; for
I insisted upon the present <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and so you
rose up in a heat, and endeavoured to keep those
who wrote from setting down this last part as it
ought to have been.</p>
            <p>In the Papers dispersed by you, you make me
barely put the question, <hi>Whether the Greek Church
did follow Tradition from Father to Son in matters
of Faith, or no?</hi> But do not mention the Inference
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55950:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I drew from it, and which is set down in the
Original Paper that was read aloud and approved
by both parties, <hi>That if the Greek Church followed
Tradition,</hi> which is undeniably true, and is granted
by your self in your Answer, <hi>then a Church holding
to Tradition as its Rule may err in matters of Faith,</hi>
which unavoidably overthrows your pretended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.
For you cannot make an evasion, by
saying, <hi>That though the Greek Church once adhered to
Tradition, yet in the Time of Arianism it left that Rule
and took up another, and so ever since fell into errour
as the Calvinists did;</hi> for that is apparently false as
to the present <hi>Greek Church</hi> (of which I spake) as is
known to every one that knows any thing of the
<hi>Greek Church,</hi> which in all its differences with the
<hi>Roman Church</hi> as to the <hi>Procession of the Holy Ghost,
the Pope's Supremacy, Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c. still pleaded
Tradition and adhered to it. Neither is so much of
your Answer true, as that even the <hi>Arians went off
from the Rule of Tradition,</hi> for they insisted on it,
and <hi>Petavius</hi> thinks they had good Reason for it.
But however I said my Instance was not about them,
but the present <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and this I do affirm,
you gave no Answer at all to.</p>
            <p>I know what Arts have been used to get Mr. <hi>T.</hi>
to approve your Copy: I have not seen what he
wrote, and I desired him to bring the Gentleman
to me who wrote for you, that we might compare
ours together, but word was left with my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<hi>that he was not well.</hi> But suppose he should
now correct his Copy, this will be too late for
my Vindication, since so many imperfect ones
have been given out and dispersed, not onely here
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55950:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in Town, but over several parts of the Nation.
And therefore I am <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to take this way to
put a stop to such dis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ceeding. I hear
Mr. <hi>M.</hi> pretends <hi>that I gave but false Copies,</hi> which
is so far from being true, that I was often solicited
on the account of your Papers, before I let one be
seen, and then it was onely to correct the Errours
of yours. And mine was taken by a Person of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as well as Integrity, who was present at the
whole Conference and very well understood the
whole matter. But because your Writer's Copy
was not then read, and none signed, I desire you
now to make good these two things, which the
whole Conference depended upon.</p>
            <p>(1.) That we have no <hi>absolute Certainty</hi> as to
the Rule of our Faith, <hi>viz. the Scripture;</hi> although
we have a larger and firmer <hi>Tradition</hi> for it, <hi>viz.
the Consent of all Christian Churches,</hi> than you can
have for the Points of Faith in difference between us.</p>
            <p>(2.) That the Tradition from Father to Son is an
infallible conveyance of matters of Faith, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the <hi>Greek Church</hi> is charged by you with
Errour, which adhered to Tradition.</p>
            <p>If you give a satisfactory Account of these two
things, you will acquit your self much better than by
boasting in <hi>Coffee-houses,</hi> and dispersing such Copies
of Conferences. If you decline giving an Answer to
this just and necessary Vindication of my self, the World
will easily see on whose side the Victory lay; but I
confess I did not think it worth <hi>boasting of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55950:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If you are really such a man at <hi>Controversie,</hi> as I
hear you would be taken for, I offer you a fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to shew your self: and I do promise by
God's Assistance to return an Answer to you in such a
manner, as will be least liable to the Injury of <hi>False
Copies.</hi>
