            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <l>And with what scorn you use to vex</l>
                        <l>Poor hearts that humbly sue;</l>

                        <l>The happy Lover sure should gain</l>
                        <l>A Paradise within:</l>
                        <l>I thought Loves plagues, like Dragons sate,</l>

                        <l>What happy Lovers prove;</l>
                        <l>For I could kiss, and sport, and toy,</l>
                        <l>And taste those sweets of love;</l>
                        <l>Which had they but a lasting state,</l>

                           <hi>love</hi> were too mean a guest.</l>

                        <l>By every sparkle made a sacrifice.</l>
                        <l>Each wanton eye now kindles my desire,</l>
                        <l>And that is free to all that was entire:</l>

                        <l>And now my wandring thoughts are not confind</l>
                        <l>Vnto one woman, but to woman-kind;</l>

                        <l>I choose there by the kernell not the rind:</l>
                        <l>And so I hope since my first hopes are gone,</l>
                        <l>To find in many what I lost in one;</l>
                        <l>And like to Merchants after some great loss,</l>

                        <l>But being crack't, or broken, there are shown</l>
                        <l>Many half faces, which at first were one;</l>
                        <l>So love unto my heart did first prefer</l>
                        <l>Her Image, and there planted none but her,</l>
                        <l>But since 'twas broke and martyr'd by her scorn,</l>
                        <l>Many less faces in her face are born;</l>

                        <p>THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SCAENE.</p>
                        <p>THe first thing that presented it selfe to the sight, was a rich Ornament that enclosed the Scaene; in the upper part of which were great branches of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iage growing out of leaves and huskes, with a Coronice at the top; and in the midst was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a large Compartiment composed of Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesk work, wherein were Harpies with Wings and Lyons clawes, and their hinder parts converted into leaves and branches; over all was a broken Frontispice, wrought with krowles and masque heads of Children, and within this a Table adorn'd with a lesser Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiment, with this Inscription, <hi>COELVM BRITANNICVM.</hi> The two sides of this Ornament were thus ordered: First, from the ground arose a square Basement, and on the Plinth stood a great vaze of gold, richly encha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and beautified with Sculptures of great Releine, with frutages hanging from the upper-part; At the foot of this sate two youths naked, in their naturall colours, each of these with one arme supported the Vaze, on the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of which stood two young women in Draperies, arme in arme, the one figuring the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54460:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
glory of Princes, and the other Mansuetude: their other armes bore up an Ovall, in which, to the Kings Majesty was this Imprese, A Lyon with an Imperiall Crown on his head; the word, <hi>Animum subpectore forti</hi>: On the other side was the like Composition, but the designe of the Figures va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and in the Ovall on the top, being borne up by Nobility and Fecundity, was this Imprese to the Queenes Majesty, A Lilly growing with bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and leaves, and three lesser Lillies springing out of the Stem; the word, <hi>Semper inclita Virtus</hi>: Al this Ornament was heightned with Gold, and for the Invention, and various composition was the newest and most gracious that hath beene done in this place.</p>
                        <p>The Curtaine was watcher, and a pale yellow in panes, which flying up on the sudden, discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Scaene, representing old Arches, old Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, decayed wals, parts of Temples, Theaters, Basilica's and Thermes with confused heaps of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Columnes, Bases, Coronices and Statues, lying as under-ground, and altogether resembling the ruines of some great Citie of the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans or civiliz'd Britains. This strange prospect detain'd the eyes of the Spectators sometime, when to a loud Musick <hi>Mercury</hi> descends; on the upper part of his Chariot stands a Cock in action of crowing: his habit was a Coat of flame colour girt to him, and a white Mantle trimm'd with gold and silver; upon his head a wreath with small fals of white Feathers, a Caduseus in his hand, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54460:89"/>
wings at his heels: being come to the ground he dismounts, and goés up to the State.</p>

My name is <hi>Momus ap-Somnus-ap-Erebus-ap-Chaos-ap-Demorgorgon-ap-Eternity,</hi> My Offices and Titles are, The Supreme Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastix, Hupercritique of manners, protonotary of abuses, Arch-Informer, Dilator Generall, Vniversall Calumniator, Eternall plaintiffe, and perpetuall Foreman of the Grand Inquest.

Heaven is no more the place it was; a Cloyster of Carthusians, a Monastery of converted gods, <hi>Iove</hi> is grown old and fearfull, apprehends a subversion of his Empire, and doubts lest Fate should introduce a legal succession in the legitimate heir by repossessing the Titanian line, and hence springs all this innovation.

the Vi-President of <hi>Parnassus,</hi> too strict to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served long, Monopolies are called in, sophistica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wares punished, and rates imposed on commodities. Injunctions are gone out to the Nectar Brewers, for the purging of the heavenly Beverage of a narcotique weed which hath rendred the Idaeaes confus'd in the Divine intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and reducing it to the composition used in <hi>Saturnes</hi> Reign. Edicts are made for the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of decayed house-keeping, prohibiting the repayr of Families to the Metropolis, but this did endanger an Amazonian mutiny, till the females put on a more masculine resolution of solliciting business in their own persons, and leaving their husbands at home for stallions of hospitality. <hi>Bacchus</hi> hath commanded all Taverus to be shut, and no liquor drawn after ten at night. <hi>Cupid</hi> must goe no more so scandalously naked, but but is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed to make him breeches, though of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers petticoats. <hi>Gauimede</hi> is forbidden the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, and must onely Minister in publike.

the Gygantomacy. In brief, the whole state of the Hierarchy suffers a totall reformation, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the point of reciprocation of conjugall affection. <hi>Venus</hi> hath confest all her adulteries, and is receiv'd to grace by her husband, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of the great disparity betwixt her perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and his deformities, allowes those levities as an equall counterpoize; but it is the prettiest spectacle to see her stroaking with her Ivory hand his collied cheeks, and with her snowie fingers combing his sooty beard. <hi>Jupiter</hi> too begins to learn to lead his owne wife, I left him practising in the milky way; and there is no doubt of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall obedience, where the Lawgiver himself in his own person observes his decrees so pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, who besides, to eternize the memory of that great example of Matrimoniall union which he derives from hence, hath on his Bed-chamber doore and seeling, fretted with starres in capitall Letters, engraven the Inscription of <hi>CARLO-MARIA.</hi> This is as much I am sure as either your knowledge or Instructions can direct you to, which I having in a blunt round tale, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out State, formality, politique inferences, or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Rhetoricall elegancies, already delivered, you may now dexterously proceed to the second Part of your charge, which is the raking of your heavenly sparks up in the Embers, or reducing the Etheriall lights to their primitive opaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and grosse dark subsistence; they are all unri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited from the Sphere, and hang loose in their
