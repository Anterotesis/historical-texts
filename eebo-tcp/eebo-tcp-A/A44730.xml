            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter from a Nobleman in <hi>London,</hi> to his Friend in the <hi>Country:</hi> Written some Months ago. Now Published for the Common Good.</head>
            <p>I Assure you, Sir, whatever you have heard to the contrary, my having been in and out in the present, as well as the two former Reigns, proceeds not from any incompatibility or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of humour, but from a true <hi>English</hi> Temper and Spirit, that cannot endure Slavery in it self, and abhors to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of it in otherss. I ever exclaimed against the Court Maxime, <hi>Live and let others Live;</hi> and watch'd my fellow Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters actions; as I desired they would mine, that our Master might not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded, nor his Subjects oppressed; and believing nothing could make <hi>England</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, but a change of our King's limited, legal Authority, into an unbounded Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, I always advised my Prince to a steddy conformity to the Laws, to place his security on the affections of his Subjects, which this would gain him, and not on Guards or Army. These principles were not like to make me thrive in any Court. The apprehension I had, that the late King's Religion would carry him to that extreme, made me not only weary of his Service, but uneasie under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and desirous to change it for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which my first heat of fancy suggested I could not miss in a Protestant; but, my cooler thoughts, what I have already seen acted, and my Knowledge of what is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther design'd convince me of my own and the Nations folly. The reports of <hi>Char.</hi> II's Murder, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Death, and a supposititious Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> all Men of common sense knew to be false and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; but, I confess, I looked upon the noise of a League with <hi>France</hi> to be real; (yet without the ridiculous and spiteful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of cutting the Protestants throats;) because the King's circumstances, especially the proceedings in <hi>Ireland,</hi> made it abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary for his own preservation. Yet now 'tis plain, this also was a pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and that the <hi>Dutch,</hi> dull as they are, have out-witted the <hi>English;</hi> and by a trick drawn us into a War, to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>France:</hi> Nor is it less evident, that Monsieur d'<hi>Avaux</hi>'s Memorial of the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> (88) to the States, (impudently pretended by the Scribler of the Desertion, to have been the cause of the long before intended Invasion,) was, though a Gentiler, as meer a Stratagem: The King, his Master, not more ascertained of the Confederacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself, than of the <hi>Hollander</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations against K. <hi>I.</hi> hop'd by this flight of Generosity, to have wrought into his Interests, Him, who before had rejected his repeated offers of succour. 'Tis no wonder each Party should labour to get <hi>England</hi> on their side; the ballance of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> put into either scale, must of necessity have made that out-weigh the other: But now, too late, we find our King was too good a Christian, to believe his Son and Nephew could gratifie his Ambition, at so barbarous a rate; and too much an English Man, to engage with <hi>France,</hi> against his Subjects Interests; which certainly was to ingross the Trade of the World, and safely look on, while the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> destroy'd each other. But alas! our want of wit, and others cunning, would not suffer us to be thus happy; fear of Slavery, artificially spred among the Gentry, and of Popery among the Commonalty, did not only make way for our ruine, but bewitched our selves to be the Instruments of it. We dreaded and roar'd against a standing Army of English, of Protestants, so zealous, that they would loose their reputation, rather than fight for their Popish King: Yet now we can kiss the rod that scourges us, tamely suffer an Army of Forreigners, of Popish, or of no Religion; who will execute, with joy, the Commands of our new K. their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; whose will, and whose interest it is to enslave us, You have long known my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about Religion, and the force of it, among Men of refined Understandings: I laugh at all sorts of bigotry, and prefer our own Religion to Popery, not as more agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Truth, but as established by Law; Disputes of this Nature ought, in my Mind, to be banished the Common-Wealth, at least, confin'd to the Schools; nor should <hi>I</hi> trouble my Head, nor would any Man that wanted not Brains, what Religion a lawful Parliament put down, or set up; provided we could but be secured against Slavery, and the loss of Abby Lands. Nor need I tell you, who have as sensibly felt it, that Slavery
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31549:2"/>
is not a more natural consequence of Popery, than of Presbitery, or any other Sect. If from what I write, you cannot gather why I make not the same Figure in the State I lately did, read the inclosed advice to our new K. and communicate it, but one by one, to our Friends, the Earls of <hi>K.</hi> and of <hi>E.</hi> the Bp. of—and the rest of our knot; 'tis, Word for Word, taken from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and it is what cleared my Eyes, and gave me a full prospect into the bottom of the design; which, after I had for some time laboured in vain to cross, I made a Leg and withdrew; concluding it base and ignoble, for an <hi>English</hi> Peer, to joyn in Council, or act in Concert with a <hi>Dutch</hi>—, a <hi>French Hugonot,</hi> and a <hi>Scotch Presbyterian,</hi> under a King without Title, whose Religion is Policy, and whose <hi>No-Title</hi> and Policy must be supported by a strong Army, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the State, and the Conquest of <hi>England.</hi>

                        <opener>
                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>HItherto, it is true, your Affairs seem to have succeeded prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously; you have got a Crown, and you have got it with ease; but it cannot be preserv'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty. Your Interest, as P. of O. Statholder of <hi>Holland,</hi> is very different from your Interest, as K. of <hi>England;</hi> but since you are the one, and yet for some time must be the other, your game is the harder, and requires double the skill, that when you landed was necessary. The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as Head of the Protestant League, (which among our selves we must own this to be, notwithstanding that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> natural aversion to the <hi>French,</hi> and the growing Greatness of their Monarchy, have drawn in to it, the whole House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the other Popish Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi>) is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in an Alliance, the K. of <hi>England</hi> ought, in prudence, to have avoided: <hi>Charles</hi> V. and <hi>Philip</hi> II. have sufficiently proved the Universal Monarchy a fantastick Dream, impracticable, impossible; besides the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Scituation of the <hi>English</hi> Dominion, sufficiently secure it against <hi>French</hi> Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>England</hi> therefore, in this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, should have stood Neuter, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the great advantages of Commerce; whilst her Neighbors, especially the <hi>Dutch,</hi> her Rivals, for this reason ever to be suspected and kept under, were interrupted by War; encreased her Naval strength, by building new Ships, repairing the old, and filling her Magazines with all necessary Stores, and erected Forts and Block-houses where want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to secure her against Invasion. The Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> if it could at all affect the late K. could not have obliged him to act otherwise: The War being on <hi>France</hi>'s side purely defensive; their being before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in declaring, after they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Confederacy, makes no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; 'tis an effect of the nimbleness na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to that Nation, to make the first pass when they see their Enemies ready to fall on. But though Neutrality be the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>England,</hi> and must have been the late King's, supposing him a Stranger to the Invasion, and sure of his Subjects, yet can it not, for the present, be yours; who have and must carry on, an Interest directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Peoples, till you are better settled in the Throne, and have forced the <hi>English</hi> to be indeed your Subjects. This done, you may (as the <hi>Dutch</hi> did in the last Confederacy, and, as it is to be feared, they will again, when they perceive in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Crown, the ill effect of their own Politicks) prevent all others by a seperate Peace. In the mean time, you must mind your own, and not the Nation's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and proceed with your Confederates, as Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> they will, without doubt, desire, as the States have already done, that you would as K of <hi>England,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

First, <hi>The temper of the</hi> English, <hi>a beady, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                              </gap>, inconsiderate, inconstant People.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The incompatibility and natural aversion of Protestant Subjects to a Popish Prince; the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in vain, endeavours to exempt it self from this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; their Publick Actions in the three last Reigns, their Acts of Parliament, Tests, Bill of Exclusion, and</hi> Rye-<hi>house Conspiracy, make them p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>st of the same stamp with the rest; and they cannot, without insufferable impudence, but confess, that their pretence of peculiar contrary principles, is an empty</hi>
                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:31549:2"/>
                           <hi>or else, that the whole People of</hi> England <hi>are, in Practice, become Presbyterians, irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable Enemies to a Popish Monarch. So gross an artifice, must not betray you, into a trust and confidence of their Loyalty, as it did your Predecessor, (who seem'd, at least, to forget the voice of the Nation,</hi> That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> had no fault but his being a Papist, to make him unfit to Govern and Succeed,) <hi>unless you will be content to run his Fortune and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. The</hi> Third <hi>and chiefest was, the King's want of an Army; which, he could not be properly said to have, so long as they were Protestants, (the few Papists among them deserv'd not to be considered under a Name) and taught, it was against Conscience to</hi> draw <hi>in desence of a Popish K. the event has shewn that Religion had padlocked their Swords, and bound up their Hands, otherwise he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have picked up and trained such a number of Men, all resolved either to fight against him, or run away from him.</hi> These, Sir, are the Shelves on which he was shipwracked, as you likewise must be, unless you steer a contrary course. Your new Subjects will be still the same, and, upon second thoughts, cannot but repent, what inconsideration made them Act hand over head; your being a Protestant Will not secure you: the odds between a Dutch Presbyterian, and an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Papist, are, in the Church of <hi>England</hi> Men's Opinion, either none at all, or so very inconsiderable, that they cannot turn the Scales, or give you any advantage. You are sensible with what difficulty your Party, in the two Houses, got the better of those who were for calling back K. <hi>I.</hi> on terms, and of those who were for setting up a Common-Wealth: These two Parties will always be your Enemies, you cannot hope to make them Converts; nor that the third will be long, either willing, or able to support your Cause: So that nothing but an Army can do your business: an Army, to the number of fifty or sixty thousand, not of English, but Outlandish men: who will fight to make you great, what a K. ought, and what the K. of <hi>England</hi> needs most to be, Master of his Subjects. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s standing out, which seems a Cross, is, on the contrary, a Blessing, an opportunity, that well managed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, will establish your Dominion. Till you haue gained this point, you must not only keep fair, but Court and Flatter the Parliament, at least, till you have engaged them in a War with <hi>France,</hi> and the reduction of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which you must so contrive, that both may be the effect of their own advice. Your seeming to share the Soveraignty, they have long ambitioned, is the most proper bait to catch your Fish; it will persuade them to find Money for the expence, and hereafter screen you from the Peoples murmurings.

After all, you must presuppose the English will, ere long, grow weary of your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and also that the Confederates may come to be so of the War, before you are able to stand upon your own Legs: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary charge must make the First un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie; and the others, disappointed of your promised assistance, may possibly give credit to what your Enemies will suggest, that you have out-witted them, and sollicited a League more to gratifie your own Ambition, than for the Common Good, to humble <hi>France.</hi> The Parliament having once advised you to the War, will be too far engaged to draw back, or think of a change; but to make your self sure on that side, you must hasten your Army to hinder it, in case they should: To prevent the misfortune from abroad, you must speedily possess your Allies, by Envoys and Ministers, that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was freely offered, and not sought by you; that the disposal on't was the People's Rights and that their assistance to confirm you in the Possession is necessary, to hinder the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemies being enabled, as otherwise he certainly will, by the late King's united Power, to swallow the Spanish Netherlands, subdue Holland, and give Law to the Empire and the rest of <hi>Europe.</hi> Your Protestant Allies you must perswade, by remonstrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the necessity of their firm adhesion, on a double account, <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Temporal Interest.</hi> The States you must sweeten, more particularly by repaying their 600000 <hi>l.</hi> and farther promising what advantages they please in the Trade of both the <hi>Indies.</hi> Nor must you spare the Wealth of <hi>England,</hi> to draw the <hi>Dane</hi> and <hi>Swede</hi> into a stricter Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance: the first may probably be won by the prospect of his Brother's Interest in the Succession: and the latter prevailed upon by a considerable yearly Pension, unless a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of his own future ruine from Denmark, when strengthned by Prince <hi>George</hi>'s Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> should make him deaf to your Proposals.

Now, that you may begin your Reign, as Princes in your circumstances used to do, by some Acts of Popularity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the Parliament the taking off the Chimney-Money, (which seems a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on the poorer sort: you need not fear but what they thus take away with one hand, they must give back with another, till they have put you into a condition to carve for your self:) and also a Bill of Union, or Comprehension, of all your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Subjects; and though it is possible neither may succeed, especially the last, to which the Church Party are not like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; the Clergy in Possession having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been averse to any change in their Popish Common Prayer Book, and much more to let others share their Titles and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices; the Propositions nevertheless will be very advantageous to you, in the love and esteem of the generality of the People. As for Religion, (the common Cloak for Rebellion, but never a security against one,) you ought to consider it, and the several Sects into which it is divided, no farther than as may best serve and promote your Interest: In publick seem to favour the Church of <hi>England,</hi> because the Laws, the Nobility, and best estated Gentry are of its side; underhand, the Presbyterians, and other Nonconformists are to be caressed; the Numbers, the Trade, the Riches, and your Protestant Allies are of their side; the Romanists you must likewise study to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige; this may possibly in time wean them from K. <hi>I.</hi> and will please a considerable part of your Army, and your Confederates of the same Opinion; who must be taught to infer from your Actions, that what is in your Declaration against Popery, as you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Thus, Sir, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to your Commands, we have freely and briefly given your Majesty our Opinion; concluding, that Cowardize, Treachery, and an innate desire of Change having given you the Crown, nothing can secure it, but such a formidable Army as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; this when you have compassed, you may safely assume the Title of <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and, after the Example of <hi>W.</hi> the First, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve for your Self what Land you please, and divide the rest among your Followers; settle in all your Dominions, such Religion, Laws, and form of Government, as shall best suit with your own Grandeur, and the extent of your Empire: But if you trust an English Army, though never so great, and despise our advice, the touchstone of sincere Councellors, your Reign will be short, and your Ruine inevitable: For when your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects reflect, they have changed a firm Peace for a lasting War, that the Flower of their <hi>Youth</hi> is destroyed, by Land and Sea, their Freedom from Taxes turned into a Grievous Load of endless Impositions, their Trade lost, their Rents fallen, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reduced from a Rich and Glorious, to a poor contemptible People; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat their Misery, next door to be enslaved by Foreigners, that they have brought all these Evils upon themselves, to secure their Religion, now really exposed to <hi>Calvinism</hi> or <hi>Luther anism,</hi> extreams, in their Opinions, equally pernicious with <hi>Popery;</hi> of which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the danger was indeeed but imaginary; they will, without doubt, repent, and contrive such a general Revolution, as happen'd in 1660. when both the Fleet and the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army, in the three Kingdoms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with the rest of the English to call back their exil'd Prince.

            <p>I Have, at last, after above four Months irresolution, concluded, I could not better serve my Friend, or my Country, than by publishing his Letter, and the good Advice given our new King; every Body will see a Plot is laid for the ruine of <hi>England;</hi> and none can wonder, a Lord, of his great Sense and great Estate, should refuse to be an Actor in the Tragedy; wherein he would not have seem'd, so long, to have born a part, as he has since often vow'd, if he had not had the vanity, to have hoped he could have perswaded his Master to have been an English K. to have made good his Declarations, his Promises, and his Oaths, to have sent back his Forreign Troops, and called a free Parliament, to reform and settle all our Disorders: But had not he had a large share in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon infatuation, one so renown'd could not have expected this from the P. of O. who could not be well supposed to have made them, but with purpose to break them, as soon as they had smooth'd his way to the Crown; no Man in his Wits could imagine, he meant to be a Slave to his Word, or <hi>trust the Loyalty of Men, become his Subjects, by Treachery to their own Prince;</hi> and it was more ridiculous to believe, That, after he got to be K. <hi>he would make good the obligations he had, in order to it, put himself under,</hi> than it would be for a Wife, to hope from her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the performance of the Vows he made her when a Lover. <hi>He that, without regard to Humane or Divine Laws, had Usurped upon the Rights of an Uncle, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Father, and Wife, was not like to be restrained by Rules of his own prescribing.</hi> We are well enough serv'd, and can justly blame none but our selves, He understands his Interest and pursues it, though we did, and still do, grossly mistake ours. Our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have been useful to him, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us with hatred and contempt, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe himself safe, unless he make us Slaves. He will force us, with the Ass in the <hi>Apologue,</hi> dearly to repent our change of Masters. And if we do not account a lasting War, both at Sea and Land, insupportable Taxes, loss of Trade, hundreds of our Ships (and among them not a few Royal ones) lost by Storm, and made Prize by <hi>France;</hi> 14000 of our Army, that was to have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Ireland</hi> before last <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed without fighting, eaten up by Lice, Flux, and Famine; and above 5000 of that in <hi>Flanders</hi> lost by Hunger, Disease, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion; 7000 of our ill man'd Fleet Dead, and above 4000 more Sick; most poyson'd by stinking rotten Victuals, for want of French Salt; an evil like to continue next year also; unless we, who are far from being Masters at Sea, can take it by force; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Robberies, barbarous Murders, and licentious Extravagancies, of <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> tokens of the Wrath of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and punishments for our <hi>crime,</hi> We shall be concluded to have as little fear of God, as we have had Honour for the K.

We have long complained of a Design, in the three last Reigns, to introduce the French Form of Government, and subvert our own; make the Parliament a Cypher, serve for nothing but to burthen the Nation with Taxes, to support a Standing Army, and make our Kings Absolute. If ever there was ground for this Outcry, there is at this day, when the Name of Parliament is made use of, to unhinge the very Fundamentals, undermining in few Hours, by a servile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with an Usurper, our Laws, our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> what our Ancestors were a building up, hundreds of years, with a great deal of Toil and Blood, to enable their new <hi>Master</hi> by excessive Impositions, four Millions, and 800000 <hi>l.

Our Parliament had no sooner perfected the Money Bills, and resolved, with a true zeal, and the wonted courage of their Predecessors, to rouse themselves up from their shameful slumbers, and enter in good earnest upon methods of redressing the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management of the <hi>Revenue,</hi> the <hi>ill conduct of the Fleet, non-payment of Seamens wages, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5 letters">
