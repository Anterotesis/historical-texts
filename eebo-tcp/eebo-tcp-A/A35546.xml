            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>My own inclinations and common huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity made me esteem it no unworthy or una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable designe, to prevent, and allay these so usuall and troublesome quarrels.

            <p>It is not to be questioned under which branch of the last subdivision the <hi>Friendship</hi> we treat on, is comprised. Every one sees that it relates unto the latter sort. But as evident as it is, that it intervenes only betwixt persons of a <hi>different ranke,</hi>

            <p>Furthermore, as it behoves <hi>inferiour relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to put up the wrongs and injuries done them by their <hi>Patrons,</hi> and not onely patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to support their contumelies, but with complaisance to behave themselves thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so on the other side, it becomes great <hi>persons</hi> not to take notice of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>little failour</hi> in their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">

            <p>Wherefore let them learn the <hi>Art of ruling,</hi> and that <hi>conduct</hi> which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the <hi>proper mannaging of power</hi>: This is no easy and common matter, or such as may be acquired without extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary attention: It comes not by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,</hi> nor is propagated by <hi>generation</hi>: to the obtaining thereof more is requisite then a <hi>great fortune,</hi> and a <hi>sence of its necessity</hi>: in fine, it is so transcendent a quality, that to speak the truth, it seems to be placed above the designs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of mankind, and it is rather <hi>a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar gift of God,</hi> then the acquest of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prudence.</hi> But the directions leading thereunto are not to be delivered occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by a digression in this discourse; but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97576:37"/>
to be deduced from another Art, wherein whosoever is thoroughly conversant and knowing, the same will neither faile in the <hi>suitable Choice</hi> of his instruments and <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> nor in his comport towards them; so as to effect, that they who <hi>mutually</hi> love and correspond among themselves like Brethren; may also agree to <hi>love, serve,</hi> and even adore him. Amongst the documents of that Art, it is one great and wholesome Precept, <hi>That such as are in power ought to assure themselves of the affections of those they rule over</hi>: hereby their <hi>Empire</hi> is more <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>stable,</hi> and the <hi>voluntary</hi> services of their <hi>vassals</hi> are not only more <hi>pleasant</hi> to them, because <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrained</hi>; but infinitely more <hi>advantageous</hi> to their <hi>Rulers,</hi> whose <hi>interests</hi> shall not be neglected <hi>any way,</hi> as long as their <hi>persons</hi> are not <hi>indifferent,</hi> or <hi>odious</hi> to them. Whence it appears, how much they <hi>mistake</hi> themselves who live at continuall variance with their <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> who not only abandon their concerns, &amp; forget or slight their particular advantages, but depress, and oppose them, as if they were their <hi>adversaries:</hi> whose sense of the <hi>unusuall care, fidelity</hi> and <hi>dispatch</hi> of a good servant, prompts them not to <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>preferre him,</hi> but to fixe him to their adherence, by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impossible for him otherwise to subsist: They imagine that he would be less their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97576:38"/>

Nor do I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this course to be more prudentiall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but more profitable. For, what <hi>Farme,</hi> or <hi>Mannor,</hi> yeelds so great and certain an income to a <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>potent</hi> Grandee, as an <hi>entire friend</hi>? what <hi>profits</hi> may compare with those which many <hi>Princes</hi> have received from their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate <hi>creatures</hi>? How vast a difference is there in our relying upon <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>obliged friends,</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supporting or carrying on of our affaires; &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For such who manage their parts and obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiousness, as they would <hi>moneys,</hi> which they do not lend <hi>gratis,</hi> but put out <hi>to use,</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed always to expect <hi>interest,</hi> and to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their addresses and applications solely by their <hi>utility,</hi> and <hi>private gain.</hi> Whereupon they serve <hi>great men,</hi> as <hi>tenants</hi> do their <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords,</hi> who do not expend themselves and their riches to imbellish their <hi>tenements,</hi> or to beautifie their grounds with <hi>pleasant Gardens,</hi> Walks and Groves, Grots and Aqueducts; but contrive which way they may improve the Land to their advantage, and with least cost multiply their <hi>present profits</hi>: Thus, <hi>they,</hi> being retained <hi>as it were</hi> by wages and salary in the service of Great Men <hi>for a time,</hi> study not <hi>during that intervall,</hi> how they may most benefit them, nor how they may best advance or secure their <hi>power, riches,</hi> or <hi>dependances</hi>; but how they may make the best of that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for themselves. But, when they are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the <hi>sence of gain</hi> and particular emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument, and fixed to us by those more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and noble ties of <hi>affection</hi> &amp; <hi>handsome friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>; they no longer act like <hi>self-minded Tenants,</hi> but embrace all our concernments with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same zeal and integrity as if they were their own, studying rather to aggrandise themselves by the greatness of their <hi>Patrons,</hi> than regarding their <hi>annuall incomes,</hi> and the profits that from

year to year accrue to them. Thus, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted themselves to our families, and as it were cordially espoused <hi>our interest</hi> once, they account nothing troublesome, great, or hazardous, which is beneficiall to us; having possessed our selves once of their hearts, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests are no longer <hi>different</hi>; they have but <hi>one</hi> important concernment, and that is, <hi>for us.</hi>

This one circumstance is so considerable, that they who harangue upon this
