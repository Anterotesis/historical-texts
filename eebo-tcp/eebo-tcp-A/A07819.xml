            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13234:11"/>
give to our Adverſaries their foure Objections foure punctuall Anſwers.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, That the <hi>Powers,</hi> to whom <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> is required, by this <hi>Canon,</hi> were indeed <hi>Tyrants</hi> to their owne Subjects, and <hi>Perſecuters</hi> of the Chriſtian Profeſſors. For were not theſe <hi>Powers</hi> heathen <hi>Governors?</hi> were not the moſt of them cruell Tyrants? were they not all profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed enemies to the Chriſtian faith? and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters of the Profeſſors thereof? This cannot be denyed; but if any mans ignorance ſhould gainſay it, we might inſtance in the Emperour <hi>Nero,</hi> who was the <hi>higheſt Power</hi> in the world at this time. He, after the fift yeare of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, became ſo bloody a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> even to his owne heatheniſh people, that they branded him with the blacke marke of a <hi>Monſter.</hi> And he was ſo vile and violent an Oppoſer of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, that his Raigne hath beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred ever ſince by Chriſtians to have beene their <hi>Firſt fierie perſecution;</hi> whereof the holy Pen-man of this Epiſtle felt ſome ſparkles: for <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. he diſplayeth himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>I Paul a Priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Whence was that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle written? the Subſcription thereof ſaith, <hi>From Rome.</hi> And the like we reade in the Epiſtle
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13234:12"/>
to <hi>Philemon.</hi> All this notwithſtanding, <hi>S. Paul</hi> requireth <hi>Subjection</hi> to this, and to all Other never ſo Tyrannous Governours. With what front or face then could theſe Romiſh, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seducers diſtort this Text, for proofe of a Rebellious Concluſion?</p>
                  <p>Their ſecond <hi>Ignorance</hi> (if yet it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ignorance) is, that they diſcerne not this their inconſequence, viz. <q>
                        <hi>The Canon exacteth ſubjection to Governours that are no Terrour to good Workers.</hi> Ergo, <hi>To thoſe that are a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to good Workers, they owe no Subjection.</hi>
                     </q> Juſt as if, in Chatechizing Children in their duty to their Parents, they ſhould inſtruct them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Divine Scripture commandeth you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence your Parents, who bring you up in the feare of the Lord: <hi>Ergo</hi> if your Parents ſhall vexe you, in your good Doings, you muſt not yeeld any Reverence unto them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they will not ſee, that there is a temporall Good redounding unto Subjects, even under moſt tyrannous Governours. I ſay againe, They will not ſee it, who name <hi>Calvin,</hi> as ſtanding for them: but onely name him, alleaging no place. Now, will any doubt but that when they argued from this Text, they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13234:12"/>
did conſult with <hi>Calvin</hi> upon it, then whom (upon this place) they could not have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Adverſarie? He ſaith, indeed, that the Text requireth <hi>Subiection to Governours,</hi> for the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake</hi> that <hi>Government</hi> bringeth: but doth hee contrarily conclude a <hi>no ſubjection,</hi> if they ſhall peradventure degenerate and turne <hi>Tyrants?</hi> His words are, <note n="*" place="margin">Calvin in locum.</note>

Therefore there can be no</hi>

                     <hi>Tyranny, which may not in ſome degree be an Helpe and Aid to the Common-weale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> commenting upon the ſame Text, hath theſe words; <hi>Niſi Tyranni ſaeviſsimi aliquam habeant rationem juris, potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am illam ſuam retinere non poſſent.</hi> And it is very true; for if <hi>Tyrants</hi> ſhould not uphold the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Juſtice and Peace, in ſome degree, they themſelves could not ſubſiſt or ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. He inſtanceth in <hi>Nero, Cùm ipſe Imperio ſuo opprimeret orbem terrarum, tamen jus diceba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, nec vis legum funditus everſa erat è rebus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis.</hi> The difference therefore, in this Caſe, between the <hi>Incendiaries</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> is no more nor leſſe then this; They ſay that the <hi>Argument</hi> of the Apoſtle <hi>Extrudeth</hi> (it is their own word) <hi>Subjection to Tyrannous Governours:</hi> But Hee denyeth this. And they reject the ſaid <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> as if they were void of all publike Juſtice: But He ſaith, there was never any ſuch <hi>Tyranny</hi> heard of.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Crotchet they have, namely, that <q>
