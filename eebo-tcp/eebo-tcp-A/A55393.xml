         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The EPISTLE to the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the great unhappinesse of most men, that
they judge of things by appearance, and
not according to truth; That those wayes
and doctrines which are most specious in
shew, which seemingly look most to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of Gods honour, the advancement
of holinesse, and the liberties of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
are most taking with many of that sort of persons, who
have a due sence of those excellent things upon their spirits:
and such an opinion, I take this to be, which is the principall
subject of this following Treatise, which is asserted by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
<hi>Viz. That Gifted persons may Preach publickly:</hi>
An opinion wherein there is a double compliance, with the
apprehensions and affections of men, whereby it gets entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among them: Either, because it gives an opportunity
for the declaration, and demonstration of a mans abilities to
others, (a disease incident to good men) or because it puts a
man into a capacity of honouring God in a more eminent way:
(which a gracious soul is very apt to thirst after) And, if,
to these be added, and upon these do follow a third thing, to
wit, an experience of some honour brought to God, and some
good done upon others, this puts it out of doubt, with divers
good men, and makes them sit down with a confident perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb facs="tcp:100839:3"/>
of the truth of it. And on the other side, when a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
undertakes to refute and overthrow that opinion, he lies
under this great prejudice, of minding his own interests, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
the Lords people this glorious priviledge, and desiring
to monopolize it to himself; And so, whatever he saith upon
that account, is rather taken as the issue of his own passions,
then the sence of the Scripture: But, because I have learned
to judge of things otherwise then by events and appearances,
and the humours or censures of men. I dare not decline a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
work upon the account of any reflections which may be
cast upon me thereby, but shall leave the vindication of my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and the bringing forth of my righteousnesse to God, and
(as in duty I ought) ingage for the assertion of the truth in this
particular: Which I am the more willing to do, because (if the
providence of God may be observed, and if the tree may be judged
by the fruit) there is hardly any one principle, which hath been
more scandalous to thousands of the most judicious of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
(both Ministers and others) and more unhappily instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
to the introduction, and propagation of all those loose,
false, vain, frivolous and pernicious doctrines (which abound
in the Nation) then the profession and practise of this specious
opinion of liberty of prophesying. Nor doth this onely flow
from the abuse of that principle, (as our Brethren would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate)
but from the very principle it self, as they state it:
For so long as they hold, that, <hi>It is the duty of every gifted
man, as such, to exercise his gifts,</hi> (which they assert pag.
32.) and that, <hi>if he have received gifts to teach publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he must use them also publickly;</hi> (which they avow,
pag. 47.) and that, <hi>he himself may judge of his gifts, and
may preach, though it be not so expedient, without any
further Call:</hi> (which they professe, pag. 20.) What can be
expected, but that this Doctrine should be a <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse,
whence the adversaries of the Truth may break out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the City of God, A <hi>Pandora's</hi> Box, from whence all
<pb facs="tcp:100839:3"/>
sorts of mischievous and foul poysoning opinions may fly out,
and that without remedy. It must be here seasonably remembred,
that the point here discussed is no triviall point, but one that
nearly concerns the very vitals of the Church, to whose wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
nothing under God and his Word, is more necessary and
conducible, then the Ordinance of the Ministery; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
nothing requires greater care in the disposal of it, then
that doth, and in nothing were the Apostles more solicitous
then in committing this Office and worke to fit persons, and
nothing would have been more incongruous to the wisdome and
faithfulnesse of the head of the Church, then to prostitute
them to the fancies and humours of every invader, nothing
more unbecoming the carefulnesse of our great shepherd,
then to suffer any wolfe (that saith or thinks he is fit for it)
to take the office of the shepherd, or to do his work, both which
come to one, and are utterly pernitious, to the flock. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of these and such like things, occasioned the Provincial
Assembly to take it into their serious thoughts, not onely to
assert the Office of the Ministry, but also to regulate the work
of the Ministry, and to confine it within those just boundaries
which God and man have set for it: This was done in that
late piece called <hi>Jus Divinum Ministerii Evangelici,</hi> a piece
which as it hath through Gods blessing been satisfactory to the
consciences of many persons, so hath it had a contrary effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others, (as might in reason be expected) to draw forth
and derive opposition upon it, from divers hands, and among
others, those of our Brethren, with whom I have now to do: And
although it is not fit, nor usuall for Assemblies to take notice of
the contradictions of particular persons; yet, because our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
have with united force undertaken the refutation of part
of that Treatise; and because they have indeavoured to manage
it with Scripture Arguments and evidence, (which justly bear
most sway in these times) and because divers well-meaning
persons, (and that not onely such as being injudicious, are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
<pb facs="tcp:100839:4"/>
but also such as seem to be pillars in their way) have
declared their high approbation of it, and asserted the unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerablenesse
of it. It was therefore thought fit that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should be done by way of reply: And accordingly the
Provinciall Assembly was pleased to lay it upon my shoulders,
and I ingaged in the work, and as I love not unnecessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes,
so I hoped long since to have given the World an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it: But it pleased that Supream Providence (which
orders all affaires) unexpectedly to surprize me, with a sad
and dangerous convulsion, which being seated in the head, did
not onely disinable me for the present, but a pretty while after
overawe me, so that I was disswaded from medling in any
thing, whereby the brain might be exercised, and discomposed:
and moreover, it is not unknown to many, that a work of far
greater concernment, and paines, and trouble, and care, did
lie in my hands all along, interfering with this, which indeed
required the whole man; besides many other occasions not
inconsiderable, which is needlesse and impertinent, for me here
to speak of: Onely thus much I have here mentioned by way
of Apologie, why this Reply comes forth no sooner, and it may
further Apologize for the frequent defects which may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in it, because I was so continually incumbred with distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cares, about other affaires, whereof I have many witnesses.
This delay therefore the Reader is intreated to pardon, and to
accept of the service, as it is now tendred, wherein, though I
doubt not, it will be easie to the wise to observe many weaknesses,
yet God and my conscience are my compurgators, that I have
managed it with sincerity, and I hope my Reader will witnesse
that I have handled it with the same candor and moderation
which our Brethren have shewn, and which I think ought to be
shewn in such differences as these. For the successe of this
work, as I am not without hope, that there will be found some, <hi>ex
meliore luto,</hi> who laying aside partiality, will own the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
here brought, and yeeld to it, (for I may without vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:100839:4"/>
say, that there is some evidence and cogency, at least in some
things in difference) so I must confesse, when I consider, how
weak and injudicious most are, and unable <hi>to discern between
things that differ,</hi> how supine and carelesse the generality even
of good men are, in the weighing of things of this nature, (and
yet usually such as are least knowing, are most confident and
heady) how apt the most are to be led by the reputation of
some particular men of their party for ability and piety, how
deeply mens interests are concerned herein; and in particular
their honour in not seeming to be bafled, and deserting that
way they are once ingaged in: I say, when I consider these
things, I am full of fears, lest what is here said, and whatever
is spoken hereafter, will vanish into the air, without any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
However this is sufficient incouragement to me, that
I have born witnesse to the truth of God in these declining
times, and hope it may be usefull, if not for the reduction of
such as are gone astray, yet for the confirmation and settlement
of others, who may be wavering herein.</p>
            <p>There are three sorts of Readers, principally which I expect
to meet with.</p>
            <p>1. Weak and well-minded soules, who are in this much to
be pitied, that being insufficient to see by their own eyes, and
to look through the vail of holy pretences, and pious ends, are
apt to be abused by others, and to be <hi>carried to and fro, by
every wind of doctrine:</hi> These, I wish they had followed
the Apostles direction, and never given way to doubtfull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations.
But having once entertained them, and being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
by them, if they do not give very diligent heed, and
receive not more then ordinary assistance, are never like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
themselves.</p>
            <p>2. Proud, wilfull, and self-conceited persons, the pride of
whose hearts, hath led them into wayes of singularity,
and will oblige them to make good their ground. Their Motto
is, <hi>Cedo nulli.</hi> And because a recesse from their received
<pb facs="tcp:100839:5"/>
perswasions would import something of weaknesse, and humane
frailty, they, being conscious to themselves, of their own great
worth, are resolved, and unmoveable from their present ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions.</p>
            <p>3. There are an intelligent and ingenuous sort of men, who
being sensible of their own weaknesse, dare not suppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
beyond a possibility of mistake, and therefore alwayes
have an eye open to discern further conviction, when ever it is
offered, and keep one ear open for the adverse party, whose
language is that of <hi>Jobs, That which I know not, teach
thou me, and wherein I have thought amisse, I will do so
no more.</hi> It is for the sake of those, that I have taken this
trouble upon my self, and I hope as to persons of this allay, <hi>my
labour may not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I shall detain thee no longer in the porch, but let thee
into the house, desiring the God of Truth, <hi>to lead us into all
Truth,</hi> which is the hearty prayer of</p>

               <p>1. THey Question, <hi>What is meant by the Ministry?</hi> And
here (to passe by impertinencies) <hi>because a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is called so from ministration,</hi> they infer, <hi>That gifted
men, whose ordinary work or calling is to Preach, may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be called Ministers of the Gospel;</hi> pag. 3. For my part
I shall never blot paper with contending about words:
Our Question is not about Names, but Things; And if
the word Minister may be applied to twenty persons, we
are not concerned in it; for the Question is not, Whether
a Gifted brother, whose work or calling is to preach,
may be called a Minister? (for even he who never preaches,
if he any other way minister to the Gospel, may be called
a Minister of the Gospel, according to their own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
but Whether such a Gifted brother may preach?
and Whether the title Minister, in its special and distinct
acception may be applied to him? And in both these we
hold the Negative.</p>
               <p>2. Their second Question is not much more important,
viz. <hi>Whether the Office of the Ministry be a relation to the
Work of the Ministry, or to the Church?</hi> And here they
tax the Assembly, for saying that <hi>the Office of the Ministry
is better defined by relation to the Work, than to a particular
people.</hi> Where I desire it may be observed, that the
Assembly did not say, The Office of the Ministry is better
defined by relation to the Work, than <hi>to the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100839:6"/>
but <hi>than to a particular Church:</hi> It was not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Assembly to deny the Ministry to be a relation
to the Church, nor yet was it their businesse accurately
to insist upon the notions of <hi>relate</hi> and <hi>correlate;</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
called the Work of the Ministry, the <hi>correlate,</hi> but
only <hi>obiter</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they asserted the Office of the
Ministry to be better defined by relation to the Work,
than to a particular Church, which our Brethren have
not here disproved; but only endeavoured to prove that
the Office of the Ministry rather consisteth in relation to
the Church in general, than to the Work; so that all
their labour, as to that particular, might have been spared.
To which may be added, that we must distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>abstract</hi> Ministry, and the <hi>concrete</hi> a Minister.</p>
               <p>And although the Minister in the <hi>concrete</hi> have the
Church for his <hi>Correlatum,</hi> yet that the Ministry in the
<hi>abstract</hi> should have relation to the Work, is no more
absurd, then that the Office of a King should have relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ruling, which, I think, no sober man will deny;
and especially when such a thing is brought in occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a person not minding, nor obliged to minde the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of words; it were a vanity in any man to batter
down such an expression by a quaternion of Arguments,
which our Brethren have attempted to do.</p>
               <p>To which may be added, that that rule upon which
their first Argument hangs, <hi>viz. Relata sunt simul,</hi> &amp; do
<hi>mutuo se ponere &amp; tollere,</hi> is true only of Predicamentall,
but not of Transcendentall relations, such as this is; whose
being is not wholly respective,<note place="margin">Suarez <hi>Metap.</hi>
                  </note> as the Masters of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks
inform us.</p>
               <p>And the same answer also may serve for the second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
(which indeed is but the same) viz. <hi>That rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
must be together, but the Office is a means to the Work
as an end, and so the Office must needs be first, and therefore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100839:7"/>
they are not relatives.</hi> To which I answer, 1. As before,
The rule holds not of Transcendentall relations. 2. A
potentiall being is sufficient in relations: My knowledge
of a Rose to be in the spring is related to that Rose even
in winter; and yet the Rose doth not actually, but only
potentially exist in winter.</p>
               <p>The other two Arguments are trivial, and therefore I
shall dilate no further about them, because this is a Logical
and no Theological Controversie.</p>

               <head type="sub">Qu. Whether Ministers are only Ministers to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Flocks?</head>
               <p>IN handling of this I shall 1. State the Question plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and faithfully. 2. I shall offer some Arguments for
the Negative. 3. I shall enquire what our Brethren have
to say for the Affirmative.</p>
               <p>For the state of this Question we must take notice of
another Question, whence it hath its rise and being, to
wit, <hi>Whether besides particular Congregational Churches,
there be any other visible Political Churches mentioned in
Scripture?</hi> It hath till these last times been universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Church of God, that, Besides that union
and communion, whereby the members of a particular
Church meet together in a Congregation for the Word
and Sacraments, there is another union and communion,
whereby particular Churches do by their Delegates (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in their persons they all cannot) meet together,
combine, consult and conclude in common, as they
judge most expedient for the good of their particular
Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100839:7"/>
This sufficiently appears from the constant practise of
the Church in all ages, even from the Apostles times,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. and so downwards; which was, when ever ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
required and opportunity was offered, to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Synods, and in common to govern all their
Churches. And as these meetings were greater or lesse,
so they received a differing denomination, being called
Synods Oecumenicall, Provincial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is at this day the judgement of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches in the world, some few amongst our
selves being excepted, and our dear Brethren in <hi>New-England,</hi>
both known by the name of <hi>Congregationall
men,</hi> so called from this their first principle, <hi>That the
Scripture owns no visible Church but one Congregation.</hi>
From hence it must needs follow, according to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
mind, That Ministers are Ministers only to their
own Congregations.</p>
               <p>As on the other side, they that own another Church,
besides Congregational, do assert, that Ministers have a
double relation, the one to their own particular Flocks,
the other to the whole Church. And thus much for the
rise of the Question.</p>
               <p>For our Brethrens mind we shall not need to go far,
they affirm possitively, that <hi>Officers stand in relation to a
particular Church onely, and they deny them to be Officers to
a Church universall, or to any but their owne Flocks,</hi> Pag. 8.
But here I cannot but take notice of a weighty difference
amongst our Congregational Brethren, in which they
should do well to be reconciled before they endeavour too
eagerly to obtrude their Notions upon the world; It is
this: Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi> and <hi>Allen</hi> in their answer to the nine
questions assert, that <hi>though Ministers are Officers only to
their own Flocks, yet they may perform acts of their Office
towards others,</hi> Pag. 133. And Learned Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100839:8"/>
concludes, that <hi>a Minister preacheth to another Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
non tantum virtute donorum &amp; charitatis, sed ex vi
vocationis, <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> not only as a gifted Brother, but as
an Officer; And it is sufficiently known that it is the
judgement of persons of greatest note in that way among
us in <hi>England.</hi> Now on the other side, Reverend Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi> expresly affirmeth that <hi>when a minister preacheth to
another Congregation, he preacheth not as a Pastour, but as a
gifted man,</hi> Survey <hi>Part 2. P.</hi> 32. And our Brethren in
this Book fall in with him, and will not allow Ministers
either to be Officers, or to act as Officers towards any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
their owne Congregation.</p>
               <p>For the better clearing of the present Question I shall
premise two Considerations which indeed do strike at the
root of all their Objections.</p>
               <p>I. That there are two waies whereby a Minister may
be a Minister to the whole Church.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Actu secundo,</hi> actually, immediatly, absolutely
and independently, so that he may without any other
warrant undertake to teach and govern the whole Church,
if it were possible; This was peculiar to the Apostles,
and surely this is abundantly sufficient to distinguish them
from ordinary Pastors.</p>
               <p>2. One may be an Officer to the whole Church <hi>actu
primo,</hi> habitually, aptitudinally, mediatly, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
and dependingly, so that he hath a <hi>jus</hi> or power
to teach every where (<hi>Go preach the Gospel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>)
but may not exercise that <hi>jus</hi> or power, every where,
but by the consent of the Church or Rulers, not as if
there was any defect in his authority, but only because
there is a manifest inconveniency and disorder in such a
promiscuous and unlicensed exercise, which therfore is
unlawful because it is repugnant to Order, and obstructive
to Edification: and this is the case of ordinary Pastors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100839:8"/>
II. I shall premise another Consideration, which being
well digested is sufficient to enervate all that is said by our
Brethren as to this point: it is this, A generall respect to
the whole Church is not inconsistent with a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to some one Church.</p>
               <p>Suppose one having a vast number of sheep, needeth
and chuseth twenty Shepheards to look to his sheep, and
these shepheards because each of them cannot possibly
look to all, do therefore distribute the sheep into twenty
parcels, and each undertakes to look to his share, yet so,
as that in things of common concernment to all the sheep,
they all meet and consult together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in matters of
private concernment every man looks to his own parcel:
In this case every shepheard hath a double relation, the
one general to the whole, the other particular to his own
parcel, which he doth more especially take care for, and
feed, and keep, and watch over, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in case any of
those sheep which properly belong not to his charge go
astray, if he see them and can keep them in, he is obliged
by vertue of his office to do it, and if through his neglect
they miscarry, he doth not only sin against Charity but
against his Office. This is the case of the Church, and
so it was out of doubt with the Apostles, unto whom
Christ committed the care of his sheep indefinitely: And
because each of them could not look to all, therefore the
sheep were divided into parcels, and every Apostle takes
upon himself a special relation unto some one parcel, and
had his proper line; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. And because the sheep
multiplied so fast, that to look to them all was a work too
heavy for the Apostles shoulders, therefore the Flock
was divided into more parcels, and they ordained more
shepheards, who although peculiarly entrusted with their
proper Charge, yet were not freed from their Care of the
whole, but in things of common concernment did meet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100839:9"/>
together with the Apostles in their daies, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And
afterwards among themselves.</p>
               <p>Or as it is in <hi>Germany,</hi> where every Elector and Prince of
the Empire sustains a double relation; He is related more
especially to his owne peculiar Territory to which he is an
Officer, acting ordinarily, and constantly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But over
and besides his, he hath a general relation to the whole
Empire, and is an Officer to the whole, not singly and by
himself, but together with others, being intrusted with a
joint-power of governing the whole, as in case of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of an Emperor, or other weighty affairs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
as the necessities and occasions of the Empire require.
Just so it is in the Church, which is one entire body (as the
Empire is) governed by one Systeme of laws, and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
under one Government, every Minister hath a double
relation, the one special and peculiar, to his owne Flock
which he is to feed constantly; the other general to the
whole Church, which he is to feed occasionally, as far as
his ability will reach, and as the Churches exigencies
command, and which he together with others hath a
power to govern.</p>
               <p>This will be put out of doubt by considering more
fully that which even now was intimated of the Apostles
themselves, who also had this double relation, one to the
whole, whereby they were Pastors of the whole Church,
and yet because they could not possibly each of them look
to all the Churches, therefore the work was divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, and they undertook a special relation to some
particular parts, as <hi>Peter</hi> to the Jews, and <hi>Paul</hi> to the
Gentiles, <hi>Iames</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp;c. Which division did
not proceed from any defect of authority in the Apostles
to feed the whole, but from the impossibility of the thing
in regard of the vastnesse of the work, and because they
were to carry on all Church-work as most suited with edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100839:9"/>
In like manner we that are ordinary Pastors, <hi>sequimur
patres, non passibus aequis;</hi> and though every Minister is
a Minister of the whole Church, and hath an Authority
extending to it <hi>suo modo,</hi> yet because it is impossible for
every one to look to every Church, and all things are to
be managed with special respect to the Churches edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
therefore Ministers are forced to divide the work,
both as to Teaching and Ruling; yet so, as that there
still remains a relation to the whole, whereby he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to teach, and with others to rule other Churches, so
far forth as his ability reacheth, and the Churches neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
require.</p>
               <p>And by the way, I cannot but take notice of a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
difference between Teaching and Ruling, in point of
the possibility of the thing, and the edification of the
Church (which is the great Rule in all Church-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations)
for a Minister may jointly with others rule a
far greater proportion than he can teach. <hi>David</hi> as a
King, could rule all <hi>Israel,</hi> but <hi>David</hi> as a Prophet, could
not <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> teach all <hi>Israel,</hi> at least not ordinarily and
constantly. And the Apostles, though it was impossible
for every one of them actually to teach every Church,
(they neither could do it, nor did it) yet it was possible
for each Apostle joyntly with the rest, to govern every
Church, and they did actually rule all the Churches, at
least all the Churches there mentioned, in that famous
Synod, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. (in which, whether they acted as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
or as ordinary Elders, all is one to the present Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.)
And this may serve for Answer to that specious
Argument so much insisted on by the Reverend and
Learned dissenters, taken from the conjunction of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Ruling.</p>
               <p>These things premised, I shall now come to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
And here I shall have a double work;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100839:10"/>
1. To lay down an Argument or two, to prove that
Ministers are Officers, and act as Officers to more than
their own particular Churches.</p>
               <p>2. To Answer their Arguments, and to justifie those
inconveniences objected by the Provincial Assembly to
the contrary Opinion.</p>
               <p>For the former, I shall not here dilate, only I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
three Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first Argument is this,</hi> If Ministers are Officers, and
act as Officers towards convertible Heathens, then they are not
Officers only to their particular Congregations: But Ministers
are Officers, and act as Officers towards convertible Heathens.
<hi>The</hi> Minor <hi>is the only Proposition that can be denied, and
that I shall now endeavour to prove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The case is plain in the Apostles: That Apostles
were constituted Officers before the visible Gospel-Church
was erected, is undeniable, and appears plainly
from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. The Apostles, at that time, were Officers
for they had actually received their Commission; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>relata,</hi> must have a <hi>correlatum:</hi> A <hi>correlate</hi> there was
none, but those who were to be made Disciples, who
were to be converted: So that, one of these two must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be granted, either that the Apostolical relation
wanted a <hi>correlatum</hi> (which to say, is grosly absurd) or
that the Heathens and Jews to be converted, were the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatum</hi>
to them.</p>
               <p>There is but one thing that can be said, to wit, that at
that time there were divers already converted Christians,
who were a sufficient <hi>correlatum</hi> to the Apostolical Office.
To which I Answer, If we suppose that all such Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had died, or forsaken the profession of the Faith,
(which might have fallen out without any detriment to
the perpetuity of the Church, seeing the essence of the
Church had been preserved in the Apostles, if they only
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100839:10"/>
had continued in the faith) I say, suppose they all had
thus fallen away, yet had the Apostles been Officers, and
therefore the Heathens had been their <hi>correlatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And such indeed are clearly expressed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.
19, 20. to be the primary and immediate object of the
Apostolical Office and relation. From whence will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that a Minister may be a Minister, though he have
no particular Church to which he stands related: Just as
the Eunuch was a member of the Church visible, though
there was no particular Church into which he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>The only probable Answer which I can apprehend is
this, That the Argument no way holds from Apostles
to ordinary Ministers: But in this case I conceive it
doth. For,</p>
               <p>1. The Apostles as well as Pastors (say our Brethren)
are Officers only to the Church. <hi>Chap. 3. p.</hi> 18. they say of
Ministers, <hi>That it is lawfull for them to go and preach to
unbelievers;</hi> and they instance in the Apostles preaching
to Heathens, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. &amp; 16. <hi>and yet</hi> (say they) <hi>they are
no Officers to such unbelievers:</hi> Whereby it is plain that
they deny not only ordinary Pastors, but also Apostles to
be Officers to Heathens; which also further appears by
the reason they adde, why such Ministers are no Officers
to Heathens (which is common to Apostles with other
Ministers) viz. <hi>Because they cannot as Officers exercise
Church-government towards them;</hi> which holds true even
of the Apostles; <hi>What have we to do to judge them that are
without,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. Now if the Apostles, who were
(according to our Brethren) only Church-officers, yet
acted as Officers towards such as were wholly without the
Church, and towards Heathens, much more is it true of
ordinary Pastors, that, albeit they are Officers in special
to their particular Flock, yet they are Officers, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100839:11"/>
act as Officers, towards other Churches.</p>
               <p>2. Apostles and Pastors are paralleld in this case, <hi>Eph.</hi>
4. 11, 12. <hi>And he gave some Apostles—and some Pastors
and Teachers, For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work
of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.</hi> From
whence it is most evident, that the object of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
and Pastoral Office is one and the same, both of them
being by Office related to the Saints, not only that are
actually brought in, but also to those that are to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered:
And the Offices were appointed, and the Officers
bestowed for this very end, <hi>for the edifying of the body of
Christ:</hi> By which Body of Christ, we must with judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Interpreters, necessarily understand the whole col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of all Christs members in all ages of the Church;
all which, in Scripture phrase, go to the making up of
Christs body, so that if one of them were lacking, Jesus
Christ should want his fulnesse (as he is pleased to express
himself) <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
               <p>And answerably to this the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or edifying, is
not to be understood, as in some other places, for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of such as are brought in only, but also for the
bringing in of those who are yet without; for that indeed
was the great end why the Ministry was instituted, <hi>Mat.</hi>
28. 19, 20. And the very phrase of building, implies as well
the gathering together of stones for the building, and the
laying of the foundation, as the raising up of the building;
and the nature of the body, as we have now explained it,
necessarily requires, that this edifying should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
extensively, as well as intensively.</p>
               <p>I shall contract all this into a short Syllogism, The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ in its latitude is the <hi>correlatum,</hi> or the object
of the Pastoral Office; But the body of Christ includes
Heathens: Therefore Heathens to be converted are the
object and <hi>correlate</hi> of the Pastoral Office. The <hi>major</hi> is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100839:11"/>
plain from the Text, and what hath been said; the <hi>minor</hi>
also is no lesse evident, that Heathens are a part of Christs
body: They are called his sheep, <hi>Iohn 10. 16. Other sheep
I have which are not of this fold.</hi> Heathens to be converted
Christ laid down his life for (else they had never been
converted) and yet he laid down his life only for <hi>his body,
Eph.</hi> 5. And therefore they are his members and part of
his body, and therefore they are the object and <hi>correlate</hi>
of the Pastoral Office.</p>
               <p>And as the whole Church in all ages (to wit, including
persons yet uncalled,<note place="margin">Predestinati nondum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregati. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> but by election belonging to it) is
the <hi>correlatum</hi> of the Ministers and Ministerial Office in all
ages, so the whole Church in one age (including such as
by predestination, though not yet by actual vocation and
congregation, belong to it) is the <hi>correlate</hi> of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Ministerial Office in that one age: So that not
only a particular Church is the <hi>correlate</hi> of a Minister, but
also such as are not yet members of any particular Church,
nor of any Church at all.</p>
               <p>The second Argument may be taken from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.
where the reconcilable world, which consists of such as
are yet without and no members of the Church, are made
the chief object and <hi>correlatum</hi> of the Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;
and from thence I shall thus argue, <hi>To whom Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
act as Ambassadours, to them they act as Officers: But
Ministers preach as Ambassadours to Heathens convertible
and to be converted, Ergo.</hi> The Proposition is evident
from the terms, To be an Ambassadour, is nothing else
but to be an Officer; and it may receive further light and
strength from this consideration, that Ministers are not
Ambassadors <hi>a pari ad parem,</hi> from one King to another
as equal, but <hi>a superiori ad inferiorem,</hi> from one superiour
in authority to all; from a Prince to his subjects, whom
he is calling in; from one who may and doth require all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100839:12"/>
Heathens, as well as others, to hear and obey his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
I mean from the Lord Christ. For the Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
that Ministers preaching to Heathens, do preach
as Ambassadors (where all the doubt lies) I proceed to
make good.</p>
               <p>1. If the Scripture makes no difference between a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
preaching to his own Church and to others; then
there is no difference, <hi>Ubi lex non distinguit, non est di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguendum.</hi>
But the Scripture makes no difference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Wherever a Minister preacheth, he is to preach <hi>with all
Authority.</hi> Strangers are as well obliged to obey him as
his own people.</p>
               <p>2. Even Heathens are bound to hear Ministers preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, and that not only <hi>ex vi materiae,</hi> because of
the matter they treat of, but <hi>virtute muneris,</hi> by vertue
of their Office. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, and he
that despiseth you, despiseth me,</hi> Luke 10. 16. And therefore
as the Jews and Heathens were bound to hear Christ, not
only in regard of his message which he brings, but also in
respect of his Office as he was the Mediator and the great
Prophet in the Church, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18, 15, 19. So also it is with
Ministers, who act as in Christs stead, they are to be
heard even by Heathens, for their Office sake, as well as
for their Doctrine. And those Jews or Heathens which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed
the Doctrine of the Apostles, are not only charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the guilt of rejecting the truth, but also of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
the Persons and Offices of the Apostles, which
could not have been, if the Apostles had not preached as
Officers to such. And surely it must needs be reputed
strange doctrine, to say, that a Minister, yea an Apostle,
preaching to Heathens, doth preach no more authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
than any woman or child that is occasionally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
to such of the things of God. The Apostles
might challenge Maintenance of those Heathens to whom
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100839:12"/>
they preached, <hi>Mat. 10. 10. 1 Cor</hi> 9. which such women
and children could not pretend to; which clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
that the Apostles preached not as gifted persons,
but as Officers to them. The Apostles preaching to such
had a power authoritatively to pronounce pardon, or to
denounce wrath to them, upon their believing or disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(which are the two acts of the Keys) and which to do
requires an Office-relation to them.</p>
               <p>If it be objected that this may be true of the Apostles,
that they were Ambassadors, and preached as Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
to Heathens, and yet not true of ordinary Pastours.
I answer; either ordinary ministers are Ambassadors,
or else Christ hath not had any Ambassadors in the world
since the daies of the Apostles, But Christ hath had, and
hath Ambassadors still in the world; therefore Ministers
are ordinary Ambassadors: the <hi>Major</hi> is plain, for if only
extraordinary Officers be Ambassadors; then where
there are no such extraordinary Officers, there are no
Ambassadors: The <hi>Minor</hi> also is no lesse clear, that the
Office of Gospel Ambassadors was a continuing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and it is most ridiculous to think, that while the
design and work of the Ambassador lasts his Office
should not continue; and besides, Christ hath perpetuated
the Office, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. If it be said they are Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
indeed, but it is to their own people, not to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:
I answer, yes rather they are Ambassadors to
Heathens: for as the great work of other Ambassadors is
to make peace, so also Gospel-Ambassadors their great
businesse is to beseech men to be reconciled to God, and
therefore their principal object is not the Church who
are already supposed to be reconciled, but Heathens and
Strangers who are yet unreconciled: and seeing ordinary
Ministers preaching to Heathens, have a power upon
their repentance to remit sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> To declare their sins
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100839:13"/>
remitted officially, it must needs follow, that they are
Ambassadors to such: And the Apostle in this place as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes
both the name and work of Ambassadors unto or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Ministers, speaking in the plural number, <hi>We
then as Ambassadors,</hi> &amp;c. And he attributes the name to
himself, upon a ground common with him to ordinary
Ministers, <hi>i. e.</hi> because he besought them as in Christs
stead to be reconciled to God: and as we rightly infer the
assurance of salvation of ordinary believers from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
assurance, because he fixeth his assurance not upon
any peculiar revelation, but upon grounds common to all
Christians; so may we that are ordinary Ministers, justly
take to our selves the Name and Office of Ambassadors,
because the Apostles assum'd it upon such grounds as are
common to all Ministers: and not upon such as are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to the Apostolical Dignity.</p>
               <p>And this may suffice for the enforcement of this second
argument: but there is one block that must be removed.
It is plausibly objected by Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shepheard,</hi>
in there answer to the nine Questions, <hi>That Ministers,
though Officers to their own Flock, yet may do the acts of their
Office towards others, as a Steward of an house acteth as an
Officer in the entertainment of strangers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thus
Ministers may preach as Officers to others, and yet be only
Officers to their own Congregations.</hi> To this I answer,
1. This concerns not our Brethren here, who do possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
determine, that Ministers preaching to others, do
preach only as gifted men, not as Officers, <hi>p.</hi> 18. So that I
might without disparagement wave this Objection.
2. This is a meer fallacy, the resemblance it self is mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood
or mis-applied: for a Steward of an house, it
is true, he acts as a Steward in the entertainment of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
but how? he acts as the Steward of that house, not
as a Steward to them whom he entertains: But a Minister
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100839:13"/>
preacheth as an Officer with authority, not only in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his own Church, but any others that occasionally
hear him, as hath been proved. And yet 3. If the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
were well laid, there is a further dissimilitude in
the case in hand; for a Steward of an house is a Steward
only to that particular Family, but Ministers are Stewards
to the whole Church, all which is called one family, and
one houshold, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 15. How thou shouldst behave thy
self in the house of God.</hi> Gal. 6. 10. <hi>Do good to all, especially
the houshold of faith.</hi> Eph. 2. 19. <hi>You are fellow Citizens of
the Saints, and of the houshold of God.</hi> And the reason why
the Steward of an house is no Officer to strangers, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Lord that makes him a Steward hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to make him a Steward over strangers, nor further
then his house or jurisdiction reacheth. But Christ, who
makes Ministers Stewards, hath authority to make them
such over the whole Church, yea, over Heathens; and
indeed so he hath done, as the former Arguments have
proved: and he requires of the world to own his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
as Ambassadors, and will severely punish their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and contempt of them.</p>
               <p>The third and last argument shall be this; <hi>If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Heathens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be the principal ground and end
why the Office of the Ministry was instituted, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
work of the Ministry, then the Office of the Ministry is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to Heathens: But the conversion of Heathens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is
the principal end why the Office of the Ministry was instituted,
and the principal work of the Ministry so instituted, Therefore
the Office of the Ministry is related to Heathens.</hi> For the
<hi>major</hi> it is evident from the very terms; every Minister is
unquestionably related to those among whom his work
lies. And as it is plain in Christ Jesus, our great Bishop,
that the Church or his sheep, are his <hi>correlatum,</hi> because
his end and his work was their salvation; so also must it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100839:14"/>
needs be in Ministers, that their relation must be towards
those among whom their great work lies. For the <hi>minor</hi>
no man can doubt of it that hath read the Scriptures, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
those fore-cited places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. &amp; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>If it be said, Conversion indeed was the great work
of the Apostles, but not so of ordinary Ministers; those
were to build up what the Apostles brought in:</p>
               <p>I answer 1. Both those places do evidently relate as
well to ordinary Ministers, as to the Apostles: For <hi>Eph</hi> 4.
they are equally named; and for <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. it is clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those Ministers who are there spoken of, and set
apart for that work of the conversion of Heathens, they
are assured by God that they shall continue to the end of
the world, which is not true of the Apostles in their own
persons, unlesse to them you adde their successors, the
ordinary Ministers. And 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 5. Who is Paul, and who
is Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but Ministers by whom ye believe.</hi> And that
text will continue true to the end of the world, <hi>Faith
comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10. of ordinary Ministers, as well
as the Apostles.</p>
               <p>2. If conversion be a work common and necessary in
these daies, as well as in the Apostles daies, then Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are now appointed for that work as well as formerly
they were: For while the cause and reason remains, the
effect also must needs remain: But conversion is a work
common and necessary now as well as then; For though
men are not Heathens now as they were formerly, yet
many are but professors and titular Christians, by vertue
of their Church-membership, and so do need a work of
conversion.</p>
               <p>3. Either the ordinary Ministers of the Church were
appointed for conversion, or else Christ hath appointed
no Officers to take care of the greatest and most principal
work, which is the conversion of sinners: But this is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100839:14"/>
highly absurd that Christ should take least care, where
there was most need: and therefore ordinary Ministers
were instituted for conversion.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with the first thing, which was
to prove, that <hi>Ministers are Officers and act as Officers to
others besides their own Congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second thing propounded was, To Answer their
Arguments, and to vindicate the Arguments offered by
the Provincial Assembly against that contrary opinion, that
<hi>Ministers are Officers only to their own Congregations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the better methodizing of it, I shall first with
all brevity propound the Assemblies Arguments, then our
Brethrens Answers, and then adde a Reply: And this I
chuse to do in this place, although these things are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed
by them under another Head, <hi>p. 227, &amp;c.</hi> because
they properly concern this Question. But I shall passe
them over with more brevity, because it is but a collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Question, and our Brethren are lesse accurate in this,
than in the other point.</p>
               <p>1. This opinion is unheard of in the Church of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these late years. <hi>Provinc.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It sufficeth that it is heard of in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But you know that is denied; and for the
Churches judgement, as it is not to be advanced into
Gods throne, so it is not easily to be slighted, where there
is an universall consent of all Churches (as there is in this
case) which it is hard to shew in any Errour: <hi>Nemo paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficus
contra Ecclesiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This opinion is contrary to our Br<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>threns practise, who
hold the administration of the Sacrament to be a Ministeriall
act, and yet give it to members of other Congregations.
<hi>Provinc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this there is a double Answer given by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100839:15"/>
1. <hi>The main Answer where they lay most stresse which
therefore I propose first, is this, that</hi> In ministerial acts some
things are common to men as men, as the Word and Prayer;
some are common to them as Church members, or as confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
with any particular Church, not considering this or
another Church, as the Sacraments; other things as special
and proper to a particular Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Excommunication,
Election, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that a man may claim the Sacrament as a
confederate with any Church: And as a father giving instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to his children and servants, teacheth them as a Father
and Master; but, if strangers come in and partake of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
he teacheth them not by vertue of any such relation;
so if a Pastor preach and give the Sacrament occasionally, he
acts not as a Pastor and Officer to them. <hi>This is the strength
of what our Brethren say,</hi> p. 278, 279, 280.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. If our Brethren perceive not how they have
overshot themselves, I question not but any judicious
Reader will quickly discern it, how they are fallen from
their own principles. Indeed the Answer were tolerable,
if preaching and giving the Sacrament were of the same
nature and quality, and did proceed <hi>pari passu,</hi> but seeing
it is generally granted by our Congregational Brethren,
That Preaching is not alwaies an act of Office, and that it
is an act which may be done by Gifted men; and that the
administration of the Sacrament is alwaies an act of Office,
and cannot be done but by one in Office, it is most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruously
done to jumble these two together, and to make
them alike in this very case where they acknowledge the
difference.</p>
               <p>2. To the Sacrament two things are required, which
are warily to be distinguished; 1. A <hi>right</hi> in the Receiver
to claim, and that indeed we have in the supposed case,
according to our Brethrens principles. 2. A <hi>power</hi> in the
Giver to administer, and this none hath but an Officer,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100839:15"/>
and none can do it but as an Officer, and therefore no man
can give it to any, but to them to whom he is an Officer,
and acts as an Officer, and therefore they cannot give it
to any member of other Congregations.</p>
               <p>And this acute Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> is so sensible of, that he grants
it in <hi>terminis,</hi> using these words; <hi>Touching the partaking
of the Sacrament by some of one Congregation in another, it
hath been a course which I have ever questioned, and against
it I have alledged many Arguments, professing the course
unwarrantable, for this reason (among others) because the
administration of the Sacrament is a Ministerial act, and
cannot be done but by a Pastor or Teacher, and what authority
hath he to do it, and they to receive it from him to whom he
is no Pastor;</hi> as he is cited by <hi>Cawdry, Inconsistency of
Indep. Way,</hi> p. 203. Nor do I see how this can be fairly
avoided by any that stick to Congregational principles,
and I think such a strange paradox as this, asserted by so
considerable a person, and flowing from such principles,
may justly render them suspected to all impartial judges.</p>
               <p>And whereas our Brethren here imply the contrary,
and talk of <hi>a Pastors giving the Sacrament to strangers not
as a Pastor;</hi> 1. Let all men take notice that in this they
have deserted their own principles, and have through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy
precipitated themselves into the gulf of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism,
which, I doubt not, in their next, either their
prudence or their ingenuity will ob<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ige them to retract.
2. The Provincial Assembly were not obliged to take
notice of the excentrical opinions of every particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
man, but of those which were owned by the
generality of them, and by such as seemed to be Pillars
among them; and sure I am, such will reject this notion
of a mans giving the Sacrament as a Gifted brother. They
know the rule, <hi>Quod competit rei qua tali competit omni tali;</hi>
If a Pastor gives the Sacrament to strangers not as a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100839:16"/>
Pastor or Officer, but as a Gifted brother (for that is the
other member of the distinction) then every Gifted bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may administer the Sacrament, which I suppose our
Brethren will tremble to grant, and therefore they must
call back their own words too loosely delivered.</p>
               <p>2. But however <hi>(say they)</hi> this is an argument against
our practise, not the assertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Yes, it may give just cause of suspicion of the
truth of that assertion, which inevitably draws along with
it such a strange conclusion as this, that no man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament any where but in his own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
which is in a great measure to cut the sinews of
Christian and Church-communion; and yet for ought
either I or M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> see, either this conclusion must be
embraced, or the principle rejected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I passe on to the Reasons.</hi> There are <hi>(say the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly)</hi>
seven ill consequences which follow this assertion, That
a Minister can perform no Pastorall act out of his own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:
<hi>I shall reduce them to two or three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Then a Minister at the same time preacheth to his own
members as a Minister, and to others as a Gifted man only.</p>
               <p>2. Then a Minister baptizeth only into his own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not into the Catholick Church, contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13.
and so a Minister can baptize none but those that are members
of his own Congregation, and so there is no way to baptize
Heathens converted, nor the children of such parents as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be members of any Congregation. <hi>And here our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
bring in that Argument mentioned by the Provinc.</hi>
That a Minister Ministerially admits into and ejects out of
the Church-Catholick, and therefore is a Minister of the
Church-Catholick, and not only of his particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>p.</hi> 281, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Let us now hear what our Brethren have to Answer.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They say,</hi> We see no absurdity in saying that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100839:16"/>
preacheth to some as an Officer, and at the same time
preacheth to others not as an Officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. This is a conceit for which there is no shadow
in the Scripture: Nay it is not only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
not only <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> the evidence of Scripture.
Ministers wherever, or to whomsoever they do the work
of Ambassadors, whomsoever they beseech to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
to them they act as Ambassadors: And whose sins
soever they remit Doctrinally (which is an act of Office)
they are remitted; and whose sins soever they retain, in
preaching, they are retained, whether their hearers be
strangers, or of their own Congregation: And this they
do by vertue of their Office. Surely it is very harsh to
say that all strangers which hear a Minister, are no more
bound to hear and obey him, then to hear or obey any
woman discoursing privately of those things; and that a
stranger rej<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cting his message, is no way guilty of the
contempt of his Office, (it will be an happy thing if that
will be a sufficient plea at the last day.) Nay by this rule
the very Apostles themselves (as we have more largely
seen) must, when preaching to Heathens, be canton'd
into the order of Gifted men; and if that be true, it was
no act of their Office to disciple Nations, and to gather in
the Saints: And all those Heathens which are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by Ministers, are not converted by vertue of the
Ministers Office, nor was the Office of the Ministry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the gathering in of souls, but only for the
building up of such as are brought in, contrary to <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
&amp; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. as hath been argued.</p>
               <p>2. They argue against that position, <hi>That a man is made
a member of the Church by Baptism,</hi> p. 284. whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is none of our assertion, and so all that labour,
both of theirs and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hookers</hi> is lost. They cannot but
know that we allow Infants to be born Church-members,

and make their Church-membership the ground of their

this only we say, That the solemn, publick and visible
way of admission of members into the Church, is by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism;
and this cannot be easily denied by any one that
looks either to the Jewish or Christian Church: For as
since the New Testament began, it hath alwaies been the
door of admission, so was it also unto Proselytes in the
Old Testament, who used to be admitted into the Jewish
Church by Baptism,<note place="margin">right foot. Hammond. Selden.</note> as divers Learned Men have proved.
Or if our Brethren question that, yet at least, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
(to which our Baptism answers) was the door of
admission into the Jewish Church. But of this more

                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Here two things are opposed which may be
conjoyned; For both the person ejects himself, and the
Minister ejects him: He ejects himself meritoriously, the
Minister efficiently and juridically.</p>
               <p>2. Either a Minister ejecting a man justly out of his
own Church, ejects him out of all other Churches (and
that cannot be but by vertue of a Catholick Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
or he is not juridically ejected out of other Churches, and
so he is in a capacity of being received into other
Churches, (which what horrid confusion it would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
into the Church of God, and how incongruous it is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100839:17"/>
unto his wisdom, <hi>in whom are hid all the treasures of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and knowledge,</hi> to appoint a remedy so short and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
for the disease, I leave to all sober men to judge.)
And this is not a bare suggestion, for experience shews
that the effect of this principle is such, and persons juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically
and justly ejected out of one Church, have been
admitted into another Church (who it may be, apprehend
him to have been unjustly dealt with) and according to
this principle there is no remedy, but so it must be.</p>
               <p>3. For the ejecting of Officers, I say, 1. That a Church
in their sense, <hi>i. e.</hi> the body of the people, hath no power
of ejecting of Officers, as our Brethren suppose. 2. That
when a Minister is juridically ejected out of Office in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church by deposition, he ceaseth to be an Officer
to the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>They say,</hi> according to our way also we cannot baptize
Heathens, for if there be a Catholick Church, Ministers are
only Officers in the Church, and not to the Heathens conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
so cannot baptize them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Ministers are Officers not only to those that are
actually members of the Church, but to all that shall be
brought in, as we have shewn; they are Officers even to
Heathens, in the sense before explained, as they do <hi>ex
officio</hi> offer them a pardon, and give it upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
so they do <hi>ex officio</hi> admit them into the
Church.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>They say,</hi> in such a case Heathens may joyn as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to some Church, and so be baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Our Brethren should not obtrude such uncouth
notions upon the world without evident proof. Their
answer implies as if there were some other way whereby a
man might be made a compleat Church-member, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Baptism, whereas in Scripture there is <hi>ne <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> quidem</hi>
of any other door of admission: If there be, let our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100839:18"/>
shew it; sure we are the New Testament way was
by Baptism. But of this more by and by.</p>
               <p>And this is all of any moment which our Brethren
have to say by way of Answer to the foregoing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Another Argument used by the Provincial Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
was this, that</hi> From hence it will follow, that when a
Minister leaves, or is put from his particular Charge, he
ceaseth to be a Minister; and so when he taketh up a new
Charge, he needs a new Ordination, which is absurd, because
every Minister is seated in the Catholick Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. And as a private Christian removing from his
Church, doth not cease to be a member of the visible Church
(for then his Baptism should cease, for every baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is a Church-member) and needs not to be baptized a new;
so a Minister going from a Congregation, needs not to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
a new.</p>
               <p>To this our Brethren Answer divers things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They say,</hi> This runs into direct Anabaptism, for by
this rule, an Excommunicate person ceasing to be a member,
his Baptism ceaseth, and so he needs to be re-baptized when
he is re-admitted. <hi>p.</hi> 292.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> I. But this followeth not for a double reason.</p>
               <p>1. It may be said, that an Excommunicate person or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
is a member, though a diseased member, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi>
3.—<hi>Admonish him as a brother.</hi> He towards whom I owe
the duty of a fellow-member, is a fellow-member: But
I owe the duty of a fellow-member, <hi>viz.</hi> fraternal admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
to such an one. Again, He who is under a Church
Ordinance appointed for his good, is a Church-member,
though diseased, and under cure: But such an one is under
an Ordinance, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Though his Baptism ceaseth at present actual<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y and
really, as to all the actual priviledges of it, and so ceaseth,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100839:18"/>
that while he repents not, he is to be looked upon after a
sort, as an unbaptized person, or as an Heathen; yet when
he doth repent and renew his Covenant, and re-admit
himself to the Church, he needs no new Baptism, for as
much as God is pleased to impute to him his former Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism,
and the Church accepts of it; And this is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of his repentance, that God looks upon his sins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of, as if they had never been committed, and so
in that case he looks on him, as if he had never fallen
from his Baptism; and so he needs no new one: Just as
it was in the case of Circumcision, when any turned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
or Idolater, and renounced his Circumcision, he was
to be reputed as an Heathen, while such; and yet when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he repented, he needed no new Circumcision, but
his former Circumcision was accepted by God for him.</p>
               <p>II. The Argument fals upon our Brethrens principles,
not upon ours: For to us (who assert that Baptism is the
door of admission into the Catholick Church) it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted,
that a man removing from one Church,
may be admitted to any other, because his Baptism gave
him a compleat visible and political membership, not only
with that Church he was admitted into, but with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
And this membership and Baptism, though they
were lost in the sense before spoken, yet upon his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
are recovered. But our Brethren, who make Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
only the door of admission into a particular Church,
they must own this conclusion, That upon every removal
there must be a new Baptism. Even as it is in civil Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
which because they are distinct from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and there is no general Corporation of which each
of these are members, therefore whenever a member pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from one to another, he needs to be admitted a new,
by what way soever they use in the admission of members.
And to save them from this intollerable inconvenience,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100839:19"/>
they have no shelter but one, which comes in the next
place.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> Baptism doth not admit, or make a man to
stand in relation to any Church, either general or particular,
but it is a solemn sign of a persons taking the Name of Christ
upon him, and therefore that remains wherever he removes.
<hi>pag.</hi> 293.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Our Brethren granted even-now, that Baptism
was a sign of a mans admission to the Church.</p>
               <p>2. This may well stand with its being a sign of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
taking the Name of Christ, nay indeed it is the same
thing in substance, for what is a Church but a company
of men professing the Name of Christ? and what then is
it to be a solemn sign of a mans admission into the Church,
but to be a solemn sign of his being a professor of the
Name of Christ?</p>
               <p>3. What a monstrous paradox is this, <hi>Baptism makes
not a man to stand in relation to any Church:</hi> This should
not have been dictated without any proof, but demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by clear evidences, it being against the judgement
of the whole Church. Surely the Apostle was not of this
mind, when he said, <hi>We are all baptized into one body,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. By which it is most evident, that Baptism
gives a man relation to some Body, and it is also plain that
he speaks of a visible body, because it is an organical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
having the distinction of <hi>teachers</hi> and <hi>taught,</hi> &amp;c.
And this Body, if it be the Church Catholick, (as we
say, and as the place proves, for as much as Jews and
Gentiles are all members of it) then we have our desire:
If it be a Church particular, then Baptism makes us to
stand in relation to such a Church. And if this were
meant of the invisible body, and this Baptism of internal
Baptism, yet it rationally follows, that as the inward
Baptism makes a man stand in relation to the invisible
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100839:19"/>
Church, so doth the external Baptism make him stand in
relation to the visible Church. Again, That which makes
a man visibly stand in relation to Christ, that makes him
visibly to stand in relation to the Church: But Baptism
makes a man visibly to stand in relation to Christ, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
The <hi>major</hi> is plain, because the Church and the Church
only, and the members of it, stand in visible relation to
Christ: The <hi>minor</hi> is evident from <hi>Rom 6. 3. Know ye
not that so many of us as were baptized into Iesus Christ,
were baptized into his death.</hi> Gal. 3. 27. <hi>For as many of you
as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ;</hi>
Therefore Baptism makes a man stand in relation to the
Church. Again, That which makes a man visibly to
stand in a Covenant relation, makes a man to stand in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to a Church: But Baptism makes a man visibly to
stand in a Covenant relation; <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> cannot
be denied, because of the identity of a Covenant and
Church relation: All and only they that are really in
Covenant, are really members of the invisible Church:
And all and only such as are visibly in Covenant, are
members of the visible Church: The <hi>minor</hi> must needs
be granted by every one that understands the nature of
Baptism: Baptism is the seal of the Covenant; and to say
the seal of the Covenant makes not a man to stand in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Covenant, is a contradiction. Lastly, That
which makes a man capable of Church-priviledges, makes
him stand in relation to a Church: But Baptism makes a
man capable of Church-priviledges, <hi>v. g.</hi> of the Supper,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which unbaptized persons are not capable of) <hi>Ergo</hi>
it makes a man stand in relation to a Church. So then
this paradox being disproved (that I may reduce these
things to my main scope) and it being evident that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
makes a man stand in relation to some Church, and
that visible too (which all grant) it remains either that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100839:20"/>
there is a Catholick visible Church, to which Baptism
makes a man to stand related; or if the Church into
which it admits a man be only a particular Church, then
upon every removal, there must be, as a new admission, so
a new Baptism.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They say,</hi> An Officer may be said to be set in the whole
Church, though his authority reacheth only to a part: as it
may be said, There are set in the Commonwealth, Iustices,
Constables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet this proves not that besides their
relation to their Precincts, they have a relation to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and a power to act there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. That phraseology sufficiently implies that the
Commonwealth, wherein they are set, is one Political
body, and so <hi>a pari,</hi> that phrase, <hi>God hath set in the Church,</hi>
whatsoever that Church is, it proves it to be one Political
body.</p>
               <p>2. The case wholly differs, for Justices, Constables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
have limited Commissions, confined to their particular
Precincts; whereas the Commission of Ministers is large
and universal (as hath been proved.) If our Brethren
would chuse a fit resemblance, let them take it from that
of the Empire before mentioned, wherein the Princes are
set in and over the whole Empire, and he that shall say,
In the Empire are set Princes, States, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall imply that
such Princes and States, besides their special relation to
their particular Territories, have another relation to the
whole Empire.</p>
               <p>3. It is not barely the phrase we rest upon, but the
sense and the explication of the phrase given us by other
Scriptures, and which necessity requires in this place, as
plainly appears from the Apostles, who were so set in the
Church, that they were also set over the Church; so are
not Justices, they are in, not over the Commonwealth;
and who, besides a special relation to their particular parts
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100839:20"/>
(which we have before discoursed of,) have also a relation
to, and over the whole Church: And so have other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to, <hi>suo modo,</hi> as hath been proved; and both Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Ministers are equalized in this, that they are in
and over the whole Church, and so have a relation to it.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>They say,</hi> The Church, in 1 Cor. 12. may be taken for
this or that Church; and so the body to be edified, for this or
that particular body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> That cannot be, for it is one Church in which
all the Apostles and Ministers are set, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. It is one
body which all the Apostles and Pastors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were given
to edifie and perfect. It is that body into which we all are
baptized, both Jews and Gentiles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. It is that
one body which is Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> mystical, which is made
up of all the members of Christ, <hi>v.</hi> 12. It is that one body
which is called the whole body, <hi>Eph. 4. 16. From whom the
whole body fitly joyned together,</hi> &amp;c. And surely he had
need have a good confidence of his abilities, that will
assert, that all this is true of a particular Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Argument used by the Provincial Assembly
was this,</hi> That hence it follows that if a people unjustly
through covetousnesse, starve a Minister from them, or through
heresie or schism vote him down, in that case it is in their
power to nullifie the Office of a Minister.</p>
               <p>To this our Brethren answer <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, That</p>
               <p>1. Though the people sin, yet indeed they do nullifie the
Office of a Minister, as if they should murther a Minister, they
nullifie his Office, and if they may debar him from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of his Office, why may they not make void his Office?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Our Brethren confound two things vastly
differing, to wit, the nullifying of the Office, and the
hindring of the exercise of the Office; It is true, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
opposition, nay indeed one mans violence may hinder
the exercise, but cannot nullifie the Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100839:21"/>
2. I demand whether this hold of the Apostles or no:
The Apostles were made Officers to the Church only,
(say our Brethren) and they say they were constituted
Officers by the Church, alledging <hi>Acts</hi> 1. (although the
Scripture tell us the Apostles were <hi>neither of man, nor by
man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>) Well then, this being premised, Suppose when
the Catholick Church was confined to one Congregation,
this Congregation had proved hereticall, and voted down
the Apostles: I only suppose it, and suppositions are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by all, and to deny that liberty is a tergiversation:
Nor doth this supposition imply any contradiction to that
promise that God hath made, that he will preserve his
Church, for that might have been preserved in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
alone. I now <hi>Quaere,</hi> Whether in this case the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Office had been null or no?</p>
               <p>If they affirm it, as it is a strange assertion, so it is also
false: For 1. The Apostles were not constituted by man,
and therefore their Office could not be nullified by man.
2. The Apostles in such a case had a power officially and
authoritatively to denounce the wrath of God against
them, <hi>Mat. 10. 14. And whosoever shall not receive you, nor
hear your words, when ye depart—shake off the dust of your
feet.</hi> 3. They were Apostles even to Heathens to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
as we have proved.</p>
               <p>If they deny it, I prove it thus, that it must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from their principles: For</p>
               <p>1. The Church being, according to them, the adequate
<hi>correlatum</hi> of the Apostles, the Church ceasing, they must
needs cease also.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Ejusdem est instituere &amp; destituere,</hi> and seeing they
allow the institution and constitution of the Apostles to
the people.</p>
               <p>3. I thus disprove that monstrous paradox: That
which renders it in the power of mens lusts or humours
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100839:21"/>
to nullifie the promises of Christ, the authority, end and
use of Christs Ambassadors, is most absurd. That which
makes it in the power of men, whether there shall be any
Officially to preach peace, to remit sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is highly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
But such is this doctrine. I prove the <hi>minor</hi> by
these steps; 1. There are now none but ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in the Church. 2. The essence of a Minister (say our
Brethren) consists in relation to a particular Church,
which is his <hi>correlatum,</hi> and <hi>sublato uno relatorum tollitur
alterum,</hi> so that when that relation ceaseth, his Ministry
ceaseth. 3. It is in the power of the people to dissolve
that relation, to eject a Minister; so say our Brethren, and
it is generally asserted by Congregational men. 4. That
which one Congregation may do, another may do, and
so every one may do: Suppose then that there are twenty,
and but twenty Congregations in the world, if each of
these resolve severally to eject their Ministers, through
covetousnesse, heresie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say, then it is in the power
of these men to falsifie Christs word, and destroy the
authority, end and use of Christs Ambassadors. But you
will say, it is in the power of men to kill these Ministers,
one as well as another, and so thereby, as well as by our
way, it is in the power of men to disanull the promise of
Christ. And therefore as it would be answered in that
case, that the bones of Christ were breakable, yet by
divine providence were kept from being broken; so
though it is <hi>remotè</hi> in the power of men to kill all those
Ministers, yet God will restrain them from the act of
killing them, that he may keep his promise; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
though it is in the power of such Churches to depose
them, yet God will hinder the act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Answer the case is wholly different, the one is an act
of horrid violence, the other a juridical act, and here is the
great inconvenience for a man to assert, that Jesus Christ
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100839:22"/>
hath given to every Congregation a juridical power to
depose their Ministers when ever they please, for the
power of judging is left by our Brethren in their hands;
and to disanul an Ordinance of Christ, and to punish an
Officer and Ambassador of Christ without his fault, and
without all hope of remedy: In what a sad condition
were Gospel Ministers, if it were in the power of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon every <hi>Capricio,</hi> when ever the humour takes
them, to rob a godly Minister, it may be for the faithful
discharge of his duty among them, of that which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
better than a world, and that without any possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of redresse, forasmuch as he hath none to make his
appeal to. How secure might a people be in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
if when a Minister reproves them sharply for their
sins, they might take away from their Minister the power
of reclaiming their sins, or officially denouncing wrath
against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they have a second Answer to relieve them.</hi> If such
a rejection of their Officers do not nullifie his Office, the reason
is, because he is <hi>de jure,</hi> and of right still over that Church as
their Officer, though hindred from the exercise of his Office.</p>
               <p>And this indeed is much more tolerable than the other,
but our Brethren have lost the benefit of this refuge, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as they positively acknowledge, that the people
have a power to annull his Office: And besides it helps
them not at all; for if the people, and they only, they
beyond appeal, have a full juridical power of deposing and
rejecting their Ministers (as our Brethren hold) then
they only have a power to judge whether the cause of the
deposition be just or unjust, and be it just, or unjust, the
Minister hath no way but to acquiesce in their sentence;
for if once this gap were opened, either in Church
or State, that a person judged and censured might
thwart the judgment of the supream Court, by his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100839:22"/>
private opinion, it would introduce intolerable confusion:
It is true in such a case he may appeal to God, and find
comfort in this, that <hi>in fero Dei</hi> his cause is good, but as
for the <hi>forum humanum</hi> he is gone irrecoverably: And
however neighbouring Churches, or Ministers may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to convince and rectifie such a Church, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them to own him as their Minister, yet, if they
will persist, they must all be contented, and he must not
be owned for a Minister. And thus much may serve for
the Vindication of those Arguments which were urged
by the Assembly.</p>
               <p>I shall now take notice of two or three of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their chief Argument is this:</hi> A Minister is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour
only to his own Flock: But it is only a particular Church
which is his Flock; <hi>Ergo</hi> He is a Pastour only to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church: The <hi>minor</hi> is proved thus, All that is a
mans <hi>Flock,</hi> he is commanded actually to feed, and to take
heed to, and he sins if he do not, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. But no Bishop
is commanded actually to feed the whole Church, <hi>Ergo</hi> the
whole Church is not his Flock, <hi>p.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The <hi>major</hi> of the first Syllogisme is untrue: A
Minister is a Pastour to his own Flock <hi>especially,</hi> but not
<hi>only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>major</hi> of the second Syllogism is denied, A
Minister is not obliged actually to feed all his Flock; and
I suppose I shall give an unanswerable reason for the deniall
of it: Every Apostle was a Catholick Pastour, and so
had the whole Church for his Flock, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. Here
our Brethren are consenters: But every Apostle was not
obliged actually to feed the whole Church, and all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they neither did it, nor was it possible for them to do
it, and therefore their work was divided among them;
the Circumcision being more especially committed to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:100839:23"/>
and the uncircumcision to <hi>Paul:</hi> And yet, although
by this distribution, <hi>Paul</hi> had a special relation to the
Gentiles, and was obliged to feed them more especially,
yet he had upon him the care of all the Churches, and
it was his duty, as far as his ability and occasions reached,
to feed the whole Church, and no farther: And so it is
with ordinary Ministers, though they are especially obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to feed their own Flocks, and indeed can do no more
constantly, yet according to their ability and opportunity
they are bound to feed the whole Church, by teaching,
and consulting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is the only Argument
urged formally in this place against our Assertion.
But because there are some other passages which seem to
be argumentative, though scattered elsewhere, I thought
fit to do them that right, as to bring them in here, that
so the Reader might see all their strength together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their second Argument is this;</hi> This makes the power of
ordinary Ministers as extensive and large as that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I Answer plainly and clearly, that the difference
between Apostolical and Pastoral power lies not in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their relation (If any assert it, let them prove it)
but in the independency, superiority, and singularity of
jurisdiction, which, if it be not sufficient to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Apostles, and ordinary Ministers, besides their
excellent and infallible gifts, I dare make our Brethren
Judges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their third Argument is this;</hi> Ministers are only Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
to them whom they can govern, as well as teach: but
Ministers cannot exercise Church-Government towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
for they are not their Flock; and therefore in preaching
to Heathens they act not as Officers, but as gifted brethren, <hi>p.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>The Answer to this is not difficult; If the not exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Government be a sufficient foundation for this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100839:23"/>
that a Minister preacheth not to such as a Pastour,
then the Apostles did not preach as Officers to Heathens,
for towards such they could not exercise Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>What have I to do to judge them that are without,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. But the Apostles did preach as Officers to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
which hath been already fully proved.</p>
               <p>Their fourth Argument is; <hi>That this brings in Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to make one man an Officer over many Churches.</hi> And this
Argument I have often wondred to meet in all sorts of
<hi>anti</hi>-Presbyterians, Greeks, and Barbarians, wise and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
learned and unlearned, all agree in this charge;
and they prosecute it with so much confidence, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernesse,
that if a man had so much charity, or so little
judgment as to beleeve them, he would think there were
no difference between <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Answer, to omit other differences which might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, as 1. That the Episcopal way leaves to inferiour
Ministers nothing but the Name and Title of Officers, all
power of jurisdiction being ingrossed into the Bishops
hands; whereby all other Ministers are made a strange
kind of men, being Officers without Office, Rulers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas in the Presbyterian way, every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Officer is confessedly invested with, and hath liberty
for the exercise of his Office, and power as need requires.</p>
               <p>2. That Government by Bishops, is a Government by
forreigners, as it were, the power of Ruling being neither
in the hands of the people, nor of any chosen by them,
(as it is in the Presbyterian way) but in the hands of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
wholly extraneous to most of the Churches they rule,
and generally, neither knowing of, nor known to those
whom they undertake to govern. But I wave these things
and many other, as being extravagant in this place: This
only I observe for the present purpose.</p>
               <p>The formality of Episcopacy lies in this, in the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100839:24"/>
of one Pastour to another, and to many other; and
of one Church to all the rest in a Diocesse; not in the
superiority of a Colledge of Pastors, or convention of
Churches over one Pastour or Church: Will any indite
the Apostles for introducing Episcopacy, because all the
Apostles met together, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. did assume a superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over <hi>Paul,</hi> (who was there met, as the rest, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of an Elder) and examine and judge of his Doctrine?
Shall any man say the united Provinces in the low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are under a Monarchy, because every particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is subject and accountable to the rest of the
Governours, the States Generall? this no man will say
but he that understands not the difference between Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by one, and by many: And therefore it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
absurd to charge us with Episcopacy, because we
would have every particular Officer and Church subject
(not to any one man, that, and that alone is Episcopacy)
but to a convetion of Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore for
the future I shall desire our Brethren to forbear such frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and intemperate accusations. And this is all that I
shall say to this present Question, closing only with this
intimation, that I principally recommend the serious and
impartial consideration of what is here said, unto such, who
though they professe they will be ordained (and we are
obliged to believe their professions) yet for the present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
it, because they are not called to any particular
charge; I hope what hath been said will satisfie some at
least, that although it is convenient that every Minister
should have relation to some one Church, yet he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a relation to the whole, and his relation to a particular
Church as a Lecturer is foundation fully sufficient for his
Ordination.</p>

the Question, that being fully done in the Assemblies.
Book. These things only I shall say,</p>
                  <p>1. We speak of persons truly gifted, not every one
that conceits himself to be gifted; not of them, who, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in their own conceits they are gifted, yet indeed
have need to be instructed in the Principles of Religion:
And that is the true case of many of our gifted preachers in
<hi>England:</hi> For such our Brethren say they do not plead,
and yet I cannot tell what to make of this, if it look not
that way, when they say, <hi>Though one that is really gifted,
for ought we know may lawfully preach without approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from the Church or others, yet it may be inexpedient;</hi> so
that hereby it is left to every man (as to the lawfulnesse
of it) to judge of his gifts, and to preach, if he think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
fit. This also must be said, that the assertion of this
Doctrine was that which opened the gap unto all that crew,
and which hath been the unhappy occasion of involving
this poor Church and Nation in those crouds of errors
and confusion which are now too rise amongst us.</p>
                  <p>2. We dispute not what may be done in cases of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
either in preaching to Heathens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in order to trial, (which is necessary to take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of a mans sufficiency for the Work.)</p>
                  <p>3. We do not in this place restrain Ordination to our
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100839:25"/>
way of Ordination: Whether it belongs to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
or to the people to ordain, we are not concerned in
this Question, which is barely this: <hi>Whether a solemn
mission or setting apart be necessary for a mans ordinary
preaching?</hi> Our Brethren deny. We affirm.</p>
                  <p>But for the full understanding of the Question, I refer
the Reader to our <hi>Ius Divinum;</hi> wherein, because out
Brethren acquarrell some things, I shall take notice of what
deserves Animadversion.</p>
                  <p>The main thing is this, They find fault with the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
given of Preaching, and they say, <hi>Any publishing,
opening or applying Gospel-truths to any persons for the uses
and ends they serve to, yea though it be but to a single person,</hi>
is Preaching. By this rule we are all Preachers, bond and
free, male and female, wise and unwise, seeing this is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
done by persons of all sorts, and in this sense, both
men and women are said <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, such preaching we dispute
not against, but enjoyn it to people of all sorts. In that
sense we do, as <hi>Moses,</hi> wish that <hi>all the Lords people were
Prophets:</hi> This is that which upon all occasions we press
private Christians to; that they would instruct the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
admonish the unruly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> privately. And truly
this businesse conscienciously managed, would so take up
the gifts and time of most Christians, that they would
never be charged at the last day for wrapping their Talents
in a napkin, though they never assumed the publick work
of the Ministry.</p>
                  <p>It is then publick Preaching that we dispute against, we
will not quarrell about words: If that shall be Preaching
which our Brethren will call so, be it so; then in that
sense we dispute not against Preaching, but Preaching
publikely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is another thing which they cannot digest, to wit,
the distinction which we made between Preaching, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100839:25"/>
the speaking of a General to his Army,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wherein the</hi>
object is a Congregation, not sacred, but meerly civil, <hi>&amp;c.
To this they say,</hi> It is preaching, though the object of it be
a Congregation not sacred, but prophane and Idolatrous, for
Infidels are to be preached to: And if the General of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
open and apply Scriptures, not for a civil end chiefly, but
for the instruction and edification of those he speaks to, and
this, not in an intermixed way to qualifie civil actions, how
this can be denied to be preaching, we know not.</p>
                  <p>To which I Reply, 1. In that case we must distinguish
between <hi>finis operis,</hi> and <hi>finis operantis;</hi> the end of the
work in its own nature, and the end of the worker. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Philosophy Professor is reading a Philosophicall
Lecture of the existence of God, or the immortality of
the soul, (wherein he takes occasion to open and apply
divers Scriptures) possibly he being a good man, may
aim at the spiritual and eternal good of his hearers, yet
none will call this preaching, because though the end of
the Reader was, their salvation, yet the end of the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was quite of another nature. So if a religious General
in speaking to his Army, when going to fight, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
aims at the salvation of their souls, yet this is not
preaching; for though his end in speaking be their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet indeed the end of the work in it self (and that
is it by which all actions must be estimated, for the end
of the actors may be various and infinite) I say, the end of
the work is to encourage them to the battel.</p>
                  <p>2. A company of Heathens met together in the case
supposed, though they are not a sacred Congregation, yet
the end of their meeting (suppose to hear <hi>Paul</hi> preach to
them) is sacred, I mean, the end of the work, though
not the end of the workers; and however it is with the
hearers, yet the end of the actor or speaker is purely and
solely the salvation of their souls; and so it is truly,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100839:26"/>
and may properly be called Preaching.</p>
                  <p>3. But in this case, I say, a General may not publickly
open and apply Scriptures to his Army, unlesse in a case
of necessity, or in order to a civil end, <hi>i. e.</hi> their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to battel.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more in the stating of the Question,
which they trouble themselves much about, concerning
our sense in the use of that phrase of authoritative preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and how they tell us, that <hi>Authority is sometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for a right or power to do some publick work; sometimes
for the majesty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fervor and gravity which is to attend the
dispensation of the Gospel; sometimes for that power which
an Officer hath over his people; and</hi> (say they) <hi>we judge
that our Brethren take authoritative preaching in this sense,
because they oppose it to brotherly charitative preaching.</hi>
But this is to seek a knot in a bulrush, for our meaning
was sufficiently plain, and we did not speak of an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
preaching, as if we did allow any publick preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which is not authoritative, but only put it as a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of, and convertible with publick preaching (unlesse
in cases of necessity) and so the Assembly expressed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
clearly and fully; <hi>We distinguish,</hi> say they, <hi>between
a private, brotherly teaching,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and an authoritative pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-teaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is all I shall say for the stating of the Question,
which now I come to discusse, and I shall do it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in
this method:</p>
                  <p>1. I shall propound and Answer their Arguments.</p>
                  <p>2. I shall propound and Vindicate our Arguments.

farre as I can with any conveniency.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>THeir first Argument is this:</p>
               <p>Election must go before Ordination: But a person
must preach, yea preach frequently and ordinarily, before Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
for without this the people cannot discern his gifts, <hi>&amp;c.
Ergo</hi> Persons not Ordained may ordinarily preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They know their <hi>major</hi> is not beyond excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but I let that passe, because afterwards we shall han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
it more fully.</p>
               <p>2. For their <hi>minor,</hi> if it be true, then preaching fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and ordinarily in that case is necessary, <hi>i. e.</hi> for
the trial of their gifts, and that we dispute not about, but
whether out of a case of necessity one may preach ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
without Ordination.</p>
               <p>But this first Argument I suppose they intended only for
Velitation: Their second Argument is the <hi>Achilles,</hi> which
I must now come to grapple with. There are two pillars
of their cause, Scripture precept, and Scripture example
alledged; and indeed either of these shall serve turn: But
we must not take them upon their bare word, but weigh
what they have said in the ballance of the Sanctuary. It
is Scripture precept which is here discussed.</p>
               <p>Their second Argument then is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such as are commanded to preach may preach: But some
men not Ordained are commanded to preach;</hi> Ergo. The
<hi>minor</hi> they prove thus; <hi>All that are apt to teach, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to teach:</hi> This they attempt to prove from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
4. 10, 11. but by their favour let us adde <hi>v.</hi> 9. to it, for our
Brethren represent the place <hi>imagint luscâ,</hi> with an half
face. The whole <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is this, <hi>v. 9. Use hospitality one to
another without grudging.</hi> V. 10. <hi>As every man hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100839:27"/>
good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> V. 11. <hi>If any
man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
let him do it as of the ability which God giveth.</hi>
Where any indifferent Reader will observe the words
mainly insisted upon, to be like a little <hi>Isthmus</hi> of land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two seas, to either of which it may be related: Or
like a tree standing in the confines of two Counties, it
being hard to determine to which County it belongs.
It may look backward and relate to hospitality; It may
look forward and relate to speaking and ministring; and
the words will bear either sense, but both senses it cannot
bear, that being an undoubted truth, that <hi>Sensus unius
loci literalis non est nisi unicus;</hi> and to demonstrate that it
must relate to this, and cannot relate to the other, will be
found very difficult, if not impossible: And yet upon
this doubtfull place our Brethren hang the weight of their
Cause.</p>
               <p>I find a threefold sense given of these words: Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it to the gift of speaking by any, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others, to the
Office of speakers. Others, to the giving of Alms: Of
these I shall speak in order, premising onely one thing,
(which is well suggested by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Collings) i. e.</hi> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the sense of the place is if it be a command to preach,
yet this Epistle being written to strangers, and in a scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
estate of the Church; that might be lawfull to them
in that case of necessity, which otherwise is unlawfull:
But I will not presse that too far.</p>
               <p>First then, Their sense is this; That whatsoever gift a
man hath he is required to exercise it; if he hath a gift to
preach, and that publickly, he must preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to
prove this sense, I observe they use three Arguments,
which I shall propound and consider.</p>
               <p>1. It is a gift indefinitely, and therefore it may extend to
all gifts. <hi>p.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:100839:27"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. And suppose it do extend to all gifts, it is a
truth granted by us, that whatsoever gift a man hath, he
ought to exercise it, but still, as he is called to it, and in his
own sphear.</p>
               <p>2. Nothing more usual then for an expression indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in words, to be definite in sense, and to be limited
<hi>pro subjectâ materiâ,</hi> according to the matter in hand. It
would be vanity to multiply instances in a case so known.
If our Brethren were discoursing with an Arminian, about
the extent of Christs death, who should urge the word
<hi>world,</hi> and <hi>mankind,</hi> and infer as they do, that the word
being indefinite, it is to be taken of all mankind, they
would quickly find an answer, that such indefinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
are to be compared with, and explained by other
places, where they are restrained; and the same Answer
may stop the mouth of this Argument: So that to argue
from the indefinitenesse of the phrase is but loose rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> This general expression must be interpreted
and limited by that which follows, <hi>If any man speak,</hi> &amp;c.
pag. 33.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It may every whit as well be limited and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
by the foregoing words, and if so, then all that
our Brethren say from these words fals to the ground.</p>
               <p>2. If it must be limited by the following words, so it
may, without any prejudice to our cause, in this manner,
<hi>v.</hi> 10. he laies this down in the general, that every man
that hath a gift must use it; then in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verse,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceth
in two sorts of men that have received gifts, to
wit, Ministers and Deacons, who must be carefull to use
their gifts, and therefore in like manner all others are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to use the gifts that God hath given them: Or if
they will not allow these to be Officers, it may be limited,
according to their own apprehensions, that as every man
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100839:28"/>
in general is to use his gifts, so in particular every man
that hath preaching gifts is to use them; but how? <hi>i. e.</hi> as
far as God doth call him forth to the use of them, but no
further; and to us there appears no ordinary way now
of Gods calling forth men to this work, but by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They argue from the particle As;</hi> As he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<hi>i. e.</hi> according to the nature of his gift, he that hath
private gifts, must use them privately; he that hath publick
gifts, <hi>i. e.</hi> gifts fit for publick use, must use them publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>p.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may well be understood cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally,
because he hath received it.</p>
               <p>2. And if it be meant thus (which we say is a truth)
that God expects an use of talents, proportionable to what
he gives, yet every one must act in his order, and in his
place and sphear, and as God cals him forth, as we shall
see more fully by and by.</p>
               <p>3. But what if this proportion be meant of Almes-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving?
then all that they say fals to the ground.</p>
               <p>Thus we have seen how our Brethren sense this place,
and what are the reasons that prevail with them so to do,
which whether they be of that consequence as to justifie
them in the holding of an opinion so offensive to thousands
of sincere Christians, and so introductory of all confusion,
I leave to sober Readers to judge. And yet their own
sense doth draw after it such grosse and manifest absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that they dare not abide by it absolutely, but quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it with an exception sufficient to invalidate all their
Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They say,</hi> By this text all gifted persons are commanded
to preach, unlesse there can be shewn some Scripture-prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to forbid their preaching. <hi>p.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>To which I reply two things; 1. Hereby the plea is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100839:28"/>
removed to another Court, and the Question lies here,
Whether elsewhere there be any prohibition? which must
be judged afterwards, by comparing our Arguments and
their Answers.</p>
               <p>2. It lies not upon us to shew a prohibition to restrain
them from preaching, but upon them to shew a warrant
for preaching (seeing for instituted worship we must have
a positive warrant) which this place we see affords not,
and whether any other place affords, we shall see hereafter.
But we must not yet part with our Brethrens Argument
from this place. There are three or four difficulties with
which it is gravel'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first is that urged by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  </hi> Collins, Here is not only a
liberty granted, but a duty enjoined, so that by this Text,
gifted persons not only may, but must preach, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
election or calling, for the Churches neglect of their duty,
must not make him neglect his.</p>
               <p>The full vindication of this, I shall leave to that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Author, but I cannot wholly let it go untouched:
I shall form the Argument thus, They who are by vertue
of a divine precept to preach the Gospel, are to do it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily,
<hi>Necessity is laid upon me, yea, wo is unto me if I preach
not the Gospel,</hi> they are to do it in season and out of season,
they are to give themselves wholly to these things, they
are not to leave the Word of God to serve tables: But all
that have preaching gifts are not under such obligations,
our Brethren being Judges. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not obliged to
preach the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The <hi>major</hi> I prove, <hi>Ubi lex non distinguit, non est distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guendum.</hi>
The Scripture takes no notice of two sorts of
preachers, whereof the one may preach seldomer or oftner
as they please, and as the Church desires; and the other
must preach frequently, constantly; and even those upon
whom the lest obligation lies in our Brethrens opinion,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100839:29"/>
are commanded. It is true no preachers are in Scripture
obliged to preach in such or such a place, nor to preach
so often (the determination of these and other like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
is left to the rules of prudence, and general
direction of the word) yet all are obliged to be instant and
diligent in the work: And as the service of the Church is
unspeakably to be preferred before the best merchandize,
and Gods glory before their own wordly interest; so
when a man hath received gifts for the service of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if these commands oblige him to preach, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him to throw off all the impediments of that noble
work, and to give himself wholly to these things: And
the rather, because of our Brethrens own Argument; A
man must exercise his gift as he hath received it. Now if
a man have ability to preach ordinarily and constantly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Lords day, if he would use sufficient diligence, such a
man dischargeth not his trust in preaching sparingly and
occasionally only.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But they say, that</hi> the case of a Minister and a gifted
brother are alike in this, A Minister sins not, if he be put out
of employment, and cast into a place where his gifts are not
desired, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so it is with gifted men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Will our Brethren then say, that others not desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a man to exercise his gifts, will justifie him in the not
exercising of it? Can any man dispence with anothers
wrapping his Talent in a napkin? What if <hi>Paul</hi> had come
to a place where he was not desired to preach, (which
often was his case) was he then free from his necessity of
preching? Or what if a Church grow weary of hearing
and preaching, so that they desire not their Pastour to
preach among them, Will this excuse him, if he throw off
preaching? For my part I must professe, were I in that
case, though I might think it more advantageous to the
Church to dispose of my self in some other place. yet
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100839:29"/>
should I by no means look at it as a dispensation from the
work of preaching, though no man should desire me,
(were there but any that would hear me.) Nay more,
where the Apostles were not only, not desired, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to preach, yet they accounted it their duty to
continue in that work. Whether that hold in ordinary
Ministers, I shall not now dispute; this only I shall say,
(and that is fully sufficient for our purpose) that if a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
be put out of employment, or be in a place where he
is not desired to preach, yet if he may be permitted to
preach, and the affairs of the Church require it, he ought
to do it, or to employ himself in some other way, which
may be equivalent for the Churches service.</p>
               <p>I shall adde but one Argument to our Brethren, taken
from their own words; Whatsoever duty a man may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
do, that he is bound to do: <hi>But one that is really
gifted for preaching (for ought we know) may lawfully
preach without approbation from a Church, or from others,</hi>
say they; Therefore, one that is really gifted is bound to
preach, although neither the Church nor others do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it, much lesse desire it. The <hi>major</hi> is most clear,
and it were a contradiction to say, that such a thing is a
duty, which may in such a case be lawfully done, and yet
that it is not his duty, or that he is not bound to it: The
<hi>minor</hi> is their own words. And this is the first inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
their sense of this place runs upon.</p>
               <p>A second is this, That hereby it will follow that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
may, nay must preach.</p>
               <p>A third is, That by the same rule, every one who hath a
gift to be a General, Magistrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may undertake those
places: To these our Brethren say something by way of
Answer; but the Reply I must leave to him who is more
concerned in them: they are so fully and largely discussed
by divers already, that it is needlesse to say any thing more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100839:30"/>
of them, and we may have occasion to speak of them
hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the fourth and principall thing is this:</hi> It is true,
every one is to exercise his gift, but in his own sphear, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
persons publickly, private persons privately; and so did
<hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> Acts 18. and those women, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>And because here the shoe pincheth, our Brethren make
a strong attempt against this assertion, and endeavour to
batter it down by divers Considerations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the examples of</hi> Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priscilla, <hi>they say,</hi> 1. It
appears not whether they were apt to preach publickly or
no. <hi>p.</hi> 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It appears that they were excellently gifted, in
such a measure that <hi>Paul</hi> cals them his <hi>co-workers,</hi> or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
labourers (for so much the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> imports) in
the work of the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 3. Nor is it in the least
intimated that they were not gifted to speak in publick;
and therefore seeing the excellency of their gifts is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
without any note of restraint or diminution, it is
most ingenuous and reasonable, to conclude they were apt
to speak publickly.</p>
               <p>2. They instructed <hi>Apollo</hi> privately, for that was most
expedient. <hi>p.</hi> 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true it was most fit to do it privately, yet
not so, as that it was inconvenient to advise <hi>Apollo</hi> to be
a diligent hearer publickly: They might have taught
<hi>Apollo</hi> (with others) publickly, without any reflection
upon him: Seeing therefore we reade of their doing it
privately, not a word of their doing it publickly; it is a
certain truth which we assert, that they instructed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
and but a meer supposition that they did, or might
do it publickly.</p>
               <p>2. As to the main Objection they say many things:
To take notice of all they say will be needlesse: The
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100839:30"/>
strength of what they have, lies in these things:</p>
               <p>1. Private men may do the same work with preaching, <hi>i. e.</hi>
they may open and apply Scriptures, exhort, rebuke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 44.</p>
               <p>And because they know we grant this, and say they
may do the same work, but not in the same manner, not
publickly, they adde</p>
               <p>2. That every Church-member is obliged to teach and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
every fellow member, as occasion requires, <hi>p</hi> 46.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If they mean that every member is bound to do
this publickly (else it is nothing to the purpose, for to do
it privately we allow) then not only gifted brethren, but
all the brethren, yea and sisters to, not only may, but must
turn publick preachers.</p>
               <p>3. A publick gift cannot be fully improved, if it be not
used publickly, but privately only, <hi>p.</hi> 47.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If therefore any really have publick gifts, and
desire to use them publickly, let them with the houshold
of <hi>Stephanas,</hi> addict themselves wholly to the work of the
Ministry, and not interlope betwixt two Callings.</p>
               <p>2. I would know of our Brethren, whether this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
rule (upon which their Argument hangs) be true or
false, to wit, That the bare having of a gift fit for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
use, is of it self a sufficient ground for that publick use
of it, without any other call. If they say that it is not
true in the general, but only true in this particular case,
then they discover to all the world, that it is but an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
of their own, meerly taken up for the defence of
a <hi>prae</hi>-conceived opinion: If they say it is true in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
then, what if a woman is gifted to teach? or a
man gifted to rule? The Argument is every whit as
strong. I will return their own Argument upon them
thus. Every man ought fully to improve the gift he hath,
and if he have a publick gift, he ought to improve it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly:
But many private men have the gift of Ruling,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100839:31"/>
Judging, Leading an Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this gift cannot be
fully improved, but by the publick exercise of it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such private men ought publickly to exercise such
gifts. There is no way to avoid this conclusion, but by
saying that besides these gifts a call is required, which till
a man hath, he is not obliged to exercise his gifts publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And the same Answer (if our Brethren will be
candid) may satisfie them, That besides preaching
gifts, there is a call required (whatever that call be) and
till a man hath that call he is not to exercise his preaching
gifts publickly, nor do his gifts oblige him or warrant
him thereunto.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>They say,</hi> Publicknesse in acting is not so material a
thing, it doth not make an act to be an act of Office, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickness
of the act doth not make it preaching; private men
spake publickly, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 12. Any private men may give
Almes publickly in the Assembly, which is the Deacons Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
<hi>p.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Though bare publicknesse of speaking makes
it not preaching, yet that is one main ingredient of that
preaching which is now in Question, and (as we judge) a
property of Authoritative preaching: And so material is
the difference between publick and private teaching or
preaching (call it what you will, for I hate <hi>logomachies</hi>)
that although this latter is allowed to women, and was
performed by <hi>Priscilla,</hi> yet publick teaching, or teaching
in the Church-Assembly is forbidden to women upon this
account, because it is an authoritative act, as is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12. where the
very reason given why they must not teach in publick, is
because they must not usurp authority; concluding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
contradiction, that to preach publickly is an act of
authority, and inconsistent with a state of subjection, and
therefore not to be performed by any who are in a state
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100839:31"/>
of subjection, and under obedience to Officers, whether
men or women. Yea further, whereas some of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
contend, that although preaching constantly in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
be unlawfull to gifted men, yet preaching occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may be lawfull. I offer it to their consideration, that it
is not only preaching constantly, which is here forbidden
to women, but also preaching occasionally, though but
once in publick, seeing even such preaching is accounted
an act of authority: And therefore by a parity of reason
gifted men are forbidden to preach, not only constantly,
but also occasionally (further then necessity requires, <hi>&amp;c</hi>)</p>
               <p>2. For <hi>Acts</hi> 15. we allow private men, though not to
preach, yet to speak publickly in divers cases, as at Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries,
Synods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> sometimes propounding questions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to be further satisfied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For the last clause it is a meer fallacy; for though
in that case a private man give his alms publickly, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he doth not give the Publick Alms (which is the
Deacons office) but only his own private alms he gives in a
publick way.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>They say,</hi> It is usuall for a man being requested, to do
the work of another mans calling; one that is no Schoolmaster
may tend a School occasionally for a few daies, and yet he doth
not go out of his sphear. <hi>p.</hi> 50.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The parallel no way holds, for, though for other
reasons the gift of some Schoolmasters places is limited,
yet indeed in it self, neither the Office nor Work of a
Schoolmaster is restrained, either by Divine or Humane
Law; any man that is fit, may manage it, and we see
ordinarily persons uncalled set up Schools without any
authority, and yet without any blame. If they would have
a fit parallel, take that of a Magistrate; What if a Justice
of the peace request another man to sit for him upon the
bench? may he do it? I trow not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:100839:32"/>
6 <hi>They say,</hi> A man may chuse it as his calling to preach,
and fit himself for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (though he do not own Ordination
as that which gives him a call) now in this case, he doth not
go out of his calling to preach. Men who have other callings,
may leave them and become teachers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. Nor doth
the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 20. forbid a change of callings, but only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a man in his calling to abide with God, <hi>v.</hi> 24. p. 51.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I. Designation of a mans self to a calling, is one
thing, and a solemn inauguration into that calling is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing: Suppose a man design himself for the service
of a state, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> untill he be by authority installed into some
Office of State, he is but a private person (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his intentions and preparations for that work) and
if he should undertake to do the acts of an Officer of State,
before he receive a civil Ordination (as I may call it) he
should go out of his sphear. In like manner, whosoever
designes himself for the Ministry, and intends that calling,
yet, if he undertake to do the acts of the Office before he
be called to it, he goes out of his place.</p>
               <p>II. For <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. I must needs declare that I am sorry
to see good men take such liberty to wrest the Scripture
to serve their conceits: O how great is the power of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice!
But I Answer,</p>
               <p>1. Do our Brethren indeed believe that it was the duty
(duty I say, for <hi>Paul</hi> speaks not what they may do, but
what they ought to do) of all the Hebrews, men and
women (for to both he writes promiscuously) to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
teachers?</p>
               <p>2. Say that all must endeavour to be teachers, what
then? must they needs be publick teachers? <hi>A genere ad
speciem non valet illatio affirmativa.</hi> They ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to teach their families, to teach Heathens, to teach
babes in Christ, and this will run smoothly and take in all.
It is the duty of all men and women to grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100839:32"/>
and to be able to teach others, according as their
place and opportunity inables them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But he speaks of such teaching as babes in Christ do
not attain to, and such as is attained by long time, and such
as belongs to grown Christians, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14. whereas all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
and babes in Christ are teachers in that private bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
way, and therefore this cannot be meant of private, but
of publick teaching, <hi>p.</hi> 52.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It follows not: The teaching here spoken of,
though private, yet was not attained unto by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
by babes in Christ, they were (according to the
Apostl's description) unable to teach their families, or to
instruct an Heathen privately, if he had desired informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from them, for he tels us, <hi>they had need that one should
teach them again, which be the first principles of the oracles of
God.</hi> Our Brethren perplex themselves by confounding
two things much differing, to wit, the duty and the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
For babes in Christ it is their duty to teach, <hi>i. e.</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
yet they may want ability to teach.</p>
               <p>3. Teachers are here taken for such as are apt to teach,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not that the Apostle injoyns it upon
all the Hebrews, as their duty actually to turn publick
teachers (<hi>If the whole body were the eye, where were the
hearing?</hi>) but only to be fit to teach, <hi>id est,</hi> in the sense
explained: As <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11. he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>id est,</hi> word
for word, <hi>condemned, blamed,</hi> that is, he was to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
So <hi>Tully, Quis te damnatior?</hi> that is, who is more
to be blamed than thou.</p>
               <p>III. For 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 20. Although I conceive not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man is so obliged to continue in his calling, that he
may not upon weighty reasons change it for another; yet
surely that text forbids a rash and groundlesse removing
from one calling to another: As it is true, whether a man
keeps his old calling or enters upon a new one, he ought
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100839:33"/>
to do it with God (which is all that can be collected from
the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verse</hi>) yet <hi>v.</hi> 20. servants, and so others <hi>a pari,</hi>
are plainly commanded not to change their callings, <hi>i. e.</hi>
rashly and causelesly.</p>
               <p>7. They cite a command, <hi>Heb. 10. 25. But exhorting one
another,</hi> i. e. <hi>in those Church-Assemblies, to which the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
clearly referres it: Not only Officers, but all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are to do it,</hi> p. 54. And whereas they know it will
and may justly be replied, that by this rule all Christians
are commanded to exhort publickly, they endeavour to
take that off by saying, <hi>only those that were able to do it are
intended, as if a father bid all his children go to work, he
doth not include the child in the cradle:</hi> But here is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
halt; for all the grown Christians were able to teach,
though not all alike, (as of the grown children some could
work better, some worse, yet by their supposition all that
can work <hi>quovis modo,</hi> are commanded to work.) Some
had better, some had meaner gifts, but the very meanest
could provoke to good works, and might say something
to admonish, to counsel and comfort others, to perswade
them to persevere, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay to that purpose a sincere heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, though of very mean abilities, might speak more
effectually then some able Teachers: So that if this place
prove any thing to our Brethrens purpose, it will prove
that it was the duty of every one, gifted or not gifted, to
preach in the publick Assembly, which is not only false,
but contrary to their own opinion.</p>
               <p>But I Answer further; Their assembling together is
not the modification of the exhortation (as if they were
to do it in the publick Assembly) but the matter of the
exhortation, they were (every one according to his place
privately or publickly) to exhort one another, to what?
even to this, that they would not <hi>forsake the assembling of
themselves together, i. e.</hi> that they would not apostatize
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100839:33"/>
from the Christian Religion, and Christian Worship, and
Christian Assemblies, nor relapse to Judaism, but that
they would persevere to the end, that they would hold
fast the profession of their faith without wavering, <hi>v.</hi> 23.
And this concerns the first sense put upon the place, as if
it obliged all gifted men to preach.</p>
               <p>In the second place the Assembly take notice, that <hi>by
gift, may be understood the Office, he that speaketh,</hi> i. e. <hi>the
publick Office-preacher, let him do it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth,</hi>
i. e. <hi>the Deacon:</hi> And thus also others unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this quarrell, understand the words. But against this
our Brethren offer divers exceptions.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They say,</hi> Neither the context nor subsequent verses
referre to Officers, but to Christians in general, therefore this
doth not, <hi>p.</hi> 57.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nothing is more common in Scriputre, than for
general and special exhortations to be joyned together,
and for the Apostles to make a transition from a general to
a special exhortation, and from a special to a general, as
almost every interpreter of Scripture observeth.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are far more usually taken
for gifts, than for an Office, <hi>p.</hi> 59.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It sufficeth that sometimes it is taken for an
Office, and therefore so it may be taken here.</p>
               <p>2. And if it be granted that gift is taken in their sense
in this place, it availeth them not, for the 10 <hi>verse</hi> may be
a general rule, wherein every man is commanded to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
whatsoever gifts he hath received, and to exercise them
in a right manner; and in the 11 <hi>verse</hi> he comes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in two particulars; the Publick teacher, saith he,
as he hath received gifts for teaching, and the gift of the
Office, so let him speak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so the Deacon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
this shall suffice to speak of the second sense.</p>
               <p>A word now of the third, which is this, That this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100839:34"/>
gift is meant of estates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which a man is to use for
Gods glory and the good of others, for so the dependance
upon the foregoing words carries it; <hi>Use hospitality,</hi> &amp;c.
and then he addes a reason, because they have received it,
and so may and ought to lay it out; or (if you will) as a
rule to guide persons in the management of it, that they
should lay out according to what they receive in. To this
there are but two things objected:</p>
               <p>1. They are here called stewards, not of this worlds goods,
but of the grace of God, and not of one grace only, to wit, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but of the manifold grace of God, <hi>p.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The grace of God which properly signifies an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of God, is commonly in Scripture taken for the
gracious effects and actings of that grace towards men.
And whereas these effects and actings of grace are of two
sorts, some concerning this life, and some concerning the
other life, either of these, or any effects of grace may be
called the grace of God Metonymically, and in respect of
such temporal effects (as well as spiritual.) God is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
said to be gracious, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.—<hi>It is his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
—and when he crieth unto me, then I will hear, for I
am gracious:</hi> So also <hi>Amos 5. 15. 1 Sam. 12. 22. 2 Kings</hi>
13. 23.</p>
               <p>And indeed, although this may possibly seem strange to
him that is praepossessed with the common use and accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the word <hi>Grace</hi> in the English tongue; yet can it not
seem improbable to him who knows the use of the
Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (and that is the language which the holy
Ghost used) which is indeed nothing else but a favour or
blessing, so that, all that we are here exhorted unto, is to
be good stewards of the manifold favour of God, or of
the manifold blessings which come from the grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God. And thus far our Brethren agree with us,
that by the grace of God we are to understand the effects
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100839:34"/>
thereof towards us; only here lies the difference between
us, that they will needs expound it of the spiritual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
acts of this grace (because that seems to favour their
cause most) when, as we say, it may be understood of the
external and temporal effects of that grace, for of such
things he spake in the foregoing verse: And in that sense
the word grace is taken in relation to men, <hi>viz.</hi> for the
temporal effects of their grace or favour towards others,
2 <hi>Cor. 8. 19. Who was chosen to travel with us, with this grace
which is administred unto us, i. e.</hi> with this charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
as all Interpreters agree. So that no man can
justly stumble at that sense of the word here. And for
the addition of the word, <hi>the manifold grace of God,</hi> who
knows not that Gods temporal favours (of all which we
are to be good stewards) are manifold? There is as great
multiplicity and variety in temporall as in spirituall
blessings.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> This will destroy the connexion of this verse
with the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What more common then for exhortations of
divers sorts, in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, to be joyned together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any coherence.</p>
               <p>2. This doth not dissolve the connexion, but only va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the connexion, for whereas they annex it to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
verse, this sense joynes it to the foregoing verse.</p>
               <p>And this may fully serve for the Vindication of this
place of Scripture; wherein, though I have not taken
notice of every word said by our Brethren, yet any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Reader that compares theirs and mine together, will
discern that I have not omitted any thing which is either
considerable or plausible, and for other things I have not
so much spare time as to throw it away upon them.</p>
               <p>And thus much for their second Argument.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="response_to_chapter">
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100839:35"/>
               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>THe third Argument will not call for much labour.</p>
               <p>They argue from a <hi>Gospel promise,</hi> Mat. 25. 29. <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every one that hath shall be given: Whatsoever gifts a
man hath, if he improve them, God will increase his
gifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true, every one is to exercise his gifts, but
every one <hi>suo modo,</hi> and <hi>debito ordine,</hi> as hath been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
said, according to his capacity and place, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a right order. What if a man be prudent and very fit
to manage the Deacons work, and to distribute the
Church-alms? must he undertake it (upon pretence of
exercising his gifts) before he be called to it? No surely;
1 <hi>Tim. 3. 10. Let them first be proved, then let them use the
Office of a Deacon.</hi> Or if a man hath gifts to rule a State,
must he take upon him that work, before he be called to
it? Surely no: And therefore a Preacher also, however
gifted, yet must not publickly exercise his gifts till he
have a call, some call I say or other, for I meddle not now
with particulars, what that call is; only I say, besides gifts
a call is required, without which he sins not, in the not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
of his gifts in such a way (although exercise them
he may divers waies.) And if our Brethren allow this in
the Office of the Ruling Elder and Deacon, that how well
soever they are gifted for those works, yet without a call,
a call (I say) distinct from that which may be pretended
by vertue of their gifts, they may not exercise those gifts,
why should they not allow it in the Preaching Ministry?
Why should not only the Offices, but also the works of
these inferiour Offices be inclosed, and that higher and
much more difficult work of the Ministry lie in common?
And this shall suffice for their second Argument, wherein
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100839:35"/>
though divers things are said, yet nothing of strength is
added, which hath not been considered and enervated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the foregoing Argument.</p>
               <p>Their third Argument is taken from Gospel presidents
or examples: They instance in two, 1. In <hi>Apollo.</hi> 2. In
the scattered Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 24.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>In</hi> Apollo, <hi>and the marrow and strength of what they
say of him is this;</hi> He preached publickly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet was
not ordained, for he knew only the Baptism of <hi>John</hi> (not the
Baptism of Christ) to which the institution of Ordination was
subsequent; he had but an imperfect knowledge of the doctrine
of Christ.</p>
               <p>Unto this instance divers things are said, which our
Brethren take notice of, and attempt to confute.</p>
               <p>1. Whereas some Answer, <hi>That</hi> Apollo <hi>was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Officer, that he is ranked with</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Peter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 12. <hi>that he is called a Minister,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this they Answer,</hi> 1. Let him prove it that will
assert it: All that the text saith of him is, that he was elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and fervent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which a man may be without those
extraordinary gifts, <hi>p.</hi> 71.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> If this place doth not, yet others do imply that
he was an extraordinary Officer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exc.</hi> But that was afterward, when he went to Corinth;
He might be a gifted man first, and yet afterwards an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 73.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That <hi>Apollo</hi> had extraordinary gifts is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
from that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. being ranked with persons so
qualified, but when he received them, the Scripture is
silent: The Scripture intimates that he had them at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
but that he received them not before, <hi>ne <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> quidem.</hi>
The distance of time is not so great between his being at
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> that is <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 24. and in <hi>Achaia,</hi> that is <hi>v.</hi> 27.
of the same Chapter: And therefore it is most probable
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100839:36"/>
he had those extraordinary gifts when he was at <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be objected against this, <hi>that he was ignorant in
many truths, instructed by</hi> Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priscilla, <hi>p.</hi> 71.
The Answer may be this, that this is not inconsistent with
his being a Prophet: God revealed not all his mind at
once to all his Prophets. Those Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. were
to hear and learn of others, as well as to speak themselves.
The Apostles had extraordinary gifts when Christ lived,
though not in such a plentifull and glorious manner as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
and yet were ignorant of those great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
truths of Christs death and resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inst.</hi> But after his departure the people of Ephesus were
ignorant of those gifts of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That might be, neither they nor <hi>Apollo</hi> might
know distinctly what these gifts of the Holy Ghost were,
and yet <hi>Apollo</hi> might have them; his face might shine and
he not know it: As a man may be converted and yet not
know that he is converted, nay possibly he may not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand what the work of conversion is.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Whereas it is further said, that</hi> Apollo's might have
a Commission from <hi>John</hi> to preach. <hi>They say,</hi> Let them
prove it that can, the Gospel is silent as to that, <hi>p.</hi> 71.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Our Brethren must remember the proof lies
upon them to make good that he was not ordained, not
upon us to prove that he was ordained: For if we lay down
this position, That meerly gifted men ought not to
preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they offer any instances to the contrary,
they must make this good, that such were only gifted men,
and not ordained: They are not so unacquainted with the
laws of disputation, as not to know that the proof lies on
the opponents part, which they manage in this place.</p>
               <p>2. The Gospel is silent as to the Mission and Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of divers others: We reade nothing of the Ordination
of <hi>Titus,</hi> of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> of the Pastors of the seven
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100839:36"/>
                  <hi>Asian</hi> Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, &amp; 3. Shall we therefore conclude
they were not ordained?</p>
               <p>3. Whereas it is said he preached only where there was
no Church: They say, <hi>Let them prove that it is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
to preach where a Church is, than where no
Church is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> This will easily be proved by that <hi>ingens telum
necessitas:</hi> I hope there is a far greater necessity of gifted
mens preaching where Ministers are not, than in a Church
where they are.</p>
               <p>4. To these I may adde, that we do not find <hi>Apollo</hi>'s
preaching in a Christian Church, but disputing in a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Assembly, a liberty which we as readily allow to gifted
men, as to write in defence of the truth.</p>
               <p>5. Say that <hi>Apollo</hi>'s were not ordained (which is all our
Brethren can extort or desire) yet this gives them no help
at all, for the extraordinarinesse of his gifts might well
supply the defect of an Ordination, and that is no presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for such whose gifts are but ordinary.</p>
               <p>And thus much for their first example.</p>
               <p>The second is that <hi>locus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the <hi>scattered Saints,</hi> Acts 8. about which I shall
not ingage my self, nor detain the Reader with repeating
those various Answers that are given to it by the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Assembly, which might easily be vindicated from their
exceptions. I shall not stand upon this; That the persons
scattered were, if not solely, yet mainly the Officers of
the Church, who might therefore preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that
which wholly invalidates this place as to their purpose, is
that which is commonly said, that this was an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
case, a case of necessity. And mark the weight of
our Brethrens deduction from this place: Because the
scattered Disciples in a persecuted state of the Church, in
a time when all Church-order was broke, preached and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100839:37"/>
taught Jesus Christ to Heathens and unbelieving Jews,
occasionally (it may be in private, or with <hi>Paul</hi> in the
market places <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in their Synagogues disputing with
them) therefore now unordained persons may preach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
and solemnly to a Christian Church settled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
wherein are plenty of able and godly Pastors, and
where as their preaching is not necessary, so to many fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God it is highly scandalous. This is the true state of
the Argument, and if our Brethren be not sick of this
consequence, I shall say they have good stomacks.</p>
               <p>But this must not passe so, and therefore they make an
assault upon it, and there are three or four things which
they say (lest they should say nothing) which stand in the
room of Answers, with which I must professe I wonder
how sober ingenious and conscientious men (such as I
hope our Brethren are) can satisfie themselves. But such
as they are we shall give them a fair hearing.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They say,</hi> Persecution laid no necessity upon them to
preach, <hi>p.</hi> 85.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, it laid a necessity upon them, <hi>i. e.</hi> in order
to Gods glory, and the salvation of souls, which could
not be had without preaching, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and preaching
could not now be had in an ordinary way; upon this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that in those times God would have all men to
be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, it
was necessary that they should preach, for as much as there
can be no salvation without preaching, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> It is questionable whether necessity can make
that lawfull, which is in it self unlawfull, as to forswear a
mans self, <hi>p.</hi> 86.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There are two kinds of evil and unlawfulnesses,
Some things are simply and absolutely evil, and <hi>prohibita
quia mala,</hi> forbidden because they are intrinsecally evil;
as to forswear, to blaspheam God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and these no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100839:37"/>
can excuse: But there are other things which are in
themselves indifferent, and only <hi>mala quia prohibita,</hi> are
therefore only evil because they are prohibited, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are against positive precepts. Now those things
which are only evil this latter way (and such is preaching
without Ordination) they may, though not ordinarily,
yet in cases of necessity do. Thus in a case of necessity,
<hi>David</hi> might eat the Shew-bread, the rest of the Sabbath
might be violated, <hi>Periculum mortis pellit Sabbathum:</hi>
And of this kind is order in a State or Church, which is a
duty to be observed ordinarily, and yet in case of evident
necessity may be violated. And, as in a State, in such a
case, every man is a Constable, so in the Church, in such a
case, every man may be a Preacher.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They say,</hi> It is an extraordinary case when Ordination
cannot be had in Gods way, <hi>i. e.</hi> when Election doth not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, <hi>p.</hi> 86.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That Election must necessarily and continually
go before Ordination, is but one of their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
to be confuted hereafter.</p>
               <p>2. And if ordinarily Election must go before Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet, as we say of preaching, when Ordination can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had, it may be done without it; so it is true of
Election when it cannot be had, Ordination must be taken
without it; and when Ordination cannot be had exactly
in Gods way, as to all the particulars, it must be had, as
it may. The Shew-bread was ordinarily according to
Gods way, to be eaten by the Priests alone, but in cases
of necessity it might be eaten out of Gods way, it might
be eaten by others.</p>
               <p>3. It is not every extraordinary case that carries it, it
must be a case of necessity, such as this is not; for what if
neither Election nor Ordination can be had by them in
Gods way? There is no necessity of their preaching in a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100839:38"/>
Church which is constituted. And thus we see how
firmly this Answer stands against all their exceptions, and
that all their assaults are but like the beating of a storm
against the wall. So that there is one flaw in their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which will for ever condemn it of insufficiency.</p>
               <p>But that is not all: Mark how the Argument is laid by
our Brethren; <hi>Those who were scattered abroad they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But many unordained men were scattered abroad; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many unordained men preached,</hi> p. 74.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. You shall see what an hopefull Argument this
is: I will make use of their own Argument against them,
and I desire no other Umpire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They who were scattered abroad they preached: But many
ungifted persons were scattered abroad; Therefore such
preached:</hi> And because this example they bring as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
for us, therefore ungifted persons may now preach
publickly; which because it is not only false, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to their own sense, therefore (that we may not be put
to deny the Conclusion) we must find fault with one of
the premises, and that can only be done our way, <hi>i. e.</hi> by
saying that, not all that were scattered preached, but only
some of them preached: Only here is the difference, these
some that preached, say we, were Officers; say they,
they were gifted men, which yet they cannot prove, and
if they could, it reacheth not our case, nor our times, for
it was a case of necessity, as hath been argued.</p>
               <p>If they like not this, I will put it in another dresse:
They who were scattered, preached: But women as well
as men were scattered, so they say, <hi>the scattering was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
to</hi> Pauls <hi>haling men and women,</hi> &amp;c. and that <hi>the
All that were scattered, were not all the Officers, but all the
Church.</hi> So that by this Argument here is a warrant for
women-preachers, if this example be a president: Nor
let them fly to their usual refuge, that women are else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100839:38"/>
forbidden, for although they were ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
yet in cases of necessity (such as this was) they
might do it, as that woman did who preached to the <hi>Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
and converted them.</p>
               <p>To this I may adde, that all that can be extorted from
this place is this, that they preached; which we may grant
without any prejudice to our cause, for there are divers
kinds of preaching or teaching, they might do it divers
waies. It might be true of all, that they preached and
taught Jesus, but not all alike, nor all in the same capacity;
the Officers might teach publickly, the rest privately;
the Officers constantly, the others occasionally; the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
might preach officially in a Christian Church, the
rest might discourse to a company of Heathens, or dispute
with them; and all these may be called teaching or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
So that our Brethrens Argument is <hi>a genere ad spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem
affirmativè,</hi> which will not hold water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For what they say, that</hi> It is indefinitely said that they
that were scattered, preached.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> They know that indefinite propositions, <hi>in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriâ
contingenti,</hi> in a contingent matter (such as this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
is) are not equivalent to an universal: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that Officers and people were scattered, I say, that
if the Officers alone had preached, that had been sufficient
ground to say of the whole they preached, as oftentimes
that is said to be done by all <hi>Israel,</hi> which was done by the
Officers of the Congregation.</p>
               <p>And thus we have seen those two great topicks of our
Brethren, from Scripture precept, and Scripture presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
overthrown. And so much for the third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Their fourth Argument is that principall place and
pillar of their opinion, which if I shall satisfactorily
Answer, there will be little ground left for our Brethrens
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100839:39"/>
confidence in this cause. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 29, 31. whence they
draw this Argument,</p>
               <p>All that are Prophets may publickly preach: But some men
who are not ordained Officers, are Prophets; Therefore some
men who are not ordained Officers, may publickly preach.</p>
               <p>Which Argument may be cut off in a word, for their
Conclusion may be granted without any detriment to
our Cause; and our Brethren might have known, and
ought to have considered, that we grant, that persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
may preach, in a double case; 1. In the case of
necessity. 2. In case of extraordinary gifts, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Commission from God, which we take to be
the case of these Prophets, of which more hereafter. In
the mean time let us follow them: For their <hi>major</hi> it is
granted on all hands: For their <hi>minor,</hi> it is this, <hi>That
some men who are not ordained Officers are Prophets;</hi> where
there is a double defect and insufficiency to the proof of
what they intend. For 1. The Prophets might be Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
though not ordained; so were the Apostles, neither
of man nor by man. 2. If the Prophets were not Officers
at all, yet the extraordinarinesse of their gifts was a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
warrant for the publick exercise thereof: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these are to be found in the case of those unordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
preachers we plead against, but they differ <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
from them, for neither are they Officers at all, ordained
or not ordained, nor are their gifts extraordinary; so that
the <hi>minor</hi> might be granted, and yet the truth not wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But let us see how they proceed: I fear it will prove
<hi>ominous</hi> to them, thus to stumble in the threshold: They
argue thus, to prove their <hi>minor, All that have the gift of
prophesie are Prophets: But some men who are not ordained
Officers have the gift of prophesie;</hi> Ergo, <hi>Some men, who
are not ordained Officers are Prophets.</hi> For the <hi>major,</hi> though
we grant it, yet, according to our Brethrens principles, it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100839:39"/>
might be denied; for, if it were as they say, that those
prophesiers here spoken of had the gift, but no Office, I
should deny such to be Prophets, because the name of
Prophet, both in vulgar acception, and in Scripture use,
connotes an Office; <hi>Caiaphas</hi> did prophesie, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.—
and yet I beleeve our Brethren are not so hardy, as to say
that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was a Prophet. The <hi>minor</hi> will lead us to the
main point, which is this, <hi>Some men not ordained Officers
have the gift of prophesie;</hi> which they attempt to prove
by three steps:</p>
               <p>They say, this <hi>prophesie 1. is a gift, not an Office.</hi>
2. <hi>That it is a gift still continuing. 3. And which some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
persons have,</hi> p. 90. And if these things be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
they say something to the purpose; but let it be
considered, if there be a flaw in any one of them, their
whole Argument fals, and how much more, when every
one of them will be taken tardy. The last Proposition
they place first, and use three Arguments to prove it,
whereof the last is that which the other propositions treat
of, the two former are these which follow.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>(Say they)</hi> Some not ordained have this gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
because we find no Scripture warrant for the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What if there be no particular warrant, it is
sufficient that there is a general rule for the ordaining of
all Church-officers, Pastors, Teachers, Elders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
(at least, if these be ordinary Officers, as our Brethren
make them) a parity of reason (which is a sufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to sober minded men, such as I take our Brethren
to be) will prove that they also are to be ordained.</p>
               <p>2. But if they be extraordinary Officers (as the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Assembly affirm) preferred before the Evangelists,
and having this priviledge above the Evangelists (for
ought we read) to be immediatly and infallibly indued, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:100839:40"/>
then what wonder if in this they partake with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who as they were not <hi>of men,</hi> so neither <hi>by men,</hi> and
needed no Ordination, nor had it, unless in relation to some
special work, as <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>(Say they)</hi> They must be discerned to have the gift
before they be ordained, and therefore some not ordained may
have the gift of prophesie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This Argument is built upon the former mistake,
as if there were a necessity of such a Prophets Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whereas, I say, Gods indowment of him with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
gifts, is a kind of Ordination, and supplies
the defect of an Ordination by men. But (complying
thus far with our Brethren, to own these Prophets to be
unordained persons, and their gifts but ordinary) I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Answer, that this is wholly impertinent (as was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
before) for in the case of a Pastor, the question is
not, Whether one not ordained may have Pastoral gifts,
which we assert he may have, nay he must have, and must
be known to have them before he be ordained; but the
question is, Whether a man not ordained may commonly
and ordinarily exercise those Pastoral gifts, which is quite
another thing: It is one thing to have gifts, another thing
to exercise gifts. A man may lawfully have divers gifts,
(<hi>v. g.</hi> of ruling an Army or a State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which yet he may
not lawfully exercise.</p>
               <p>But let us now come to their next Proposition, which
is more to the purpose, <hi>viz. That this prophecying is
not an Office but a gift.</hi> If this be proved, it amounts to
something, but I doubt the premises will fall a mile short
of the conclusion. I passe by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> they run into,
which Dr. <hi>Collins</hi> takes notice of, and shall rather consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how they attempt to prove it; which they do by two
Arguments.</p>
               <p>1. All who have the gift of prophesie are Prophets: But
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100839:40"/>
all that have the gift are not Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If these Prophets were ordinary persons, I deny
the <hi>major,</hi> for then besides the gift, they must be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as in other ordinary cases:) But if these Prophets were
extraordinary persons, I deny the <hi>minor,</hi> for the very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of such a gift extraordinarily inspired, is an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
call, and makes them extraordinary Officers, as it was
in the Prophets of the old Testament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. That which ought in duty, and might in faith be
coveted by every member of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> was not
an Office but a gift: For 1. God no where promised to make
every one an Officer there. 2. This was impossible, for then
all the body had been the eye; and if these were extraordinary
Officers, much lesse might they covet to be such: But now this
prophesying they ought and might covet in faith. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The <hi>major</hi> is denied: 1. An Office might be
coveted as well as a gift, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 1. If a man</hi> (Gr. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>if any man) desire the Office of a Bishop, he desireth a good
work.</hi> Yea an extraordinary Office might be coveted, as is
evident from the desires and endeavours of the sons of the
Prophets in the old Testament.</p>
               <p>2. Let our Brethren shew where God promised to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
member of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> these extraordinary
gifts, and I will shew them where God promised to every
one of them to be Officers.</p>
               <p>3. If extraordinary gifts might be desired, (as our
Brethren say) why not an extraordinary Office? If an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Office might not be desired, this is either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is an Office, or because it is extraordinary; not
because it is an Office, that hinders not but it may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted,
as we have shewn; nor, because it is extraordinary,
for then extraordinary gifts might not be desired. That
extraordinary gifts might be desired, appears from the
very words cited by our Brethren, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 1. Desire
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100839:41"/>
spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesie;</hi> whence it
is most evident, that not only prophesying, but the other
gifts mentioned there, <hi>i. e.</hi> of tongues, interpretation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
were to be desired: So that our Brethrens Argument is
feeble to prove this to be an ordinary gift, because it was
to be desired.</p>
               <p>4 For every member in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to be
an Officer was not impossible: True, it was impossible
for all to be Officers there in that Church, but not to be
Officers in other places: And this I would desire our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to ruminate upon, whether, supposing, that all the
members of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> might in faith desire,
and so obtain gifts fitting them for Office (which our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
grant) &amp; supposing that the exigencies of the Church
required their Office-relation, which might well have
been in those times, and that their being in other callings
ought not to hinder it (as our Brethren sufficiently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<hi>pag.</hi> 53.) I say, whether, supposing these things, it
were either impossible or unlawfull for every member of
the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to desire to be an Officer, where
he might be serviceable to the Church: That in this case
it is unlawfull or impossible, I suppose our Brethren will
not readily say; and if they say it, nothing more easie
then to disprove it: And if they grant it to be possible
and lawfull, then all their Argument fals to the ground,
then every member ought in duty, and might in faith,
covet, as to have gifts necessary for an Office, so (in due
order and fit time) to be Officers, though not in that
Church, yet in some Church, which is enough to our
purpose. Adde to this that if this prophesie be an Office,
this is no more then that wish of <hi>Moses</hi> so much insisted
upon, at least according to their sense of it, <hi>I would that all
the Lords people were Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have shewn the insufficiency of their proofs
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100839:41"/>
alleadged for the defence of their first and most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Position, <hi>That the prophesying here spoken of, is a gift,
not an Office:</hi> This Position they uphold only by two
Arguments, which I hope any ingenuous Reader will
discern to be so farre answered, that they have no great
reason to be confident upon these grounds: And yet I
must intreat the Reader to consider, that here lies the
great stresse of the cause; for if it be not a bare gift,
(which you have seen our Brethren cannot prove) but an
Office, then the preaching of these Prophets is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
nor example for the preaching of any that are not
Officers: Now although I might acquiesce here, for as
much, as, if any assert that these were barely gifted men,
it lies upon them to prove it; yet, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> there is
a reason given, whereby it doth more then probably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that these Prophets were Officers. In the mean
time, let this be remembred, that if we could not prove
that these preachers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. were Officers (no more
then they can prove that they were only gifted persons)
yet our cause stands unshaken, and all that would follow in
that case would be this, that this place must be laid aside,
both by our Brethren, and by us, as not demonstrative to
the point in hand.</p>
               <p>This being premised, I come to our Argument, which
is taken from 1 <hi>Cor. 12. Eph.</hi> 4. where the Prophets are
enumerated amongst Officers, and (which is most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable)
placed before the Evangelists. I know our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
think to blow away this with a breath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They say,</hi> Nothing can be gathered from the order of the
words; seeing oft-times the worse is placed before the better,
as <hi>Priscilla</hi> before <hi>Aquila,</hi> the woman before the man, <hi>p.</hi> 93.</p>
               <p>And thus far it is true, that the bare order is no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
argument to prove a priority in dignity; and that the
same things are sometimes in Scripture placed first, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100839:42"/>
last, so that in all cases the order is not to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and yet in some cases it is not to be slighted, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when it is punctually observed, that wherever Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<hi>in concrete</hi> are mentioned, they are placed next after
the Apostles, and that this is done so solemnly, and with
such emphaticall words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>first Apostles, secondarily Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. And as
it may fairly be collected, that the Apostles are the chief
of these Officers, because generally they are placed first,
and that the Pastors and Teachers are the lowest of them,
because generally they are placed last, so also it is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
(and I doubt not our Brethren would make good
use of it, were it for their cause, as much as it is against
it) that Prophets are generally placed in the second
order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For what they adde,</hi> If Prophets be Officers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. then those places must be understood of extraordinary
Prophets, who did foretell of future events, as <hi>Acts</hi> 11. yet
this hinders not, but this prophesying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. may be only
by gift, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It was not the sole work of Office-Prophets,
(that I may accommodate my discourse to our Brethrens
conceptions) to foretell future events; for <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>
as Prophets, did exhort, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 32.</p>
               <p>2. To say that there should be two sorts of New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament-Prophets,
the one by Office, the other by gift,
as it is but a begging of the question, so it will by wise
and indifferent Readers, be lookt upon but as <hi>subterfuge,</hi>
and why may we not as well make two sorts of Apostles,
two sorts of Evangelists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the one by Office, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by gift? It had been somewhat tollerable, if these
in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. had been said to Prophesie, but not called
Prophets (<hi>seeing,</hi> as our Brethren say, <hi>the doing of some
Acts occasionally, as</hi> v. g. <hi>ones teaching occasionally, doth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100839:42"/>
not denominate a man a teacher)</hi> but seeing they are also
called Prophets; impartiall men will easily gather, that
they are the same which are known by that name in other
places. Thus much for the first Proposition; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dispatched, I now come to the second, and shall try
whether that succeed better in our Brethrens hands; and
that is, That Prophesying is an ordinary gift, and still
continuing in the Church. This they undertake to prove
as followes:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Prophesying was in use, and no Gospel Rule can
be shewed for the repeal or ceasing of it, <hi>p.</hi> 96.</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>A gift may cease in the Church two waies.</hi> 1. Either
by a positive act of God in his Word forbidding it: or
2. By a privative act of God in his Providence withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. Who knows not that the gift of Tongues, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and infallible explication of the Scripture is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
and yet it would be a most vain Argument to dispute
against the cessation of it thus, because there is no Gospel-rule
for the repeal of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. This Prophesying is ordinary, <hi>Ergo</hi> still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The proposition is altogether needlesse, for if it
be ordinary that is sufficient, and indeed that is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
of the assertion of the Provinciall Assemby (that
this Prophesying is extraordinary) And therefore let us
hear what they have to say, or what they alledge to prove
it ordinary.</p>
               <p>For the self-contradiction they say God hath left us to,
<hi>p.</hi> 97. I shall only say this, Wise men before they had
made such a bold charge (especially making use of the
dreadfull Name of the Lord) would have understood the
grounds of it, which indeed are none at all: for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
of the <hi>Ius divinum regiminis Ecclesiastici,</hi> were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
three or four reverend City Ministers, whereof one or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100839:43"/>
two are since gone out of the City; and, not one of them
was a member of the Provincial Assembly when the <hi>Ius
divinum Ministerii</hi> came forth: And being different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
though agreeing in the main of this controversie;
it is no disparagement to any of them to differ in some
circumstance: however all of them do agree in that
which our Brethren here oppose, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the gift was
extraordinary. Besides, I suppose, our Brethren would
be hard put to it to prove that there is any contradiction,
for these two may very well consist together, to say that
these Prophets were extraordinary Officers in respect of
their gift, and yet the ordinary Pastours of <hi>Corinth</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their Office and relation: And seeing there was
a competent number of extraordinary Officers residing
in that Church, it was most fit they should be the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Pastours of that Church <hi>quoad exercitium muneris:</hi>
And in this sense we may safely embrace both what the
worthy Authors of that excellent piece <hi>Ius divin. regim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
affirm, and also what learned <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rutherford asserts, i. e.</hi> that
these Prophets were the ordinary Pastours of that Church
and yet both grant, that for their gifts they were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary;
and that is the thing now in question: So that
in stead of a contradiction feigned, here is a real agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
found out; all of us agreeing in the two principles
which our Brethren here oppose: and all asserting, 1. That
these Prophets were Officers. 2. That they were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
as to their gifts: To which their special relation
to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and residence there, and doing the acts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
is no more a prejudice, than it was to the Apostles,
who though they were extraordinary Officers, yet some
of them at some times were as Pastours to some Churches,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which occasioned that apprehension that <hi>Iames</hi>
was Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That this Prophesying was ordinary, our Brethren offer
some Arguments to prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:100839:43"/>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The rules to regulate the work are ordinary, <hi>p.</hi> 100.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I see no rule but what may very well agree to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Officers. Extraordinary Officers, 1. Must
act orderly. 2. Must speak in a known language, 3. Must
speak to edification. 4. Must be subject to the trial of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Officers, yea people also, as the Provincial Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fully proves; of which our Brethren take no notice:
<hi>Paul</hi> commends the <hi>Beraeans</hi> for examining his doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The work of these Prophets is ordinary, <hi>i. e.</hi> to
speak to edification and exhortation, and comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This also was the work of Apostles. 2. The
work indeed was ordinary, but the manner of doing it was
extraordinary, in as much as these did it infallibly, and by
immediate revelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. But here is no mention of extraordinary work, of
a gift of praediction, which is required to all extraordinary
Prophets, but the contrary is intimated, and this prophesying
is here said to be, not a sign for them that believe not (which
praediction of events is) but for them that believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. 1. Date non concesso,</hi> that these Prophets had not
the gift of prediction, that no way hinders but they might
be extraordinary Officers, for besides this they had another
extraordinary gift, to wit, a gift of infallible teaching
by immediate revelation. Divers of the Apostles had not
this gift of praediction, that we read of, and yet I hope our
Brethren will give them their passe for extraordinary
Officers.</p>
               <p>2. For my part I am prone to conceive (and let our
Brethren disprove it) that the praediction of future events
was rather a priviledge indulged to some New Testament
Prophets, than common to all Prophets: The gift of
miracles was a gift bestowed upon Prophets, and yet some
wanted it; for <hi>Iohn</hi> (though a Prophet) yet did no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 41. However, the great and principal work
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100839:44"/>
of these New Testament Prophets (and the old also) was
preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore (although these Prophets,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 had the gift of praediction) yet it is no wonder
that the title of prophesying should be appropriated to the

which is preaching.</p>
               <p>3. And how poor an evidence is this to prove, that
these Prophets could not foretell future events, because
it is not mentioned in this Chapter? the rather because
he here speaks of the Prophets, not in relation to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
(for whose-sake the gift of prediction was given)
but in relation to beleevers, and to the Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ordering of the work of prophesying or
preaching in and to the Church-assembly.</p>
               <p>4. We readily grant all which can be proved from this
place, which is only this, that the preaching of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
(for it is that act of the Prophets which is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
prophesying) is not for them that believe not, but
for them that beleeve: It is not said, that these Prophets
were given not for a sign to them that beleeve not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
(which had been more to the purpose) but that, that act
of their Office there spoken of was not for a signe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. If they had not that particular extraordinary gift of
praediction, yet had they divers other extraordinary gifts,
as that of Tongues, and the interpretation of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and that was sufficient to make the persons extraordinary,
though they wanted some other extraordinary gift.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> Publick Prophesying extraordinary was allowed to
women, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 36, 38. But this publick Prophesying was not
allowed to women, <hi>v.</hi> 34. let your women keep silence; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this publick Prophesying was ordinary <hi>p.</hi> 102.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That extraordinary Prophesying was allowed to
women in publick, either in the old or new Testament,
hath been often said and supposed; but never yet could I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100839:44"/>
see it proved; nor can one instance be given of it, that I
know of, to wit, that any woman did preach in a publick
Assembly; and there lies the stresse: <hi>Anna</hi> might speak
to all, <hi>i. e.</hi> severally, as they came by turnes to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and so might <hi>Priscilla</hi> occasionally speak privately, as
she had opportunity: And indeed we read that when she
preached, she chose to do it privately, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them in a publick Assembly.</p>
               <p>But that Argument is so fully handled by others, that
I shall not need to dilate upon it here.</p>
               <p>And thus we have seen how infirm our Brethrens Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
are, which are brought to prove that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying
was ordinary.</p>
               <p>In the next place I should come to lay down Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove that it was extraordinary: I shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon all the Arguments used to prove it: Some were
proposed by Dr. <hi>Collings,</hi> and are by him vindicated in
his last piece; others I dare venture to stand upon their
own legs, and refer the comparing of them and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
here given to any indifferent Reader: And besides,
Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> hath eased me of that burden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This only I take notice of, that</hi> this Prophesying was by
revelation, <hi>v.</hi> 26. Every one (<hi>i. e.</hi> of you Prophets) hath
a Psalme, a Doctrine, a Tongue, a revelation, an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<hi>And</hi> v. 30. If any thing be revealed to another that
sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.</p>
               <p>To which our Brethren answer two things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They say,</hi> All these enumerated were not extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
A Doctrine is ordinary; the ordinary Elders have a
Doctrine, <hi>p.</hi> 103.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is true of ordinary Officers, they had a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
it is true also of extraordinary Officers, they had
a Doctrine, but not both in the same way; in the one it
was extraordinary, in the other ordinary, so that from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100839:45"/>
the bare mention of a Doctrine, it can neither be collected
that that Doctrine was ordinary, nor that it was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
but that must be gathered from the circumstances
of the place; and for this place, whereas the Office here
spoken of is extraordinary (as we have proved) and the
word Doctrine is at least ambiguous: It is more probable
that this Doctrine is meant of an extraordinary kind (as
the rest are which are there enumerated) than that it is
meant of an ordinary Doctrine, when nothing else here
spoken of s ordinary.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say</hi> that the word revelation is somtimes taken
for a revelation in an ordinary way, that is by the word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That is readily granted, and needed no proof,
but it must be added that somtimes also it is taken in an
extraordinary sense; so that now we are to enquire which
way it is to be taken here, and which way the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the text restrain that common word: Now that it is
meant of extraordinary revelation four things will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
belief with unbyassed Readers. 1. That the word is of
the present tense, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, if it be revealed, not if it
have been revealed, as it should have been, for the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the word was past. 2. The posture in which it
is revealed, when he sitteth by. 3. The effect of such a
revelation, that it gives a stop to the others discourse:
4. That this revelation was not common to all the
Church, but peculiar to these Prophets, and not common
to all the Prophets neither, but peculiar to one, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
some one that sitteth by, and therefore surely it cannot be
the revelation by the Word, which is common to all the
Prophets, yea, all the Church. Nor is there any weight in
what is further objected by our Brethren, that if this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
should command silence to a Prophet speaking by
immediate revelation, then the same Spirit should clash
with it self: For though these Prophets did speak by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100839:45"/>
revelation, yet not so as that they did not at all
exercise their ordinary gifts, or that they never spake as
ordinary men: For even the Prophets and Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
sometimes spake their own private opinions: And
why might not these Prophets after the delivery of their
revelation amplifie it, and open it according to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
opinion, by the help of their excellent, though ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
gifts? which (though they were much to be valued
and respected) yet well might be corrected by some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
revelation manifested to another.</p>
               <p>But (<hi>say they</hi>) this requiring the first to hold his peace,
doth not necessarily forbid his proceeding so far as he intended,
or command a sudden silence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only commandeth so to
contract a mans discourse, as there may be opportunity for
others.</p>
               <p>And I confesse nothing is more easie then to dictate;
This is soon said, but if you ask our Brethren for a proof,
I am afraid they will stick in the mire: In the mean time,
they having offered no proof for it, must needs allow me
to rely as much upon my affirmation, which yet is not
mine, but the Apostles, as they upon their negation. It
is plain from the words, that it was a thing that fell out
beyond expectation, and therefore is brought in conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally,
<hi>If any thing be revealed,</hi> which condition was
needlesse, if the revelation spoken of was ordinary and
common. And this may be abundantly sufficient for the
Vindication of this place, from which I may justly expect
this fruit, that ingenuous men of a contrary mind to us,
may abate some of their confidence, and see cause to make
a further enquiry into this point then yet they have
made.</p>
               <p>And this may suffice for Answer to their Arguments,
whereby they attempt to prove that gifted persons may
preach. Let us now see, whether we have not more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100839:46"/>
Arguments to prove that they may not preach:
Albeit this must needs be said, that in course of disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it is not incumbent upon us to prove the Negative,
but upon them to prove the Affirmative, <hi>Asserenti incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
probatio.</hi> So that I might here take take up, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
shewn the invalidity of their Arguments, I might
<hi>supersede</hi> further trouble: And this <hi>memorandum</hi> I shall
leave upon the file, that this Assertion of our Brethren,
<hi>That unordained persons may preach ordinarily,</hi> is neither
commanded by any Gospel precept, nor countenanced by
any Gospel example (which hitherto hath been alleadged.)
But because our Arguments, whereby we have proved
our Assertion, are assaulted by our Brethren, it will be
convenient to say something by way of Vindication.</p>

            <div n="7" type="response_to_chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <p>THe first Argument is put into our hands by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
and it is <hi>Rom. 10. 15. How shall they preach except
they be sent?</hi> i. e. <hi>How can they do it lawfully?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The summe of our Brethrens Answer lies in this,</hi> That
the mission here spoken of, is not Ministeriall, whereby they
are constituted in their office; but providentiall, whereby
they are sent into any place: and that this mission is indeed
necessary to preaching, <hi>i. e.</hi> naturally, not morally; As it is
true, How can a man preach except he have health, strength,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And besides, it may be morally necessary, and yet not
constitutive of a Minister: For it is morally necessary to a
Ministers preaching, <hi>i. e.</hi> lawfully, that he have all the
Gospel qualifications required to a Preacher, and yet though
he want some of these, he may be constituted a Minister.</p>
               <p>To which I Reply, 1. To the last clause, there is an
apparent fallacy, which will plainly appear by this one
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100839:46"/>
distinction, That a mans preaching may be unlawfull two
waies; 1. Circumstantially, when there is a defect in the
principles, or in the manner of acting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Substantially,
when there is a defect in the substance of the act, both as
to the matter and manner of it: When a Minister wants
some necessary qualification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he preacheth lawfully
for the substance of the act, though he sins in the manner
of acting; but when one that preacheth wanteth mission,
the very substantial act of preaching is unlawfull. As when
a Magistrate acts vaingloriously, he sins in the manner of
his acting, but his act is lawfull in it self; but when a man
usurps the power of a Magistrate, there he sins in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the act, because he wants authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or as
it is in the case of the Lords Supper, it is wholly unlawful
for a scandalous sinner to receive it, but it is lawfull for a
regenerate man (though weak in grace) to receive it,
though he sins in the receiving of it. In a word, the act
is lawfull, <hi>quoad specificationem actus,</hi> for the kind of it,
and <hi>per se;</hi> though it is sinfull, <hi>quoad exercitium actus,</hi> in
the exercise of it, and <hi>per accidens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It must be granted that the word sending is <hi>vocabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, taken variously in diyers places: Sometimes
it is taken for the mission of a person already authorized to
any place or people, but sometimes also it is taken for the
authorization of a person to a work or office, yea, so it is
frequently taken as <hi>Ioh. 20. 21. As my Father hath sent
me, so send I you, i. e.</hi> As the Father authorized and seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to the Office of a Mediator, so do I authorize you
to be Apostles, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Cor. 1. 17. Christ sent (i. e.</hi> commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionated
<hi>me) not to baptize, but to preach.</hi> John 1. 6. <hi>A
man sent of God.</hi> Thus Christ often said, that <hi>he was sent,</hi>
in Answer to that Question of his enemies, <hi>By what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
doest thou these things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. This providential mission, and Ministerial mission
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100839:47"/>
need not to be opposed to one another, but may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
together: A providential sending of a Minister to any
place (such as that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 16. to <hi>Macedonia</hi>) doth
not at all exclude, but rather presuppose a Ministerial'
mission, that <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apostle before hand. Nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
upon further search these will be found to be much
coincident: <hi>How can they preach unless they be sent?</hi> Sent,
by whom? They say, by God: Well then, we must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
in the Scripture how God sends Preachers: Thus
much is apparent, that God sends them by some call (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the gifting of them.) Whether this call be by
people, or by Officers, that is another dispute, which now
I shall not meddle with; this is sufficient to our purpose,
A call authorizing men to preach, is that whereby God
sends men to the work of preaching: If they were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Officers, then God sent them oft-times immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly;
if ordinary, then God sent them by the ministry
and mediation of men: And all those that were providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
sent by God to any place, were called either one way
or the other; And this calling or designation of them to
their office and work, is that which is commonly known
by the name of Sending. This authorization of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> is
called the sending of him, <hi>Isa</hi> 6. So it is called sending by
<hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 4. And this sending is that which is denied
to the false Prophets, <hi>Ier. 23. 21. I have not sent them;</hi>
were this meant of a providential sending, this were not
true, for so God did send them; and therefore the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, I did not authorize them. In this sense also Christ
bids us pray the Lord, <hi>that he would send forth labourers
into his harvest:</hi> How send them? for that, let Christ's
example interpret Christ's words, <hi>He sent forth the twelve,
Matth. 10. i. e.</hi> by giving them Command and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
So <hi>Luke 10. 1. After these things the Lord appointed
other seventy also, and sent them</hi>—And conformable to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100839:47"/>
this, was the example of the Apostles, who used to send
men into the Ministry, by fasting and prayer, and laying
on of hands; and this way of Sending is granted on all
hands, our Brethren cannot deny it: But for another way
of sending that remains yet to be proved. Hitherto we
have had no example of it, as hath been seen.</p>
               <p>4. Let it be considered that our Brethren observe that
this is brought in as a justification of the calling of the
Gentiles, and of the sending of Preachers to them by the
Apostles, which the Jews grumbled at: Upon which I
ground this inference, That the <hi>cannot</hi> here, <hi>How can they
preach unlesse they be sent,</hi> must be understood of a moral
impossibility, and not of a natural impossibility, as our
Brethren would have it: For if it be taken of a natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility,
it is false, for though the Apostles had not
sent them, they might have gone of their own accord, or
some other way: But if you take it for a moral impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
it runs smoothly; Whereas you Jews grumble at
us for sending Preachers to the Gentiles, we do no more
then what is necessary; for seeing God hath promised
that the Gentiles shall be saved by calling upon the Lord,
and they cannot call on God without beleeving, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
without hearing, nor hear without preaching, nor
preach without sending, <hi>i. e.</hi> not preach lawfully, unlesse
they be sent, either by an immediate call, or else by us
or others, who are authorized by God for that work,
and therefore we are not to be blamed for sending of
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exc.</hi> But (<hi>say they</hi>) all the other interrogations are to be
understood of a natural impossibility; It is naturally impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for one to call upon him on whom he beleeves not, or to
beleeve on him of whom he hears not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that this
only is meant of a moral impossibility, will be hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:100839:48"/>
But the Answer is easie, That it is a very frequent thing
in Scripture, for the same word to be used in divers senses;
as, <hi>Let the dead (i. e.</hi> spiritually) <hi>bury the dead (i. e.</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally.)
And (to keep to the very phrase) the word <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
is thus used, <hi>Ier. 13. 23. Can the Aethiopian change his
skin?</hi> &amp;c. There is a natural impossibility, <hi>then may ye also
do good that are accustomed to do evil,</hi> there is a moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility:
So in that comparison of our Saviour, <hi>A good
tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit,</hi> there is a natural impossibility;
<hi>How can ye being evil, speak good things,</hi> here is a moral
impossibility.</p>
               <p>5. If this be only a providential mission, by which these
Preachers are here said to be sent, then none at all are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
nay the very devils themselves, if they should
preach Christ (as they did sometimes in possessed persons)
must necessarily be taken into the number of the Preachers
here spoken of, (for even such would be providentially
sent) then which what can be more absurd. And I wish
our Brethren would duly consider that there is a necessity
of granting one of these two things; either that the devils
may be the Preachers here spoken of, or that the mission
here spoken of is not providential.</p>
               <p>I shall adde no more upon this account, only there are
some Arguments which they offer to prove that this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
here spoken of is not constitutive of a Minister.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They say,</hi> The Apostles were Officers and yet had missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
afterward, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Officers indeed they were while Christ lived,
they were constituted Preachers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. but they
were not Apostles of the Gentiles untill <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and
therefore it is not strange that when they were inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to that new and solemn work, they had a new and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
mission.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:100839:48"/>
2. This Argument is founded upon the ambiguity of
the word <hi>sent,</hi> or <hi>mission,</hi> which sometimes is taken for a
mans authorizing to a work, and so they had but one
mission to one kind of work; sometimes for a bare dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
of them to this or that particular place or work, and
in this case they might have a hundred missions: God
sent <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c.
yet surely our Brethren will not make all these to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
missions in the sense of the present dispute.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Mission</hi> (they say) <hi>may be repealed (so cannot a call
to an Office:</hi>) Mat. 10. &amp; 28. <hi>compared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That is taken off already: The Apostles had in
each place a distinct call to a distinct work.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They say,</hi> The seventy Disciples had mission to preach,
who were not Officers that we find.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is a contradiction, for if they had a mission
from Christ, that made them Officers, at least <hi>protempore;</hi>
for what is the making of one an Officer, but a solemn
designation of him for that work, by a person impowred
to authorize him.</p>
               <p>2. They might be Officers, though we do not reade
of it.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>They say,</hi> Then the instructions of none can be usefull
to work faith, but of Officers only; for this hearing is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to beleeving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That follows not, for though the only ordinary
means of begetting faith, is the hearing of a Gospel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
yet God is not bound up, he may and doth oft
times use private instructions of private men to that end:
And as it follows not, that it is simply impossible for a
man to beleeve that heareth no Preacher, because the
Apostle saith, <hi>How shall they hear without a Preacher?</hi>
(seeing God may work faith by immediate inspiration)
so it follows not that it is simply impossible for any man
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100839:49"/>
to be converted by hearing of one who is not ordained,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> because the Apostle saith, <hi>How shall they preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they be sent?</hi> But this only follows from both, that
the hearing of a Preacher sent, is the only ordinary means
of working faith and salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But we must not part thus, our Brethren adde that this
text is not cogent, because</hi> though it did prove a necessity of
a mission, yet it doth not prove a necessity of ordination (which
was the thing to be proved) seeing this mission is not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I shall not contend about words, nor is it perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to enter into a particular dispute about Ordination.
This is sufficient for our purpose, this mission is not the
bare gifting of them, but it is an authorizing of them to
the work, or the giving of them commission to preach:
Now there are but two Scripture waies of giving men
commission to preach that we know of, the one extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
from God immediatly (which our Brethren have
too much modesty to pretend) the other ordinary, by
men setting them apart to that work (whether the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
set them apart in the Name of Christ, or in the
Name of the Church, all is one as to this question) it
sufficeth us that some solemn designation or setting apart
is necessary, and that gifted men may not preach meerly
because they are gifted, unlesse they have some further
call or mission; which although our Brethren here seem
to grant, (in saying that the bare gifting of men is not the
sending of them) yet indeed they are obliged to deny by
vertue of their interpretation of that <hi>Text, 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 11.
where the meer having of that gift is propounded as a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground to put a man upon the use of it.</p>
               <p>But however let us hear what they have to prove that
this mission is not Ordination.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They say,</hi> We cannot find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:100839:49"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If you cannot finde it in expresse terms, yet others
have found it in clear consequences.</p>
               <p>2. Then Deacons are sent, for they were ordained, <hi>Acts</hi>
6. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Very true, Deacons were sent and had mission:
What advantage can our Brethren pick out thence?</p>
               <p>3. Mission may be repeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That was answered before.</p>
               <p>4. A Parochial Presbytery, if sufficient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may ordain
one for that Church, but they cannot send one to themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That Presbytery doth not send an Officer in
such a case to themselves, but to the Church, and so there
is a sufficient distinction between the person sending, and
the person sent.</p>
               <p>2. A locall distinction is not necessary between the
person sent, and the persons to whom a man is sent.
<hi>Isaiah</hi> was sent to the whole house of <hi>Israel;</hi> now put case
<hi>Isaiah</hi> be in the Temple when he is sent, and with him
divers Jews, I say, he is in Scripture phrase sent as well
to those that are locally present, as to those that were
absent.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>They adde,</hi> That mission is propounded at the end of
Ordination, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 14. And he ordained twelve, that—
he might send them forth to preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The strength of this Argument lies in the
ambiguity of the word <hi>Sent,</hi> which, as we readily grant,
sometimes it signifies a locall mission to a place, so again,
at other times it signifies a constitutive mission to an
Office.</p>
               <p>2. Though the words in the English make some shew
for them, yet indeed if one look into the Greek, it is but
a meer shew, for it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>acquisivit,
comparavit,</hi> he got, procured, took twelve into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
bred them up under his roof, that he might fit them
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100839:50"/>
for, and so send them into the work of the Ministry; so
that indeed the word whereby their Ordination is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
is plainly that of <hi>sending;</hi> and the other, however
it came to be rendred by our Translators, <hi>he ordained</hi> (who
neither meant it in such a sense as our Brethren do, nor
ever dreamed that it would be so made use of) yet indeed
signifies nothing but barely the taking of them into his
family, his constituting of them members of his family,
and not his ordaining of them to be Officers in his Church.
And thus I have dispatched all that hath any moment,
which is alleadged by our Brethren, as to this place.</p>
               <p>There are divers other things they adde, which being
lesse material, I may trust the judgement of any common
Reader with them; as when they say, <hi>It is not a Church,
nor a Presbytery, but Christ who sends Ministers:</hi> Which if
they understand thus, that Christ only doth it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
soveraignly, authoritatively, they have not us for their
adversaries; but if they so mean it (as they must, or else
it is nothing to the purpose) that men cannot send <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Ministerially, it is too gross to be beleeved by any man
that reads the New Testament, and therein finds so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rules and examples of Gods sending by the Ministry of
men, as <hi>Acts 6. Acts 13, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So when they say,</hi> That the mission of Ministers is not by
a Presbytery, but by the Word; and that Christs command to
go and preach, is a mediate calling to all lawfull preachers,
though no Presbyters should urge it upon them; and that a
Presbytery only sends in a Doctrinal way, as a private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
also may do, by saying, <hi>Go and Teach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where we have almost as many absurdities as words.</p>
               <p>1. Two things are opposed that ought to be conjoyned,
to wit, the Agent and the Rule, the Presbytery sends,
but this they must do according to the Word.</p>
               <p>2. All manner of calling, either by a Presbytery, or by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100839:50"/>
a Church, is made wholly superfluous; For they here
plainly assert, that Christ's saying, <hi>Go preach,</hi> is a calling
and a mediate calling to all lawfull Preachers, and that
gifted men are lawfull Preachers, is their great businesse
to prove; and if they say a call is further necessary, here
is a call reaching to all gifted men: I am much mistaken if
many of their own Brethren of the Congregational way,
will not reject and abhor such loose assertions as these.</p>
               <p>3. They allow as much to a private Christian, as to a
Presbytery, both of them send in a doctrinal way. But
the very mention of these Paradoxes is an ample Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the first Argument.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THe second is taken from</hi> Heb. 5 4, 5. No man taketh this
honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he that is called of God—</p>
               <p>To this they Answer two things.</p>
               <p>1. If this prove a call, yet it proves not a call by imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hands, which is that they contend for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We are not now medling with that particular kind
of call, nor is this place alledged to prove it, but only to
prove this in the general, that notwithstanding the
highest gifts and qualifications fitting them for any Office,
they must also have a call and designation to that Office,
and that remains unshaken by all that they have said.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> he speaks not of Gospel Ministers, but of
Priests, and of the high Priests only, which are an higher or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than Ministers, and prefigured Christ, and it follows
not, because a call was necessary to the highest order of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
therefore it must be necessary to an inferiour order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Let me take the boldnesse to question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100839:51"/>
the Gospel Ministers are an inferiour order to the
high Priest or no? If it be affirmed upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are types of Christ, then upon that account
the inferiour Priests were of an higher order. (That I say
not, the goats, and sheep, and buls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which also were
types of Christ.) If this be the reason, because they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated
sin, they did it only Ministerially and Declarative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by typifying and applying the true expiatory sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;
and that also is the Office of a Gospel-Minister,
<hi>Ioh. 20. 23. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted.</hi>—
However it is, sure I am the Lord Jesus doubts not to
preferre <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> before all the old Testament Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and that in regard of his work, and to preferre the
meanest New Testament Minister before him.</p>
               <p>2. If the work of the high Priest was higher, and that
must be weighed on the one hand, then let it be weighed
on the other hand, that the gifts of Christ were more
glorious. And this assertion I may venture to lay down,
that Jesus Christ had more warrant to undertake the
highest Office in the Church without a call, than one who
is but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a meer man hath to take the meanest
Office without a call.</p>
               <p>The third and fourth Arguments I shall omit, because
there is nothing that I find in our Brethrens Answer,
which will need a Reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fifth Argument is taken from</hi> those rules laid down
about the calling of men into the Ministry, and about the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of their qualifications, and one main reason of it was this,
that false Doctrine might be prevented, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3, 4.
<hi>Tit</hi> 1. 5, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this they Answer,</hi> 1. This concludes for the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Officers only, not against the preaching of gifted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
who lay no claim to the Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The best clew for the guiding of us in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100839:51"/>
of every Law is the reason of the Law: Now if
one great reason why the Apostle was so carefull to try
and approve of Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was this, to prevent false
Doctrine; then upon the same account, he was obliged
to be as careful to try all Preachers, for else he had made
a hedge about the sheep, and yet left one gap open, which
indeed was enough to frustrate the design of the hedge:
What if none be allowed to be shepheards by Office, but
such as are called, will it not be of as bad consequence, if the
wolves be allowed to take upon them the exercise of the
shepheards work? We see by experience, some gifted
men preaching occasionally and disseminating their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
opinions, have done more to poison the people,
than an able Minister by his instant and diligent labours
could do to preserve and nourish them. What is the
ground of the Apostles strictnesse in admitting men into
the Ministry (<hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man</hi>) but this,
the difficulty and importance of the work? And what
work is more difficult and important than that of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to do it as becomes the Gospel? <hi>Paul</hi> prefers it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the rest, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. And in regard of this work, it is
that he cries out, <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> 2 Cor.
2. 16. So that it were a strange incongruity and self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
for the Apostle to use so much care in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Office-Preachers, and yet to be wholly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
as to another sort of Preachers, who may preach fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
(yea as often as the other, according to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
Principles) without coming under such a harsh
and ungratefull examination and ordination.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> There ought to be care to chuse Officers that
are sound in the Faith, but this the people must look to in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But this relieves them not, for what care shall be
taken as to their gift-Preachers, who may preach without
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100839:52"/>
the Churches election, nay are under a command to
preach, as they are pleased to expound 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God I say, which no man can dispense with: I
know our Brethren say, that <hi>to a mans exercise of his gifts
in this or that place, there is required a call from the people or
the Magistrate,</hi> p. 149. But this will not help them; for
I demand, whether in case the Apostles had neither been
called by people nor Magistrate, Whether that had been
a sufficient discharge to them from the execution of their
Office? I trow not: Nay they preached when they were
forbidden; and why? but for the reason now mentioned,
to wit, that they were under a command of God, which
no mortal man could dispense with: And therefore if gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men are under a like command, pressed with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
penalties, to preach (as our Brethren say) they may
and must preach, though they have no call, neither from
people nor Magistrate.</p>
               <p>The sixth Argument I am sure will stand upon its own
legs, taken from that confusion which will necessarily
come into the Church by this means, which indeed the
sad experience of our Church in these daies doth so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
demonstrate, that I shall need to confute
him that denies it, only as the Philosopher did confute
him that said there was no motion by walking before him;
so I shall only point him unto reall Arguments, and desire
him to make use of his own eyes, reason and observation,
and he will quickly be of the same opinion.</p>
               <p>But these Arguments were not directly levied against
our Brethren, (whom we acknowledge to be more sober)
but against such as pleaded for a promiscuous assumption
of the Office. The next Position laid down by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Assembly indeed doth more nearly concern them,
which is this, <hi>That none may do the work of the Ministry
without Ordination.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>ANd to this purpose they urge eight Arguments,
which to me still seem very considerable, and my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
is, that if any judicious man of another minde,
could but redeem himself from the prevailing power of
prejudice, and duly ponder our Arguments and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
he will find that all the assaults they make against
them are vain and ineffectual: But it shall not be taken
upon my word.</p>
               <p>I will 1. propound our Arguments. 2. Take notice
of their Answers; wherein I promise them not disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuosly
to conceal or neglect any thing wherein their
strength lies. 3. I shall adde something (where it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
for the vindication of those Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That work, for the doing of which, God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
special Officers of his own, neither ought, nor may be
done by any others; But God hath designed special Officers for
this work of preaching.</p>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is granted; but all the doubt lies about the
<hi>major,</hi> and that is the Proposition which our Brethren de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and they give three instances to the contrary; <hi>Prayer
is the special work of Ministers,</hi> Acts 6. 4. <hi>We will give our
selves to prayer: And so is exhorting and reproving,</hi> &amp;c.
Tit 1. 5, &amp;c. <hi>Distribution of worldly goods is the Deacons
work, and yet others may Pray, Exhort and Rebuke, give
Almes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. For Prayer, it is true, it is the duty of all men,
and of Ministers more than others, but that it was a work
for which the Office of the Ministry was appointed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth this text assert, nor did ever any man dream,
and so that is wholly impertinent to the case in hand: One
may as well say, that the Office of the Ministry was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100839:53"/>
for the work of hospitality, because they especially
must be given to hospitality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. as to say, that it
was designed for the work of prayer, because they especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
must give themselves to prayer.</p>
               <p>2. For the Deacons work, that is not barely the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of worldly goods, but the distribution of the
Churches goods (which our Brethren here do either sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly
or unwarily, which I rather think, confound) and
this latter none but the Deacon may do, so that this may
be retorted upon them, that as the appointment of the
Deacon for that work of distributing the Churches almes,
is a sufficient reason to prove that no private man ought to
do it, so also is the appointment of a Minister, for the
work of preaching, a sufficient intimation that other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may not undertake that work.</p>
               <p>3. For that work of reproving and exhorting, they
may do it, but privatly, not publickly.</p>
               <p>Against this our Brethren object two things.</p>
               <p>1. If an Officer rebuketh a member in private, this he
doth as an Officer, so that the publicknesse of an act is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make it an act of Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This depends upon a meer mistake. It is one
thing to say the publicknesse of the act of exhorting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
makes it an act of Office, or that a publick act is an act of
Office, that we affirm. It is another thing to say that no
act but a publick act is an act of Office (as our Brethren
mistake it) this we affirm not, nor is it for our purpose to
assert it; nay, we assert that an Officers private rebuke is
an act of Office.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> If it be the different way and manner of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that maketh an act to be an act of Office, then their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
concerns not the work it self, but the manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and so all which it proves is this, that none ought to do
the Officers work in the same manner as he doth it, <hi>i. e.</hi> not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100839:53"/>
officially, and this we readily grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Our Argument concerns the work, but then
it must be the work in question, and that our Brethren
well know was not exhorting in general, but publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting:
But of this more hereafter. It must now be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that the Provincial Assembly confirmed the
<hi>major</hi> by three Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first was this, Because</hi> God hath severely punished
such as have done those works, for which he hath appointed
special Officers, as <hi>Saul, Uzzah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this our Brethren Answer two things.</p>
               <p>1. That these were cases of necessity, and so if they prove
any thing, they prove that gifted men may not preach, no,
not in a case of necessity, which is allowed by your selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The case is not parallel, nor is the necessity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
of Preaching and Sacrificing; Preaching (as our
Brethren will grant) is absolutely necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so is not Sacrificing; nor was Sacrificing neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in that case for <hi>Israels</hi> deliverance (if God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
an opportunity of sacrificing) I conceive the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell
will lie right between their sacrifices and our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
neither of which are necessary to salvation, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate
medii.</hi> And hereby the Argument will receive
further light and strength, <hi>i. e.</hi> Because God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
peculiar Officers for the administration of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
(as well as their Sacrifices) therefore they
ought not to be administred by persons out of Office, no,
not in any case of a pretended necessity (forasmuch as
there is no absolute and real necessity of either Sacrifices
or Sacraments to salvation.) And thus far our Brethren
must consent with us, unlesse they will turn grosse separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
and allow a liberty also for gifted men to administer
the Sacraments, which I am confident they will not.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say</hi> the case is not alike; for there was an express
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100839:54"/>
prohibition of these acts to any, except Officers, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 15. &amp;
16. 40. <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. 5. &amp; <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 22, 23. The preaching of
gifted men is not thus forbidden: And besides not only the
manner but the matter of these workes were forbidden to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> A thing may be prohibited two waies, either in
expresse terms, or by solid consequence: I suppose our
Brethren are far from that dotage which divers Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
and Socinians run into, that we are not to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with Scripture consequences, but to look for express
Scripture, as if men must not beleeve what God saith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he speak it in their way: There are many things
confessedly unlawful, which are not prohibited in express
terms, but only by some general rules and Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences:
What if I should keep to the instance of <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah?</hi>
who was punished not principally, at least not sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because he did touch the Ark with his hands, but
because he did not bear it upon his shoulders; which the
Levites were to do: Now (I say) as in this case, Gods
command that the Ark should be carried upon the Levites
shoulders, was a command that it should be carried so
only, and it was a prohibition to the Levites or any other,
to carry it any other way; so in our case, Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Officers to preach, is a prohibition to others to
invade that work. Again, let me make this supposition
(which no ingenuous man can disallow of,) Suppose that
<hi>Paul</hi> had not expresly prohibited women to preach, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
our Brethren to answer me, whether, in that case,
it had been lawfull for gifted women to preach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
or no: If they say <hi>yea,</hi> then I argue thus against
them, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth not establish a new Law, but revives
and interprets an old Law, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 34. Let your women
keep silence—for it is not permitted unto them to speak, but
they are commanded to be under obedience, as saith the Law.</hi>
So that it was forbidden by the Law before that time,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100839:54"/>
and had been unlawful, though <hi>Paul</hi> had never prohibited
it. If they say, <hi>no,</hi> then I argue thus, that an expresse
prohibition is not necessary, for such there had not been
in the case supposed, nor had women been prohibited any
other way but thus, Preaching was committed unto
certain men in authority, commissionated for that work:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> it was prohibited to persons under authority, and
because all women are under authority, therefore are they
universally excluded from this work: I add further, that
it is a granted case in the businesse of the Sacraments, the
administration whereof is prohibited to all un-officed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(our brethren themselves being Judges) and how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited?
There is no more an expresse prohibition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
men from administring the Sacraments, then from
preaching, but only it is therefore judged prohibited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God had appointed Officers for the doing of that
work, and therefore implicitly prohibited the doing of it
by others; and surely the prohibition doth equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
both preaching and administring the Sacraments by
others, forasmuch as both the manner of prohibition is
the same in both, and the reason of the prohibition, to wit,
because Officers were appointed by God for those works:
And thus I have vindicated the first proof of the <hi>major,</hi>
wherein I have been the larger, because it is a principal
point, and because what our Brethren excepted had some
colour of reason, although I am not without hope, that
our Brethren themselves by this time may see, that it was
a colour only, and no substance.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The</hi> major <hi>was proved thus,</hi> That otherwise the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
God hath appointed are made void, or at least unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and insufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this they say,</hi> This will prove as strongly that Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are unnecessary, at least to the work of private exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
seeing private Christians may do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:100839:55"/>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is very true, and naturally follows, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
private Christians may reprove privatly, therefore
there needed no peculiar Officers to be set apart for that
work of private reproving, and if that were the whole
work of a Minister, there would need no Officers for the
work of the Ministry: But because there is another, and
an higher work of the Ministry, which private Christians
may not do, <hi>i. e.</hi> the work of publick preaching, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that there are Officers appointed for it.</p>
               <p>3. Hereby the order instituted by God in the Church is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this they say,</hi> It is not. As a Fathers teaching of
his children doth not destroy the order of Schoolmasters, nor
take away the distinction between Master and Schollar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is true that a Father teaching privately, doth
not destroy the relation of a Schoolmaster and Schollar,
but if Fathers did, and might promiscuously teach in a
publick way, this would destroy, or at least much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
that comely order. In like manner, that a Father or
any Christian teach others privatly, is no way prejudicial
to publick teaching, but eminently subservient to it, and
we heartily wish it were more conscientiously and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practised; but if publick teaching were promiscuously
allowed to all gifted men (whether Masters or Schollars)
surely this would be repugnant to the order instituted by
Christ, that one member of Christs body should usurp the
acts of another. And thus much shall suffice for the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the first Argument used by the Provincial Assembly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second Argument was this,</hi> No religious service
may be performed by any persons not appointed, nor warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereunto: But persons gifted are not appointed nor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Brethren deny the</hi> minor, <hi>they say,</hi> gifted persons
are appointed to preach. <hi>Against this, was argued as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100839:55"/>
If they are appointed to preach, then every gifted man
that preacheth not is guilty of a sin of omission. <hi>To this they
answer,</hi> he is not guilty, if he want an opportunity, a call
from others to exercise his gifts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> I would gladly know whether the Apostles had
been excused if they had refused to preach at all, for
want of a call from men to preach; What if both Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and people had not desired them to preach, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did this give them a <hi>supersedeas</hi> or no? If they say it
did, I suppose many are not of their mind, I am sure for
one, that was <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was not only not call'd to
preach, but forbidden to preach, yet he accounted it his
duty to preach, <hi>Act. 5. 29. We ought to obey God rather than
men.</hi> If they say it did not discharge them from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then I demand why it did not; surely all the account
which can fairly be given of it must be this, They were
by God appointed and obliged to preach, and therefore no
men can dis-oblige them: And upon the same ground; if
gifted men were appointed by God for that work, the
negligence of men not desiring them, (provided they
would permit or hear them) would not dis-ob<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ige them:
Add to this, that whatever gifts a man hath, he is bound
to exercise them wherever he can (where he is not restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and put under some kind of impossibility of doing it)
whether he be desired or no: A Christian having received
a gift of private instruction, he is obliged to instruct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
not only when they desire him, but when they do
not, whenever he can have conveniency and opportunity
so to do: And in like manner (if our Brethren say true,
that all gifted men as such, are appointed by God to
preach) if a man have a gift of publick instruction, he is
obliged to use it whenever he can be permitted so to do,
and not only when others call him to the exercise of his
gift. And this is the more forcible against them, because
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100839:56"/>
they reduce those preaching gifts unto the talents spoken
of <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. which talents whoever useth not, is under a
most dreadfull curse and commination: Now, as it is in
other talents, if a man have received riches, honour, parts,
interest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he must use and exercise them for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whether he be desired or no; so in like manner accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their hypothesis, his preaching talent must be laid
out, whether the people desire it or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our third Argument was this,</hi> No man may do the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Magistrate or Deacon, who is not called to it: <hi>Ergo</hi>
none may do the Office of a Minister, who is not called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>To this Argument they Answer divers things.</p>
               <p>1. If this Argument hold, then, as no man that is no
Magistrate, may do one act of the Magistrates, so no man
that is not ordained, may do <hi>one</hi> act of the Minister, he may
not preach once, though as a probationer, which is against our
Brethrens own principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a double flaw in this discourse; For,</p>
               <p>1. There is not <hi>Par ratio;</hi> there is not equal necessity
of mens trials in order to both works: It is necessary a
Minister should do the work of a Minister, <hi>viz.</hi> Preach
in order to his Trial and Ordination to that work. But
it is not necessary a man should do the work of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
in order to his trial, for his abilities may be fully
known other waies.</p>
               <p>2. In cases of necessity private men may do the work
of the Magistrate: It is proper to the Magistrate to take
away a mans life, and yet in a case of necessity, as if a
private man be assaulted by a Rogue upon the high-way,
it is lawfull for him, if he can, to take away his life.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They Answer,</hi> Care may be taken otherwaies, there may
be approbation without Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is true, men may devise twenty waies of their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100839:56"/>
own, as indeed there is a marvellous pronenesse in men to
set up their own devises in Gods worship; and whenever
they are convinced of the necessity of using any means in
order to an end, rather to contrive means and waies of
their own, than to use such as God hath already appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which, I fear, is our Brethrens miscarriage here: God
hath appointed an Ordination, and an examination and
approbation in order to Ordination, and of Ordination
the Scripture speaks more clearly and frequently, than of
any other approbation; nor do I remember that ever it
speaks of the approbation of any Preachers, but in order
to Ordination; our Brethren have forsaken this Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, and introduced a new device, of approbation
without Ordination. And because the occasion here leads
me to it, I cannot but take notice of one thing, whereas I
am informed some persons, through carelesnesse or osci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy,
or wilfulnesse, or ignorance, have taken up this
conceit, that an Approbation from the <hi>Commissioners</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the tryall of Publick Preachers, is a kind of
Ordination, and may serve in stead of it: I would have
them here to take notice, that this is not only false in it
self, but against the very words of that Act whereby they
are constituted, wherein an expresse protestation is made
(as elsewhere hath been observed) <hi>That they themselves do
not intend that this shall be taken as an Ecclesiasticall call, but
only a Civil dispensation of the Magistrates right to particular
places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas it was urged, that</hi> The work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
being a work of greater consequence and difficulty, than
the work of the Magistrate or the Deacon, it requires greater
care.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They Answer,</hi> Men may perform some works of greater
consequence, who yet may not perform works of lesse conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
To beleeve is an act of higher consequence, than to do
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100839:57"/>
the work of a Deacon, yet every Christian may beleeve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This is a meer fallacy, for though beleeving is a
work of greater difficulty and consequence in relation to a
mans self, yet not in relation to the Church and other
men, and that is it we are treating of; so that the
work of beleeving is altogether impertinent in this place,
for we are speaking of such works as relate to others,
and wherein there is a care required in relation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but beleeving is a work confined to a mans
self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our fourth Argument was this,</hi> None may administer
the Sacraments who is uncalled; Therefore none may preach
who is uncalled, for these two are joyned together in that
Commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. and preaching is the greater
work, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
               <p>Our Brethren make many exceptions against this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They say it makes against us,</hi> For you (<hi>say they</hi>)
separate between preaching and baptizing, you allow men to
preach probation-wise, not to administer the Sacraments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation-wise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The reason of the difference is apparent, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
probation-wise is simply necessary in order to their
Approbation and Ordination, for the trial of their gifts,
and so this preaching is in a case of necessity, and therefore
allowable; but there is no necessity at all of trying their
gifts by administring the Sacraments, seeing there are
none of their gifts exercised there, but such as are fully
discovered by their trial in preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> Matth. 28. is no Commission authorizing
them either to preach or baptize, (that Commission they had
afore, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.) and therefore could not now be
constituted afresh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Give me leave however to propound it as my
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100839:57"/>
private opinion, though I shall not be positive in it, and
I know there are some difficulties in the way, that the
Apostles were indeed Officers before, but not Officers of
the same kind, and therefore might well require another
commission: If a man be a Captain in an Army, he is an
Officer; but if he be made a Collonel, he must have a
new Commission: If a man be a Deacon in a Church, he
is an Officer; but if he be made a Minister, he needs a
new Commission: If a man had been made a Pastour and
Teacher in the Apostles daies, this man had been an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer;
but, if he had afterwards been made an Apostle, he
had needed a new Commission: And this I take to be
well-nigh a parallel to our case: For the Apostles it is true,
were Officers before this, but I humbly conceive they
were not Apostles before this; which I think will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
by these three Considerations. 1. That an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
strictly so called, was a new Testament Officer, and
therefore such an Office was not in being before the new
Testament began: But the new Testament did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
till the death of Christ (as all intelligent Divines
grant) for that was it which rent the vail, and abolished
the Jewish pedagogy. 2. They were not Apostles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and formally, untill they had Apostollicall gifts:
But these gifts they had not before the death of Christ.
3. They wanted universality of jurisdiction (which was
the constant character of an Apostle) nay indeed, so far
were they from having a jurisdiction over all Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time, that they had not jurisdiction over all the
Jews, nor (to speak strictly) over any of the Jews, for
as much as they were, till Christ death, subject to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
of the Jewish Priests, that being not taken away
but by the death of Christ: And surely it is something
strange to fancy them to be Apostles without any juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.
I conclude therefore, they were rather Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100839:58"/>
or extraordinary Teachers, than Apostles, (and so
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Firmin</hi> affirms of <hi>Paul</hi> before <hi>Act. 13. Mat.</hi> 10.) and
had not their Commission as Apostles, till <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.
19, 20.</p>
               <p>2. Put case that <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. is not a formal Commission,
yet it must needs be granted, that it is a renewing and
confirming, and enlarging of their former Commission,
and therein their work is afresh proposed to them, and
enjoyned upon them, and that is sufficient for our purpose;
for this work is double, preaching and administring the
Sacraments, which being equally imposed upon them,
must by like reason be equally restrained to them, unlesse
better grounds can be shewn to the contrary, than have
yet been given.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They say,</hi> It is denied by some that preaching is a
greater work than baptizing. The sealing of a Deed is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
work than the writing of it; every Clerk may write it, but
only the Conveyancer can seal it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Question is not, whether preaching or bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
be greater in regard of the dignity of the work?
but in regard of the difficulty of it: As in the instance
proposed; The sealing of the Deed is a work of greater
dignity, but the writing of the Deed is a work of more
difficulty, and therefore belongs to him who is appointed
for such works, and who hath more skill in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such works: So in this case, preaching which
answers to the writing of the Deed, being a work of far
greater difficulty, than the applying of the seal, it was
requisite that greater or at least equal care should be taken
in it, and that it should be managed by none but such as
are both fitted for, and appointed to the work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fifth Argument was this,</hi> To usurp authority is a sin;
But Preaching is an act of Authority, and therefore for persons
not in Office to preach, is to usurp Authority, and so to sin,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100839:58"/>
1 <hi>Thes. 5. 12. Heb.</hi> 7. The losse is blessed of the greater:
Women must not preach, because they must not usurp Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. In Preaching the key of the kingdom of Heaven
is used, which is an authoritative act.</p>
               <p>Against this our Brethren offer divers exceptions, some
whereof are impertinent, and some frivolous: All that
hath any appearance of probability, I shall take notice
of.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They say,</hi> Preaching is no act of Authority, for if a
man preach to Heathens, where no Church is; How can he
usurp authority over the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> True, he cannot usurp authority over the Church,
but authority he useth towards them to whom he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
when <hi>Paul</hi> preached to Heathens, it was an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
act, no lesse than when he preached to the Church:
He preached as an Ambassadour to one as well as to the
other: And seeing that <hi>Paul</hi> or any other Minister preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Heathens, or such as are yet unreconciled, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as in Christs stead, it can be no other than an act of
authority.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> There may be other waies to give authority
to men to preach, besides Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Our Brethren should do well to remember
that Golden saying of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to bring
in nothing without Scripture evidence: Ordination, we
know, and there are clear Scriptures warranting that,
and much more clear and undoubted for that, than for
Election (as hath been often observed) but for a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
warrant for another way of authorizing men to the
work of the Ministry without Ordination, we know none,
and if our Brethren know any, they should do well to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>For</hi> Heb 7. <hi>They say,</hi> Indeed he that blesseth by an
original, inherent power, as Christ doth, he is greater than
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100839:59"/>
he that is blessed, and of such a blessing the Text speaketh;
but he that blesseth Ministerially, and instrumentally is not
alwaies greater than he that is blessed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This is very grosse, and contrary to the Text,
which evidently speaks of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> who blessed only
Ministerially (and not by any original power) and yet
that kind of blessing the Apostle alledgeth as an evidence
of his superiority over <hi>Abraham</hi> as the party blessed, and
if this were not spoken of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> it were wholly
impertinent to the present cause, which was to prove that
<hi>Melchizedek</hi> was greater than <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>They say,</hi> There is a plain difference between teaching
and usurping authority over the man, so the Text runs: But
I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the
man, but to be in silence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. This should not have been said by such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to know any thing which belongs to the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scripture, wherein it is so familiar a thing, to use
a conjunction disjunctive, or a word disjoyning one thing
from another, when indeed the one explains the other:
Shall any, who reads <hi>Rev. 22. 15. For without are dogs, and
sorcerers, and whoremongers,</hi> thence infer that these sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not the dogs there intended, because they
are distinguished from them? This would be plainly
childish. And (to give an instance in the very same kind
of conjunction) <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12. speaking of the Gospel, he
saith, <hi>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught
it, but by the revelation of Iesus Christ;</hi> where the latter is
not distinct from, but expositive of the former, for how
could he receive it from man, any other way then by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taught it?</p>
               <p>2. For their phrase in this place, the Apostle hath so
hem'd it in on both sides with an <hi>exegesis,</hi> that no rational
man can doubt of it: On the one side of it teaching is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100839:59"/>
on the other side silence is enjoyned: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more evident, then that he speaks of that
usurpation of authority which consisted in teaching, and
is opposed to silence. And for what they adde, <hi>That the
Apostle speaks of her usurping authority over the man,</hi> i. e.
<hi>her husband, not over the Church. Answer,</hi> This is indeed
to seek a knot in a bulrush: For, <hi>the man</hi> here is not to
be understood singularly, for her husband (there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Text which either commands or warrants
such a sense) but indefinitely, for any man: For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
is comparing sex with sex in the general, not hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and wife in particular: And if this Text concerns
such women also as have no husbands (which I beleeve
our Brethren will not deny) then the Apostle speaks of
usurping authority over the male kind in the Church, not
over an husband. To which may be added, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
here spoken of, is not an Oeconomicall, but a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall,
an Ecclesiasticall authority; not an authority in
the Family, but in the Church; not an authority assumed
in some Family administration, but in a Church affair.
If it be further said (for I shall improve their Argument to
the highest) that the Apostles forbidding this usurping of
authority to the women, allows it to the men; I Answer,
It no way follows, no more then it follows, that the
<hi>French</hi> Laws, when they prohibit women from usurping
authority, or wielding the Scepter, do allow it to all men;
or then it would follow, if a Law were made, that no
woman should usurp authority in a corporation, that
therefore every man ought to do it, which is so far from
being true, that on the contrary such an act would not
only forbid women also, but all others untill they were
called to it.</p>

it, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 34. Let your women keep silence—it is not
permitted for them to speak, but to be in subjection, as saith
the Law:</hi> Whence the inference is plain and undeniable,
that to speak, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Church, is unlawful for those
who are in a state of subjection: And because all unoffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
persons are in a state of subjection as well as women,
therefore by the same reason they are forbidden to preach,
for my part, this is so clear, that he that shall resist such
evidence, I shall despair of ever seeing him convinced by
man.</p>
               <p>I shall pass over this only taking notice of two things,
which concern our present controversie.</p>
               <p>1. That it is not only constant preaching, but even
occasionall preaching which is here forbidden them: And
so, by a parity of reason, gifted men unless in case of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and with order to trial for Ordination, which also is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
as hath been argued, may not so much as preach
once and their preaching though sparingly, is as clearly,
though not so grossly contrary to this prohibition, as to
preach constantly.</p>
               <p>2. That it is the work, and not the manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is here forbidden: The very work of publick
preaching is here forbidden them: This I say, to prevent
a common evasion of our Brethren, that gifted men may
not and cannot preach in the same manner as ordained
persons, <hi>i. e.</hi> they cannot do it authoritatively, yet the
work they may do: And why may not I have the same
liberty, and apply it to the case of women, and say that
they may do the work, although they cannot do it in the
same manner, <hi>i. e.</hi> with authority: If I should say so, it
would be easie to silence me, by saying, that the very act
of preaching is spoken of, as an act of authority, and that
may justly silence them too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The sixth Argument was this,</hi> The Scripture reproves
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100839:62"/>
uncalled men for preaching. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 21, 22. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
not onely for preaching false doctrine, but for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without a call, for running without being sent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this our Brethren return this strange Answer;</hi> That
these were Prophets rightly called by God; and they are blamed
for this that being Prophets they did not prophesie right things
<hi>pag.</hi> 128.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This is a little too grosse, to say, they are by God
called to be Prophets, of whom God professeth, <hi>They
ran but he sent them not:</hi> Whether shall we believe God or
our Brethren? And this is the more considerable, because
it was not with Prophets as it is with ordinary Gospel-Ministers
(who besides the delivery of a message to them
from God, must also have a solemn mission and authoriza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the work) for the Prophets had no other call then
this, or at lest, this was Gods usuall way of calling them,
he immediately inspired them with an extraordinary mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage:
And when God vouchsafed to send such a message,
that was taken for an authorization of them, or a call to
be a Prophet, as plainly appears in the case of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. where after God had delivered a message to and
by <hi>Samuel,</hi> it followes, <hi>v. 20. And all Israel knew that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
was established to be a Prophet of the Lord:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on the contrary seeing these Prophets were such as
had not any message at all from God that we read of)
thereby it is evident that they were not Prophets,
and he that faith, they were such, as he asserts it
<hi>gratis,</hi> so it is plaine, it is but an opinion taken up <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
to gratify their cause. And I am perswaded had
not our Brethren been hurried into this fancy by the
favourable aspect it hath to their doctrine, they would
have rejected it as wholly ridiculous. Whereas they urge
that saying, <hi>If they had stood in my counsell, and had caused
my people to hear my words, then they should have turned
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100839:63"/>
them from their evil way, but the Lord would not have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
his blessing upon the labours of false Prophets.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
1. As the words are here rendred, they no way
oppose our doctrine, for, The standing in Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
and speaking Gods Words, implies a call, as hath
been shewed; as if he had said If they had waited till I
had sent them, and delivered my message to them,
then they might have expected a blessing. 2. It must
be observed that there is another reading proposed by
some learned men, which as it is very conformable to the
Hebrew Text, so it is more probable in it self, and more
consonant to the context, to read it thus, <hi>If they had
stood in my counsel,</hi> i. e. <hi>if they had stood till I had
sent them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they would have profited this people and they
would have turned them from their evil way;</hi> whereas now
they did encourage them in it; so that he brings in this as
an evidence, that they were false Prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The seventh Argument used by the Provinciall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
was this:</hi> The Ministers of Christ have been as carefull to
make proof of their mission as of their doctrine, <hi>Cal. 1. Joh.</hi>
3. 27, 28. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this they say:</hi> 1. If it prove a call, yet it proves not
that this call is ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That is not the businesse, to speak of this or that
particular call, (that is proved in another proposition)
but onely in the generall to shew, that over and besides
gifts, some other call, mission, or designation from God,
either immediate, or mediate, is required; and this is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
against our Brethren, who assert, that any man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gifts, is <hi>eo nomine,</hi> called by God to preach, and his
gifts alone sufficiently warrant him, though he have no
other call.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> The reason why Paul proves his mission,
was but for his doctrines sake, and although it was necessary for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100839:63"/>
Paul to prove his immediate call; and to prove the divinenesse
of the doctrines of the Gospel, yet there is no such reason to
make it necessary to prove a mediate call.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. I do not understand that the proof of <hi>Pauls</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
mission was necessary to prove the divineness
of his doctrine, for then, those ordinary officers that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that time could not have proved the divinenesse of
their doctrine. Besides, there are, and were diverse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
excellent and sufficient mediums to prove his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
by, he proved it out of the Law and the Prophets,
by miracles, by ocular witnesses of Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true he proves his mission for his doctrines
sake, and that makes not against us at all, but for us, seeing
if <hi>Paul</hi> had preached without a call, he had given just
occasion to suspect his doctrine and to doubt of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of it, (because they that reject Gods warrant to the
office, have no reason to promise to themselves Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the work) And therefore it followes strongly, that
much more ought Ministers, who have far lesse gifts then
<hi>Paul</hi> had, to prove their mission and call, or else they must
give men leave to doubt of the certainty of their doctrine.
It is true (what our Brethren say) that, <hi>the proofe of an
ordinary call is no sufficient argument to prove the truth of
the doctrine, seeing ordinary lawfull Ministers may erre:</hi>
But yet when a man cannot prove his call, that may render
his doctrine doubtfull, and the reason is, because, <hi>Bonum
oritur ex integris, malum ex quolibet defectu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make a mans preaching regular many things must
concurre, he must be called, he must preach agreeable to
the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the want of any one of these will
make it irregular.</p>
               <p>Other things they say, but because they are
triviall, I wave them, as not having such store of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100839:64"/>
time as to throw it away to no purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The eighth and last Argument was this.</hi> That work
may not be performed which cannot be performed in faith:
But preaching by a gifted Brother, not called, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be
done in faith; for, 1. Such have no precept to preach.
2. There is no precept for people to hear them or maintaine
them. 3. They have no promise of assistance, of protection,
of successe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which our Brethren say something: But because
they adde nothing of any weight, except that which hath
been said by themselves before, and by us answered; to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
Tautologies, I shall ease my self, and Reader, of the
trouble of following them: There is one thing onely
which is very observable, that they say nothing as to that
which is most considerable in the argument, which is the
matter of maintenance; which I must desire them seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and conscientiously to peruse, and let them take it
in this form, and give me leave to improve it.</p>
               <p>All Scripture-Preachers may challenge maintenance:
But all gifted men (though preaching) cannot challenge
maintenance, Therefore they are no Scripture-Preachers.</p>
               <p>The Major is the maine thing liable to doubt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall prove it. Either all Scripture-Preachers may
challenge maintenance, or onely such Preachers as are in
office-relation to those to whom they preach, and of
whom they challenge maintenance: But not onely such
Preachers may challenge maintenance as are in office-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them; Therefore all Scripture-Preachers may
challenge this maintenance.</p>
               <p>The Minor (for that onely is liable to exception) I
prove thus: The Apostles (say our Brethren) were
onely in office-relation to the Church, and other Teachers
are onely in office-relation to their particular Churches
(as they assert) But these might challenge maintenance
from others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:100839:64"/>
The disciples <hi>Luke</hi> 10. had no office-relation to them to
whom they preached; they were no officers in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Church, and the Christian Church was not then erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and yet for their very work they may require mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
<hi>v. 7. And in the same house remaine eating and
drinking such things as they give, for the labourer is worthy
of his hire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Paul,</hi> where ever he sowes spirituals (though it be
among heathens) he may require carnals, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. And
generally in Scripture, the maintenance is rather thrown
upon the work then upon the office. The double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. and the high estimation, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.
13. is for their works sake. And the oxe that treadeth
out the corn (though it may be he treadeth not out his
own Masters but another mans corn) ought not to be
muzled: I would desire our brethren to answer me this
question: Suppose a man will go into <hi>Wales</hi> to preach the
Gospel, Whether in that case, they do not believe the
people are obliged to give him carnalls for his spiritualls?
If they affirme it (as I believe they have too much inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
to deny it, and the foregoing places fully evince it)
then we have gained thus much, that the maintenance is
not due onely to such as are office-wise related to those to
whom they preach, but to all Scripture-Preachers, which
was the thing to be proved, and so we have secured the
Major.</p>
               <p>For the Minor, it is needless to spend time about it, for
our brethren grant it, and besides it speakes for it self:
For if all gifted men be bound to preach (as our brethren
assert) and if in Churches, many men are, and all ought
to covet to be so gifted (which also they assert) then
the maintenance of such would be both absurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
               <p>And thus much shal suffice for the vindication of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100839:65"/>
Assemblies Arguments, to prove that none ought
to Preach without Ordination: And so I have done with
the principall Question: Onely that the Reader may be
able more judiciously to compare things together I shall
present him with an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or enumeration of the
Arguments on both sides.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Arguments alledged by them to prove that unordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men may preach.</head>
                  <p>I am the more willing to propound all their Arguments
together, because I would not take them at advantage,
but set the best glosse upon their cause, for, it oft times
falls out, that, <hi>quae non prosunt singula, juncta juvant,</hi> those
Arguments which when they are pull'd asunder, have but
little strength in them, being united together, seem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable;
so that if their cause have any reall strength in
it, we shall see it here, when the arrowes are all put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one bundle, or else we may conclude, that there is
neither strength nor truth in it.</p>
                  <p>Their first Argument is this. Election must go before
Ordination (which they take for granted, though it never
was proved) But a person must Preach before Election
and therefore before Ordination, and so one not yet Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
may Preach: So that their Argument is this:
Because a man unordained may Preach in a case of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>i. e.</hi> when he is to be tried for Election or Ordination,
therefore he may Preach where there is no necessity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Gifted men unordained are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commanded to
Preach. And here because <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11.
commands every man to exercise his gift they inferre from
thence, that this gift must needs include preaching (though
it may as well relate to hospitality) and that this gift must
needs be exercised in a publick way, by such as have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
call thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:100839:65"/>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. They argue from examples, Because <hi>Apollos</hi>
(who was a man extraordinarily indowed, and an Officer
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.) spake publickly to divers <hi>Iews,</hi> though not
gathered together in a Church assembly; and because the
scattered Saints (who it is doubtful whether they were offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
or no) in a case of persecution and necessity spake
occasionally of the things of God to persons they met
with, therefore any gifted men may ordinarily, and without
a case of necessity preach publickly in a Church Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Because some persons, who are called by the
name of Officers, Prophets, and therefore may well be
concluded to be in Office, because such being inriched
with extraordinary gifts did Prophesie, therefore persons
who are unquestionably no Officers, and whose gifts are
but ordinary, may preach.</p>
                  <p>And this is <hi>bonâ fide</hi> the whole strength of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which, whether it be of sufficient force to transport a
man beyond the sentiment or judgement of the Church,
in all ages, of the generality of the reformed Churches of
the present ages, of the far greater part of learned and
godly divines among us: I desire our brethren, and all that
are concerned in it, in the fear of God to consider.</p>
                  <p>And now let us see whether we cannot give a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our assertion, and whether it doth not stand upon
a firmer basis.</p>

from God a call and designation thereunto. And
therefore persons farre inferiour in excellency and gifts

                  <p>6. To allow the Preaching of unordained men, opens a

                  <p>10. None may administer the Sacraments, because he

               <p>1. These words, <hi>they appointed two,</hi> do in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
relate to the Apostles, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 17, 21, 22. To this our
Brethren reply, <hi>The exhortation about chusing was given to
the 120 brethren and therefore they did chuse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It was not an exhortation to chuse, nor a directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in chusing (here is not a word of the knowledge, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
prudence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the person to be chosen, which useth
to be the subject of the Apostles discourse, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
to, or directs in chusing) but onely a declaration
that one must be chosen, which was very congruous and
convenient, whether the Apostles or people did appoint;
and however the Apostles might and did appoint, yet it
was fit the People should consent and be satisfied.</p>
               <p>I forbear other things as to this place, because they
will recur in the next place, whither I refer them; only
this I leave to the consideration of ingenuous men, that
it is at least doubtful who it was that are here said to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
two; the Grammatical construction and Logical
connexion possibly will bear either; I am sure it will beat
the Apostles, and therefore great stresse cannot be laid
upon this place.</p>
               <p>The next alledged Text is that, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. concerning
the choice of Deacons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which it was said,</hi> That the people were guided and
limited in their choice by the Apostles; so that if they had
swerved from the Apostles directions, the Apostles would not
have ordained them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this they Answer,</hi> That Lawes and Rules directing
in the choice, hinders not the entireness of the choice: A Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100839:67"/>
have entire power of chusing and yet are limited by
Lawes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is true, Regulation by dead Lawes and Rules
is no prejudice to the peoples sole power in election, but
a regulation by living Judges doth destroy it, to wit, the
regulation being such, as here it is, wherein the Apostles
(or their vicegerents the Ministers) have not only a bare
vote in the election, but a negative voice, whereby it is
in their power either to chuse or refuse: So it was here,
and therefore surely the Apostles had a share, yea, the
great share in the choice, and therefore the people had not
the whole and sole power in the choosing of Deacons,
which was to be proved: This case is not unlike our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
when the Fellowes have a power to chuse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet
under the direction and regulation of the Master, who
hath a power to chuse or refuse the person chosen by the
Fellowes: Can any sober man in this case say that the
sole power of choosing is in the Fellowes? Is it not in the
Master also? And so it was in the Apostles.</p>
               <p>3. Our Brethren forget the maine thing that was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at which by their own acknowledgement was this,
that, The essence of the call consists not in Election, and
that plainly appeares from this place: For if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
had refused any of those chosen by the people upon
just grounds, I desire our Brethren to Answer whether
they think they would have been Deacons notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether the Apostles would or not. If they say,
<hi>yea,</hi> that is so injurious to the Apostles, and their jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that they will have few followers; if they say <hi>no,</hi>
then the essence of the call to the office of the Deacon (and
so of the Minister by their own Argument) consists not
in Election, unlesse they will say, that a man can be a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
and yet want the essence of a Deacon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Excep.</hi> If this Election had been frustraneous it had not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100839:68"/>
been for want of Ordination but for the neglect of observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gospel-Rules in chusing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nay, on the contrary, it had been the want of
Ordination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For suppose the people had proceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Go<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pel-Rules, in the Election and choosing a
person visibly fit, and the Apostles by the spirit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,
seeing something in him which renders him unfit,
had denied Ordination; In this case, the Election had been
null, though according to Rule, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The want of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
makes it null, efficiently, or rather deficiently, though
the want of fit qualification makes it null meritoriously.</p>
               <p>And againe, let us suppose that both the people and the
Apostles had not exactly kept to the Rule in choosing (for
the Apostles might erre in matters of fact though not in
matters of doctrine) and the people had chosen, and the
Apostles ordained a man not fit for the office according
to rule, in that case, to say that this call had been null,
would be a venturous assertion: It is harsh to say, of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man chosen to the office of a Deacon who is not full of
the holy Ghost and wisdome, (for those are the required
qualifications) that his choice is null. I am confident
our brethren have too much modesty to affirme it, and if
they do not affirme it, then that which in this case had
made the election null, had not been the not observing of
Gospel-Rules, but the want of Ordination.</p>
               <p>2. It was said, that, <hi>though the people might have the
sole power of chusing Deacons, yet not of Ministers.</hi> A minore
ad majus non valet argumentum affirmativè.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this they Answer,</hi> That we use that kind of arguing,
when we argue thus; We use Ordination in the choice of
Deacons; <hi>Ergo,</hi> of Ministers much more, so Christ argues
from the lesse to the greater; God takes care of Lillies, Ravens,
<hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> he will much more take care of you. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Our Brethrens answer runs upon a grosse mistake,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100839:68"/>
for they inconsideratly confound two Canons which vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
differ (though both of them belong to the same To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick.)</p>
               <p>1. Their Argument is fetcht from this Canon: <hi>Cui
competit minus, competit majus:</hi> If a power of choosing
Deacons, which is the lesse, belongs to the people, then a
power of choosing Ministers, which is the greater, belongs
to them.</p>
               <p>To this the Assembly well answered: <hi>A minori ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus,
non valet affirmativè.</hi> It is very false to argue thus:
The power of choosing a Captaine belongs to the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the power of chusing a Generall belongs to
him: Or thus, The members of such a Company have
a power to chuse their own Officers (which is the lesse)
and therefore they have a power to chuse the City Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
which is the greater. It is a true Rule, <hi>A majori ad
minus, valet affirmativè. i. e. Cui competit majus, compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit
minus:</hi> But it is false to argue, <hi>A minori ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
affirmativè,</hi> or thus, <hi>Cui competit minus, competit
majus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But there is another Canon, much differing from
the former, and that is this; <hi>Quod competit minori, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit
etiam majori:</hi> If Ordination was required to the
meaner and lesse considerable Office, which is that of the
Deacons, much more is it required to that which is the
greater and weightier Office. And this was the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
used by the Assembly. And to this belongs the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 26. If the care of Gods Providence reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to lillies (which are the lesse) much more will it reach
to you, which are the greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third Text alledged for the peoples election, was</hi>
Act. 14. 23. When they had created them elders by suffrages,
(<hi>for so they say the word,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>is generally used</hi>)
in every City: And this they say, may have reference to the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100839:69"/>
disciples, as well as to Paul and Barnabas, for they were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> One would think nothing more can be said, or
desired by any sober man for the elucidation and vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Text, then the making out of these two things.</p>
               <p>1. That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is frequently used for a simple
chusing or appointing, though without suffrages.</p>
               <p>2. That it cannot be taken here for chusing by suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>From these two, it followes most evidently, and irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably,
that this place, (which is alledged as a pillar to
prove the peoples election, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) doth no wayes inforce
it, but rather overthrow it.</p>
               <p>For the first, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are not
alwayes used for a chusing by suffrages, but oft times, for a
simple chusing, or appointing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is most plaine, from
<hi>Acts</hi> 10. 41. and may be made good by a multitude of
instances, for which the Provinciall Assembly, referred
you to other Authors, and especially <hi>Selden de Synedriis,</hi>
it being needlesse to transcribe.</p>
               <p>3. How oft the use of words varies from the etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
no man can be ignorant, that is not wholly a stranger
to the Greek tongue.</p>
               <p>But our Brethren say, it is strange, that <hi>Luke</hi> should use
the word in such a sense as was different from the custome
of all that writ before him.</p>
               <p>I answer. 1. It is so used by others, as was now
said.</p>
               <p>2. It is no new thing, to find a word, used in Scripture
in a different sense, from that which it hath in other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
And if our Brethren acknowledge that <hi>Luke</hi> useth
the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 41. in a sense, never
used in any Author before him; Why may we not expect
the same favour for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:100839:69"/>
2. Although this (if nothing else could be said) were
sufficient to answer their Argument, which is taken from
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and it be incumbent upon them to
shew, that the word must needs be so understood in this
place, yet, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> we assert; That this word can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be taken in their sense: And in this case by their own
allowance, we may recede, from the native signification
of the word, because it is repugnant to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
               <p>And for proof of this, I shall but desire any candid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
diligently to read the whole context, especially in
the Greek tongue, And I perswade my self, he will judge
it but a few removes from an impossibility to understand
it in our Brethrens sense.</p>
               <p>1. They are said to ordaine to them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not to
themselves, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it should have been, if the people
had done it. And although it be true, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
taken for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet that is but seldome (and then also
it is, for the most part, aspirated, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and the common
use of the word, (by which our Brethren will have us
guided in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and therefore we expect
the like from them in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) I say, the common
use of the word is otherwise, and especially this is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
if you take notice of other circumstances, which
oblige us to this sense, as namely:</p>
               <p>2. The same persons are said to ordaine in severall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Churches: Therefore it must needs be meant
of them that had an authority over severall Churches.</p>
               <p>3. They ordained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who going away, commended
the people to the Lord, and surely that was the Apostles:
it is a lamentable shift to say, <hi>That the disciples are spoken
of in the foregoing verse, and therefore it may be understood
of them.</hi> True, they are spoken of and so are the Apostles
spoken of, and, seeing both are spoken of, we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100839:70"/>
to whom this must be referred, and for that, the
very first rudiments of Grammer will determine, that the
reference must be towords of the same case. Now then,
in the 22. verse, the disciples are spoken of in the <hi>Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
case, and as passive under the Apostles confirming,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by
no meanes agrees, as being active, and of the <hi>Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
case: But now if you understand it of the Apostles,
all things run handsomly. The same persons are brought
in as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>vers.</hi> 21. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>v.</hi> 23. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>v. 25. &amp;c.</hi> all of them of the
<hi>Nominative</hi> case, and the active signification: And whoever
take out the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from all the rest, wherewith
it is hedged in on both sides, as they offer manifest violence
to the Text, so they will be judged by indifferent persons,
meerly to take it up in favour of a praeconceived opinion.</p>
               <p>And therefore our Brethren, do well take up, and at last
come to this faint conclusion; <hi>Though this do referre to the
Apostles, yet the people may be comprehended in it:</hi> So that
whereas in the first canvasing of this Text, we had much
adoe to get in the Apostles; and this Text hath been often
alledged by our Brethren to shew, not that the people
may, but that the people must, ordaine and chuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Elders, now all that it amounts to, is a <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y be,</hi> they
may be included here. All the answer it deserves, and
that I shall give is this; The people may not be included
here: At lest <hi>non liquet,</hi> it appears not from the Text at
all, that they are comprehended here. However, let the
question lie here, between us and our Brethren, whether
this Text, and this Ordaining belong to the Apostles (who
are here expresly said to do it) or to the people (of whose
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not a word is spoken here) and I suppose
impartiall Arbitrators will quickly end the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:100839:70"/>
                  <hi>But, (say they, who ever did <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> yet)</hi> this
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> cannot be meant of Ordination, seeing it is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as distinct from Ordaining by prayer and fasting, when
they had chosen—and had prayed with fasting, and if Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
were intended, here were a Tautologie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> I would ask our Brethren this question, whether
in case the people were they who are here said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
to chuse Elders, whether they did not manage that work
with prayer and fasting, and whether this Text doth not
sufficiently speak for it self, that this prayer and fasting
was used in relation to the choice of Officers: If they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
then the Tautologie remaines on their part as well as
on ours.</p>
               <p>2. But indeed, we must take heed of calling it a Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologie,
when ever we find the same thing expressed in
divers phrases, which is a familiar practice in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>3. Albeit the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when put by it self, did
signify, to ordaine by fasting, and prayer, and laying on of
hands, yet common reason and frequent use will teach us,
that when fasting and prayer are expressed, then, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
should be understood onely of imposing of hands.</p>
               <p>4. Our Brethren forget the present work, we did not
alledge this place, or this word, to prove that Ordination
is to be done by fasting, prayer, and laying on of hands,
nor were we drawing any argument from this Text; But we
were upon the defensive part, and our work was onely this
to maintaine, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth not here signify a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by the suffrages of the people, which being proved,
our Brethrens attempt from this Text is frustrated, and
the place sufficiently vindicated.</p>
               <p>These three places being cleared, and redeemed from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretation,
there is but one thing remains to be done,
which is a little to inforce those absurdities objected by the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100839:71"/>
Provinciall Assembly against their opinion. I shall take
notice onely of the first, as being most materiall, which is
this:</p>
               <p>Every one that is to be made a Minister, must first be tried,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 10. whether he be apt to teach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> able to convince
gaine sayers. Now in many Congregations, the major part are
very unfit to judge of Ministeriall abilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this they answer:</hi> That true Churches are fit to judge
of Ministeriall abilities, Christs sheep know his voice, <hi>John
10.</hi> and the Church could judge of the qualifications of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
<hi>Act.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. I dare venture the question upon this point,
and although I shall not determine it concerning every
congre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation (whereof possibly some learned men may be
members by accident) yet, for the generality of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
(including such as are constituted according to
our brethrens principles) I say they are not able to judge
of a mans soundnesse in the faith, and his ability to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
gaine-sayers. I will onely suppose that (which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
is true) a Congregation to consist of such as are
unacquainted with the affaires of learning, and I will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a crafty heretick to come before them, I say, he may
most easily conceale his heresies, so that they shall never
discover it, nor be able to try his soundnesse in the
faith.</p>
               <p>I might instance in divers cases, suppose a <hi>Socinian</hi> is
to be tried by the people, they ask him whether he believe
Christ to be God, he will Answer <hi>yes,</hi> I believe him to be
the true God, to be one with the Father, to be equall with
God: How apt would a company of honest soules be to
be cheated with such pretenses and how readily would
they be his compurgators; whereas, if this man were to be
called by Ministers, they know that these are but words,
and that though he acknowledge Christ in word, yet in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100839:71"/>
deed he denies him, and allowes him to be God, onely as
the Magistrate is a God; so there are many other weighty
points, wherein it is impossible for the people to try a
mans soundnesse in the faith. How many grosse
errors are there about the providence of God, the Person
and Natures of Christ, the fall of man; which any
learned man may so hide under ambiguous expressions,
that it shall be impossible for an ordinary Congregation
to discover them, unlesse they plow with the heifer of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
or Scholars: So for a mans ability to defend the
truth, and convince gain-sayers, how unfit people
are to judge of that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no man can be ignorant, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
how sadly, and frequently, the judgements of
people of all sorts, and opinions, and waies, are misplaced,
applauding some highly for their sufficiency that way, who
are known to understanding men, to be miserably defective
therein, and vilifying others, who are unquestionably far
more sufficient. To convince gain-sayers, is a great part of
learning, and that unlearned men should be able to judge
of a mans learning, will then be believed, when it will be
credited, that a blind man can judge of colours, or, a deaf
man of sounds, or an ordinary ignorant man, of the great
affaires of State.</p>
               <p>2. For that in <hi>Iohn,</hi> I hope our Brethren will be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to alledge it to this purpose, when they shall consider
that it is a character given by Christ to all his sheep, <hi>My
sheep know my voice.</hi> It is true of wise men and weak
men, of men, women, and children, which are the sheep
of Christ: So that, unlesse they will say, that the silliest
woman in a Congregation, who is godly, is able to judge
of a Ministers ability to convince gain-sayers, (then which
nothing can be more highly absurd) they must confesse
this Text was impertinently alledged.</p>
               <p>3. For the peoples fitnesse to judge of the Deacons
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100839:72"/>
abilities it is a strange instance, that because people are able
to judge of a mans prudence, faithfullnesse, piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
therefore they are able to judge of his learning, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.
And you may as well argue thus, that such a
man is able to build an house well, therefore he can mold
a State.</p>
               <p>And thus much shall suffice, to speak of the first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
which, when a judicious, and candid Reader, hath
duely weighed, I may groundedly hope, that he will be
thus far convinced, that the necessity of Popular Election
is not so clear, as hath been conceived, nor indeed so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
as Ordination. And sure I am, if we had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
evidences for Ordination, then such as these, we should
have sufficiently heard of it from our Brethren.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <p>THE second Question is this: Whether the Essence
of the Call to the Ministry, lie in Election or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.
And here also I must take the same liberty I
have used, and that is not to transcribe every word nor to
take notice of such passages as are inconsiderable, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such as have most strength, and most appearance of
truth in them. In the doing of which, as I have the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, and my own conscience, so I doubt not I
shall have the attestation of any disinterested person, who
shall compare both together.</p>
               <p>But, before I come to handle the point, I must needs do
my Brethren that right, as to let the world know, how
far they are from that generation of men that despise and
deride Ordination; they say, <hi>we do highly esteem of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100839:72"/>
as an appointment of Iesus Christ,</hi> p. 275. Onely
here they differ, They give Election the praecedency to
Ordination, and they place the essence of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall
call in Election, not in Ordination. But good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
we should not condemn them unheard: I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do them the justice as to consider what they offer by
way of Argument, and that is onely this: Ordination
doth not give the essence; <hi>Ergo,</hi> election doth (for their
first Argument from <hi>Acts 14. vers.</hi> 23. hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed
before.) That the essence of the Call lies not
in Ordination, they indeavour to make good by three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their first Argument is this,</hi> That which doth not set a
man over a Church of Christ, or commit it to his charge, that
doth not give the essentials of the Ministeriall office: But
Ordination doth not set a man over a Church of Christ,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> because without Election a man cannot be over any
flock.</p>
               <p>I answer to the Minor, and the proofe. 1. That it is
but a begging of the question, and hath been before dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
that without Election a man cannot be over any
flock.</p>
               <p>2. Although a man could not be over a flock without
Election, and Election were necessary to his Call, yet the
Essence of the Call may lie in Ordination: Election may
be necessary, as the <hi>causa, sine qua non,</hi> and yet Ordination
may be the <hi>causa formalis</hi> of the Call to the Ministry.
Suppose by some ancient Charter, the People of such a
City, are invested with a right to chuse their own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
So that without their Election, he is not their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister;
Yet so, as that it belongs to some Gentleman, to
present the person so Elected, unlesse he can shew reason
to refuse him, in this case Election is necessary, and yet
the Essence of the eivil Call, lies in his Presentation. Or
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100839:73"/>
suppose <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> had been to

                  </gap>shop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> yet, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the n<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> of their Election, the Essence of the Arch
Bishops C<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> did lie in another thing, to wit, civilly in the
gift of the King, Ecclesiastically, in his consecration by the
Bishops: So, though the Election of the people were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
yet the Essen<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of the Call, may lie in the Ordination
of the Minister<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>3. Although Election determine a mans imployment
to this or that particular place, yet Ordination sets him
over a Church of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> over the whole Church:
His Ordination sets him over a Church indefinitely: his
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>tion sets him over this or that particular Church. As
the Act of the University, makes a man a Doctor of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
but the choice of such a City, or such a noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
makes him the Physitian of that City, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second Argument is this:</hi> Ordination is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentiall
unto a mans having the whole Essence of the Call
to the office, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3. Paul and Barnabas had the Essence
of their Call before from God, they were not of men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.
And this example is a binding rule to us.</p>
               <p>Answ. 1. I might say, as Divines say of Vocation,
That there is a Calling, <hi>ad foedus,</hi> to the Covenant, and
<hi>ad munus,</hi> to an Office. So likewise for Ordination, there
is a double Ordination, the one, <hi>ad munus,</hi> to an Office, the
other, <hi>adopus,</hi> to a Work. The Ordination which we
spake of, and wherein the Essence of the Ministeriall Call
doth consist, is an Ordination to an Office; and such an
Ordination the Apostle never had, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. And such an
Ordination, this Text, peradventure, speaks not of, but
of an Ordination to a Work, nor is there any ground to
wonder, that men should be solemnly Ordained to such
a work as this, a work so great, so uncouth, so difficult, so
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100839:73"/>
much exposed to contradiction, nor was it unusuall in the
Church either of the Old or New Testament, to use fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and prayer, or laying of hands, as well in the designati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a person to a work, as to an Office.</p>
               <p>2. This Argument will fall as heavy upon Election as
Ordination: It must be remembred that they assert that
the essence of the call lies in Election; and to prove this,
they urge the Election of an Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. Now
from hence, I thus argue against them: If this was the
prerogative of the Apostles, that they had their call nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of man nor by man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the essence of their call
doth not lie in Election: But this was the prerogative of
Apostles, that they were neither of men nor by men;
so that although Ordination and Election were both
used in reference to the Apostles, yet the essence of
the call did lie in neither of them: And it is certain
that in <hi>Acts</hi> 1. the essence of <hi>Matthias</hi> his call, did not lie
in the election of the people (for that <hi>Barsabas</hi> had, as
well as <hi>Matthias</hi>) but in the designation of God: And
therefore, as our Brethren would say for themselves, in
that case, that we are to distinguish between what is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and what is extraordinary, between what was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the Apostles, and what was common to other
Officers; and that this was common to the Apostles,
with other Officers to be admitted by Election, which
therefore is a president for us in the call of other Officers,
but that the essence of their call should not lie in Election,
but in Gods designation, this was peculiar to them, and
so is no rule to us; the same Liberty, I hope they will
allow us, to say, that in this Ordination here was,
1. Something ordinary and common to the Apostles,
with other Officers, which was to be ordained, which
therefore doth strongly justifie the use and necessity of
Ordination to other Officers. 2. Something extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100839:74"/>
and peculiar, to wit, that the essence of their call
did not lie in this Ordination, but in the immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of God, which therefore cannot be applied to
ordinary Officers.</p>
               <p>To say nothing of that which peradventure may be said,
that <hi>Paul</hi> had the essence of his Call from this Ordination,
and yet no prejudice to that other assertion that <hi>Paul</hi> had
his Office neither of nor by man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. for though men
were used as instruments in the dispensation of the rites
belonging to <hi>Pauls</hi> Ordination, yet to speak properly it was
not men but God, that was <hi>Pauls</hi> Ordainer, for the holy
Ghost said, <hi>separate me,</hi> &amp;c. It was not men that nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Paul</hi> to be an Officer, but God did it, from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their third Argument is taken from the nature of
Ordination,</hi> Ordination <hi>(say they)</hi> is nothing else but the
solemn separation of an Officer by prayer and fasting
<hi>(they after adde,</hi> and laying on of hands) to the work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he is called: It can be imagined to consist but of three
things. 1. Fasting, and that is no act of worship. 2. Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands, and that was not essentiall to Ordination then,
and it is questionable, whither it be still continuing or not.
3. Prayer, which therefore must be the act giving essence to
Ordination seeing the others do not.</p>
               <p>Now upon all this, they build a double argument.</p>
               <p>1. Ordination consisteth in an action performed to God only,
<hi>i. e.</hi> in prayer, therefore it cannot give the Essence of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
call to office, from men.</p>
               <p>2. That action which cannot be performed in faith, before
a man have his outward Call to office, cannot give him that
outward call: But Ordination is such an action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For how
can a man pray in faith, for his blessing upon a person in a
work of an office, before he can conclude, that he is so much as
outwardly called to that office.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:100839:74"/>
For Answer. 1. For the last clause, I also would
ask our Brethren one question; Suppose the Essence of
the Ministeriall Call did consist in Election, and that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are to be used for the person to be Elected, before his
Election (which I know our Brethren will not diflike) in
this case I ask them their own question How can they pray
in faith for a blessing upon that person in the work of his
Office, before he have the Call to the Office? Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they shall reply with reason, will serve for our use as
well as theirs.</p>
               <p>2. In such cases, our prayers have (as most frequently in
many other cases) a tacit condition, that God would
blesse him in the work, <hi>viz.</hi> if he shall be set apart for it.
I may pray in faith, that God would go with me in a
journey, that God would blesse me in the exercises of the
Lords day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Although I do not certainly know that I
shall live either to go one step in my journey, or to do one
exercise upon the Lords day.</p>
               <p>3. All their Argument proceeds upon a grosse mistake
and unacquaintednesse with our principles: In a word,
we hold that the Essence of Ordination, consists in none of
those three things mentioned, neither in fasting, nor pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
nor laying on of hands, (all which are only the modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the work) but in something else, to wit, in this, the
designation of fit persons by Officers unto the work, which
designation indeed, is signified by imposition of hands,
and deservedly introduced, with fasting and prayer, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a work of greatest weight, yet still the Essence of it
lies not in this.</p>
               <p>4. For imposition of hands, it is granted by most Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
that I know of, that it is not so Essentiall to
Ordination, as that they will pronounce that Ordination
null, which wanted it, although they conceive in being a
rite instituted by Christ, cannot without sinne, be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100839:75"/>
by men. Whether imposition of hands ought to
continue in the Church, is excentricall to our present que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and therefore I shall wave it, leaving onely this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum</hi>
for the Readers consideration.</p>
               <p>That the great Argument used for the abolition of it,
because it was used in those daies for the collation of the
extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost, hath to me, very
little cogency in it; both because by the same reason,
Preaching must be now laid aside, because when <hi>Peter</hi>
preached, the holy Ghost fell upon them that heard him,
<hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44. And because it continued all along in the
old Testament, notwithstanding this, that sometimes it
was used in those times for the collation of extraordinary
gifts, as <hi>Deut. 34. 9. And Ioshua was full of the spirit of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for Moses had laid his hands upon him.</hi> But I must recall
my self, and remember that it is not now my task to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with that point, but only to shew that our Brethrens
Arguments are not unanswerable.</p>
               <p>And now that we have seen the weaknesse of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
alledged to prove that the essence of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
call consisteth in Election, not in Ordination, I shall
consider whether we cannot find stronger Arguments to
prove the contrary, That the essence of the call doth not
lie in the Election of the people, but in the Ordination of
the Ministers.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="13" type="response_to_chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
               <p>I Shall confine my self to one Argument, which
I shall desire our Brethren to chew upon, which is
this.</p>
               <p>The essence of the call to the Ministry, must lie in the
act of those only, who by divine appointment are and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100839:75"/>
ought to be in a capacity to give it: But the people nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are, nor by divine appointment are necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be in capacity to give the essence of the call to the
Ministry: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The essence of the call doth not lie in
the act of the people, <hi>i. e.</hi> not in Election.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Major,</hi> it is a plain case: Wherever God puts
a man upon a work, he requires that he be fit for it. God
will have no man to undertake any work, of Magistracy,
Ministry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which he is not fit. The Teacher must
be apt to teach, &amp;c. And if it be one of the works of a
Minister to send forth other Ministers, then God requires
this of him, that he be in a capacity to do it. And so
doubtlesse, if Election be the priviledge of the members
of the Church, as such, and the Essence of the Ministeriall
Call lies in it, then by divine appointment this is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
qualification for every Church-member to be in a
capacity to give it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Minor</hi> which is this, That the people neither are,
nor by divine appointment are necessarily required to be
in a capacity to give the essence of the call to the Ministry:
This I shall prove from those things which are requisite
to put men into such a capacity. And thus I argue: Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and ability to judge of the fitnesse of a Minister,
are necessary to make a man capable of giving the essence
of the Ministers call: But people neither have, nor is it
necessarily required that they should have these: <hi>Ergo</hi>
they are not capable of giving the Essence of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Call: I shall prove both propositions.</p>
               <p>1. For the <hi>Major,</hi> there are two ingredients, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of
both I shall speak in order. 1. I say, to give the Essence
of the Ministeriall Call is an act of authority, I think this
is unquestionable in all other cases; wheresoever the power
of calling to any office lies, there is an authority in relation
thereunto: For instance, in a Corporation, If it belongs
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100839:76"/>
to the Court of Aldermen to give the Essence of such an
Office, it is an act of authority in them: So if it belong
to the Court of Common councel to do it, it is an act
of authority in them. <hi>Et sic in caeteris.</hi> It is true a man
may give an Office to another, which he himself hath not.
But if he have it not formally, he must have it virtually.
In democraticall governments, where the officers are
chosen by the body of the people, there, I say, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
resides, and upon that very ground, the people taken
collectively, are superiour in authority unto the Officers
to whom they give the Call. And as the Apostle saith,
The lesse is blessed of the greater, so may I say, the lesse is
called of the greater. And as it is in civil respects, in
some Parishes where the People are Patrons of the place,
and give the Essence of the civil call to a Minister, to be
the Minister of the place, as to all legall rights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there,
I say, the People are, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> invested with authority,
for that worke, and their collation of this place
upon that Minister, is an act of authority: So
in like manner, if it belong to the people to give
the essence of the Ecclesiasticall call unto a Minister, then
the people hereby are impowred with an authority, and
their act is an act of authority. And this is the first branch.
Authority is necessary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The use of this we shall see
when we come to the <hi>Minor;</hi> In the mean time we must
prove the other branch of the <hi>Major,</hi> or rather, that is
proved already, that ability to Judge of a Ministers fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is necessary to put a man into a regular capacity to
give the essence of the call to the Ministry. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I now come to the proof of the <hi>Minor,</hi> where I must
shew;</p>
               <p>1. That people have no authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That they neither have nor by divine appointment
are required to have ability to judge of a mans fitnesse for
the Ministry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:100839:76"/>
1. That people have no authority nor can do any act
of authority in the Church, is plain from hence, because
they are by Gods appointment placed in a state
of subjection, at lest it is a cleare case concerning
women, who are forbidden to do an act of authority (<hi>i. e.</hi>
to preach publickly) because they are in a state of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
And this is the more considerable, because in
that instance which our brethren so much insist upon,
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. in that election of an Apostle, not only the men, but
women also did concurre, which they could not have done,
if election were an act of authority, or if it were that act
which gives the essence to an Officer.</p>
               <p>2. As they want authority, so they want ability. And
here there are two branches.</p>
               <p>1. They have not 2. they are not required to have abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to judge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The people have not ability to judge of a mans fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for the Ministry; This we have proved before, and
thither I refer the reader; and indeed, if our brethrens
principles did not oblige them to the contrary, it would
be out of doubt that for the body of almost all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
in the world, they are exceeding unable to judge of
divers of those abilities which are required to the Ministry.</p>
               <p>It is little lesse then a contradiction to say, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
men should be fit judges of another mans learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(and that learning is of necessary use to a Minister,
neither will our brethren deny, nor can any one doubt,
but he that is wholly a stranger to it) and it is no lesse
absurd to think, that those persons who are unacquainted
with the stratagems and subtilties of gainsayers and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
should be competent judges of a mans ability to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
gainsayers.</p>
               <p>If it be said, it is true, the people are not able to judge
of these things themselves, but they should and may call
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100839:77"/>
in the help of neighbouring Pastors. I answer. They
may do it, and they may forbear it: According to our
Brethrens mind, this is not necessary to the being, but to
the well being of it: It is the people that have the whole
and sole power of giving the Essence of the Ministeriall
Call; So that if they will perversly or proudly refuse
the help of Pastors, (as some of our brethrens mind have
experienced the giddinesse and unrulinesse of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
even when they have had Ministers to guide them,
and much more when they have been left to themselves)
they may do it: Or what if a Congregation be in an
Island, or where there are no Pastors to help them? in that
case they want ability to judge.</p>
               <p>2. Who ever they are, that are intrusted with a power
to give the Essence of the Ministeriall Call, they are to see
with their own eyes. And surely they that blamed the
Bishops, because they delegated the Pastorall work to
others, which they ought to have performed personally,
cannot excuse the people (if they were indeed intrusted
herewith) that they manage it by others care and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Or else,</p>
               <p>3. This great inconvenience will follow, that Christ
hath intrusted this great power in such hands, as are unable
of themselves to manage it. And thus I have dispatched
the first branch, and shewed that the people are not able to
judge.</p>
               <p>The second branch is this? The people are not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
required to be able to judge of a Ministers abilities,
as they ought to be, if it did belong to them to give the
essence of the Ministeriall Call. I say, if it doth belong to
every Church-member, as such, as his priviledge, to have
a joint power to give the essence of the Ministeriall call,
then it belongs to every Church-member as his duty, and
he ought by divine appointment to be fit to judge of a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100839:77"/>
Ministers abilities, and this would be a necessary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in every Church-member, not onely that he be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but also judicious, and prudent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
able to judge of a mans fitnesse for the Ministry,
so that if a man were never so godly and desirous of
Church-membership, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if he were apparently unfit
to judge of a Ministers abilities (as many hundreds of
godly people, unquestionably are) he ought not to be
admitted a Church-member, because he wanted one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
qualification for that relation: Which because it
is a grosse and manifest absurdity, therefore it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
required that Church-members should be able to
judge of a Ministers fitnesse, and by consequence, it follows
that the people are not intrusted with giving the essence of
the Ministeriall Call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which was the thing
to be shewn; And thus much might serve for that
point.</p>
               <p>Onely, whereas there were divers Arguments urged by
the Assembly, to shew, that the Essence of the Call did
not lie in Election, which our Brethren here praetend to
answer: I am under some necessity of attending their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But because, some of them do manifestly refer to
such things as have been fully discussed before, I shall not
need to follow them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but onely take notice of
such things, as have hitherto been omitted, or are now
more strongly fortified.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>It was argued from</hi> Acts 6. Where the Apostles are
said, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> i. e. to constitute appoint, Acts 7. 10. Deut. 1.
13. Exod. 18. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They answer,</hi> If <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, be taken for the constituting
act in some places, so is the word chusing taken for the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
act, in other places. <hi>Luke 6. 13. And of them he</hi>
chose <hi>twelve, whom he named Apostles,</hi> and the people here
are said to chuse, and that expresseth the putting of a man into
office.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:100839:78"/>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is true when chusing, is put by it self, it may
signifie an appointing, if it be ascribed to one that hath a
power to appoint, as it is, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. But it is far otherwise,
where <hi>chusing and appointing</hi> are distinguished from, and
opposed to one another, and the act of chusing, ascribed
to the inferiours, the people, and the act of appointing,
asscribed to the superiours, the Apostles, in such a case
to say chusing is appointing, or to say, that the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
act, was that which was done by the inferiours, is
but one remove from impossible, that I say not ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
               <p>2. It was argued from <hi>Tit. 1. 5. I left thee in Creet to
ordaine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>what was he left there to give an adjunct of
their call?</hi> It must be considered, in what state the Church
then was, and how usefull the paines of <hi>Titus</hi> might have
been in other places, which necessarily called for his help;
so that we may rationally conclude, if the people could have
given the Essence of the Call without him, and if Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been but an unnecessary Adjunct, it is no way
credible that the Apostle would have diverted <hi>Titus</hi> from
so great, essentiall, and excellent a service, for the doing
of a businesse, which was but circumstantiall.</p>
               <p>The onely answer they give, that signifies any thing is
this: <hi>That Titus was left in Creet, not onely to ordaine El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but also to set in order the things that are wanting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that relieves them not, for the setting of things in
order (it which concerns onely the well being of the Church)
was not to be put in competition with those other glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
services, which <hi>Titus</hi> might have done in the mean
time, (and which concern the very Essence of the
Church.)</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>2. <hi>It was argued from the</hi> nature of Election of a
people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is not the making of a man a Minister, but their
Minister: The people <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. did look out men, but
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100839:78"/>
it was Moses that made them Rulers: If the people
have not office power, neither formally nor eminently,
they cannot make an Officer, for, <hi>nihil dat quod non
habet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They answer many things. 1. <hi>That Election makes a
man a Minister.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> That is a meer begging of the question.</p>
               <p>2. The act of Moses is not parallel either with Ordination
or Election, but rather with Christs act in making Church-Officers,
because onely Christ is the King of the Church; as
onely Moses was the supreme Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. To speak strictly, not <hi>Moses,</hi> but God was
the supreme Magistrate of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and that policy was
not a Monarchy, but a Theocrasy, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> well calls
it, and <hi>Moses</hi> indeed had no regall nor arbitrary power at
all, but was onely Gods Secretary, to write his mind, and
Gods instrument, to publish and execute Gods lawes:
And look what <hi>Moses</hi> was to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that are Ministers
unto the Church: <hi>Moses</hi> was the publick interpreter of
Gods Law, and Gods Vice-gerent, who in Gods
Name, and according to Gods Word was to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
the people, and they were to be ruled by him; and
albeit in some cases the people might have the power of
Election, yet indeed it was <hi>Moses</hi> his act which was the
constituting act in the creation of Officers: Just thus it is
in our case, Ministers are the publick interpreters of
Christs lawes, and Christs Vicegerents, who in Christs
name, and according to Christs word, are to governe the
people, and they are to be ruled by them; And albeit the
people have a power of Election, yet indeed it is the
act of the Ministers, which is the constituting act of an
Officer: So that here is no difference at all in the power
and authority of <hi>Moses</hi> and Ministers (in both it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
and limited) onely the one is Civil, the other
Ecclesiasticall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:100839:79"/>
3. That rule <hi>(they say)</hi> is not universally true, <hi>nihil
dat quod non habet,</hi> for freeholders by chusing, may make
Burgesses and Parliament men. The freemen of a Corporation
give the essentialls of their call to a Bailiffe, and why may it
not be thus with the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is <hi>dispar ratio,</hi> Because all things are to
be regulated by law and institution, Civill things by a
civill institution, and Ecclesiasticall things by a divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution:
Now what such freemen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do, they have
a charter, and a warrant for, whereby they are <hi>quantum ad
hoc</hi> authorized for the work. If our brethren can shew a
parallel divine institution, for the peoples being authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to give the Essentials of the call to a Minister, then
they do their businesse: But that they have not been able
to do: In these cases the people have such office-power
eminently in them, though not formally: And though
each of the people considered distributively, are inferiour
to such a Magistrate after he is chosen, yet, all the people
taken collectively, are (as to that act) superiour to him
who is to be chosen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Argument was this.</hi> That if the essence of the
call lie in Election, then it will follow, that a Minister is
onely a Minister to his particular charge, and that he cannot
act as a Minister in any other place, which is a strange and
false assertion.</p>
               <p>And this the Assembly prove by diverse considerations
and Arguments, to which our brethren answer. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all that is here said doth more properly belong to
that former question <hi>i. e.</hi> whether a Minister be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
onely to his own particular Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I thought it
more meet to bring it in there, and thither I refer the
reader for a reply to all that here they say, which hath any
sinews or substance in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againe the Provinc. urged this:</hi> That thence it will
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100839:79"/>
follow that there must be Churches before Ministers, which
cannot be, for every Church must consist of persons baptized,
and baptize them none can, but he that is a Minister. Christ
therefore chose Apostles before Churches, and the Apostles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
elders to gather Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this they answer,</hi> 1. A Church must needs be before an
officer, because he that is an officer is made an officer onely to a
Church, and therefore the Church is presupposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This is a meer begging of the question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we
have already at large confuted it, and shewen, that a Minister
is an officer, and acts as an officer even to such as are no
Church.</p>
               <p>2. The Apostles were extraordinary officers, and therefore
that instance proves not that ordinary officers must be before
Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Our brethren must take heed of denying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarinesse
of the Apostles to ordinary Ministers in the
administration of Church affaires. They themselves do
oft make use of it: And it cannot be denyed by any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
or ingenious man, that the Apostles, as in some
things they did act as extraordinary officers, and are no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
for us, (as in single, and absolute, jurisdiction,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) so in other things, their acts were ordinary, and
there examples binding as to us, as their preaching, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that this case is of the same nature, may
appeare from hence because the same reason which made
it necessary fo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Apostles to be before Churches, made it
also necessary for other Ministers to be before them: For
the reason why the Apostles were to be before Churches,
was this, because, by them Churches were to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus it was with the ordinary
Ministers of those times, they also were instituted then,
and are so now (by that lasting institution <hi>Eph</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) not onely for the building up of Churches already
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100839:80"/>
constituted, but also for the bringing in of those who are
not yet gathered, and therefore it was and is necessary still
that Ministers be before Churches.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They say,</hi> Acts 14. 23. When they had chosen them el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in every Church, the Churches therefore were before the
chusing of elders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. That instance doth not at all enervate our
assertion, for although some Churches may be before some
elders, (which we never denyed) yet in the generall, a
Minister must needs be before a Church. And thus much
shall suffice for the vindication of those arguments which
the Assembly used to shew that the essence of the call
doth not lie in election. It now remaines that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the defence of those arguments which they used to
shew that the essence of the Ministeriall call doth consist in
ordination: Wherein I must still crave the continuance
of the liberty I have used, <hi>i. e.</hi> not put my self or the reader
to unnecessary trouble in animadverting upon every
passage, but onely to observe such things as are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative

<hi>They answer,</hi> 1. It is questionable whether laying on

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But forasmuch as this laying on of hands was
done by an ordinary Presbytery, which had not such a
power of conferring gifts by the laying on of hands (that
being the peculiar priviledge of extraordinary officers)
therefore it cannot here be rationally supposed to be so
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100839:80"/>
used in this place, but onely for ordination: And therefore
this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here said to be conveyed, must needs be rather
concluded to be an office (which we often read to have
been conferred by ordinary officers) then a gift (which
we never read that an ordinary officer was intrusted to
convey) But that our brethren will not beare with: For,</p>
               <p>2. They say this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not an office, and here they
repeat Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> reasons, so that in answering one I shall
answer both, and I must needs acknowledge that what is
spoken upon this place is said very plausibly.</p>
               <p>1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> most commonly signifies gift, not office.</p>
               <p>2. A man is not said to forget the office that is in him (he

to stirre up his grace, not his office.</p>
               <p>3. An extraordinary office (such as this was) could not be
collated by ordinary officers.</p>
               <p>Lastly, they observe that this gift is said to be given, not

                  </gap> by the laying on of their hands as the cause, but onely <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
with, noting onely the concurrence and connexion.</p>
               <p>To all which I reply, 1. That both <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
are used in scripture for office as well as gift, our brethren
themselves will grant, so that the word being indifferent,
we must see which way other considerations will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it.</p>
               <p>For the second (where most difficulty lies) I reply.</p>
               <p>1. A man may properly be said to neglect his office, or
to disregard <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be carelesse in his office, or in the
execution of his office: I know no absurdity in it, either
in the English, or in the Greeke Tongue: If a Magistrate
be slothfull, carelesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may properly say he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
that Office that God hath put him in, he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
his place. And as a man is said to neglect himselfe,
when he neglects those things, and those actions which
concerne himself; so a man neglects his office, that neglects
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100839:81"/>
the works of his office: So for the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, strip
it of the metaphor, and it is no more but this, put forth,
actuate, exercise thine office. <hi>Pauls</hi> bidding him stirre up
his Ministry, is no more then what elsewhere he bids him,
<hi>fulfill thy Ministry,</hi> do the work of an Evangelist. He
that neglects the work of his Ministry, invalidates his
office, disuseth, neglects his office, and he that fulfils the
works of his Ministry, stirres up his office: For that

is hardly worth taking notice of, because the preposition

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is used so variously, sometimes for one preposition,
sometimes for another, sometimes for that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in him, sometime for that which is adjoyning to
him (as all know that are not wholly strangers to the

it: Sometimes it is taken for <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
is for a man to be <hi>apud se,</hi> for a man not to be besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
so here the Office, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for <gap reason="foreign">

which is committed to thee: And as men are said to be
in sin, though indeed it is sin that is in them; and they
are said to enter into their masters joy, though to speak

said to be in drinke, though drinke be in him: So it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
seeme strange if an office be said to be in a man,
though in propriety of speech he be in his office.</p>
               <p>For the third branch: 1. An extraordinary office might
be conveyed in this case by ordinary officers: For 1. It is
commonly thought that <hi>Paul</hi> did concurre in this ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with that Presbytery.</p>
               <p>2. They ordained him by divine direction: And as it
was no dishonour to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> that they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to that work <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1, 2. by persons inferiour to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100839:81"/>
them, seeing those persons did it by the immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of the Holy Ghost, so neither is it any prejudice
to the extraordinarinesse of <hi>Timothies</hi> office, that it was
conferred by ordinary officers, seeing they conferred it by
the conduct of propheticall designation.</p>
               <p>3. What more ordinary both in state and Church, then
for a person to have an office conveyed to him, <hi>viz.</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially,
by such as are inferiour to him, as the King by
some of his subjects, the Arch-Bishop, by Bishops, the
officers of a Church in our brethrens way by the people,
whom I hope they will allow to be inferiour to their
officers, at lest they professe that they do so.</p>
               <p>For the last clause, I say two things.</p>
               <p>1. That <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is used for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in other places besides
this; <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 7. God brought <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>with, i. e.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>by an high hand,</hi> as it is
elsewhere phrased: So <hi>Acts 19. 27. They told what things
God had done</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>with them,</hi> i. e. <hi>by them;</hi> especially
seeing the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here, is expounded by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the other
place, which our Brethren suppose to be parallel, that puts
it out of doubt: And the reason wherefore the Apostle
rather useth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was onely for better
sound sake, (which the Apostles were not neglective of)
it had been unhandsome to have said, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and therefore he elegantly varies the word, and
puts in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in stead of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: But if you will needs have
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be taken in another sense then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi>
for <hi>with,</hi> and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be understood of a <hi>gift,</hi>
then why may we not acquiesce in this sense, (which will
both fully take off all your objections, and yet no way prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
our cause) <hi>neglect not the gift,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with the laying on
of hands: i. e.</hi> neglect not the gift, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor the laying on
of hands used in ordination, whereby thou wast solemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set apart for, and obliged to the discharge of thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100839:82"/>
gifts, and office; Do not slight, forget, disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that injunction <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this sense I am sure
the Greeke will beare very well, and the English doth not
exclude it.</p>
               <p>Againe, if this satisfie not, it may be further added,
that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be understood of the gift in
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. (forasmuch as the power of conferring such
gifts was the priviledge of Apostles and extraordinary
Officers) and the same word 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of the office, the conveyance of which did fall
within the verge of the ordinary Presbyters: And if you
take it thus, then you may groundedly suppose, that the
laying on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, was not done at the same time,
nor to the same end, with the laying on of the hands of the
Presbytery, but that this latter did convey the office at
one time (which is said most properly to be neglected
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.) and the former did convey a gift at another
time, which he is called upon to stirre up, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6.
And this fully takes off all the difficulty. Nor can any
wonder at the different sense of the same word, and
same phrase, for that is so common a thing, not onely
in divers Epistles, but in the same Epistle, yea the
same Chapter, yea the same Verse sometimes, that one
and the same word or phrase is differently to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that none can justly stumble at it here. But lastly,
it must be remembred that (if this place were to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in their sense, and did not contribute any thing
to our cause) the truth we assert doth not so depend upon
this place, that it must needs fall, if this place do not
uphold it, forasmuch as it is founded upon divers other
important places, as hath bin shewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Assembly argued further:</hi> The persons ordaining,
were Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, and Presbyters, whom
it is not likely that Christ would appoint to convey onely the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100839:82"/>
adjunct of the Ministeriall call, and leave the great work of
conveying the Office-power to the people.</p>
               <p>To this they say two things. 1. In stead of giving an
answer, they offer an argument; <hi>that because one relate
gives being to another, therefore the people must needs give
being to the Minister.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This is a meer fallacy: <hi>Relata,</hi> are considerable
two wayes, as I may say, <hi>in esse constituendo, &amp; in esse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,</hi>
either as they are to be constituted, or as they are
compleatly constituted: It is true, <hi>Relata</hi> considered <hi>in
esse constitute,</hi> do give being one to another, the Father
is not a Father unlesse he have a son. But then consider,
relations <hi>in esse constituendo,</hi> as they are to be constituted,
and so somewhat else gives being to them, when they are
<hi>relata,</hi> the one gives being to the other, but there must be
some other person or thing, which puts them into that
relation, and it is that which we speak off: For instance,
The husband gives being to the wife, and the wife to the
husband: But there is something else which legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
them in that relation, to wit the Act of the Justice,
or the Minister: A Vice Chancellour is the Correlate
of the University, yet the Chancellours act doth consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
him in the relation, and gives him the essence of his
call.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> Though Ordination be but an adjunct, yet,
it consisting chiefly, if not onely, in prayer, Christ might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the Elders in adding such an adjunct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But what sober man can imagine, that if this
were all, The Apostles should take so many journeyes
about Ordination; and should leave <hi>Titus,</hi> (who could
ill be spared) in <hi>Crete</hi> to ordain elders: What, would he
leave him onely to pray for a blessing upon persons to be
constituted by others? It is strange he should leave him
to a worke no way peculiar to his office, and a worke
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100839:83"/>
which a brother might performe as effectually as an
officer?</p>
               <p>And this shall suffice for the second Question.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="15" type="response_to_chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
               <p>THE third and last question is this, Whether ordination
may be done by the people? Wherein I shall need to
say little, because indeed they say little to the purpose,
and what they do say, is for the most part, either nothing
else but a repetition of their disproved principles, or so
infirme, that I may safely leave things to any ingenuous
reader, who shall compare our arguments and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse I will not wholly omit this task also,
but, where I can pick up any thing that requires an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and hath not been already dispatched, I shall here
take notice of it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They offer divers arguments to prove this proposition:</hi>
That in a Church which wants officers, some beleevers may
lawfully ordaine without officers.</p>
               <p>1. Else ordination were unattainable, for there is neither
precept nor president of an ordinary officers acting in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
out of the particular Church he is over. In the places
which speak of ordination, to wit <hi>Acts</hi> 6. and 13. 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
5. 22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. the persons ordaining were all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
and so no president for ordinary officers: And for
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. we see nothing to convince us that it was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Presbytery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> 1. There are divers practises lawfully used
(even in our brethrens judgment) which yet we find no
president for, but such as extraordinary persons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in: I will instance but in one, and that is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100839:83"/>
which we never read practised but by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and concurrence of an extraordinary Officer. <hi>Paul</hi>
practiseth it; <hi>I have delivered him to Satan.</hi> And the
Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> practiseth it, but not without <hi>Pauls</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
command, and positive warrant and concurrence,
1 <hi>Cor. 5. 3, 4. For I verily as absent in body, but present in
spirit having judged already,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>when ye are gathered
together, and my spirit:</hi> And yet our Brethren allow, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
this as a president for the practise of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by ordinary Churches, and ordinary persons: And
therefore good reason they should allow us the same liberty.</p>
               <p>2. And the rather, because this makes against our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
as well as us; It is their own grant, that Ordination
is an Institution of Christ now in force, and that it is to
be managed by the Officers of the Church, where there
are such: So that both they and we are thus farre agreed,
that ordinary Officers may ordaine. Now if what they
say be true, then there is neither precept nor president
for the Ordaining of Officers, and so it followes from
hence, not onely that none but Officers may ordaine
(which we assert) but also that Officers may not ordaine
at all (unlesse they will say Officers may do that for which
they have neither precept nor president) so that our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
argument, either doth not praejudice us, or else
it enervates their own principles.</p>
               <p>3. The true way therefore to discern what acts of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Officers are presidentiall to ordinary, and what
not, is this: Those actions which were proper to those times,
those actions which were the results of extraordinary
gifts, those actions which were appendants to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
jurisdiction; those are no presidents for us. The
Apostles healing the sick by anouncing with oyl, their
preaching without study, their ordering of the Church
affaires by their single jurisdiction, these things are unimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100839:84"/>
by us. But now on the otherside; Those actions
of extraordinary Officers which are common to all the
ages of the Church, those, which may be transacted by
ordinary gifts, and ordinary jurisdiction, those are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
for us: The Apostles publick praying, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
administring the Sacraments, authoritative rebuking,
ruling, censuring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say, their acting of those things,
is and was ever by the Church taken to be a president for
ordinary Officers acting the same things. Now foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as Ordination is allowed by our Brethren, to be one
of those New Testament practises yet to be continued, by
virtue of these instances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It followes that the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Apostles therein (though they were extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Officers) is a president for us, onely here is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
(wherein I am willing any indifferent man should
be umpire) whether it is a president for the peoples or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining,
(who, though in things belonging to them, they
did act distinctly from, and concurrently with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
as in the businesse of Election, yet never do we find
them ordaining or joyning with the Apostles in the work
of Ordination) or whether it be not rather a president for
Ministers Ordaining, who are the undoubted successors of
the Apostels, and who did act with them in such
works.</p>
               <p>4. And Lastly, for that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. how faintly and
impertinently do they speak? What if you meet with
nothing that convinceth you, that this was an ordinary
Presbytery? sure I am you meet with nothing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
you they were extraordinary: And it is a great deal
more rationall for us to think they were ordinary persons
(of whom we read nothing which was extraordinary)
then to fancy them to be extraordinary, (of which we
have no evidence at all) the proof lies upon their side.
I need no positive proof to perswade me to take a man
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100839:84"/>
for an ordinary person, he is justly presumed so to be,
till some <hi>indicia,</hi> or discoveries of an extraordinary state
break forth: But now, if one will assert, that another
is an extraordinary person, he must have positive proof
for it, which if our brethren can bring, to prove this Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
to be extraordinary, we shall submit to them, but,
till then, they must not take it ill, if we believe them to
be ordinary. Thus much for their first and principall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They argue thus;</hi> Those that may act in making De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
in a Synod, they may Ordaine; But Believers (who are
not Officers) may act in a Synod, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 15. 2,
22, 23.</p>
               <p>I answer to both Propositions.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Major</hi> may be questioned, because all those
things are to be regulated by Scripture, now if we have
Scripture precept or example for the one, <hi>i. e.</hi> for acting
in a Synod (which they say here is) and not for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which we have proved there is not, then believers
may do the one and not the other.</p>
               <p>2. For the <hi>Minor,</hi> I deny, that the brethren may
act in making Decrees in a Synod, I deny they did so in
this place, we read not a word of it: All that we read is,
that the whole Church consented to the decrees, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
upon the execution of them, which they might do,
though they neither acted nor were present at the making
of the Decrees: Even as thousands consent to Acts of
Parliament, that have no hand in the making of them. And
if our brethren think to prove this, they must bring better
Arguments then any they have yet brought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Argument they urge is this;</hi> That Ordination
consisteth in such Acts is may be done by the people; The
people may fast and pray, and (<hi>which may seem to be most
doubtful</hi>) they may impose hands if that be a rite still to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100839:85"/>
as appeares from <hi>Numb.</hi> 8 10. where the children of
Israel laid their hands upon the Levities.</p>
               <p>To this Instance, the Assembly gives such satisfying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
that I wonder how our Brethren could resist the
evidence of them; and indeed their Replies are so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
that I count it but lost time to make a rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and all that I shall desire of the Reader is this; That
he would but use his reason, and lay aside his passion and
prejudice, and compare what is said on both hands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I doubt not he will see, that all their assaults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, are but like the dashings of the waves against
a rock, whereby they break themselves to pieces.</p>
               <p>But if all that satisfie not, I shall adde two Answers
more.</p>
               <p>1. Extraordinary instances are no presidents for ordinary
cases. This was apparently an extraordinary case. The
<hi>Levites</hi> and Church-Officers were not yet instituted:
and to argue thus, that, because the people did lay on
hands before those Church-Officers were created (who
were afterwards to do it) therefore they might do it when
such Officers were created and appointed for that work;
It were as if a man should argue, Gifted men may preach
where there are no Apostles nor Ministers to be had, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they may do it where there is plenty of Ministers: Or
thus, <hi>David</hi> might eat the shew-bread when he could get
no other, therefore any man may eat it when his table was
spread with other bread.</p>
               <p>2. Forasmuch as it is ridiculous to think that all <hi>Israel</hi>
did lay their hands upon the heads of the Levites, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this was onely some of them, and those some (no
doubt) were the first-born. Now it must be remembred,
that as the <hi>Levites</hi> were taken instead of the first-born,
<hi>Num.</hi> 8. 16, 17. so the first-born till then were in stead of the
<hi>Levites,</hi> and till God instituted the Ecclesiasticall Offices
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100839:85"/>
and Officers in <hi>Israel,</hi> the first-born were Officers; and so it
concerns not the people at all, nor proves any right in them
to do the same thing.</p>
               <p>In the next place they come to answer some Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are urged by the Assembly, to prove that
Ordination did not belong to the people.</p>
               <p>Their Answers to the two first, are nothing else but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions
of what hath been already discussed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I here wave them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the third, the Assembly observed;</hi> That all that is
written in the Epistles concerning the Ordainers and the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the party ordained, is mentioned in the Epistles to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> who were Church-Officers; not in those
Epistles which are written to the Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They answer.</hi> 1. Charges may be directed to Officers,
and yet the people required to concurre, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3.
If <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were to act these alone as Evangelists,
then they are no presidents for us, if, with others, why not
with the people as well as the Officers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> They were to act alone in Ordination as Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
and yet are a president for us. For, here are two
things to be considered.</p>
               <p>1. The work, <hi>viz.</hi> of Ordination, which was common
and ordinary, and this is imitable.</p>
               <p>2. The manner of doing it which was extraordinary; <hi>i. e.</hi>
by their single power, and this is inimitable.</p>
               <p>You will say, If the manner of this Ordination was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
then <hi>Timothy's</hi> practice in Ordination is no
more a president for ordinary Officers Ordaining, then for
the people Ordaining.</p>
               <p>I answer, Yes; There is a different reason, because <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
was one of the Officers or Persons ruling; and an
extraordinary one, who alone might stand in the room of
all other Officers; it may be there were no Officers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100839:86"/>
when <hi>Timothy</hi> did ordaine; however his acting in
this as an Officer, though extraordinary, may well be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
for his successors, such as are Officers for the doing
of the work (which is ordinary) though not for the doing
of it by his single jurisdiction, which was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
               <p>But now on the other side, for the people or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
rulled, <hi>Timothy</hi> was not one of them, but sustained a
distinct person from them, and there were people at that
time unquestionably present, when ever <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
Ordained; and the people even in the dayes of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Officers, did retain their distinct liberties, and
exercise those things, which did belong to them as people,
as is plain in the case of Election, which they injoyned
and practised.</p>
               <p>And had Ordination belonged to the people as well as
Election, certainly (notwithstanding the agency and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Apostles therein, yet) we should have heard
somewhat, at least, concerning the peoples concurrence;
which because we hear not a syllable of, we therefore just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude, that Election did, and doth, belong to the
people, but Ordination doth not.</p>
               <p>I adde onely this; That look what reasons our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
have to look on the Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Baptizing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to be a president for Ministers Baptizing, and not for the
peoples baptizing; the very same reasons have we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that their Ordaining is a president for Officers Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining,
not for the Ordination of the people.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> All may be written to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
because they were to direct others how to act in them.
And therefore the Apostle writes to them about other things
(which yet were not to be acted by them alone, but by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
as the making of prayers for Kings, clothing of women in
modest aparrel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:100839:86"/>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> By this Rule, all things should have been written
onely in the Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> for they were
to direct the people in all other things. But it is not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the putting of a thing in this Epistle, which makes
that act peculiar to Officers; But this is it which is justly
insisted on, and which our Brethren should do well againe
to consider, that, <hi>Paul,</hi> who was so carefull to order the
affaires in every Church; yet in all his Epistles to those
Churches, speakes not a word about the businesse of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.
Surely the Scriptures silence is argumentative
as well as its speech, and it is oft urged in Scripture: <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedek</hi>
is said to be without Father, <hi>&amp;c</hi> because the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is silent as to his geniallogie, so <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.—<hi>our Lord
sprang of Iuda of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning
the Preisthood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And surely, it is not to no purpose that the Scripture is
so silent, as to the point of direction about the mission
of Ministers, in all those Epistles to people, but insinuates
thus much to impartiall Readers, that the Holy Ghost
looked upon the people, as persons not intrusted with that
work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The last thing urged by the Assembly was this;</hi> That
Ordination is an authoritative mission, an act of jurisdiction,
an act which gives the essentialls of the Call. Private persons
can no more conveigh power to another to administer Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then they can do it themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They answer.</hi> That Ordination is no act of jurisdiction,
nor would it be so though it did convey the Office-power: Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
do convey Office-power to their Bailiffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet do no act
of jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. This hath been answered before, to wit, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have that power by a Constitution, but there is not
any Constitution for the peoples conveying the Office-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to Ministers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:100839:87"/>
2. If the word <hi>jurisdiction</hi> be taken strictly, there is a
difference made between Ordination and Jurisdiction, but
if by an act of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> they mean nothing else but an
<hi>act of Authority</hi> (for that is the thing in question) then we
have before proved that it is an act of Authority, and it
were easie to make it good by Arguments.</p>
               <p>We never find Ordination practised either in the Old or
New Testament, but by persons in authority towards
their inferiours. <hi>Moses</hi> Ordained <hi>Aaron; Aaron</hi> his sons,
Christ his Apostles, the Apostles other Ministers: And if
in all these it be granted to be an act of Authority, surely
to deny it to be so in other Ministers, carrying on the same
work, is an assertion neither true nor probable.</p>
               <p>Again, Ordination is that act which constitutes a man
in Office, and therefore must be an act of authority: But
I must remember my work is not now to prove, but to
answer, and therefore I forbear, and shall give my self
and the Reader a writ of ease.</p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div type="summary">
            <head>Only that the Reader may see the fruit of our Brethrens
opinion (as indeed posito uno absurdo, sequuntur mille) I
shall present him with a list of some novel and strange
assertions which they have been hurried into by the force
of their principles.</head>
            <p>Novel and strange passages.</p>
            <p>1. They implicitly deny Jesus Christ to have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Iews</hi> as a teacher by Office, for thus they say,
<hi>p.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>A man is not a teacher by Office to all that he may preach
to: If he preach to Heathens—such as will not receive
iustruction, yet they are said to be taught, though they stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the Word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 54. He (i. e. <hi>Jesus</hi>) taught
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100839:87"/>
them, and yet <hi>v.</hi> 57. they were offended at him. But a man
is not a teacher by Office unto such heathens.</p>
            <p>And the Apostles, according to them, were no Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
to Heathens; for they thus argue, <hi>pag. 18. That
such are no Officers to people as cannot exercise Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
over them:</hi> But (say I) the Apostles cannot
exercise Church-government over heathens. <hi>What have
I to do to judge them that are without.</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12.
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. One that is really gifted for preaching (for ought we
know) may lawfully preach without approbation from a Church,
or others, <hi>p. o.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is the work of God and Christ onely, to send Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
let it be proved wherever a Presbytery was impowred to
send. <hi>pag. 126. And the Church is in no better case with
them; for they say,</hi> The person sending is Christ, neither
a Church nor a presbytery, <hi>pag. 125. And afterwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sending is nothing else but Christ commanding to go and
preach, not by a Presbytery, but by the word. And how a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
can send, but by exhorting to follow the command of
Christ, we know not. And in such a doctrinall way</hi> (for
ought we see) <hi>a private Christian may exhort to go and
teach,</hi> pag. 130. So that now both Presbytery and Church
are thrust out of Office, and every one that is apt to teach,
is commanded to preach, though neither Presbytery nor
Church send him; And every private Christian hath as
great a power to send Ministers, as either Church or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
which who can read without wonder?</p>
            <p>4. If the Major part of a Congregation be wicked, we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
then it is no true Church; and if once it were a true
Church, yet now it ceaseth to be so, or is unchurched. <hi>pag.</hi> 237.</p>
            <p>5. They talk of Pastors administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
not as Pastors; for thus they say, <hi>If Pastors preach
and give the Sacraments to their own flock, they act as Pastors,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100839:88"/>
but if they perform these acts to any, not of their own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
they do it not as Pastors,</hi> pag. 280. Then they do it
as gifted-men, for that is the other branch of the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
He that preacheth to strangers not as a Pastor,
preacheth as a gifted-brother (that they grant). And
therefore he that administreth the Sacraments to any not
as a Pastor, doth it as a gifted-brother.</p>
            <p>6. We see no inconvenience in asserting that heathens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to Christianity may be a Church, before they be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<hi>pag.</hi> 288.</p>
            <p>7. A minister as oft as hee changeth his place and people,
needeth a new ordination, <hi>pag.</hi> 290.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>They say,</hi> It is our mistake, when we assert that Baptisme
doth admit, or make a man stand in relation to a Church,
whereas baptizing is not into a Church, but into the name of
Christ, <hi>pag.</hi> 292.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>They say,</hi> If a people turn hereticall, or starve a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
or combine to vote him out; the sin of the people doth
nullify the office of the Minister, <hi>pag.</hi> 296.</p>
            <p>And, that I may tread in our brethrens steps who were
so ready to catch at the appearance of a contradiction in
the Provinciall Assembly, I shall put them in mind of two
or three <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or seeming repugnancies at least, if not
grosse contradictions.</p>
            <p>Self contradicting passages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They say, pag.</hi> 20. that one that is really gifted for
preaching may (for ought we know) lawfully preach without
approbation from a Church or others, <hi>pag.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>And they urge 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11. to prove it the duty of
gifted persons to preach, and surely if it be a duty, then it
obligeth whensoever a man may do it lawfully.</p>
            <p>And yet, pag. 149. they say, <hi>We grant, that to a mans
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100839:88"/>
exercise of his gifts in this or that place, there is praerequired
a call from the people, or Magistrate:</hi> And how can any
man preach but he must preach in this or that place?
<hi>Quod nusquam <unclear>fit</unclear> non <unclear>fit</unclear>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> When an ordained Minister removes from
one charge to another, They chuse him not as one that is to be
made a Minister, but as one already made and now to be made
their Minister, <hi>pag. 300. And yet, pag. 302. They say,</hi>
when he removes, he is to have a new Ordination, and a
new Election. The Gospel knoweth no difference between ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a man a Minister, and making him their Minister.
<hi>pag.</hi> 302.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>They say,</hi> Men to be sent to the heathens to convert
them, should be Ordained, because the conversion of soules is
a proper work of the Ministry; <hi>pag. 300. And yet,</hi> pag.
302. <hi>they say;</hi> When men are sent to heathens, if they be
Officers, yet they preach not as Officers: The conversion of
souls is the work of the Ministry, not the proper work.</p>
