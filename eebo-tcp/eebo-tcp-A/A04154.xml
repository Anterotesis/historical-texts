            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

a deserving Church-man indeed.</p>
            <p>I will not at all preface in generall termes, which
like lightning breaketh in the ayre, but seazeth on
no particular subject; it is better to cull out some
text of holy Scripture to be the burthen of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and I know none fitter then to polish those
twelve precious stones in the High Priests Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
as they are twise set downe by <hi>Moses</hi> in these

               <p>And they filled the breast-plate with foure rowes of
stones. The order was thus: A Sardius, a Topaze,
and a Carbuncle, in the first row. And in the second
row, an Emeraud, a Saphire, and a Diamond. And in
the third row, a Ligure, an Achate, and an Amethyst.
And in the fourth row, a Tarshish, an Onyx, and a
Iasper. And they shall be set in ouches of Gold.</p>

            <p>Which place is notoriously concentrique,
with that <hi>Apocalyp. Chap. 21. vers. 19, 20. The

some termes of difference; those are fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
these superstructives; those to adorne a City,
the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> these the watchmen of that city;
those signified the 12. Apostles, these the twelve
Tribes; those have neither all of them the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

those names, the <hi>Calcedony</hi> which is the third, the
<hi>Chrysolite</hi> the seventh, the <hi>Chrysoprase</hi> the tenth,
the <hi>Hyacinth,</hi> the eleventh; though (as S. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
and our English Rabbin) they be the same stones,
yet are they otherwise called.</p>

the leaves of metaphors are often the sweetest

first in the esteeme of God, of whose mysteries wee
are disposers; let men thinke of us as meanely as
they will, we are a chosen generation, and a royall
Priesthood to him, <hi>amat gente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nostra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> he loves the
Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> as they in the Centurions behalfe,

<hi>Ambrose.</hi> Thirdly, in regard of those rich endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and vertuous habits of grace, which by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working
with God we should labour by frequent
and iterated acts, to introduce both into our owne

               <hi>It is certaine</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the excellency of gifts
wherewith teachers excell above other men, are noted
unto us in this place by those things which are most
precious of all other upon the earth: and withall wee
are hereby taught, both what precious accompt God
makes of such teachers, as also how greatly they ought
to be esteemed amongst men; and it is no lesse certaine
that every one of these excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertues did shine forth
most cleerly long agoe in the old Apostles.</hi> So he.</p>
            <p>I need not trespasse against mine owne ease to
labour for either words or method; not for
words, for rare beauties are most lovely plaine dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and stones rich in themselves shew best set in a
foyle: not for method, it is already <hi>ordo quincunx,</hi>
one breast-plate into foure rowes, and those foure
rowes into twelve stones, three in each row; as the

Shall any be more sollicitous of <hi>generation</hi> and the

Neither can a Church-man be without it: for

Though some of our Disciples be of ductile dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
and easily follow the worke-mans hammer,
in their forming to grace; yet most are of dull eares,
stiffe necks, and hard hearts, jeoparding the losse
both of our oyle and labour. Now wee had need
have hope to expect with patience whilst we offer
grace, till the Spirit cloth our words with a hidden
and strong power to make them operative; we had
need have hope, while they have breath, to see if
when they are gone up to their death-beds, they
may be gained on, that they fall not into the grave
and hell both at once.</p>
               <p>Out of what hath beene already spoken you
may easily gather who is a worthy, and who is an
unworthy Church-man; and surely Church-men
are either the most deperdite, or else most happy
men of all, even then when as holy writ phraseth
it<note n="a" place="margin">Gn. 42. 36. Iere. 31. 15. Dan. 9. 26. Gen. 5. 24.</note>

here fulfilling their Ministery, they are either the
worthiest or unworthiest of men. A meane is
scarce given; for looke what degree of goodnesse a
thing holds while it is right, it ebbeth into the
same degree of evill when it is retrograde. The

will the sooner doe, if you remember that I write
these things not to teach, but to perswade you; or
<hi>non ut doctiores, sed ut meliores sitis; non ut mentem

to put my words into the forme of entreaties
or commands: whether to milke you with the

which stickes to our profession by those who startle

because not to death. Lastly, if the worst fall out
