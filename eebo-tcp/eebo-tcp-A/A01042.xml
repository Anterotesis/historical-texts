            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I haue beene visiting a Gentle-woman (I may say) of good parts other-wayes, but that, by the deceit of Seducers, her Heart is alienated from the Veritie of GOD HIS true Worship: Which, through the loue I beare her, so pierceth mee, as I could not choose, but, in the little Conference wee had, to aske her, why shee did so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinatelie obfirme her mynde agaynst Trueth? Shee answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee, That shee could obtayne no Resolution to her Soule, of such Scruples, as chiefelie mooved her to abhorre our Communion; al-be-it shee had so farre sought for it, that shee had delivered her Doubts, in writ, to their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <hi>Theriomachus:</hi> vvho receiving them of her hand, with covenant of an Answere, yet had done nothing for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quytall there-in.

And it is, indeede, no marvell, that they delude so securelie, when, first, they haue brought their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples heere-to, That they neyther will reade what wee write, nor heare what wee teach. And if, perhaps, vpon anie such motion, as this is, from anie of them, wee fall to write ought, it is, immediatelie (without anie eyther reading or pondering what we speake) put in their Ghostlie Fathers handes: whose word syne, they take for the estimation it is to bee had in; as I haue latelie learned, even by mine owne experience.</p>

And, if wee will lay aside Passion and Praejudice, wee must acknowledge, that there bee some of them, who are both excellentlie learned, and exemplarlie holie men. And thus much haue I gained by hearing of them, that certainlie, I perceiue our Writers to lay against them, manie vnjust im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, so to make their doctrine odious: as if they did maintaine things, where-of I haue often heard them teach the contrarie.

And verilie, (saving the judgement of holie Church) that opinion of implicite Faith, hath both much disgraced the Catholicke Cause, and hath made our Doctrine to bee suspected of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2564:14"/>
for an Argument, which is the verie Poynt in Question. All our Dispute, is, what Companie, of so manie Acclaimers, is the true Church of CHRIST. In this Question, proponed to vs by your Poët, wee are come thus farre, That who heare CHRIST'S voyce, and His voyce onlie. Wee haue layde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so this ground, That the Scriptures are onelie to bee helde for His voyce. Vpon which ground, I challenged your Church, as adding to her owne. Now here for your defence, that your Decrees must bee counted CHRIST'S voyce; and that even by Scripture, you assume, that you are the Church; and, where the Sheepe are to bee tryed, by the voyce which they doe heare, you will, therefore, justifie the voyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you, forsooth, doe heare it. And by such Logicke as this, what may you not conclude? You might, with more credite, tell vs in plaine Tearmes, That you will not haue it put in question, but that you are the Church: than appeare to put that poynt in tryall, and incontinent, to take it for a Principle, which is the verie Poynt contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Now, as this is your fault in Logicke, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding chyldish; so, in Divinitie, you misse, and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouslie. Because the LORD affirmeth, That who heareth the Church, heareth Him; and who despyseth them, despy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Him; if Pastours, vnder the pretext of this Power, should presume, absolutelie, to impose on Consciences, what they please; binding Christians, indifferentlie, without proving, to admit all; it were an impudent, yea, an impious vsurpation: For these speaches of <hi>CHRIST</hi> haue alwayes this implyed Condition, That Pastours speake nothing, but the wordes of the Great Shepheard: For, <hi>the words of the Wyse,</hi>

Scripture, if wee can not take vp the verie genuine sense, and meaning of the place, at least, let vs not expound that place of Scripture, in a sense repugning to the Analogie of Fayth: So shall wee bee lyke to a man, who how-so-ever hee hath aberred from the direct way, yet hee wandreth in the Fields, leading to the Towne where-at hee would bee. I affirmed, (<hi>Philomathes</hi>) that your Objection, of Scriptures obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, was also Sophisticall; and thus I cleare it: All reason of obscuritie, must bee eyther in the matter it selfe, or in the manner of delyverie, or in the weaknesse of their percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to whome it is delyvered. Of divine thinges, wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that, how-so-ever, for most reall and constant existence, they bee, of all thinges, the most certayne: yet, that, for their retyred eminencie, to all creatures, of all thinges, the most obscure. But, for the manner of deliverie, as GOD, in holie Scripture, hath revealed them, we affirme, that all the wisdome, and eloquence of all creatures, (even in a conceived matter) could never haue found out so playne a manner; or, so farre, and lovinglie, haue attempered it, to the capacitie of man, (as in so high mysteries, and a constant remayning Rule of Fayth, was possible.) And yet, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so-ever they bee thus delivered, wee acknowledge, that no naturall man, (and naturall onlie) is capable of them: For they are spirituallie discerned: But the spirituall man, by the<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>To reason, then, from the naturall obscuritie, or retyred eminencie of the matter, to the manner of deliverie: or, from the weaknesse of man's perception, to conclude of the manner of deliverie: or, from the perception of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, to conclude of the perception of the spirituall man, it were al-wayes absurd Sophistication.

Now, from this speciall Case, and qualitie of Case, to inferre, That the man by this Commotiue, first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, had still there-after no other, or greater Warrand, for his Beliefe of Scripture, but the Authoritie of the Church, which first induced him: it were no better Logicke, than to conclude of the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> That they never had anie better Foundation of their Fayth, than the Report of their Woman from the Well.</p>
                  <p>The Authoritie of the Church, may, and will often, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Infidell, to reverence, and belieue Scripture: but so, as having come thus farte, then, in the communitie of that Church, to discerne lawfull, from vnlawfull worship; and, orthodox, from hereticall professours, the Scriptures onlie must haue place: as in a case, where-in to alleadge the Churches authoritie, were extreamlie ridiculous, it beeing the verie point in question, what companie is the Church. And I shewed you before, how your men are alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or at least, labour to deceiue others, by confounding

                  <p>I did suspect, (<hi>Eriphilus</hi>) that you would kindle at my Position: and, therefore, (for a more gentle Recept)<note place="margin">II.</note> I, even of purpose, turned my talke to <hi>Philomathes.</hi> But, I will calmlie coole your heate, if I can. I deny no Article of the Creede. I both confesse, and belieue, the Catholicke Church. But, (that I may, yet once, make you more agast) in that, I doe belieue it, I, even therefore, deny <hi>Catholicke,</hi> or <hi>Vniversalitie,</hi> to bee a proper Marke of the Church; yea, or anie Marke at all: For, <hi>Fayth is the evidence of thinges, which are seene:</hi> but, the vniversalitie of the Church, is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">Heb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </note> by Fayth: therefore, the vniversalitie of the Church, is not seene. Now, if it bee of things, which are not seene, but are believed, it can not bee a marke, where-by, heere to discerne the true Church. And, because, (<hi>Eriphilus</hi>) you sought for Syllogismes, I thus reason: All Marks are seene, or fall, vnder some Sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Vniversalitie</hi> is not seene, neyther falleth vnder anie Sense: There-fore, <hi>Vniversalitie</hi> can bee no Marke. The Proposition of this Argument, as it is moste certayne, so is it confessed by your Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in his second chapter, <hi>De notis Eccles.</hi> The Assumption, none will denye, who haue anie Sense: For all Schooles holde this for an vndoubted Principle, That no <hi>Vniversall,</hi> as it is <hi>Vniversall,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

Absolutelie, and most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie, the Catholicke Church, is the whole number, of what-so-ever tyme or place, who haue beene, are, or shall bee vnited vnto CHRIST, their Head, and liue in Him, by His Spirit; whether heere, on Earth, fighting; or hence, in Heaven, triumphing. Absolutelie, and lesse properlie, the Catholicke Church, is the whole militant companie heere on Earth, of what-so-ever Kinred, Tongue, or Nation, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one, and the same common Ensigne, of Christian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; whether Hypocrites, or true Professours; whether pure, or corrupt, Worshippers; whether Orthodox, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall; as even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> argueth, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>De Notis Eccles.</hi> In anie of which Cases, shee is believed, and (in her <hi>Vniversali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>) falleth not vnder Sense. Improperlie, agayne, and in opposite Relation, the Church is called <hi>CATHOLICKE,</hi> for two Respects: The one, In opposite Relation to the Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which was limited within the compasse of one People, and of one Region: the Christian Church, no more so confined, but spread, indifferentlie, over all, is called the <hi>CATHOLICKE CHVRCH.</hi> Neyther thus, because that eyther al-wayes all Peoples Vniversallie, or moste parte of Men, embrace the Gospell: but, because the Entrie is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and offered, indifferentlie, vnto all. The other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, was the opposite Relation, to hereticall Companies, separating them-selues, by Errour, from the common Bodie of the Church, &amp; Trueth mayntayned there-in. And in this last Respect, it is, that al-most the Fathers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie speak of it; calling the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munitie of the Visible Church, retayning Trueth, (in relation to particular hereticall Companies) the <hi>CATHOLICKE CHVRCH.</hi> And, in this Sense, opposing, ordinarilie, to arrogant men, the <hi>Authoritie, Multitude, Consent, Succession,</hi> &amp;c. of the Catholicke Church, as you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, <hi>Philomathes.</hi> But in this manner of the Fathers
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2564:23"/>
reasoning, two things are carefullie to bee marked, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Fathers shall bee found both pertinentlie, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie, to haue vsed this Argument; &amp; where by, your men now, shall bee seene evidentlie, and impudentlie, to abuse it. The first, is that state and condition of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Argument hath place, according as it was when the Fathers vsed it. The second, is, what weight, or moment, the Fathers placed in it. The state of the Church, then, was in common, pure, holding Trueth, and by the force there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, purging, or expelling all in-bred, or accressing evils, or Heresies. So, as then, though by an improper Speach, yet the Communalitie of the Church, keeping Trueth, in relation to a few Declyners, might not impertinentlie bee called the Catholicke Church, and her authoritie, might well haue beene opposed vnto them. But, who, in a plaine contrarie state, and condition of the Church, when Errour obtaineth in common, and Trueth is afflicted, and borne downe; yet, without consideration of the altered State and Condition, would still vse the same reason, from <hi>Multitude,</hi> and what-so-ever, or how-so-ever an obtaining State; hee were a ridiculous Sophister, confounding diverse, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct times, and cases. To reason from the state of the Church in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> (where-in evill was not tollerated) to<note place="margin">Revel. 2.</note> the state of the Church in <hi>Smirna,</hi> (where-in Heretickes waxed prowde, and despysed the abject state of true Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours) it were sophisticall: but much more sophisticall, to reason from the state in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to the state in <hi>Pergamus;</hi> when<note place="margin">Rev. 12.</note> the true Church dwelt, even where Satan's Throne was; knowne to GOD, though hid from the worldlie sort. To reason from the Woman cloathed with the Sunne, treading the Moone, and crowned with twelue Starres; to the same Woman, lurking in the Wildernesse, it concludeth not: for, as, in the first Case, the Fathers had reason, and did wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to convince by all Advantages; so, whyle the Case is clearlie altered, (according as by Scripture was fore-tolde)<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>And, this altered Condition, of Tyme, and of the Church, in tyme, which maketh the Argument, some-tyme, pertinentlie, vsed, to bee nowe ridiculous: besides, that both <hi>SCRIPTVRE</hi> hath fore-tolde it, the <hi>FATHERS</hi> did see the working on of it, and, wee haue, aboundantlie often, prooved, and still offer, to prooue it. It is cleare, also, by that other Poynt, which I propounded, to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, in this reasoning of the <hi>FATHERS:</hi> namelie, What Weyght, or Moment, they placed in that same Argument.

This <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> did both fore-see, and gaue warning of it: that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered<note place="margin">In Math. homil. 49.</note> state of the Church, behooved to bring men to a more neare and proper Rule of Examination, (as in his Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, aboue cited, is cleare.) In that, how-so-ever, before that Heresie obtayned place in the Church, and the abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of desolation stood also (<hi>in sanctis Ecclesiae locis</hi>) in the holie places of the Church, manie wayes were to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Church: (as, while Trueth helde place in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, was <hi>Vniversalitie</hi> improperlie taken, <hi>Multitude, Consent, Succession,</hi> &amp;c) yet now, after that hereticall contagion hath infected the Bodie in common, no manner of way is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the true Church, (amidst the corrupted communitie of the Church) but onlie the Scriptures. You are greatlie deceived, (<hi>Philomathes</hi>) if you esteeme the Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to bee called <hi>CATHOLICKE;</hi> eyther because al-wayes the moste parte of men shall come in to her, and embrace the Profession: or yet, That of such as come in to her, the moste parte shall al-wayes holde the Trueth.

And, how-so-ever, that neyther most part come in, neyther of such as are in her, is the most part of her, or saved: yet all, vniversallie, who are saved, must both bee in her, and of her. And, how-so-ever, in her, most part keepe not Trueth, yet no Trueth is, but in her. If (as your Men are al-readie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,

                  <p>What Companie did take in hand, and, accordinglie, first performed, the publishing of the Gospell, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Worlde, and converted all Nations, to the Fayth; that must bee the Companie, to which the Title of <hi>CATHOLICKE,</hi> or <hi>VNIVERSALITIE,</hi> properlie, belongeth: and that Companie, is the <hi>Catholicke Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> onlie, did both vnder-take, and performe this. There-fore, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Catholicke</hi> Church; and, to her, properlie, that Note belongeth.</p>

But your Poet, appropriating this Title, to the first Converters, hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted from this Dignitie, all the Converted by them: And, thus, his Proposition, is not onlie false, but even ridiculous.

                  <p>It is the mayne poynt, where-in wee would bee resolved. For these other things, I am not to make Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Can you, al-wayes, denye, but that <hi>CONTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVANCE,</hi> is a proper Marke of the Church?</p>

                  <p>It is no more a proper Note of the Church, than<note place="margin">II.</note> Colour and Stature, are proper Notes of a Man. And, (that I forget not my promise, as I come on them, one by one, to shew, the vayne sophistrie of your man's mayne Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in all) I affirme, That, as <hi>Vniversalitie</hi> was foolishlie brought by him, for a discerning Marke, betwixt Acclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; so, also, is this, of <hi>Continuance:</hi> not, that I deny it, to bee an attribute, and common accident: for, certaynlie, since her first beginning, the Church both hath continued, and shall continue al-wayes. But, doe you holde this good Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, in your man, (<hi>Philomathes</hi>) of common accidents, to conclude, that they are proper Notes, and discerning Marks? you know, that <hi>Proprium,</hi> is but one of diverse kynds of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication: and, that what-so-ever, is proper to any thing, it conveaneth (as Schooles speake) <hi>Omni soli, &amp; semper:</hi> that is, <hi>To all, to onlie, and al-wayes.</hi> But, <hi>Continuance,</hi> could not bee sayde of the Church, <hi>Semper:</hi> that is, <hi>at all tymes.</hi> For, at the first moment of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evaes</hi> Creation, (who were the Church) <hi>Continuance,</hi> of them then, had bene no true Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when as yet, no tyme had run. Besides, what-so-ever is a proper Note, it is so converted with the subject, where-of it is the propertie; as that, if <hi>Continuance</hi> were a proper Note of the Church; then, as none could be the Church, but which had continued, and did still continue: so, what-so-ever did continue, behooved to bee the Church, which you see, were extreamlie absurd. For, Heaven, and Earth, continue to this day: Satan, continueth a Liar, and a Murtherer, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2564:29"/>
and his Children continue Liars, and Murtherers, lyke their Father: and, the evill Seed continueth, even amidst the good Seede, in the Lord's owne Fielde, till the last day of separation. So, as if with anie probable shew, your man would had <hi>CONTINVANCE,</hi> counted a concluding Marke of the Church, hee should haue added there-to, this Modification, That, what companie hath continued in the true Fayth, and Worship of CHRIST, that is His true Church. But, then, if hee should assume, that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath onlie continued in the true Fayth, and lawfull Worship of CHRIST, wee will denye it, as extreamlie false: and, tell him, that hee continueth impudent, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Question. And, thus, you may perceiue, (<hi>Philoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi>) that your man's most lykelie Marks, yet are no proper Markes, till they bee modified, by that one, and onelie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue, and truelie discretiue Marke, which at first I layde downe vnto you.</p>

                  <p>I will presentlie prooue, what eyther Poynt, or<note place="margin">V.</note> Edge, it hath; and, how piercing so-ever you presume it to bee, (<hi>Eriphilus</hi>) yet make it to bee found as phlegmaticke, as you are cholericke. Of your Syllogisme then, <hi>Philomathes,</hi> (where-by you conclude no thing to <hi>Romes</hi> advantage, if any other Churches may bee shewed, to haue continued in anie Profession, or Worship of the Name of CHRIST) I grant the Proposition to bee true: for, no question, but that onlie with-in the compasse of the visible Church, and vnder the common Ensigne of Profession, the true Church, and all true Christians, are, and haue continued, al-wayes. And, as where-ever the Ensigne is, and the Name of CHRIST pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, how corruptedlie so-ever it bee in common, yet, there, possiblie, yea, probablie, (I durst say assuredlie) are some true, though weake, Christians: So, where that Name is not at all named, nor anie worship there-of, there no Church can bee sayde to bee at all. Your Assumption is both false, and deceitfull. And, to shew it evidentlie to bee such, if I should but oppose to you, the <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Churches, which haue continued, and not onelie without anie Communion, but al-most without anie knowledge of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> what could you finde, to say, against these Instances? but,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2564:30"/>
I will bee so indulgent, vnto you, as not to vrge them on you: I will, other-wayes, sufficientlie, so discover the deceit of your Assumption, as the falsehood of it may bee clearlie seene: for it contayneth a double fallacie; one in the name of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the other, in that which is affirmed of it. For, if by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> bee vnderstood, the whole bodie of the visible Church, on which, for some Ages, by craft and ambitious vsurpation of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> in-thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Temple, the Character, Name, or Number of<note place="margin">Revel. 13.</note> the <hi>Beast,</hi> were imposed in common: how-so-ever thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, ever were in that communitie, who, rejecting, and detesting them, retained the Name of the Lambe His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Character there-of; and were of the 144000 sealed<note place="margin">Revel. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>

                        </gap>
                     </note> ones: and, manie, who, in simplicitie, received the Name, or Number of the <hi>Beast,</hi> yet never received his Character. Then, sophisticallie, and deceitfullie, you reason from the accressing Sore, and Gangrene in the bodie, (and of which Sore, the name is but improperlie and tyrannicallie imposed on the bodie) to the bodie affected there-with. When wee pleade agaynst the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> wee pleade not against that bodie absolutelie, where-in that evill was, and that so farre obtaining, as it named the bodie after it selfe, (while<note place="margin">Revel. 2. 13.</note> the Church of GOD dwelt, even where <hi>Satan's</hi> Throne was) but wee pleade agaynst the evill, in, but not of, the bodie: not agaynst all, who were called the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> or <hi>Papists,</hi> or were counted of that number: But agaynst <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie,</hi> or <hi>Antichristianisme.</hi> Not agaynst all, who were, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row common Contagion, perhaps, lightlie touched, or taynted with the Evill: But agaynst the Characterized com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, <hi>Antichrist</hi> his mancipated Slaues, and in whom the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent Evill, had eaten vp all true lyfe, and sense. So, as in this Case, for arrogating anie poynt, to the Mischiefe which wee oppugne, to oppose vnto vs, the common bodie, even heavilie affected, and, in common, over-gone with it; it is no lesse absurd sophistication, than if one should confound the Dropsie, Iaundies, or Gangrene in the Bodie, with the Bodie in which they are, and drawe Conclusions from the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2564:31"/>
one, to the other. If all the Bodie, were the Evill, then were there no Bodie. But, even a sicke Bodie, is yet a Bodie: and, how-so-ever so affected, in common, and, no part appeareth to be fullie free, but, that the Sore possesseth all: yet, so long as the Bodie liveth, and mooveth, performing naturall Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; it evinceth, that some Noble partes yet resist the Disease; so as the Bodie, al-be-it heavilie affected, yet dieth not: yea, getting the true Medicine, and Divine Purgation of the Word and Spirit, will expell the Evill, and notiue Humour, and recover Health; as Experience hath prooved clearlie, in manie Reformed, both Churches and Persons.</p>
                  <p>Thus, (<hi>Philomathes</hi>) if in your Assumption, you meane, by the Church, that whole Bodie, absolutelie, on which that Name was fraudfullie, and tyrannicallie, imposed: then you conclude not your Poynt, but deceiue, by Aequivocation, (<hi>A dici, ad esse</hi>) from <hi>So called,</hi> and, wronglie called, to <hi>So is;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding that knowne Distinction of Logicke, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, where-of I spake before. And if, by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> you signifie the <hi>Papalitie,</hi> and Evill in the Bodie, which wee impugne, (as you must, if you evince ought agaynst vs) then is your Assumption clearlie false. For, both before that Evill invaded the Bodie, the Bodie was: and, even at the tyme of the waxing Sore, yet still continued, brooking some healthsome remnant of Spirituall Sense, and Lyfe: and, now, at last, by the Medicinall Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Word, and Spirit, is recovering Health, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the, formerlie, destroying Disease.</p>
                  <p>This will bee yet more cleare, by the discoverie of that other Fallacie, where-by, in this Case, of the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, your Men partlie illude, and partlie are illuded. For, because the Church continueth al-wayes, they esteeme, and conclude falselie, That, there-fore, shee continueth still in one, and the same Condition of Light, and Lyfe: that is, That Trueth, and lawfull Worship, hath al-wayes helde place, and borne swey there-in, in common: so as what-so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Companie, or Doctrine, most, in common, obtayned, and carried Vogue, that was the true Church of <hi>CHRIST,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:2564:31"/>
and the true and Orthodox Fayth. And this is most absurdly false, and evinced to be so, not onlie by evident Experience, but also by cleare Scripture. For, all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For, how-so-ever, that, for <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathes</hi> better satisfaction, I was, and am, contented to deale thus; yet, what a senselesse thing, in effect, is this, That the Trueth of GOD, (so clearlie revealed, and, which, by anie, having Spirituall Eyes, is as easilie discerned from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as Light is from Darknesse) for Man's vayne humour, should bee put to this forme, and Rule of Tryall; That, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it may bee cleared, where, and with whome, it hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblie continued, wee will prowdlie, and rebelliouslie, reject it?

visible: yet, I will denye your Proposition, if, from a restrict Case, you draw it to an absolute Assertion, because, in some consideration, the Church is invisible. And, to cleare this: In respect of the matter of the Church, (which is Men) and, in respect of the common outward forme, (in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke &amp; common Ensigne of Profession, &amp; worship) we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, the Church to bee, and, al-wayes to haue beene, visible. But, in respect of her inward forme, &amp; the purpose of Grace, (where-on chiefelie the Trueth of the Church hangeth) she is invisible. And, the LORD knoweth, who are His. Schooles doe call the one, <hi>Ratione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Signi;</hi> &amp;, the other, <hi>Ratione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Beneplaciti.</hi> And, seeing it is an Article of our Faith, to belieue the Church; and, <hi>that Fayth, is of things, which are not seene;</hi> it followeth, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, that in some (and that a most principall) respect, the Church is invisible. For, to be believed, &amp; to be seene, can not consist. Yea, this is so evident a trueth, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is forced to confesse it: these are his words, <hi>Melius dico in Ecclesia aliquid vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deri,</hi>

But, if by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> your As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption meaneth the Evill, and Sore, agaynst which onlie it is that wee pleade, and not agaynst the common Bodie, where-of wee are; then, is it manifestlie false: and, so, your Conclusion fayleth.</p>

of that Bodie, in common, are, eyther infected, or, at least, heavilie affected, yea, and even much afflicted there-by; so, as no part can bee separablie showne, brooking, a-part, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, without eyther Infection, or Affection. And, yet, even in such a Case, a Skilfull man, beholding, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, will perceiue, evidentlie, that it is a living, al-be-it a sick Bodie: yea, that such Strength, of naturall Vigour, yet remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth there-in, al-be-it no-where vnaffected, which, both, resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth the wasting Disease, even in the verie Paroxisme, and, in ende, by prevailing vitall power, &amp; helpe of right Medicine, expelleth it.

I did not say, neyther ever mynded I to say, That none did see our Church: but, I, justlie, taxed a false Conclusion, led from <hi>VISIBILITIE,</hi> to common, and continuall seeing. For, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thinges are visible, which yet neyther are, in common, nor al-wayes seene. And, this maketh not our Church invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblie visible; but it sheweth him, who will deny it, to bee visiblie blynde. I acknowledge, That, how-so-ever <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Darknesse,</hi> hath over-gone the whole Church, in common, yet that ever still, with-in the compasse of that Vsurpation, vnder the common Ensigne, were numbers of true, and lawfull Worshippers, and, a true, and lawfull Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: which were, al-wayes, visible, by the Ensigne, and common Bodie: as whyte is visible, in the rucke and heape, how-so-ever covered with the over-going Chaffe, or Strae, till the Fanner come, and purge the Floore. And, to come yet more neare, (<hi>Eriphilus</hi>) I say, That they were not onlie visible in this sort, but, al-so, in their persons, and practise of pure Worship: and, that they were seene, al-so, al-be-it not, in common, perceived. For, manie thinges, will bee both visible, and seene, al-so, which yet will escape percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even of the Seers. Yea, which you will yet, perhaps, more admire, I affirme, That they were not onlie visible, and seene, but perceived, al-so; though not in common, nor of the blynded worldlie sort, (which was the LORD His Providence, for their preservation;) but only of their<note place="margin">Rev. 14</note> sealed Brethren, who were brought from the Earth; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spirituall Virgines, onlie got Eyes, to see, and perceiue; and, Eares, to heare, and vnderstand, that sweet, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned Song, which the Beast's stupified Sectators could ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heare, nor learne. Now, then, though I affirme, and that justlie, That from <hi>Visibilitie,</hi> one may not conclude of seeing: neither, from seeing, may one conclude of perceiving:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2564:39"/>
neyther, from both seeing, and perceiving, of seeing, and perceiving, in common: yet I deny not, but freelie, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie affirme, That our Church was all-wayes visible, seene, and perceived, but not of such as had no Eyes. Doe you not know, that manie thinges may bee visible; which yet, through the blyndnesse of beholders, are not seene? yea, and manie things are seene, which even the seers, (through mis-regard, or over-vayling mist, or GOD, in justice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numming their Senses) yet, will not take vp, nor perceiue: which, yet, the illuminated, will both see, and perceiue clearlie.</p>
                  <p>To reason, then, from <hi>Visibilitie,</hi> to common sight; or, from <hi>Visibilitie,</hi> and common sight, to conclude common Perception; or, to conclude of what is not seene, or percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in common, That it is not seene, or perceived, at all; yea, is not visible; yea, is not at all; it is such a dead kynde of Argumentation, (<hi>Eriphilus</hi>) as, where-in all your choler will never kindle the lyfe of good Logicke.

But, (<hi>Eriphilus</hi>) to be yet more playne, and to come even close to your hand. As, before, I cleared, how the Church continued al-wayes, al-be-it not al-wayes in one, and the same Condition: so, I tell you, now, That the Church was ever, and in all Ages, visible; how-so-ever not al-wayes in a-lyke measure of Health, and Spirituall Vigour: which is your Mens grosse Fallacie. A Man, even brought to bed with sicknesse, is no les visible, than when he walked abroad, in perfect health, albeit neither seen of so many, nor so health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as before.

                  <p>Verilie (<hi>Eubulus</hi>) I can not denye, but your Reasons are sound, and solide; and, your Distinctions are subtill. But, it seemeth exceeding strange, that anie such Case, and so long a tyme, should haue befallen the Church of GOD: which maketh mee yet to suspect, that your Argumentes, are more out of subtiltie of Logicke, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Veritie of the Matter: and, that, how-so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they evince, indeede, clearlie, a <hi>Possibilitie</hi> of such a Case: yet, that anie such Case, in trueth, was, they will not conclude: And, it were a rash Conception, so to thinke of holie Church.

For, the workes of GOD are wonderfull, and, Hee is marvelous, in the Case of His Saynctes. As, great is the Mysterie of Godlinesse; so, al-so, is that of Iniquitie. And, without true illumination, to know the Scriptures of GOD, none ever shall attayne, eyther to the healthsome Knowledge of the one, or happie Discoverie of the other.

For, there bee manie poynts of Trueth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in diversitie of judgement, breaketh not the <hi>Vnitie</hi> of the Church: Yea, and manie Divisions, and Dissentions, which, yet, divyde not the dissenting Members, one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or, if one from another, yet, neyther of them from the Head, or common Bodie; from which those, onlie, may bee sayde, absolutelie, to fall, which holde not the Head, or, subvert, directlie, and with pertinacie, the Foundation. For, manie, in weaknesse, will holde Opinions, which, in-deede, doe even choppe agaynst the Foundation, by cleare, and necessarie Consequence; but not immediatelie, or directlie.

Wee are all, heere, still, compassed with Infirmitie; knowing, but in part, and, prophecying, but in part. In which Case, the Apostle, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablie, advyseth, That, <hi>Who are perfect, they bee so myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and, if anie bee other-wayes mynded, that the LORD</hi>

That Dissentions, and Divisions are, it declareth Men, to bee, yet, in that part, carnall: but, it doeth not separate them, from the common Bodie, so long as they holde one, and the same LORD, one Fayth, one Hope, one Baptisme, and are vnited in one, and the same Spirit: no more, than did this Defect, in the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> which, al-be-it, that, heere-fore, the Apostle did rebuke, as carnall,<note place="margin">

And, though, by anie such Schisme, eyther a Person, or Companie, should bee divided, from particular, eyther Church or Churches; it will not, therefore, follow, (&amp; I thinke, none dare avouch it) that, there-fore, they are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Head, or common Bodie: so, to make them in a-lyke Case, with haereticall Subverters of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

and, Deserters of the Head. Wee see, by Experience, in naturall Bodies, That, by inflicted Woundes, such Gaps will bee made, as the sides of the Wound, eyther from other, will start a-sunder: and, so, one part of the Bodie, by a separating Wound, will be severed from another part: which, both, will yet remayne still vnited in the common Bodie, and, bee part-takers of one, and the same common Sense, Motion, and Lyfe, from one, and the same Head, and Heart.

And, denying vs anie such <hi>Vnitie,</hi> as may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a Church of CHRIST, you haue appropriated all to <hi>Rome,</hi> how justlie, we will, even now, examine: and, first, your Objection against vs, is, manie wayes sophisticall. First, if such bee accounted ours, who are none of vs, the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vnjust. Wee acknowledge, and doe lament it, that there is too great Division, and varietie of Sects, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues Christians, in the worlde: but, what doe most part of them, more, or so much concerne vs, as they concerne your Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> out of whose dongue, as noysome Flees,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2564:45"/>
they are bred: and by Satan's craft, comming to fly on, vpon our Churches, (that by the mixture of their Poyson, they may bring the Trueth in disgrace) are onlie, by vs diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie resisted, and their Errours clearlie convinced: while, in the meane tyme, your <hi>Romish Church,</hi> (whose brood they are) is carelesse of anie thing, but to suppresse the Trueth; and, calumniouslie, to lay over, on vs, the Stinke of their owne Excrements. As for such, whom we will not disadvow, in common, (how-so-ever wee will not justifie the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Giddinesse, and bitternesse of some particular Men, who, as fyre-brands, disturbe, humurouslie, and vnnecessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the Peace of the Church) I affirme, that no such mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Poynts are in differ betwixt vs, in common, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wee, both, may not, and ought not, embrace others, mutuallie, as Brethren. Which, that wee doe not, it is our weaknesse, and the malicious worke, of but a few evil-inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Instruments; seeking more their owne Estimation, than GOD his Glorie, and good of His Church. And, that no such Separation is betwixt vs, but that, how-so-ever, by a cruell Wound, of mercilesse Hands, wee are separated, one of vs, from another; yet wee are still joyned in the common Head, and in the common Bodie, each of vs to other. So, as your Man's odious enumeration of <hi>Protestants, Puritanes, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists, Zwinglians,</hi> and, if you list, to adde to them, <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> also, is but a calumnious traducing, of such, as, most part, are not separated eyther from other: or at least, how-so-ever, by some weaknesse, they bee in that sort distracted, yet, are but one Bodie, joyned in one, and the same LORD, Fayth, Hope, Baptisme; and informed, all of them, by one and the same Spirit, al-be-it not all, in a-lyke measure. Amongst whom, there is no just breach of Communion: how-so-ever, that, by a Wound, of some cruell and dispitefull Men, those you doe call <hi>Lutherians,</hi> are, vnnecessarilie, separated from the rest: but, none of vs, from the common Head, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, in which we are still vnited, and will be yet more &amp; more nearlie: our Concord, in GOD, and His Trueth, growing, as your <hi>Vnitie,</hi> in Evill, shall be broken off: the will of GOD
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2564:45"/>
being fulfilled, in all the worke of <hi>Antichrist's</hi> deceit, justlie vpon the Worlde, for contempt of His Trueth. And, thus (<hi>Philomathes</hi>) your Assumption, where-by you denye vs anie such <hi>Vnitie,</hi> as, of necessitie, is requyred in the Church of CHRIST, for keeping, justlie, that Account, is false. And, no lesse false is it, al-so, in that, what you would robbe vs of, you doe appropriate to <hi>Rome:</hi> which can not bee, truelie, praysed for anie <hi>Vnitie,</hi> except that which before I mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, out of the seaventeenth Chapter of the <hi>REVELA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION,</hi> which is the onlie <hi>Vnitie</hi> proper vnto her, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinglie, there fore-tolde of her. For, other-wayes, shee hath fallen away, foulie, both from the Head, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: and, can never bee sayde, to haue keeped <hi>Vnitie</hi> with the true Bodie; other-wayes, than the accressing Sore, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stume in the Bodie, but not of it, may bee sayde, to bee one with the Bodie. And, your Man bewrayeth, verie well, howe poorelie provyded hee is, of anie sure probation of his <hi>Vnitie:</hi> when, for all Argument, where-by to evince an <hi>Vnion,</hi> in one LORD, one Fayth, one Hope, one Baptisme, and one true, and sanctifying Spirit, hee is not ashamed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudentlie, to take that, which is the verie mayne poynt in question. Whither, I pray you, did his Poëticke Furie transport him; when, without blushing, to sustayne his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, on which all the lyfe of his Cause depended, hee brought this onlie, and goodlie, Argument?</p>
                  <p>That Church, onlie, keepeth <hi>Vnitie,</hi> in all poynts, which cleaveth to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>But, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> onelie, cleaveth to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>There-fore, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> onlie, keepeth <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> in all poynts.</p>
                  <p>The Proposition of this his Demonstration, he prooveth, by this; That the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Peter.</hi> But the Pope is <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successour. <hi>Ergo,</hi> doe you requyre mee, (<hi>Philomathes</hi>) to make anie aunswere to these your Man his Raveries? Or, if hee had beene set, of verie purpose, to play the Praevaricator in the Cause,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2564:46"/>
which hee pleadeth; could hee more ridiculouslie, I will not say, haue reasoned, but raved: Wee neyther deny, nor envy your Church, her <hi>Vnitie</hi> with the Pope; al-be-it, in christian Compassion, wee pittie it. But, wee deny, your Mischiefe to haue anie <hi>Vnion,</hi> eyther with the Head, Foundation, or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, except as a Sore in it, but not of it. And, to cleare yet farder, the falsehood of your Man's mayne Assumption, of <hi>Vnitie, (That the Church of Rome, keepeth Vnitie in all poynts</hi>) and how vayne hee is, in vaunting there-of: if your Poet had as carefullie picked out the Partialities of his <hi>Romish Church,</hi> (even in this their damnable and cursed conspiracie) as hee hath, with a perverse mynde, and poysonable Eye, pryed in our Distractions: What great matter, of Insulting, hath hee, or anie of his profession, against our Churches, for any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, betwixt vs, and these whom they doe call <hi>LVTHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIANS?</hi> If he were as powerfull a Peace-maker, as he proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth an impertinent Pratler, he might haue found, at Home, to worke vpon, not only great Dissentions, but even as bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and materiall, Digladiations, as anie is amongst vs. When al our Controversie, amongst our selues, about the manner of Presence, and participation of CHRIST, in the sacred Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is duelie weighed; what shall bee found, there-in, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the manyfolde Debates, amongst your Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, about the manner of their prodigious <hi>TRANSSVB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTIATION?</hi> whence, as from an horrible <hi>Hydra,</hi> so manie monstruouslie diverse Heads haue sprung vp, in their Schooles, as never will bee reconciled, till Fyre, from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, burne vp all that intoxicated Bodie.

Propertie of the Church of CHRIST: yea, and I will grant thus much more, That al-be-it all properties be not Marks, (because more is requyred for being a proper Marke, than onlie to bee a proper Attribute) yet, that <hi>Holinesse</hi> is even a proper Marke of CHRIST His Church; but, where-in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath as litle, and lesse advantage, than in anie of the former. And, for clearing of this, (<hi>Philomathes</hi>) I must, first, put out your Man, from the Lurking-denne of Aequivocation, where-in your Doctours delight to lye; and, thence, to shoote at the Innocent, in secret. For, if, by <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> bee meaned, that sanctified Disposition of the Soule, and Affections, by the Spirit of Regeneration, wrought in all true Christians; in that Sense, it can bee no Marke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause GOD, onlie, knoweth the Hearts of Men. And, wee concluded, before, with consent of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> That all Markes must, of necessitie, fall vnder Sense. And, agayne, if by <hi>Holynesse,</hi> bee meaned, that which is seene, and exposed to perception, in Mens outward carriage, according to the Law of Righteousnesse, in Manners, and common conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; neyther, thus, can it be a proper Marke of CHRIST HIS true Church. For, that, by the restrayning Vertue of GOD HIS Spirite of Administration, even <hi>Heathen</hi> men, and <hi>Infideles,</hi> will appeare, in all morall Vertues, matcheable to Christians; except, that wee know, that what-so-ever is not of Fayth, is sinne. Was not <hi>Paul</hi> vnrebukeable, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Law; while, yet, hee was not onlie no Believer, but even a cruell Persecuter al-so?</p>

                  <p>How-so-ever outward Righteousnesse may not bee a sure Marke of Men, considered absolutelie; for that fayre carriage, which by the restrayning Vertue of the Spirit of Administration, will bee even in <hi>Heathen</hi> men: yet, (as you did, in short wordes, make answere to your selfe) that what is not of Fayth, is sinne; and, that, there-fore, no <hi>Heathen</hi> conversation, how approoved so-ever, can be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for true <hi>Holynesse:</hi> So, amongst Professours of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, I thinke, that <hi>Holynesse</hi> in lyfe and manners, must bee a most sure discerning Mark, wherby to know the true Church,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2564:48"/>

And wee are a-searching of such Notes, as in the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christians, all acclayming the Title of the Church, may discerne the Vpright, from the Bastard, in that same kynde.

                  <p>That Companie, which hath turned all the Worship of GOD, (Who will bee worshipped, in Spirit, and Trueth) in a prophane Histrionicke Farce: which teacheth, for Doctrines, the Traditions of Men': which burdeneth the Consciences of Christians, (whom their Lord will haue to be free, saith <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>) with innumerable ydle, &amp; superstitious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, of Mans inventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; in the multitude where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all true Religion, is not onlie buried, but, al-so, lost: Which, after that perfect Sacrifice, which CHRIST offered, once for all, offereth still Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatorie Sacrifices, for Sinne: Which devyseth Sacramentes of their owne, which they haue not received from the LORD: Which, supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouslie,

What they haue beene, who are contayned in our Kalendar, wee are not much curious to inquyre; because wee holde it not for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister of Sayncts, but for a civill Rule, where-by to calculate Tymes.

But, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Man, it is neyther the ryme, <hi>when,</hi> nor the place <hi>where,</hi> anie Man, eyther liveth, or dieth, that maketh him a Christian. But, that third thing in his Question, which, onlie, for all; except to multiplie Babling, hee should haue asked, namelie, in what Fayth they lived, and died? And, then, wee answere, That, if they were Saynctes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2564:50"/>
they both lived, and died, in the same Fayth which wee holde; and were even of our Companie: which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, is not defined by Tyme, <hi>when,</hi> or place <hi>where,</hi> but by the vnion of what-so-ever persones, in what-so-ever place, and of what-so-ever tyme, in one LORD, one Fayth, one Spirit, on Baptisme, &amp;c. for all Sayncts are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Trueth: and, Thy Word is Trueth, sayeth our Saviour.

                  <p>The Proposition of his Argument, is true: but<note place="margin">XIX.</note> his Assumption, is extreamlie false: where-of hee laboureth, to fortifie the first part, touching the Defects alleadged on our Churches, thus:</p>
                  <p>The Promise of CHRIST, to His Church, is, That <hi>Peter's fayth shall never fayle:</hi> that, <hi>The Gates of Hell shall not prevayle against her:</hi> that, <hi>The Salt shall not lose its savour:</hi> that, <hi>The Bryde shall not bee out of favour:</hi> that, <hi>The Church shall remaine the stable Pillar of Trueth,</hi> &amp;c. and, According to this Promise, the certayne Condition of the Church, is, That <hi>Shee al-wayes continueth, and is, visible.</hi> But, by these things, which you affirme, of your Churches, <hi>Peter's Fayth should haue fayled: The Gates of Hell should haue prevayled: the Salt should haue lost</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:2564:62"/>
                     <hi>its savour: the Spouse should haue beene out of favour: the Pillar should haue beene over-throwne: and, the Church of CHRIST, should not haue continued, and continued visible.</hi> There-fore, thinges affirmed by you, can not consist with the promise of CHRIST, made to His Church, and her Condition, accordinglie: and, consequentlie, you are <hi>Haeretickes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, having, as hee thinketh, set vs aside, from anie Interest in the Title of CHRIST'S Church: next, vpon a ground, confessed by vs, but miserable mistaken by him, hee buildeth a Conclusion, for the second part of his mayne Assumption, which concerneth the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> thus:</p>
                  <p>To giue lawfull Ordination to Pastors, is competent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the Church of CHRIST. But, you, <hi>Protestantes,</hi> acknowledge, That the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, given by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was lawfull Ordination. There-fore, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> must bee the Church of CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Doe you not, now, perceiue (<hi>Philomathes</hi>) whither your Man's meaning tendeth, by all this his great Squadron of Interrogatours: with the multitude where-of, hee would, in a Musicall Moode, over-whelme vs?</p>

                  <p>I now perceiue it well anough: you haue reduced all, to so cleare and compendious a forme. And, graunting the Major of his mayne Argument, you denyed his Minor. And, first, that part there-of, which, vpon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes, layde agaynst you, hee assumed of your Churches. For Probation where-of, I must confesse, that no-thing is brought, by him, in his second Syllogisme, but the all-readie disputed poyntes, of <hi>Continuance,</hi> and <hi>Visibilitie.</hi> Where-of you haue sayde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So, that, except it please you to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto his last, and, appearinglie, insoluble Objection, agaynst you, grounded on your owne Graunt, of lawfull Ordination by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I thinke, for mee, there

And if your Man, will haue it permitted vnto him, by Poeticall Licence, agaynst the <hi>LORD'S</hi> mynde, to wrest Scripture, and to intitle, thus, the Doctrine of Fayth: yet, why is it called <hi>Peter</hi>'s faith, more than <hi>Paul's, I am</hi>'s, or <hi>Iohn</hi>'s? And, why would not your Poet rather (according to Scripture speach) cal it the Faith of our <hi>LORD IESVS CHRIST?</hi> But, in what-so-ever sense,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2564:66"/>
giving him, that the Fall, or Standing of the Church, had depended, whollie, on the fayling, or stabilitie, of <hi>Peter's</hi> Fayth; could that Fayth, bee no other-wayes preserved, but in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> And, shall the fall of <hi>Rome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>Peter's</hi> Fayth, and, consequentlie, CHRIST'S Church, is fallen? To make this Conclusion infallible; your Man must bring a better Argument, than a vayne vaunt, of a bare personall Succession: while, in the tyme, they are fallen away from <hi>Peter's</hi> Fayth, to the fayth of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus.</hi>

                  <p>Nowe, to cleare this, by Accommodation: I say, That the <hi>BODIE,</hi> is the <hi>CATHOLICKE CHVRCH,</hi> in which are all sorts of Christians: the Evill in this Bodie, but not of it, is <hi>Haeresie, Antichristi anisme,</hi> or <hi>Papalitie.</hi> Now, as a much different, and distinct consideration, was put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Evill, considered in it selfe, and the partes of the Bodie, affected there-with: and, agayne, amongst affected parts, a great difference betwixt those, who yet retayne lyfe, and Motion, and are cureable; and others, who are dead, or consumed by the Disease: So, (<hi>Eriphilus</hi>) you must not confound <hi>PAPISTES,</hi> and <hi>PAPALITIE; ANA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAPTISTES,</hi> and <hi>ANABAPTISME; BROW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTES,</hi> and <hi>BROWNISME.</hi> GOD forbid, that wee judge so hardlie, as, because <hi>PAPALITIE, ANA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAPTISME, BROWNISME,</hi> &amp;c. are damnable, that, there-fore, all who are called, or professe them-selues <hi>PAPISTES, ANABAPTISTES, BROWNISTES,</hi> are damned. Because, all-bee-it affected, in some degrees, and even dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouselie sicke, of those Evils, yet they may haue the lyfe of the common Bodie; part-taking, thus, with the common Head, and bee curable, by the Purgation of GOD. How manie <hi>PAPISTES, ANABAPTISTES, BROW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTES,</hi> are there, who, not knowing the deepnesse of Satan's deceit, (where-with some of their Seducers, and manie al-so of their Companies, are infected deadlie, and diverted from all true lyfe) are, in simplicitie of Heart, miscarried, with glistering and plausible pretences, of the Church of Zeale, of Puritie, singular Holynesse, and such lyke; having yet, and, all-bee-it some-what affected, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the lyfe of GOD, and true Foundation? And, so, in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2564:69"/>
distinct considerations, are of one, and the same Companie, with all good Christians, and true Professours: and, yet, are not of one, and the same Companie. Because, al-bee-it one, in the common Bodie, and some measure of the common Lyfe, yet separated each from other: for keeping the cleane partes free, not from the others partes, but from the Evill, where-with they are affected; till GOD, by the Purgation of His Word, and Spirit cure them.</p>
                  <p>When wee dispute agaynst the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and deny her the Name, or Title of CHRIST's Church; wee meane the <hi>Papalitie,</hi> not all <hi>Papistes; Antichristianisme,</hi> not all, who, in simplicitie of Heart, are miscarried after it, (which no more justlie may be excluded, from the account of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, than those two hundreth Men, accounted Traytors,<note place="margin">2.

Neyther maketh this the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to bee the Church of CHRIST: because such <hi>Papistes,</hi> as are saved, are not saved by the destroying, and consuming Gangrene, where-with they are affected, and which fighteth agaynst the lyfe of GOD: but by the remnant of the lyfe of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, so farre, as yet, prevayling in them, that the evill hath not gotten force, to suffocate, or extinguish it. In which respect, they were, and are, of our Companie: as, in some measure, joyned to, and holding still, the same Head: al-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it each from other separated, eyther by an vnnecessarie wound, of turbulent Men, or, by a needefull disjunction: and (al-be-it not all in a-lyke measure of strength, and health) enjoying the Common Lyfe.

It is a grosse Sophistication, in your Men, what is true of the <hi>Catholicke Church,</hi> to conclude, that, properlie, of anie one part thereof: but, it is both grosse and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to conclude the Properties, and Priviledges, of the Bodie, of the inherent and consuming Gangrene in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but not of it.</p>

                  <p>VVithout the <hi>CATHOLICKE CHVRCH,</hi> it is moste true, that there can bee no Salvation, But, it were high praesumption, for the most pure worshipping Companie, in all that common Bodie, to confine, absolutelie, all Salvation, within their particular Societie: how-so-ever, Salvation, there, must bee moste assured, and lesse danger of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>And, it were an extreamlie ridiculous Clayme, If, in a Bodie, vvhich had beene over-gone, with a great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; and, yet, by the power of the Noble partes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning Integritie, had so farre recovered, that even the Dregges, and force of the Sicknesse, were fallen into the Legges, and Feete: If, there-fore, (I saye) the swol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Legges, and Feete, shoulde denye the rest of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and take all Priviledge there-of, to them-selues; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, they, for-sooth, kept still the Dregges of a long Disease.</p>

                  <p>And, still the <hi>CHVRCH</hi> lived the same Lyfe of GOD, all-though not, all-wayes, in a-lyke measure, and force.

                  <p>Wee are, nowe, come to our last poynt, and, as wee account, the moste choyse Shaft, in all our Quyver. Our Man's last part, of his Discourse, vpon this poynt of <hi>HAERETICKES,</hi> you reduced, (<hi>Eubulus</hi>) vnto this Syllogisme:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> thinges, affirmed by you, of your Churches, can not consist with the Promise of CHRIST, made to His <hi>CHVRCH,</hi> and her certayne Condition there-by: and, if you are forced, to acknowledge, of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that which is competent, onlie, to CHRIST His Church: then are your Churches <hi>Haereticall;</hi> and, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the Church of CHRIST.</p>

                  <p>There-of, graunting the Proposition, you denyed the Assumption; and, haue, accordinglie, done your best, to show it false, in this part, that anie thing is affirmed by you, of your Churches, where-with the Promise of CHRIST, can not consist. The other part of the Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, seemeth, yet, to stand strong: namelie, that you are forced, to confesse, that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which can not bee competent, but to the Church of CHRIST: and, there-fore, that the Conclusion, at least, for that part, is true: namelie, That <hi>The Church of ROME, is the Church of</hi> CHRIST. This poynt, confessed, by you, of <hi>Rome;</hi> and, which can bee competent, to none other Companie, but to CHRIST His Church, is the lawfull Ordination of Pastours; as you, your selfe, did, before, verie formallie, take vp, in this Syllogisme:</p>

               <p>To giue lawfull Ordination, to Pastours, is competent, onlie, to the Church of CHRIST.</p>

                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:2564:73"/>There-fore, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was the Church of CHRIST. And, consequentlie, <hi>Protestantes</hi> are <hi>Haeretickes,</hi> who haue forsaken her communion.</p>

                  <p>Then, will I, as clearlie, vnfolde to you, the<note place="margin">XLI.</note> manyfolde Deceit there-of. For, first, his whole Argument, is a beguiling Sophisme; <hi>à communi indiviso,</hi> as the Schooles speake; to bee a separate parte in the Communitie. And, to cleare this, I will, orderlie, goe thorowe the partes of his Syllogisme. You haue to advert, the deceit of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: For, that lawfull Ordination of Pastoures, is competent, to no Companie, or Bodie, but to the Church of CHRIST; it is moste certayne. For, the Orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Pastoures, must, of necessitie, haue outward law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Place, and power, in the visible <hi>CHVRCH:</hi> in which, except they, both were, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>uld bee no lawfull Ordayners at all. Nowe, because that Bodie, in common, in which all lawfull Ordayners are, and must bee, is, vndoubtedlie, the Church of CHRIST: there-vpon, to insinuate, that all, or moste parte, of Ordayners, in this Bodie, are of it: and, though lawfull Pastoures, yet, eyther true Pastoures, or Christians, it is a Sophisticall Deceit, <hi>à communi indiviso,</hi> as I haue sayde. And, vpon your Man's Proposition, thus, rightlie vnderstood, and, as it can onlie bee admitted, to bee true; when you haue assumed, that, Ordination, given by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was lawfull Ordination: yet, shall you
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2564:74"/>
never bee able to conclude more, heere-vpon, than, <hi>That the Church of Rome, is in the CHVRCH, and common Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> Where-by it was, (before visible Separation vvas made, from that Contagion, in, but not of the Bodie, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commandement, to the VVitnesses, to <hi>Come vp, hither</hi>) that Ordination given by the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi>

And, that, which, a little before, I aunswered to your Man's Question, (<hi>Were all damned, aeternallie, Who were not of your Companie?</hi>) may cleare to you the infolded Fallacie of this your Man's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position also.

                  <p>Nowe, vpon that, which is proper, and competent, to the whole Bodie; and, there-fore, rightlie propounded of the Bodie, in common: and, which, all-so, is rightlie assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not onlie of partes of the Bodie, (because, of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:) but, even, of the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Shall the Sore, in the Bodie, appropriate, there-fore, to it selfe; or, glorie of the naturall, and liuelie Actions of the Bodie, because it is in the Bodie; yea, and hath even over-gone the Bodie, in common? A man hath the Goare, in his Legge: which Legge, all-bee-it, in an hudge degree, festered; yet, walketh, and mooveth, through the remnant of living, and mooving power, which it yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth. Nowe, shall the Goare, heere, glorie, that, by it, the Legge walketh, and mooveth; vvhere-as, it is, by it, that the Legge creapeleth, and halteth?</p>
                  <p>Lawfull Ordination, is a good, yea, and proper Action, of the Church of CHRIST: not of the Goare, or for the Goare, which is in the Church, and stayneth it: but,

through the Lyfe, and Power of the Head, yet remayning in the Bodie, al-be-it affected, and having divers Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, even corrupted, with the Sore. <hi>Papalitie,</hi> is the Goare in the Church, but not of it: of which, to conclude, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Actions of the Church, because it hath place there-in; and there-vpon, farther, to conclude, of it, the Title of the Church, and Bodie, whose, properlie, the Actions are; it is but a fraudulent Illuding. Neyther, because lawfull Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, is a proper Action of the Church of CHRIST, will it, there-fore follow, That who ever giue lawfull Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, are of the Church, how-so-ever they must bee in it. For, as I haue, else-where, evinced, clearlie, lawfull Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, may bee taken from a Wolfe, and Thiefe, who, as yet, still retayneth outward Place, and Power of orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

                        </gap>
                     </hi>) if your Man's Proposition, bee vnderstood so, as, that, where ever lawfull Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pastours were, that Bodie, (considered whollie) behooved to bee the Church of CHRIST, I yeeld it to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> true: but, if hee, fraudfullie, would insinuate, That all with-in that Bodie, who gaue Ordination, were the Church, or of the Church of CHRIST, then is his Proposition deceitfullie false; and hee concludeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Now, let vs see his Assumption. (<hi>But, the Protestants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, That Ordination, given by the Church of Rome, was Lawfull Ordination</hi>) This Assumption, as it may bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, in an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e of two diverse Senses; so, I must, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, answere it. For, first: if by the name of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> bee vnderstood, the common Bodie of the visible Church, al-be-it, at that tyme, affected, so farre, even in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, with that Antichristian Sore, as by Fraude, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall Vsurpation, the Name or Number of the Beast, sitting there-in, were imposed: al-be-it numbers, there-in, never received his character; I grant his assumption <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> bee true: but, where-on, hee shall conclude nothing, eyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst vs: or for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as wee oppugne her.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2564:75"/>
For, wee never pleaded agaynst the Bodie; neyther haue wee ever separated our selues from the Bodie, as your Men would fayne bynde vpon vs: but, wee pleade agaynst <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie,</hi> in the Bodie; and, haue separated our selues, from the Sore, and such deadlie contagious parts, as are infectiue, and incurable: offering, still, the purging Medicine of GOD HIS Word, for the cure, and Health, of all affected Members, who will admit Physicke; and, for destroying of the annoying, and eating Evill: praying GOD, heartilie, for the perfect convalescing of the whole Bodie. And, the Sore, is still more than ridiculous to oppone, for defence of it selfe, the actions, or properties, of the Bodie, where-in it is: for, with-in that Bodie, even affected, in common, and bearing the name or number of the <hi>Beast,</hi> were, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, numbers, of not onlie lawfull, but, also, true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, to giue Ordination. For, a sicke Bodie, is still a true, and living Bodie: but, the Sicknesse, in it, is no part of it, and is Enemie to the Lyfe there-of. Next, agayne, if, by the name of the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi> your Poet vnderstand, even the <hi>Papalitie,</hi> or characterized <hi>Papistes:</hi> that is, the incurable parts, deadlie festered with the Sore, (which onlie wee impugne:) then, al-be-it not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, yet, in some respect, wee grant, the Ordination, even so given, to haue beene lawfull: namelie, so long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned outward Place, and Power of Ordination; before <hi>Antichrist's</hi> full detection, and separation of the revived Witnesses, from the contagious Companie. Because, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be-it the Ordayners were <hi>Wolues,</hi> and <hi>Thieues,</hi> yet they were not, in common, knowne to bee so: but, retayned still, with all, in common, the reputation, if not of true, yet, of lawfull Pastours. In which case, the receiving of Ordination, from them, was nothing praejudiciall to the sincere Receiver of the same, who had not, as yet, espyed them to be Traytors. And, this Lawfulnesse was not, because it was ministred by the Sore, or deadlie festered parts in the Bodie: but, because those festered parts were still in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Church, and, in common, all-so, esteemed to bee
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2564:75"/>
of it: and, al-be-it dead, incurable, and contagious, yet were not cut off, outwardlie, from the Bodie: thus, retayning, still, the account of Members; al-be-it, in effect, they were none, but a deadlie consuming Evill.</p>
                  <p>If your Poet, poore Man, had eyther vnderstoode, or considered, what, I thinke, I haue, playnlie, layde before you: if hee had not beene, first, a verie shallowe Ignorant, and vnstable <hi>PROTESTANT;</hi> and, now, (I warrand you) no profound <hi>PAPIST:</hi> howe could this haue, so much, stupified him, and casten him into such a Musing; that, in the <hi>REFORMATION</hi> of the <hi>CHVRCH,</hi> wee made no question, to receiue, and vse, the <hi>MINI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRIE,</hi> of <hi>PRIESTES,</hi> ordayned by the <hi>CHVRCH,</hi> which hee calleth <hi>ROMANE?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, as the Bodie, all-bee-it affected, yet was the Bodie: So, the Calling of the <hi>MINISTERS</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, all-bee-it taynted, and corrupted, in common, yet, was a <hi>CALLING;</hi> and, that, according vnto the state, and tyme, lawfull.</p>
                  <p>And, your Poet his Muzing, hath, heere-in, so mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Memorie; that, forgetting what they moste ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject agaynst vs; hee yeeldeth vs, heere-by, that our <hi>PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STOVRES,</hi> and <hi>REFORMERS,</hi> had an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Vocation.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, as I haue opened, the implyed Deceit, of your Poet his Proposition, and Assumption, you may see, (<hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomathes</hi>) what Conclusion hee can bee able to builde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon; eyther for the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi> not-with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing anie Confession of ours; or, yet, agaynst vs.</p>
                  <p>And, this, for-sooth, is the Argument, where-of all your Men, so much glorie, as, they doe entitle it, their <hi>IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINCIBLE ARGVMENT:</hi> and, where-in your Poet hath so much pleased him-selfe, that hee hath reserved it, for his last Blowe: and, falleth, even for to muze, what wee can bee able to answere there-vnto: and, is so secure, of getting none Answere from vs, as, hee is content, to set this, to all his <hi>Disciples,</hi> for a terme of adhering to the <hi>Romish Faith:</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:2564:76"/>
till wee, for-sooth, finde out an Aunswere there-vnto.

So, as, verilie, the longer, the more, I am induced, to thinke, and see, that it is a good, yea, a necessarie thing, for Christians, to bee humblie, and prudentlie carefull; in prooving, and trying, what they doe holde, in Matters of Fayth; where-in Men stand, in no lesse hazard, than of missing of, or hitting on, the right Way of Salvation.</p>

                  <p>I am so farre from your Temper, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (<hi>Philomathes</hi>) as, by the playne contrarie, I thinke, wee haue badlie bestowed this Day: where-in, with great indignation of Heart, I haue beene forced, to heare the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Church, disdaynfullie mocked, and bitterlie rayled vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So, as I, both blame my selfe greatlie, for casting in anie such purpose, and you, al-so, for so curiouslie insisting there-in. And, by this Dayes experience, I perceiue, well, how just reason our Holie Fathers haue, to interdict <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes,</hi> absolutelie, of all; eyther hearing of these <hi>Heretickes,</hi> or conference with them, or reading of their Bookes: and, that how-so-ever, some coole-mynded Men, can not brooke it, thereis great reason, of ridding away, and dispatching, out of the Worlde, even by all meanes, of such pestilent and pernicious Men: vvho, except they bee quyte ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed out, will not fayle, to subvert the whole state of

the World. For, I see, (<hi>Philomathes</hi>) that, by your giving Eare, to their charming Speaches, you are, all-readie, put in the Stayes; yea, halfe over-turned. For me, when-so-ever I heare ought of them, to which I can not make Aunswere; I, then, make the Signe of the Crosse, over my Person; and, I turne myne Heart, and Eares, another way. So, as, let them speake, wryte, or preach, what they please, (how true, playne, and infallible, so-ever, it appeare;) yet, I determine, with my selfe, That it is false: and, I rest, vpon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of holie Church; whose Doctrine, I count it sinne, once to put in question.</p>

                  <p>Agaynst an vndoubted Light, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie convincing Trueth, it were, in-deede, high sinne, once to deliberate: much more, curiouslie, or carnallie, to make question. But, for attayning to Knowledge, and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in doubtfull Matters; to enquire humblie, soberlie, and sincerelie; wee not onelie well may, but, all-so, are, of due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, holden. And, who, without Light, are carried, vpon anie Man's Credite, in Matters of Salvation; I thinke, they more resemble senselesse Blockes, than wyse Christians.</p>
                  <p>As for your other Opinion, (of ridding away, out of the Worlde, by what-so-ever meanes, those you call <hi>Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes</hi>) I am sorie to heare it of you: and, so much the more, if you haue vttered it, not onelie out of Passion; but, all-so, out of a setled judgement.

                  <p>And, it will bee, assuredlie, seene, (<hi>Eriphilus</hi>) that this Tragicall, and bloodie Wisedome, (where-by Men, nowe, are begun to thinke, that the Catholicke Fayth, must bee mayntayned) shall bee the Meane, to hasten the Ruine of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church: vvhyle all the Worlde shall bee wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, by their owne Perill, and cleare Sight, of such
