         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in every <hi>Faithful Minister</hi>
of Christ, which engageth them to

the blessed Souls in Glory with Christ, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions

of Souls in Hell, who came thither by the

16. 25.</hi> And how they spent the Day of their
Visitation, and how light they once set by God, by
Christ, by Heaven, by Mercy, whilest Mercy
was an earnest solicitour for their Hearts: And
with our bodily eyes we see at the same time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of poor sinners living about us, as if there
were no God, no Christ, no Heaven, no Hell, no
Iudgment, no nor Death to be expected; as if a
man were but a master beact, to rule the rest, and
feed upon them, and perish with them. And if
it were your own case, to see what Souls do in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Hell, and at once to see how unbelievingly,
carelesly and senselesly most men live on earth, as if
there were no such difference in another World,
would it not seem a pittiful sight to you? If you
had once seen the five Brethren of <hi>Dives</hi> on Earth,
eating, drinking, laughing and merry, cloathed and
faring daily with the best, and at the same time
seen their Brothers Soul in Hell, begging in vain
for a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase, and wishing in vain that
one from the dead might go warn his Brethren,
that they come not to that place of Torment, would
it not seem to you a pittiful sight? would not pity
have made you think, <hi>[Is there no way to open
these Gentlemens eyes? No way to acquaint

where</hi> Lazarus <hi>is, and whither they themselves
<pb facs="tcp:43891:3"/>
are going? No one driveth or forceth them to
Hell, and will they go thither of themselves?
and is there no way to stop them or keep them
back?]</hi> Did you but see your selves what we see
by faith (believing God) and at once beheld the
Saints in Heaven, the lost despairing Souls in Hell,
and the sensless sensual sinners on earth, that yet
will lay none of this to heart, sure it would make
you wonder at the stupidity of mankind. Would
you not say, O what a deceiver is the Devil that can
thus lead on souls to their own damnation? Oh
what a cheater is this transitory World, that can
make men so forget the World where they must live
for ever! O what an enemy is this flesh, that thus
draweth down mens Souls from God! O what a
besotting thing is sin that turneth a reasonable soul
into worse than a beast! what a bedlam is this
wicked world, when thousands are so busily labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

would give them everlasting blessed life.</p>
            <p>And as we have such a sight as this by Faith to
make us pity you, so have we so much <hi>taste</hi> of the
<hi>goodness</hi> of God, the <hi>sweetness</hi> of his ways,
and the <hi>happiness</hi> of believers, as must needs
make us wish that you had but once tried the same
delights, which would turn the pleasures of sin into
detestation. God knoweth that we desire nothing more
for <hi>our selves,</hi> than the <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi>
of this <hi>Holiness and Happiness</hi> which we <hi>believe
and taste.</hi> And should we not desire the same for you?</p>
            <p>And being thus moved with necessary pity, we
ask of God, what he would have us to do for your
Salvation. And he hath told us in Scripture that
the preaching of his Gospel, to acquaint you plainly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the truth, and earnestly and frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to turn from the Flesh and World to God
by Iesus Christ, is the means with which his grace
is ready to concur for your Salvation; when obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
resistance causeth the Holy Spirit to forsake
the Sinner and leave him to himself, to follow his
own Counsels, Lusts and Wills.</p>
            <p>In this hope we undertook the Sacred Ministry,
and gave up our selves to this great and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
work: in the great sense of our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but yet in the sense of your Souls Necessity.
We were not such Fools at our first setting out, as
not to know it muct be a life of labour, self-denyal
and patience, and the Devil would do his worst to
hinder us, and that all sorts of his instruments
would be ready to serve him against our Labours,
and against your Souls. <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Captain</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

no strange thing to <hi>Paul</hi> that bonds and afflictions
did every where abide him, nor did he account his
life dear that he might finish his course with joy,
and the Ministry committed to him by the Lord,
<hi>Acts 20. 23, 24.</hi> It was no strange thing to
him to be <hi>forbidden to preach to the Gentiles

came, both high and low, were against the Apostles
preaching of the Gospel, and yet they would not
sacrilegiously and cruelly break their Covenant with

the Gospel, at the will of Satan, that is for the
everlasting <hi>suffering</hi> of <hi>your souls,</hi> under the

you may be converted and saved? If we be herein
besides our selves, it is for you. Could the words
of the ignorant or proud, have perswaded us, that

or your other supplies and helps sufficient,
that our labours had been unnecessary to you, God
knoweth we should have readily obeyed the <hi>silencing

land where our service had been more necessary.
Let shame be the hypocrites reward, who taketh not
the saving of souls, and the pleasing of God, for a

It is God and you <hi>sinners</hi> that next must tell us
what our entertainment and success shall be. Shall
it be still neglect, and unthankful contempt, and
turning away your ear and heart, and saying, we
have somewhat else to mind? Will you still be
cheated by this deceiving World? And spend all
your days in pampering your guts, and providing
for your flesh that must lie rotting very shortly
in a Grave? Were you made for no better work than
this? May not we bring you to some sober thoughts
of your condition, nor one hour seriously to think
whither you are going? What! not to <hi>one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened

so despised. Let not your God, your Saviour, and
your souls be set so light by. O let there be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane

            <p>Poor sinners! We talk not to you as on a stage,
in customary words, and because that talking thus
is our trade. We are in as good earnest with you
as if we saw you all murdering your selves, and
we are perswading you to save your lives. Can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man be in jest with you who believeth God?
who by Faith foreseeth whither you are going, and
what you lose, and where the game of sin will end?
It is little better to jest with you now in Pulpit or
in private, than to stand jesting over your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
souls, when at death you are breathing out your

            <p>Alas, with shame and grief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we do confess,
<pb facs="tcp:43891:5"/>
that we never, speak to you of these things as their
truth and weight deserve, nor with the skill and
wisdom, the affection and fervency which beseemeth
men engaged in the saving of poor souls. But yet
you may perceive that we are in good sadness with
you. (For God is so.) What else do we study for,
labour for, suffer for, live for? Why else do we so
much trouble our selves, and trouble you with all this
ado, and anger them that would have had us silent?
For my own part, I will make my free Confession to
you to my shame: that I never grow cold and dull
and pittiless to the Souls of others, till I first grow
too cold and careless of my own (unless when <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
or <hi>speculative studies</hi> cool me, which I must
confess they often do.) We never cease pittying you,
till we are growing too like you, and so have need of
pity our selves.</p>
            <p>When through the mercy of my Lord, the prospect
of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ful operation on my self. O then I could
spend and be spent for others. No words are too
earnest, no labour too great, no cost too dear, the
frowns and wrath of malignant opposers of the
preaching of Christs Gospel are nothing to me.
But when the World of Spirits do disappear, or my
Soul is clouded, and receiveth not the <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

influences of Heaven, I grow cold first to
my self, and then to others.</p>
            <p>Come then poor sinners, and help us who are
willing at any rate to be your helpers. As we first
crave Gods help, so we next crave yours. Help us,
for we cannot save you against your wills, nor save
you without your consent and help. God himself
will not save you without you; and how should we?
know that the Devil is against us, and will do
<pb facs="tcp:43891:6"/>
his worst to hinder us; and so will all his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
by what names or titles soever dignified or
distinguished. But all this is nothing, if you will
but take our parts your selves: I mean if you will
take Christs part, and your own, and will not be
against your selves. Men and Devils cannot either
help or hinder us in saving you as you may do your
selves. If <hi>God</hi> and <hi>you</hi> be for us, who shall be
against us?</p>
            <p>And if <hi>you will help us,</hi> give over striving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, and Conscience, give over fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ and his Spirit: take part no more
with the World and the flesh which in your Baptism
you renounced: set your hearts to the message
which we bring you. Allow it your <hi>manlike so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thoughts;</hi> search the Scriptures, and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the things which we speak be so or no. We offer
you nothing but what we have resolvedly c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>en our
selves: and that after the most serious d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ation
that we can make. We have many a tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> looked
round about us, to know what is the happiness of
man: And had we found better for <hi>our selves,</hi>
we had offered better to <hi>you.</hi> If the World would
have served <hi>our turns,</hi> it should have served yours
also; and we would not have troubled you with
the talk of <hi>another world;</hi> but it will not; I
am sure it will not serve your turns, to make you
happy, nor shall you long make that sorry self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
shift with it as now you do.</p>
            <p>But if you will not <hi>think</hi> of these things; if
you will not use the reason of men, alas what can
we do to save your souls? O pity them Lord, that
they may pity themselves. Have mercy on them,
that they may have some more mercy on themselves.
Help them that they may help themselves and

us. If you still r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fuse, will not <hi>your</hi> loss be more
than <hi>ours:</hi> If we lose our Labour (which to our
selves we shall not;) if we lose our hopes of your
Salvation: what is this to your everlasting loss of
Salvation it self? And what is our suffering for
your sakes, in comparison of your endless suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>But, O, this is it that breaketh our hearts, that
we leave you under more guilt than we found
you; and when we have laid out life and labour to
save you, the impenitent souls must have their pains
increased, for the refusing of these Calls. And
that it will be part of your Hell, to think for ever
how madly you refused our Counsel, and what
pains and cost and patience were used to have saved
you, and all in vain. It will be so: it must needs
be so: Christ saith <hi>it shall be easier for Sodom
and Gomorrah in the day of Judgment than
for the</hi> rejectors of his Gospel-calls. The Nature
of the <hi>thing,</hi> and the nature of <hi>Justice</hi> certainly
tell you, that it must be so.</p>
            <p>O turn not our complaints to God against you:
Turn us not from beseeching you to be reconciled to
God, to tell him you will not be reconciled. Force
us not to say, that we earnestly invited you to the
Heavenly Feast, and you would not come. Force
us not to bear this Witness against you, <hi>Lord, we
could have born all our labour and sufferings for
them, much easilier, if they would but have
yielded to thy grace. But it was they themselves
that broke our hearts, that lost our labour, that
made us preach and intreat in vain: It was
easier to preach without maintenance, than
without success. It was they that were worse
to us than all the Persecutors in the World.
<pb facs="tcp:43891:7"/>
How oft would we have gathered them, but
they would not, but are ungathered still?</hi> How
many Holy, Faithful Ministers have I known these
eleven years last past, who have lived in pining po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and want, and hardly by Charity got Bread
and Clothing; and yet if they could but have truly
said [Lord the Sermons, which I preach private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in danger, have won many Souls to thee] it
would have made all this burden easie. But I tell
thee sensless and impenitent Sinner, thou that deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst
God thy Heart, and thou that deniedst them
thy Conversion, which was the end of all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
hast dealt much more cruelly with them, than
they that denyed the <hi>Levites</hi> Bread.</p>
            <p>Poor Sinners! I know that I am speaking all this
to those that are <hi>dead in sin:</hi> but it is a <hi>death</hi>
consisting with a <hi>natural life,</hi> which hath a <hi>capacity</hi>
of <hi>spiritual life:</hi> Or else I would no more speak to
you than to a stone. And I know that you are <hi>blind</hi>
in sin: but it is a <hi>blindness</hi> consisting with a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
faculty, which is capable of spiritual
<hi>illumination:</hi> Or else I would no more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you than I would do a beast. And I know
that you are in the fetters of your own lusts: your
<hi>wills,</hi> your <hi>love,</hi> your <hi>hearts</hi> are turned away from
God, and strongly bewitched with the dreams and
dalliances with the flesh and world: But your wills
are not <hi>forced</hi> to this Captivity: Surely those
<hi>wills</hi> may be changed by Gods Grace, when you
clearly see sufficient reason for to change them:
Else I would as soon preach (were I capable) to
Devils and damned souls. Your case is not yet des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
O make it not desperate: There is just the
same hope of your <hi>Salvation</hi> as there is of your
<hi>Conversion</hi> and <hi>perseverance,</hi> and no more.
<pb facs="tcp:43891:7"/>
Without it there is no hope: and with it you are
safe, and have no cause to doubt and fear. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
may be yet yours if <hi>you will.</hi> Nothing but
your own Wills, refusing Christ and a holy life, can
keep you out. And shall that do it? Shall Hell
be your own choice? And <hi>will</hi> you, I say <hi>will</hi> you
not be saved.</p>
            <p>O think better what you do! Gods terms are
reasonable: His Word and Ways are <hi>good</hi> and
<hi>equal:</hi> Christ's Yoke is easie and his Burden light,
and his Commandments are not grievous to any, but
so far as blindness and a bad and backward heart
doth make them so. You have no true reason to be
<hi>unwilling:</hi> God and Conscience shall one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you and all the World that you had no reason for it.
You may as wisely pretend reason to cut your throats,
to torment your selves, as plead reason against a
true Conversion unto God. Were I perswading you
not to kill your selves, I would make no question,
but you would be perswaded. And yet must I be
hopeless when I perswade you from everlasting mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and not to prefer the world and flesh before your
Saviour and your God, and before a sure everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joy? God forbid!</p>
            <p>Reader, I take it for a great mercy of God, that
before my head lyeth down in the duct, and I go to
give up my account unto my Iudge, I have this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
once more, earnestly to bespeak thee for
thy own Salvation. I beg it of thee, as one that must
shortly be called away, and speak to thee no more,
till we come unto our endless state, that thou
wouldst but sometimes retire into thy self, and use
the reason of a man, and look <hi>before</hi> thee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou art going; and look behind thee how thou
hast lived, and what thou hast been doing in the
<pb facs="tcp:43891:8"/>
World till now; and look <hi>within</hi> thee, what a case
thy soul is in, and whether it be ready to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Eternity, and look <hi>above</hi> thee what a Heaven
of Glory thou dost neglect, and what a <hi>God</hi> thou
hast to be thine everlasting <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Enemy,</hi> as
thou <hi>choosest</hi> and as thou <hi>livest,</hi> and that thou art
always in his sight: <hi>Yea</hi> and look <hi>below thee,</hi>
and think where they are, that died unconverted.
And when thou hast soberly thought of all these
things, then do as <hi>God</hi> and true <hi>Reason</hi> shall direct
thee. And is this an unreasonable request? I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to God, and to all Wise Men, and to thy own
Conscience when it shall be awakened. If I speak
<hi>against thee,</hi> or if all this be not for <hi>thy good,</hi> or
if it be not <hi>true</hi> and <hi>sure,</hi> then regard not what I
say: If I speak not that message which God hath
commanded his Ministers to speak, then let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
as contemptuously as thou wilt. But if I do but
in Christs name and stead, beseech thee to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to God, 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. refuse it at thy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril:
And if Gods beseeching thee shall not prevail
against thy sloath, thy lust, thy appetite, against the
desires of thy flesh, against the dust and shadows of
the World, remember it when with fruitless cries
and horrour, thou art <hi>beseeching him</hi> too late.</p>
            <p>I know, poor Sinner, that <hi>Flesh</hi> is bruitish, and
lust and appetite have no reason: But I know that
<hi>thou</hi> hast reason thy self which was given thee to
over-rule them; and that he that will not be a
<hi>Man</hi> cannot be a <hi>Saint,</hi> nor a <hi>Happy man.</hi> I
know that thou livest in a <hi>tempting</hi> and a <hi>wicked</hi>
world, where <hi>things</hi> or <hi>persons</hi> will be daily hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
this. But I know that this is no more to
a man, that by <hi>Faith</hi> seeth <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> before
him, than a Grain of Sand is to a Kingdom, or a
<pb facs="tcp:43891:8"/>
blast of Wind, to one that is fighting or flying for
his life, <hi>Luke 12. 4.</hi> O man! that thou didst
but know the difference between that which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and sin will give thee, if thou wilt sell thy soul
and Heaven, and that which God hath promised
and sworn to give thee, if thou wilt heartily give
up thy self to him.</p>
            <p>I know that thou maist possibly fall into Company
(at least among some sots and drunkards) that will
tell thee, all this is but troublesome preciseness, and
making more ado than needs: But I know withal
what that Man deserveth, who will believe a Fool
before his Maker: (for he can be no better than a
Miserable Fool, that will contradict and revile the
Word of God, even the Word of Grace that would
save Mens Souls.)</p>
            <p>And, alas, it is possible thou maist hear some
of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> (or rather of <hi>Cain,</hi>) deriding
this <hi>Serious Godliness</hi> as meer <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and
<hi>Fanaticism,</hi> and <hi>Self-conceitedness:</hi> As if you
must <hi>be no better</hi> than the Devils slaves, lest you
be <hi>Proud</hi> in <hi>thinking</hi> that you are <hi>better than
they;</hi> That is, you must go with them to Hell,
lest in Heaven you be <hi>Proud Hypocrites</hi> for <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
your selves <hi>happier</hi> than they.</p>
            <p>It may be they will tell you, that this talk of
<hi>Conversion</hi> is fitter for <hi>Pagans</hi> and Infidels to
hear, than Christians and Protestants. Because
such mens big Looks or Coats may make the poyson
the easilier taken down, I will intreat thee but as
before God to answer these following questions, or
to get them answered, and then judge whether it
be <hi>they or we</hi> that would deceive thee? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as men use to talk against <hi>Learning</hi> that have

state where he must be for ever, than of that where
he must be for a little while, and from whence he
is posting day and night. And whether it be not
wiser to lay up our treasure where we must stay,
than where we must not stay, but daily look to be
called away and never more to be seen on earth?

               </gap>the Mint &amp; Cummin, while love mercy, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

of Ceremonies and built the Tombs, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the Sepulchers of the Saints; while they kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and persecuted those that did imitate them, and
hated the living Saints, and honoured the dead.
They were the bitterest enemies and murderers of
Christ, on pretence that he was a blasphemer, and
<pb facs="tcp:43891:11"/>
a seditious enemy to <hi>Caesar</hi> and the common peace,
and one that spake against the Temple: They were
the greatest Enemies of the Apostles. And silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of those that preached Christs Gospel, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
them that called on his name. And had
these no need of <hi>Conversion,</hi> because they could
say, God is our Father (when the Devil was their
Father, <hi>Joh. 8. 44.</hi>) and that they were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>

               <hi>Quest. 16.</hi> Doth not the <hi>Holy</hi> State of Heaven
require Holiness in all that shall possess it? Can
an unholy soul there <hi>see</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> and

the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>World?</hi> Is not the Church a
holy Society of regenerate souls? Yea the <hi>Church</hi>
visible, is only those that in baptism <hi>vow Holiness</hi>
and <hi>profess</hi> it. Look those hypocrites in the face
and see whether they do not blush, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
in the Creed, <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghost,
I believe in the Holy Catholick Church, and
the communion of Saints,</hi> who shall have the
<hi>forgiveness of sins, and live ever-lasting.</hi> Ask
them whether they mean, <hi>Holy Adulterers, holy
<pb facs="tcp:43891:12"/>
worldlings, holy perjured persons?</hi> Ask them
whether they mean a <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> in a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or a jesting, canting stage-play Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?
If the Church <hi>be holy,</hi> be holy if you
will be of the Church: If it be a Communion of
Saints, make it not a Communion of Swine, and
make not Saints and their Communion seem odious
either for their infirmities, or their crossness to your
carnal interests or conceits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. 18.</hi> Ask them whether there be a
<hi>Heaven</hi> and a <hi>Hell,</hi> or not? If not, why are
they pretended Christians? If there be, will God
send one man to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and another to <hi>Hell,</hi> to
so vast, so amazing a difference of states, if there
be no great difference between them here? If <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi>
no more differenced Christians from others,
than <hi>saying a Sermon,</hi> or <hi>saying over a Prayer,</hi>
doth difference one from an Infidel, where were the
<hi>Justice of God</hi> in saving some and damning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
and what were <hi>Christianity</hi> better than
the Religion of <hi>Antonine, Plato, Socrates, Seneca,
Cicero, Plutarch,</hi> if not much worse? Go into

<hi>living prudent men,</hi> then go to the <hi>Painters</hi> shop
and see a <hi>comely picture,</hi> and to the <hi>Looking</hi>-glass
and see the <hi>appearances</hi> of each passenger in
a Glass, and to the Periwig-shops, and set a
<hi>wodden-head with a periwig</hi> upon the Bulk,
and you have seen somewhat like the difference of a
<hi>Holy Soul,</hi> and of a <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>dressed formal
hypocrite, Psal. 23. 27.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. 19.</hi> Ask them whether <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>all
men</hi> make not a great difference between man and
<pb facs="tcp:43891:12"/>
man; the loyal and perfidious, the obedient
and the disobedient? And whether they difference
not themselves between a friend and a soe, one that
loveth them, and one that robbeth, beateth, or would
kill them. And shall not the most Holy God more
difference between the righteous and the wicked?
<hi>Mal. 3. 17, 18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. 20.</hi> But if they are deaed in every point
save carnal interests, ask them why they are <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>
or <hi>Priests?</hi> And if Conversion and holiness
be a needless thing, what use they themselves are of?
and why the Country must be troubled with them,
and pay them Tythes, and owe them reverence?
When these twenty Questions are well answered,
conclude that you may be saved without Conversion.</p>
            <p>But if poor soul, thou art fully convinced, and
askest, <hi>What should I do to be Converted?</hi> The

Lord in thee have we trusted, Let us never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
            <p>Having thus contributed my endeavour in this
Preface to the furtherance of the design of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Book. I must tell thee, Reader, that I take it
for an honour to commend so masculine a birth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World: The Midwife of <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
need not be ashamed of her office. Who the
Author of this Treatise was, how h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> preached, how
he lived, how he suffered (and for what) and how
he died, his Life and Letters lately printed fully
tell you: and I earnestly commend the reading of
them to all, but especially to Ministers, not to
tell them what men have been here forbidden to
preach Christs Gospel, and for what, nor what men
they are that so many years have done it: but to
tell you what men Christ's Ministers should be:
But say not he kill'd himself with excessive Labour,
<pb facs="tcp:43891:13"/>
and therefore I will take warning, and take my ease.
For, 1. He lived in perfect health all his days, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his labours, till after his hard and
long imprisonment. 2. It was not the greatest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of his times of liberty that hurt him, but his
preaching 6 or 7 or 8 times a weak after that he
was silenced, because he could not speak to all his
people at once. O make not an ill use of so excellent
an example. Say not like <hi>Judas, what needs this
waste?</hi> His labour, his life, his sufferings, his
death were not in vain. The ages to come that read
his Life, and read this little popular treatise, and
his <hi>Call to Archippus</hi> shall say, they were not in
vain. And though he was cut off in the midst of
his age, and his longer labours, and more elaborate
writings thus prevented, take thank fully this small
but methodical, warm, and serious tractate: Read
it seriously, and it cannot be but it must do thee
good.</p>
            <p>I am one that have lookt into Books and Sciences,
and Speculations of many sorts, and seriously tell
thee as a dying man, that after all my searches and
experience, I have found that <hi>Philosophical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries</hi>
into the <hi>Divine Artifices</hi> and the <hi>Nature
of things,</hi> hath among a greater number of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
a great many pretty pleasant probabilities,
which a holy Soul can make good use of in admiring
God, and may find us a lawful kind of sport; but in
the moralities which Atheists count uncertainties,
the <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> and <hi>our duty,</hi> and <hi>our
hopes,</hi> the <hi>doctrine and practice</hi> of <hi>Holiness,
Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and the
<hi>diligent seeking</hi> and <hi>joyful hopes of life everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
is all the true <hi>Wisdom,</hi> the <hi>goodness,</hi> the <hi>Rest</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:43891:14"/>
and <hi>Comfort</hi> of a soul: whatever be our <hi>plea,</hi>
this is the <hi>satisfying certainty,</hi> the <hi>Business,</hi> and
the <hi>beautifying</hi> improvement of our lives.</p>
            <p>I have done, when I have sought to remove a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
scandal, which I foresaw; that I should my
self write the Preface to his life, where himself
and two of his friends make such a mention of my
name, which I cannot own; which will seem a
praising him for praising me. I confess it looketh
ill favouredly in me: But I had not the power of
other mens writings, and durst not therefore forbear
that which was his due. Had I directed their
pens they should have gone a middle way, and only
esteemed me [a very unworthy servant of Christ,
who yet longs to see the peace and prosperity of his
Church] and should have forborn their undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
praise, as other men should have done their
slanderous libels. But if the Reader get no harm by
it, I assure him the use I made of it was, to lament
that I am really <hi>so much worse</hi> than they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me; and fear lest I should prove yet <hi>worse
than</hi> I discern my self, who see so much sin and
weakness, in my betters, and much more in my self, as
to make it the <hi>constant sentiment</hi> of my soul, that
PRIDE of mens GREATNESS, WISDOM,
and GOODNESS, is the first part of the DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILS
IMAGE on mans soul, and DARK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS
is the second, and MALIGNITY the
third.</p>

            <p>HOW well were it if there were no
more Unconverted ones among us,
than those to whom this is directed?
Unconverted <hi>persons</hi> how many are
there, but how few Unconverted <hi>Readers</hi>
especially of such Books as this before
thee? A Play or a Romance better suits
the lusts, and therefore must have more
of the eye of such; what will <hi>cherish</hi> the
evil heart is only grateful, not what will
<hi>change</hi> it.</p>
            <p>How many are there to whom this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
who will not know, that <hi>they are
the men?</hi> and how little hope is there that
this <hi>Excellent Treatise</hi> should reach its
end, with those who apprehend not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
concern'd in it? Art not thou one of
them? Art thou a Convert, or art thou
yet in thy Sins? What is Sin? What is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version?
It may be, thou canst tell me
neither, and yet a Convert thou sayst thou
art. But to what purpose is it then like to
be, for the Servant of God to treat with
thee about this matter? Let him bid thee
believe, thou art a believer already; let
him bid thee repent and turn to the Lord,
that work thou sayst is not now to do. What
<pb facs="tcp:43891:15"/>
can there be said to this man, that's like to

               </gap>ing him to good? Friend, know thy self
better, or thou perishest without remedy.
Thou maist pray, but what hope is there in
thy praying? Thou maist read, but what
hope is there in thy reading. Yet read on,
this little hope there is; in this Book there's
<hi>Eye-Salve</hi> that may heal thee of thy blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
In this Book there is a <hi>Glass</hi> that will
shew thee thy face. Dost thou know thine
own face when thou seest it? Behold thy
very Image in those marks that are given
of an Unconverted Person; Read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them, and then say, if thou be not
the man.</p>
            <p>Be willing to know thy self, and to know
the worst of thy case? wink not at the
light, hide not thy self from thine own soul.
Wilt thou never know thy disease, till it be
past remedy.</p>
            <p>Much of our hardest Work would be over,
if we could see the sinners to whom we are
sent, to be <hi>convinced sinners.</hi> If we could
but open the blind eyes, there were hope we
should shortly raise the dead.</p>
            <p>Sinner, of a truth, thou art in evil case
whether thou know it or not; thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the dead, and there is but a step be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
thee and Hell. Thou wilt not believe
it though it be told thee, yet once again let
<pb facs="tcp:43891:15"/>
me beseech thee, come to the Glass that is
here presented to thee, and narrowly observe
whether the very marks of the dead be not
found upon thee.</p>
            <p>If there be a miscarriage in this first
work, if thou wilt not understand thy
misery and thy danger, there's an end of
all hopes concerning thee. Whilst self-ignorance
abides upon thee, all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
that are necessary to a man in thy case,
will do thee no good; they are never like
to prosper with thee, because thou wilt not
count them proper for thee. Who will be
perswaded to do that, which he believes is
already done? Who will take the Counsel
of the Physitian that does not think himself
sick? The man of God may spare his pains
of perswading thee to Conversion, whilst
thou art confident thou art converted alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Who will be at the pains of repentance
that concludes he hath repented? Who will
bear the labour and the pangs of the new
birth that is confident he is already passed
from death to life?</p>
            <p>But Friend, let me a little reason with
thee; thou art confident it is well with
thee, yet why wilt thou not yield to thus
much at least, to put it to the question, <hi>am
I not mistaken?</hi> Thou art worse than mad,
if thou thinkest such a question may not be
<pb facs="tcp:43891:16"/>
put. Dost thou know that thy heart is false
and deceitful, and yet because it speaks
<hi>good</hi> concerning thee, must it not be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
whether it speak <hi>truth</hi> or no? Be so
wise as to conclude <hi>I may be mistaken,</hi>
and thus come to the trial whether thou art
mistaken or not.</p>
            <p>And if upon trial by the marks that are
before thee, thou come to be undeceived,
and see thy self wrapped up in that misery
which hitherto thou wouldst not suspect,
the next news I expect to hear from thee is,
<hi>What must I do to be saved?</hi> O were it
come to that once! Then thou hast an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
at hand in those <hi>Means</hi> thou wilt find
prescribed thee: And because they are such
as thou wilt hardly be perswaded to use,
take in the <hi>Motives</hi> that follow, and these
will help down the means. Consider both
the one and the other, and if thou dost not
find the Means proper, and the Motives
weighty, I think I shall do thee no wrong
if I tell thee, thou art still of a blind mind,
and an harder heart.</p>
            <p>Friend, the matter which this little Book
comes to treat with thee about, is of highest
importance; 'tis a matter of Life or Death.
If thou sayest, The Terms upon which Life
is offered, are hard; consider, is it not
harder to dye? He is worthy to dye
<pb facs="tcp:43891:16"/>
who will lose his Soul to save his Labour. If
thou couldest step down into the Deep, and
take a turn or two with those Damned Souls,
who are drench'd with Fire and Brimstone,
and bound in Everlasting Chains of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and should ask them, <hi>Now what
do you think of the terms upon which
life was offered? Now what think you

            <head>Mr. JOSEPH ALLEINE'S CALL TO THE UNCONVERTED.</head>
            <p>DEarly Beloved, and longed for,
I gladly acknowledge my self a
debtor to you all, and am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
as I would be found a
good steward to the Houshold of God, to
give to every one his Portion. But the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
is most solicitous for those Patients,
whose case is most doubtful and hazardous,
and the Fathers bowels are especially turned
towards his dying child. The numbers of
the unconverted souls among you, call for
my most earnest compassions, and hasty dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to pluck them out of the burning, <hi>Iud.</hi>
23. and therefore to these first I shall apply my
self in these lines.</p>
            <p>But whence shall I fetch my arguments, or
how shall I choose my words? Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
shall I wooe them? whereby shall I win
them? Oh that I could but tell! I would write
unto them in tears, I would weep out every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
I would empty my veins for Ink, I
would petition them on my knees; verily
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43891:18"/>
(were I able) I would, (O how thankfully
I would!) if they would be prevailed with to
repent and turn.</p>
            <p>How long have I travelled in birth with
you? how frequently have I made suit to you?
how often would I have gathered you? how
instant have I been with you? this is that I
have prayed for, and studied for, for many
years, that I might bring you to God: O that
I might but do it! Will you yet be intreated? O
what a happy man might you make me, if you
would but hearken to me, and suffer me to carry
you over to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>But, Lord, how insufficient am I for this work!
I have been many a year woing for thee, but the
Damsel would not go with me. Lord, what a task
hast thou set me to do! Alas, wherewith shall I pierce
the scales of Leviathan, or make the heart to feel
that is hard as a stone; hard as a piece of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
milstone! Shall I go and lay my mouth to the
grave, and look when the dead will obey me and
come forth? shall I make an Oration to the Rocks?
or declaim to the Mountains, and think to move
them with arguments? shall I give the blind to
see? From the beginning of the world was it not
heard that a man opened the eyes of the blind. But
thou, O Lord, canst pierce the scales, and prick the
heart of the Sinner. I can but shoot at rovers and
draw the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow at a venture, and do thou direct the

the sin, and save the Soul of the sinner, that casts

            <p>But I must apply my self to you, to whom
I am sent: yet I am at a great loss. Would to
God I knew how to go to work with you!
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43891:18"/>
would I stick at the pains? God knoweth, you
your selves are my witnesses, how I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
you in private, as well as in publick,
and have brought the Gospel to your doors,
testifying to you the necessity of the new birth,
and perswading you to look in time after a
sound and through change. Beloved, I have
not acted a part among you, to serve my own
advantage; our Gospel is not yea, and nay.
Have not you heard the same truths, from the
Pulpit, by publick labours, and by private let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
by personal instructions? Brethren, I
am of the same mind as ever, that holiness is
the best choice, that there is no entring into
Heaven, but by the straight passages of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
birth: that without holiness you shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

counsels of the Lord by me: forgo your sins:
set to prayer: up with the worship of God in
your families: keep at a distance from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions

            <p>Brethren, I beseech you suffer a friendly
plainness and freedom with you in your deepest
concernments. I am not playing the orator, to
make a learned speech to you, nor dressing my

These lines are upon a weighty errand indeed,

nor is my business with your fancies, but

nothing. If I were to please your ears, I could

then tell you a smoother tale: I would make

I mean by the conversion I perswade you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
after.</p>
               <p>It is storied, that when <hi>Iupiter</hi> let down the
golden Chaplets from Heaven, all of them but
one were stolen: Whereupon (lest they should
lose a relique of so great esteem) they made
five others so like it, that if any were so wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
minded, as to steal that also, they should
not be able to discern which was it. And truly
my beloved the Devil hath made many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits
of this Conversion, and cheats one with
this, and another with that; and such a craft
and artifice he hath, in this mystery of deceits,
that (if it were possible) he would deceive
the very Elect. Now that I may cure the
damnable mistakes of some, who think they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43891:21"/>
are converted when they are not; as well as
remove the troubles, and fears of others, that
think they are not converted, when they are;
I shall shew you the nature of conversion, both
negatively, or what it is not; and positively,
what it is.</p>
               <p>We will begin with the negative.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>It is not the taking on us the Profession of
Christianity.</hi> Doubtless Christianity is more
than a name. If we will hear <hi>Paul,</hi> it lies not
in word, but in power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 20. If to cease
to be Jews and Pagans, and to put on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
profession had been true conversion, (as
this is all, that some would have to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by it) who better Christians than they of
<hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea?</hi> These were all Christians
by profession, and had a name to live, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had but a name, are condemned by
Christ, and threatned to be spewed out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.
1, 16. Are there not many that name the name
of the Lord Jesus, that yet depart not from
iniquity? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. and profess they know
God, but in works deny him? <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. And
will God receive these for true converts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
turned to the Christian Religion? What,
converts from sin, when yet they do live in
sin! 'Tis a visible contradiction. Surely if the
lamp of profession would have served the turn,
the foolish Virgins had never been shut out,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 3, 12. We find not only professors
but Preachers of Christ, and Wonder-workers
turned off, because evil workers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22.
23.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>It is not the being washed in the laver of
Regeneration,</hi> or putting on the badge of Christ
<pb facs="tcp:43891:21"/>
in baptism. Many take the press-money, and
wear the Livery of Christ, that yet never stand
to their colours, nor follow their leader. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi>
and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and <hi>Magus</hi> were baptized
as well as the rest. How fondly do many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
here, deceiving, and being deceived!
dreaming, that effectual grace is necessarily tied
to the external administration of Baptsim,
(which what is it, but to revive the Popish
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enent, of the Sacraments working grace, <hi>ex
opere operato?</hi>) and so every Infant should be
regenerated, not only <hi>(Sacramento tenens)</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally,
but really and properly. Hence
men do fancy, that being regenerated already,
when baptized, they need no further work.</p>
               <p>But if this were so, then all that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
(in their infancy) must necessarily be
saved: because the promise of pardon and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is made to conversion and regeneration.
<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. Our
Calling, Sanctification, (as to the beginnings
of it) or Conversion (which are but the same
thing, under different conceptions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;)
is but a middle link in the golden
chain, fastned to election at the one end, and
glorification at the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>
2. 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. The silver cord may not be
broken, nor the connexion between Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Salvation, between grace and glory,
impiously violated, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. If we are indeed
begotten again, it is to an inheritance incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
reserved in Heaven for us, and the divine
power is ingaged to keep us for it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. And
if the very regenerate may perish at last in their
sins. we will no more say, that he that is born
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43891:22"/>
of God, his seed remaineth in him, and that
he cannot sin, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3 9. <hi>i.e.</hi> unto death, now
that it is impossible to deceive the very elect,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24.</p>
               <p>And indeed were this true, then we need
look no farther to see our names written in
Heaven, than only to search the Register, and
see whether we were baptized: then I would
keep the certificate of my baptism, as my fairest
evidence for Heaven, and should come by assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of my gracious state, with a wet finger:
then men should do well to carry but a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
of their baptism under the Registers hand,
when they dyed (as the Philosopher would be
buried with the bishops bond in his hand, which
he had given him for the receiving his alms in
another world:) and upon sight of this, there
were no doubt of their admission into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>In short, if there be no more necessary to
conversion or regeneration, than to be turned
to the Christian Religion, or to be baptized in
infancy, this will flie directly in the face of that
Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14. as well as multitudes of
others. For first, we will then no more say,
<hi>strait is the gate and narrow is the way:</hi> for if all
that are baptized, and of the true Religion, are
saved, the door is become heavenly wide, and
we will henceforth say, wide is the gate, and
broad is the way, that leadeth unto life; for if
this be true, whole Parishes, yea whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and whole Kingdoms may go in a breast,
and we will no more teach, that the righteous
is scarcely saved, or that there is need of such a
stir in taking the Kingdom of Heaven by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43891:22"/>
and striving to enter in. Surely if the
way be so easie as many make it, that there is
little more necessary, than to be regenerated
in our baptism, and cry God mercy, and be
absolved by the Minister at our end, 'tis more
ado than needs, to put our selves to such run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and seeking, and knocking, and fighting,
and wrestling, as the word requires, as necessary
to salvation. Secondly, if this be true, we will
no more say, <hi>few there be that find it:</hi> yea we
will rather say, <hi>few there be that miss it:</hi> we
will no more say, that of the many that are
called, <hi>but few are chosen Mat.</hi> 22. 14. and
that even of the professing <hi>Israel, but a remnant
shall be saved, Rom.</hi> 11. 5. If this Doctrine
be true, we will not say any more with the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<hi>Who then shall be saved?</hi> but rather
who then shall not be saved? Then if a man
be called a brother (that is, a Christian) and be
baptized, though he be a fornicator, or a rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
or covetous, or a drunkard, yet he shall
inherit the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Arminian</hi> will reply; such as these
though they did receive regenerating grace in
Baptism, are since fallen away, and must be
renewed again, or else they cannot be saved.</p>
               <p>I answer, 1. That there is an infallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
between regeneration and salvation, as
we have already shewed, and I itch to be farther
evidencing, but that 'tis against designed bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
2. Then men must be again born again,
which carries a great deal of absurdity in its
very face. And why may not men be twice
born in nature, as well as in grace? Why not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43891:23"/>
as great an absurdity to be twice regenerated
as to be twice generated? But 3. and above
all, This grants however the thing I contend
for, that whatever men do, or pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in baptism, if they be found afterwards
to be grosly ignorant or prophane, or formal,
without the power of godliness, they must be
born again, or else be shut out of the Kingdom
of God. So then, they must have more to plead
for themselves, than their baptismal regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Well, in this you see all are agreed, that be it
more or less that is received in baptism, if
(when men come to years) they are evidently
unsanctified, they must be renewed again by a
through and powerful change, or else they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
escape the damnation of Hell: Friends and
Brethren be not deceived, God is not mocked;
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7. Whether it be your baptism or what
ever else that you pretend, I tell you from the
living God, that if any of you be a prayerless
person, <hi>Iob.</hi> 15. 14. or unclean, or malicious,
or covetous, or riotous, or a scoffer, or a lover
of evil company, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. In a word, if you
are not holy, strict, and self-denying Christians,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. you cannot be saved,
except you be transformed by a further work
upon you, and renewed again by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Thus I have shewed, that it is not enough to
evidence a man to be regenerate, that he hath
been baptized; effectual grace not necessarily
accompanying baptism, as some have vainly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.
But I must answer one Objection before
I pass.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:43891:23"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The Sacraments do certainly attain their
ends, where man doth not <hi>ponere obicem,</hi> or lay
some obstruction, which Infants do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer, it is not the end of Baptism to
regenerate, 1. Because then there would be
no reason, why it should be confined only to
the seed of Believers: for both the law of God,
and the nature of Charity, requires us to use the
means of conversion for all, as far as we can
have opportunity. Were this true, no such
charity as to catch the children of Turks and
Heathens, and baptize them, and dispatch
them to Heaven out of hand; like the bloody
Wretches, that made the poor Protestants (to
save their lives) to swear they would come to
Mass, and that they would never depart from it,
and then put them forthwith to death, saying,
<hi>They would hang them while in a good mind.</hi> 2.
Because it presupposeth regeneration, and
therefore cannot be intended to confer it. In
all the express instances in Scripture, we find
that baptism doth suppose their repenting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
receiving the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37.
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. And to
imagine, that baptism was instituted for an end
of which not one of the first subjects was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
(for they were all adult persons and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have faith and repentance according
as they professed, and their children were not
baptized till after them, in their right,) were
no little absurdity. Were this Doctrine true,
baptism would make Disciples, but we find it
doth bespeak them such before hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
19. 3. Because Baptism, being but a Seal of
the Covenant, cannot convey the benefits, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43891:24"/>
according to the tenour of the Covenant, to
which it is set. Now the Covenant is conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal,
therefere the Seal conveys conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
The Covenant requires faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
as the condition of the grand bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
pardon, and life, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 31. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19.
And what the Covenant doth not convey but
upon these conditions, the Seal cannot. So
that Baptism doth presuppose faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the subject, without which it neither
doth, nor can convey the saving benefits: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the Seal should convey contrary to
the tenour of the Covenant to which it is affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>It lies not in a moral righteousness.</hi> This
exceeds not the righteousness of the Scribes and
Pharisees, and therefore cannot bring us to the
Kingdom of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Paul,</hi> while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted,
was touching the righteousness
which is in the Law blameless, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6.
None could say black is thine eye. The self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justiciary
could say, <hi>I am no Extortioner, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
Vnjust,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. Thou must have
something more than all this to shew, or else
(however thou maist justifie thy self) God will
condemn thee. I condemn not morality, but
warn you not to rest here. Piety includes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
as Christianity doth humanity, and
grace reason. But we must not divide the
tables.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>It consists not in an external conformity to the
rules of Piety.</hi> 'Tis too manifest, men may have
a form of godliness, without the power, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.
5. Men may pray long, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 14. and fast
often, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 12. and hear gladly <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 20.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43891:24"/>
and be very forward in the service of God,
though costly and expensive, <hi>Esay</hi> 1. 11. and
yet be strangers to Conversion. They must
have more to plead for themselves, than that
they keep their Church, and give alms, and
make use of prayer, to prove themselves sound
Converts. No outward service but an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
may do it; even to the giving all his goods
to the poor, and his members to the fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
13. 3.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>It lies not in the chaining up of corruption, by
education, humane laws, or the force of incumbent
affliction.</hi> 'Tis too common and easie, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
education for grace; but if this were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
who a better man than <hi>Iehoasb?</hi> While
<hi>Iehojadah</hi> his uncle lived, he was very forward
in Gods service, and calls upon him to repair
the house of the Lord, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 2, 7. But here
was nothing more than good education all this
while: for when his good Tutor was taken out
of the way, he appears to have been but a wolf
chained up; and falls off to Idolatry.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>In short, it consists only in illumination, or
conviction, in a superficial change, or partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
An <hi>Apostate</hi> may be a man inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. and a <hi>Felix</hi> tremble under
convictions, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 23. and a <hi>Herod</hi> amend
many things, <hi>

                     </gap>ar.</hi> 6. 20. 'Tis one thing to
have sin alarm'd only by convictions, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have it captivated and crucified by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
grace. Many, because they have been
troubled in conscience for their sins, think well
of their case; miserably mistaking conviction
for Conversion. With these <hi>Cain</hi> might have
passed for a Convert, who ran up and down the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43891:25"/>
World, like a man distracted under the rage of
a guilty conscience, till with building and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
he had worn it away, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13, 14.
Others think, that because they have given off
their riotous courses, and are broken off from
evil company, or some particular lust, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to sobriety and civility, they are now no
other than real Converts; forgetting that there
is a vast difference between being sanctified,
and civilized; and that many seek to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. and
are not far from it, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 34. and arrive to
the <hi>almost</hi> of Christianity, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 28. and yet
fall short at last. While conscience holds the
whip over them, many will pray, hear, read,
and forbear their delightful sins: but no sooner
is this Lyon asleep, but they are at their vomit
again. Who more religious than the Jews,
when Gods hand was upon them? <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 34,
35. but no sooner was the affliction over, but
they forgat God, and shewed their Religion to
be but a fit, <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37. Thou mayest have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged

thy stomach, and have escaped the gross pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions

               <p>You may cast the lead, out of the rude mass,
into the more comely proportion of a plant,
and then into the shape of a beast, and thence
into the form and features of a man: but all
the while it is but lead still. So a man may pass
through divers transmutations, from ignorance
to knowledge, from prophaneness to civility,
thence to a form of Religion, and all this while
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43891:25"/>
he is but carnal and unregenerate, while his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

never be accepted at Gods Bar. All this though
good in it self, will not prove you converted,
and so will not suffice to your salvation. Oh
look about you, and bethink your selves of
turning speedily and soundly. Set to praying
and to reading, and studying your own hearts;
rest not, till God hath made through work
with you: for you must be other men, or else
you are lost men.</p>
               <p>But if these be short of Conversion, what
shall I say of the prophane sinner? It may be,
he will scarce cast his eyes, or lend his ears
to this discourse: but if there be any such read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or within hearing, he must know from
the Lord that made him, that he is far
from the Kingdom of God. May a man be
civilized and not converted, where then shall
the Drunkard, and Glutton appear? May a
man keep company with the wise Virgins, and
yet be shut out? Shall not a companion of fools
much more be destroyed? <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. May
a man be true and just in his dealing, and yet not
be justified of God? What then will become
of thee, O wretched man, whose conscience
tells thee thou art false in thy trade, and false
of thy word, and makest thine advantage by a
lying tongue? If men may be enlightned, and
brought to the performance of holy duties,
and yet go down to perdition, for resting in
them, and sitting down on this side of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
what will become of you, O miserable

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43891:26"/>
And of you, O wretchless sinners, with whom
God is scarce in all your thoughts: that are so
ignorant, that you cannot, or so careless, that
you will not pray? O repent and be converted;
break off your sins by righteousness: away to
Christ for pardoning and renewing grace: give
up your selves to him, to walk with him in
holiness, or else you shall never see God. Oh

               <p>1. <hi>The author it is the spirit of God;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called, the sanctification of the spirit;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43891:27"/>

Christ, for that he hath begotten us again:

Yet is this work principally ascribed to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, and so we are said to be born of the
spirit. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>So then it is a work above mans power.
We are born, not of the will of the flesh, nor
of the will of man; but of God. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 31.
Never think thou canst convert thy self. If ever
thou wouldst be savingly converted, thou must
despair of doing it in thine own strength. <hi>Ier.</hi>

thou hadst by thy first birth, a good nature, a

               <p>O ye Saints, how should you love the word?
for by this you have been converted. O ye
sinners, how should you ply the word? for by
this you must be converted. No other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means but this. You that have felt its
renewing power, make much of it while you
live, be for ever thankful for it. Tie it about your
necks, write it upon your hands, lay it in your
bosoms. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 21, 22. When you go let it
lead you, when you sleep let it keep you, when
you wake let it talk with you. Say with holy
<hi>David,</hi> I will never forget thy precepts, for by
them hast thou quickned me. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119, 93.
You that are unconverted, read the word with
diligence, flock to it, where powerfully
preached; fill the porches, as the multitude

30, None are drawn to Christ by their calling,

6. 37, 44. Effectual calling runs parallel with
eternal election. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
               <p>Thou beginnest at the wrong end, if thou
disputest first about thine election. Prove thy
conversion, and then never doubt of thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.
Or canst thou not yet prove it? Set
upon a present and thorow turning. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Gods purposes be (which are secret) I am
sure his promises are plain. How desperately
do rebels argue? If I am elected I shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
do what I will: If not, I shall be damned,
do what I can. Perverse sinner, wilt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
where thou shouldest end? Is not the word
before thee? What saith it? <hi>Repent and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
that your sins may be blotted out, Acts.</hi> 3. 19.
<hi>If you mortifie the deeds of the body, you shall
live, Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Believe and be saved, Act.</hi> 16.
31. What can be plainer? Do not stand still,
disputing about thine election, but set to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
and believing. Cry to God for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
grace. Revealed things belong to
thee, in these busie thy self. 'Tis just (as one
well) that they that will not feed on the plain
food of the word, should be choaked with the
bones. What ever Gods purposes be, I am sure
his promises be true. Whatever the decrees of
Heaven be, I am sure, that if I repent and believe
I shall be saved; and that if I repent not, I
shall be damned. Is not here plain ground for
thee: and wilt thou yet run upon the rocks.</p>
               <p>More particularly, this change of conversion
passes thorowout in the whole subject. A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43891:30"/>
person may have some shreds of good
morality, a little near the list, but he is
never good throughont the whole cloth,
the whole body of Holiness and Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
Feel him a little further near the ridge,
and you shall see him to be but a deceitful piece.
Conversion is not a repairing of the old build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but it takes all down and erects a new
structure: it is not the putting in a patch or
sowing on a list of holiness; but with the true
convert, holiness is woven into all his powers,
principles, and practice. The sincere Christian
is quite a new fabrick, from the foundation to
the top-stone all fire-new. He is a new man,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. a new creature. All things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
new, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. Conversion is a deep
work, a heart work; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37, and 16. 14.
it turns all upside down, and makes a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a new world. It goes <hi>throughout</hi> with men,
<hi>throughout</hi> the Mind, <hi>throughout</hi> the Members,
<hi>throughout</hi> the motions of the whole life.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Throughout the mind.</hi> It makes an universal
change within. First it turns the ballance of the
judgment, so that God and his Glory do
weigh down all carnal and worldly interests.
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 25. It opens
the eye of the mind, and makes the scales of its
native ignorance to fall off, and turns men from
darkness to light. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. The man that before saw no danger
in his condition, now concludes himself lost,
and for ever undone, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. except renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the power of Grace. He that formerly
thought there was little hurt in sin, now comes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43891:31"/>
to see it to be the chief of evils; he sees the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness,
unrighteousness, the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and the filthiness that is in sin, so that he is
affrighted with it, loaths it, dreads it, flies it,
and even abhors himself for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15.
<hi>Iob</hi> 42. 6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. He that could see
little sin in himself, and could find no matter
for confession (as it was said of that learned Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> (who it seems while he
knew so much abroad, was a miserable stranger
to himself,) that when he was to be confessed
by the Priest, could not remember any thing to
confess but was fain to run back to the sins of
his youth) I say he that could not find matter
for confession, unless it were some few gross
and staring evils, now sin reviveth with him,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. he sees the rottenness of his heart,
and desperate and deep pollution of his whole
nature: he cries, unclean, unclean, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.
4. 5. Lord purge me with Hysop, wash me
throughly, create in me a new heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.
2, 7, 10. He sees himself altogether become
filthie, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 3. corrupt both root and tree,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 17, 18. he writes <hi>unclean</hi> upon all his
parts, and powers, and performances, <hi>Esay.</hi> 63.
6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. He discovers the nasty corners
that he was never aware of, and sees the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
and theft, and murther, and adultery
that is in his heart, which before he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of. Heretofore he saw no form nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in Christ, no beauty that he should desire
him; but now he finds the hid treasure, and will
sell all to buy this field. Christ is the pearl he
seeks, sin the puddle he loaths.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:43891:31"/>
Now according to this new light, the man
is of another mind, another judgment, than
before he was: Now God is all with him: he
hath none in Heaven nor in Earth like him, <hi>Ps.</hi>
73. 25. He prefers him truly before all the
World: his favour is his life: the light of his
Countenance is more than Corn and Wine and
Oyl, (the good that he formerly enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and set his heart upon, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7.) Now
let all the World be set on one side, and God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
on the other? Let the Harlot put on her
paint, and gallantry, and present her self to the
soul (as when Satan would have tempted our
Saviour with her) in all the glory of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
yet the soul will not fall down and
worship her; but will prefer a naked, yea a
crucified, persecuted Christ before her, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.
8. 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 22. Not but that a Hypocrite may
come to yield a general assent to this, that God
is the chief good: yea the wiser Heathens (some
few of them) have at last stumbled upon this:
but there is a difference between the absolute,
and comparative judgment of the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
No Hypocrite comes so far, as to look
upon God, as the most desirable and suitable
good to him, and thereupon to acquiesce in
him. This was the converts voice; <hi>The Lord
is my portion saith my soul Whom have I in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
but thee? and there is none upon earth, that I
desire besides thee. God is the strength of my heart
and my portion for ever, Psal.</hi> 73. 25, 26. <hi>Lam.</hi>
3. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, it turns the byass of the Will, both as
to means and end</hi> (1.) <hi>The intension of the wist
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43891:32"/>
is altered, Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>Esay</hi> 26.
8, 9. Now the man hath new ends and designs.
Now he intends God above all, and desires and
designs nothing in all the world so much, as
that Christ may be magnified in him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.
20. He accounts himself more happy in this,
than in all that the earth could yield, that he
may be serviceable to Christ, and bring him
glory in his generation. This is the Mark he
aims at, that the name of Jesus may be great in
the world, and that all the sheaves of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
may bow to this sheaf.</p>
               <p>Reader, dost thou view this and never ask
thy self, whether it be thus with thee? Pause a
while, and breathe on this great concernment.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The election also is changed,</hi> so that he
chooses another way, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 30. He pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od as his blessedness, and upon Christ
as the principal, and holiness as the subordinate
means, to bring him to God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 7. He chooses Jesus for his Lord. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6. He
is not meerly forced into Christ by the storm,
nor doth he take Christ for bare necessity, as the
man begged from the gallows, when he takes
the wife, rather than the halter: but he comes off
freely in the choice. This match is not made
in a fright, as with the terrified conscience, or
dying sinner, that will seemingly do any thing
for Christ, but doth only take Christ, rather than
hell: but he deliberately resolves, that Christ is
his best choice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. and would rather
have him to choose, than all the good of this
world, might he enjoy it while he would. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
he takes holiness for his path. He doth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43891:32"/>
not out of meer necessity submit to it: but he
likes and loves it. <hi>I have chosen the way of thy
Precepts, Psal.</hi> 119. 173. He takes Gods testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
not as his bondage, but as his heritage,
yea his heritage for ever: <hi>v.</hi> 111. he counts
them not his burden, but his bliss, not his cords
but his cordials. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 14, 16,
47. He doth not only bear, but take up Christs
yoak. He takes not holiness, as the stomach
doth the loathed potion, (which it will down
with rather than dye) but as the hungry
doth his beloved food. No time passes so
sweetly with him (when he is himself) as that
he spends in the exercises of holiness; these
are both his aliment, and his element, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of his eyes, and the joy of his heart. <hi>Iob.</hi>
23. 12. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 82, 131, 162, 174. <hi>Psal.</hi>
63. 5.</p>
               <p>Put thy conscience to it as thou goest, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou art the man. O hapy man, if this
be thy case! But see thou be thorow and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
in the search.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, it turns the bent of the affection.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
7. 11. These run all in a new chanel. The <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
is now driven back, and the water runs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
against its natural course.</p>
               <p>Christ is his <hi>Hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1. this is his prize
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. here his eye is, here his heart is. He is
contented to cast all over board (as the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
in the storm, ready to perish) so he may
but keep this Jewel.</p>
               <p>The thirst of his <hi>Desires</hi> is, not after gold,
but grace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. He hungers after it, he
seeks it as silver, he digs for it as for hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43891:33"/>
he had rather be gracious, than be great;
he had rather be the holiest man on earth, than
the most learned, the most famous, most pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous.
While carnal, he said: Oh! If I
were but in great esteem, and rolled in wealth,
and swim'd in pleasure, if my debts were paid,
and I and mine provided for, then I were a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
man: but now the tune is changed. Oh,
saith the Convert, if I had but my corruptions
subdued; if I had such measures of grace, such
fellowship with God, though I were poor and
despised, I should not care, I should account
my self a blessed man. Reader, is this the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of thy soul?</p>
               <p>His <hi>Ioys</hi> are changed. He rejoyceth in the
wayes of Gods testimonies, as much as in all
riches, <hi>Psa.</hi> 119. 14. He delights in the Law
of the Lord, wherein once he had little favour.
He hath no such Joy, as in the thoughts of
Christ, the fruition of his company, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirity
of his people.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Cares</hi> are quite altered. He was once set
for the World, and any scraps of by-time, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
(too often) was enough for his soul. Now
he gives over caring for the Asses, and sets his
heart on the Kingdom. Now all the cry is,
<hi>What shall I do to be saved? Acts.</hi> 16. 30. His
great solicitude is, how to secure his soul. Oh!
how he would bless you, if you could but put
him out of doubt of this!</p>
               <p>His <hi>Fears</hi> are not so much of suffering, but of
sinning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25, 27. Once he was afraid
of nothing so much as the loss of his estate,
or esteem, the displeasure of friends, the srowns
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43891:33"/>
of the great: nothing sounded so terrible to
him, as pain, or poverty, or disgrace. Now
these are little to him, in comparison of Gods
dishonour, or displeasure. How warily doth
he walk, left he should tread on a snare? He
feareth alway, he looks before and behind;
he hath his eye upon his heart, and is often
casting over his shoulder, left he should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 14.
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 2. 14. It kills his heart to think of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Gods favour; this he dreads as his only
undoing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 11, 12. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 8. No
thought in the world doth pinch him and pain
him so much, as to think of parting with
Christ.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Love</hi> runs a new course. My Love was
crucified (said holy <hi>Ignatius</hi>) that is, my
Christ. This is my beloved, saith the Spouse
<hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 16. How doth <hi>Augustine</hi> often pour
his loves upon Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He can find no words sweet enough.</hi> Let me
see thee, O Light of mine eyes. Come, O thou joy
of my spirit; Let me behold thee, O the gladness
of my heart. Let me love thee, O life of my soul.
Appear unto me, O my great delight, my sweet
comfort, O my God, my life, and the whole glory
of my soul. Let me find thee, O desire of my heart:
Let me hold thee, O love of my soul. Let me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
thee, O heavenly Bridegroom. Let me possess
thee, O eternal blessedness, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Sorrows</hi> have now a new vent. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
7. 9. 10. The view of his sins, the sight of a
Christ crucified, that would scarce stir him
before, now how much do they affect his heart?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:43891:34"/>
His <hi>Hatred</hi> boils, his Anger burns against sin,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 104. He hath no patience with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
he calls himself fool, and beast, and thinks
any name too good for himself, when his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
is stirred up against sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 22.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 2. He could once swill in it, with too
much pleasure; now he loaths the thought of
returning to it, as much as of licking up the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
vomit.</p>
               <p>Commune then with thine own heart, and
attend the common and general current of
thine affections, whether it be towards God in
Christ, above all other concernments. Indeed
sudden and strong commotions of the affections
and sensitive part, are oft-times found in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
especially where the natural constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
leads thereunto: and contrariwise, the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
themselves are many times without sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
stirrings of the affections, where the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is more slow, dry and dull. The great inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is, whether the judgment and will be stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
determined for God, above all other
good, real or apparent: and if the affections
do sincerely follow their choice, and conduct,
though it be not so strongly and sensibly, as is
to be desired, there is no doubt, but the change
is saving.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Mouth</hi> is become a well of life, his <hi>Tongue</hi>
as choice silver, and his <hi>Lips</hi> feed many: Now
the salt of grace hath seasoned his speech, and
eat out the corruption, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 6. and cleanseth
the man from his filthy communication, flattery,
boasting, rayling, lying, swearing, backbiting,
that once came like the flashes proceeding from
the hell that was in the heart. <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 6. 7.
The <hi>Throat,</hi> that was once an open sepulchre,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 13. now sends forth the sweet breath
of prayer, and holy discourse, and the man
speaks in another Tongue, in the Language of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and is never so well, as when talking
of God, and Christ, and the matters of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

He speaks it may be like an Angel, but
he hath a covetous eye, or the gain of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness

white, but his heart is full of rottenness, <hi>Mat.</hi>
13. 27. full of unmortified cares, a very oven
of lust, a shop of pride, the seat of malice.
It may be with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> Image, he
hath a Golden head, a great deal of knowledge:
but he hath feet of clay, his affections are
worldly, he minds earthly things, and his way
and walk are sensual, and carnal, you may trace
him in his secret haunts, and his footsteps will
be found in some by-paths of sin. The work is
thorowout with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:43891:36"/>
3. <hi>Thorowout the motives, or the life, and
practice.</hi> The new man takes a new course,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 3. His Conversation is in Heaven,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. No sooner doth Christ call by effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
grace, but he strait way becomes a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 20. When God hath given
the new heart and writ his law in his mind, he
forthwith walks in his statutes and keeps his
judgments, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Though sin may dwell (God knows a
wearisome and unwelcome guest) in him,
yet it hath no more dominion over him. <hi>Rom.</hi>
6. 14, 7. He hath his fruit unto holiness, <hi>Rom.</hi>
6. 22. and though he makes many a blot, yet
the law and life of Jesus is that he eyes, as his
copy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. and hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
respect to all Gods commandments, <hi>Ps.</hi>
119. 6. He makes conscience even of little sins &amp;
little duties, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 113. His very infirmities
which he cannot help, though he would, are his
souls burden, and are like the dust in a mans
eye, which though but little, yet are not a
little troublesome. [O man, Dost thou read
this, and never turn in upon thy soul by self-examination?]
The sincere Convert is not one
man at Church, and another at home: he is not
a Saint on his knees, and a Cheat in his shop: he
will not tithe mint and cummin, and neglect
mercy and judgment, and the weighty matters
of the Law: he doth not pretend piety and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
morality, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 14. but he turns from
all his sins and keeps all Gods Statutes, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
18. 21. though not perfectly (except in desire
and endeavour) yet sincerely, not allowing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43891:37"/>
himself in the breach of any, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15, Now
he delights in thy word, and sets himself to
prayer, and opens his hand, (if able) and
draws out his soul to the hungry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 109. 4 <hi>Esay.</hi> 58. 10. He breaketh off his
sins by righteousness, and his iniquities by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercy to the poor, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27. and hath
a good conscience willing in all things to live
honestly, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

offence towards God and men.</p>
               <p>Here again you shall find the unsoundness of
many professors, that take themselves for good
Christians. They are partial in the law, <hi>Mat.</hi>
2. 9. and take up with the cheap and easie du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of religion, but they go not thorow with
the work. They are as a cake not turned,
half roasted, and half raw. It may be you shall
have them exact in their words, punctual in
their dealings, but then they do not exercise
themselves unto godliness; and for examining
themselves, and governing their hearts, to this
they are strangers. You may have them duly
at the Church, but follow them to their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and there you shall see little but the world
minded, or if they have a road of family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
follow them to their closets, and there
you shall find their souls are little looked after.
It may be they seem otherwise religious, but
bridle not their tongues, and so all their religion
is in vain, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 26. It may be they come up
to closet and family prayer; but follow them
to their shops, and there you shall find them in
a trade of lying, or some covert and cleanly
way of deceit. Thus the hypocrite goes not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43891:37"/>
thorowout in the course of his obedience.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the subject of Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>6. The terms are either from which, or to
which.</p>
               <p>1. The terms from which we turn in this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Conversion, <hi>are</hi> sin, Satan, <hi>the</hi> world, <hi>and</hi>
our own righteousness.</p>
               <p>first, <hi>Sin.</hi> When a man is converted, he is
for ever out with sin: yea with all sin. <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 128. but most of all with his own sins,
and especially with his bosom sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23.
Sin is now the But of his indignation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
7. 11. he thirsts to bathe his hands in the blood
of his sins. His sins set abroach in sorrows.
It is sin that pierces him and wounds him: he
feels it like a thorn in his side, like a prick in
his eyes, he groans and struggles under it,
and not formally, but feelingly cries out, <hi>O
wretched man:</hi> he is not impatient of any bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
so much as of his sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 12. If
God should give him his choice, he would
choose any affliction, so he might be rid of sin.
He feels it like the cutting gravel in
his shooes, pricking, and paining him as he
goes.</p>
               <p>Before Conversion he had light thoughts of
sin: he cherished it in his bosom, as <hi>Vriah</hi> his
lamb: he nourished it up, and it grew up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with him; it did eat as it were of his
own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay
in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter:
but when God opens his eyes by conversion,
he throws it away with abhorrence, <hi>Esay.</hi> 30.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43891:38"/>
22. as a man would a loathsome toad, which
in the dark he had hugged fast in his bosome,
and thought it had been some pretty and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
bird. When a man is savingly changed,
he is not only deeply converted of the danger,
but defilement of sin: and O how earnest is
he with God to be purified? He loaths himself
for his sins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. He runs to Christ,
and casts himself into the fountaine opened for
sin and for uncleanness, <hi>Zec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 13. 31. If he fall
what a stir is there to get all clean again? He
flies to the word, and washes, and rubs, and
rinches, labouring to cleanse himself from all
filthiness both of flesh and spirit: He abhors
his once beloved sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23. as a cleanly
nature doth the trough, and mire, wherein he
sees the swine delight.</p>
               <p>The sound Convert is heartily engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sin. He wrestles with it, he wars against
it. He is too often foiled, but he never yields
the cause, nor lays down the weapons; but he
will up, and to it again, while he hath breath
in his body. He will never give quiet possession,
he will make no peace; he will give no quarter,
he falls upon it, and fires upon it, and is still dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
of it with continual alarms. He can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
his other enemies; he can pity them, and
pray for them, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 60. but here he is impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
here he is set upon revenge: he hunteth, as
it were, for the precious life; his eye shall not
pity, his hand shall not spare, though it be a
right hand or a right eye: Be it a gainful sin,
most delightful to his nature, a support to his
esteem with carnal friends; yet he will rather
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43891:38"/>
throw his gain down the kennel, see his credit
fall, or the flower of pleasure whither in his
hand, than he will allow himself in any known
way of sin, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 8. He will grant no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
he will give no toleration, but he
draws upon sin where ever he meets it, and
frowns upon it with his unwelcome salute,
<hi>Have I found thee, O mine enemy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, hath conscience been at work, while
thou hast been looking over these lines? Hast
thou pondered these things in thine heart?
Hast thou searched the book within, to see if
these things be so? If not, read it again, and
make thy conscience to speak whether or no it
be thus with thee.</p>
               <p>Hast thou crucified thy flesh with its affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and lusts; and not only confessed, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
thy sins; all sin in thy servent desires, and
the ordinary practise of every deliberate and
wilful sin in thy life? If not, thou art yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted.
Doth not conscience fly in thy
face, as thou readest, and tell thee that thou
livest in away of lying for thy advantage, that
thou usest deceit in thy calling, that there is
some way of secret wantonness that thou livest
in? why then, do not deceive thy self, thou
art in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Doth not thy unbridled tongue, thy bruitish
intemperance, thy wicked company, thy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of prayer, of hearing and reading the
word, now witness against the, and say, <hi>We
are thy works and we will follow thee?</hi> Or if I
have not hit the right, doth not the bird with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43891:39"/>
tell them, there is such or such a way, that
thou knowest to be evil, that yet for some car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
respect thou dost tolerate thy self in, and
art willing to spare? If this be the case, thou
art to this day unregenerate, and must be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
or condemned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Satan.</hi> Conversion binds the
strong man, spoils his armour, casts out his
goods, turns men from the power of Satan unto
God, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. Before, the Devil could no
sooner hold up his finger to the sinner, to call
him to his wicked company, sinful games, filthy
delights, but presently he follows, like an Ox
to the slaughter, and a fool to the correction of
the stocks, as the bird that hasteth to the prey,
and koweth not that it is for his life. No
sooner could Satan bid him lie, but presently he
had it upon the top of his tongue, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3. no
sooner could Satan offer a wanton object, but
he was stung with lust. The Devil could do
more with him than God could. If the Devil
say, away with these family duties, be sure they
shall be rarely enough performed in his house.
If the Devil say, away with this strictness,
this preciseness, he will keep far enough from
it. If he tells him there's no need of these clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
duties, he shall go from day to day and
scarce perform them. But now he is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he serves another master, and takes quite
another course, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. he goes and comes
at Christs beck. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24. Satan may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
catch his foot in his trap; but he will no
longer be a willing captive. He watches against
the snares and baits of Satan, and studies to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43891:39"/>
be acquainted with his devices. He is very
suspitious of his plots, and is very jealous, in
what comes athwart him, lest Satan should
have some design upon him. He wrestles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
principalities and powers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. He
entertains the messenger of Satan as men do the
messenger of death. He keeps his eye upon
his enemy. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. and watches in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
lest Satan should put in his foot.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>World.</hi> Before sound faith, a
man is overcome of the world. Either he
bows down to <hi>Mammon,</hi> or idolizes his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or is a lover of pleasure, more than a
lover of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. Here's the root
of mans misery by the fall; he is turned aside
to the creature, instead of God, and gives that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,
confidence, affection to the creature,
that is due to him alone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.
37. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 11. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 5.</p>
               <p>O miserable man! What a deformed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
hath sin made thee. God made thee little
lower than the Angels, sin little better than
the devils, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 70. and 8. 44. a monster
that hath his head and heart, where his feet
should be, and his feet kicking against Heaven,
and every thing out of place, the world, that
was formed to serve thee, is come to rule thee;
and the deceitful harlot hath bewitched thee
with her inchantments, and made thee bow
down and serve her.</p>
               <p>But converting grace sets all in order again,
and puts God in the Throne, and the world at
his footstool, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 25. Christ in the heart,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43891:40"/>
and the world under feet, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1.
So <hi>Paul, I am crucified to the world, and the world
to me, Gal.</hi> 6. 14. Before this change all the cry
was <hi>who will shew us any (worldly) good:</hi> but
now he sings another tune. <hi>Lord lift thou up
the light of thy countenance upon me,</hi> and take
the corn and wine whose will, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6. 7.
Before, his hearts delight and content was in
the world; then the Song was, <hi>Soul take thine
ease, eat, drink and be merry, thou hast much goods
laid up for many years:</hi> but now all this is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
and there is no comliness that he should
desire it, and he tunes up with the sweet Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
of <hi>Israel, The Lord is the portion of mine
inheritance; the lines are fallen to me in a fair
place, and I have a goodly heritage.</hi> He blesses
himself, and boasts himself in God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.
2. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 24. nothing else can give him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
He hath written vanity and vexation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all his worldly enjoyments, <hi>Ec.</hi> 1. 2. and loss
and dung upon all humane excellencies, <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 7, 8. He hath life and immortality now in
chase, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. he trades for grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and hath the Crown incorruptible in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 25. His heart is set in him to
seek the Lord, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 19. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
15. 15. He first seeks the Kingdom of Heaven
and the righteousness thereof, and religion is
no longer a matter by the by with him, but
the main of his care, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4.
Now the gawdy idol is become <hi>Nehushtan;</hi>
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. and he up and treads upon it, as
<hi>Diogenes</hi> trampling on <hi>Plato's</hi> hangings, and
saying <hi>Calco Platonis fastum.</hi> Before the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43891:40"/>
world had the swaying interest with him: He
would do more for gain than godliness, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
6. 5. more to pleasure his friend, or his flesh,
than to please the God that made him, and
God must stand by till the world were first
served; but now all must stand by: he hates
father and mother and life and all in comparison
of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.</p>
               <p>Well then, pause a little, and look within.
Doth not this neerly concern thee? Thou
pretendest for Christ; but doth not the world
sway thee? Dost thou not take more real delight
and content in the world, than in him? Dost
not thou find thy self better at case when the
World goes to thy mind, and thou art encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with carnal delights, than when retired
to prayer and meditation in thy closet, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
upon Gods Word and Worship? No
surer evidence of an unconverted estate, than
to have the things of the world uppermost in
our aims, love, and estimations, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 15.
<hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
               <p>With the sound convert Christ hath the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.
How dear is this name to him?
How precious is its savour? <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Psal.</hi>
45. 8. The name of Jesus is engraven upon his
heart, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. and lies as a bundle of mirth
between his breasts, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 13. 14. Honour is but
air, and laughter is but madness, and <hi>Mammon</hi>
is fallen like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark, with hands
and head broken off on the threshold, when
once Christ is savingly revealed. Here is the
pearl of great price to the true Convert; here is
his treasure, here is his hope, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 44. 45.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43891:41"/>
This is his glory: My beloved is mine, and I
am his, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 16. O 'tis sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to him to be able to say, Christ is mine,
than if he could say, the Kingdom is mine,
the <hi>Indies</hi> are mine.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>your own Righteousness.</hi> Before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
man seeks to cover himself with his
own sig-leaves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6, 7. and to lick himself
whole with his own duties, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 6, 7. He is
apt to trust in himself, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 15. and 18. 9.
and set his own righteousness, and to reckon
his Counters for Gold, and not submit to the
righteousness of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
changes his mind; now he casts away
his filthy rags, and counts his own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but a menstruous cloth: he casts it off, as
a man would the verminous tatters of a nasty
beggar, <hi>Esay.</hi> 64. 6. Now he is brought to
poverty of spirit. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3. complains of and
condemns himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and all his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
is, <hi>poor, and miserable, and wretched, and
blind, and naked, Rev.</hi> 3. 17. he sees a world of
iniquity in his holy things, &amp; calls his once ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
righteousness, but flesh, and loss, and dogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat,
and would not for a thousand worlds be
found in himself, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4, 7, 8, 9. His finger
is ever upon his sores, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 3. his sins, his
wants. Now he begins to set a high price up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christs righteousness: he sees the need of a
Christ in every duty, to justifie his person, and
justifie his performances: he cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, he cannot pray without him; Christ
must go with him, or else he cannot come into
the presence of God; he leans upon the hand
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43891:41"/>
of Christ and so he bows himself in the house
of his God. He sets himself down for a lost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
man without him. His life is hid in Christ,
as the life of a man in the heart. He is fixed in
Christ, as the roots of the tree spread in the
earth for stability and nutriment. Before, the
news of a Christ was a stale and sapless thing:
but now how sweet is a Christ? <hi>Augustine</hi> could
not relish his before so much admired <hi>Cicero,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he could not find the name of Christ,
How pathetically cries he? <hi>Dulcissime, amantis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benignis.
Caris. &amp;c. quando te videbo? quando
satiabor de pulcritudine tua? Medit. c.</hi> 37. <hi>O
most sweet, most loving, most kind, most dear, most
precious, most desired, most lovely, most fair, &amp;c.</hi>
all in a breath, when he speaks of and to his
Christ. In a word, the voice of the Convert
is, with the Martyr, <hi>None but Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The terms which <hi>are either</hi> Vltimate, <hi>or</hi>
Subordinate <hi>and</hi> Mediate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vltimate</hi> is God the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, whom the true Convert takes, as
his All-sufficient and eternal blessedness. A man
is never truly sanctified, till his very heart be
in truth set upon God, above all things, as his
portion and chief good. These are the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
breathings of a believers heart, <hi>Thou art my
portion O Lord, Psal.</hi> 1. 9. 57. <hi>My soul shall
make her boast in the Lord, Psal.</hi> 34. 2. <hi>My ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
is from him: he only is my rock, and my
salvation, he is my defence: in God is my salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and my glory, the rock my strength, and
my refuge is in God, Psal.</hi> 62. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Psal.</hi>

Would you put it to an issue, whether you
be converted or not, now then let thy soul and
all that is within thee attend.</p>
               <p>Hast thou taken God for thy happiness?
Where doth the content of thy heart lie?
Whence doth thy choicest comfort come in?
Come then, and with <hi>Abraham</hi> lift up thine
eyes, Eastward, and Westward, and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and Southward, and cast about thee
what it is, that thou wouldst have in Heaven or
earth to make thee happy. If God should give
thee thy choice, as he did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> or should
say to thee, as <hi>Ahashuerus</hi> to <hi>Esther, What is thy
petition, and what is thy request, and it shall be
granted thee; Esther</hi> 5. 3. What wouldst thou
ask? go into the gardens of pleasure, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the fragrant flowers from thence:
would these content thee? Go to the treasures
of <hi>Mammon,</hi> suppose thou mightest lade thy
self, while thou wouldst from hence: go to the
towers, to the trophies of honour; what
thinkest thou of being a man of renown, and
having a name like the name of the great men
of the earth? Would any of this, all this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
thee, and make thee count thy self a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
man, if so then certainly thou art carnal
and unconverted. If not, go further; wade
into the divine excellencies, the store of his
mercies, the hiding of his power, the deeps
unfathomable of his All-sufficiency. Doth this
suit thee best, and please thee most? Dost thou
say, <hi>'Tis good to be here. Mat.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>Here I
will pitch, here I will live and dye?</hi> Wilt thou
let all the world go, rather than this? Then 'tis
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43891:42"/>
well between God and thee: Happy art thou, O
man, happy art thou, that ever thou wast born.
If a God can make thee happy, thou must needs
be happy: for thou hast avouched the Lord to
be thy God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17. Dost thou say to
Christ, as he to us, <hi>Thy father shall be my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and thy God my God, Ioh.</hi> 20. 17. Here
is the turning point. An unsound professor
never takes up his rest in God; but converting
grace does the work, and so cures the fatal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of the fall, by turning the heart from its
idols, to the living God, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9. Now
saies the soul, <hi>Lord, whither should I go? Thou
hast the words of eternal life, Ioh.</hi> 6. 68. Here
he centers, here he settles. Oh 'tis as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of Heaven to him, to see his interest in
God. When he discovers this, he saith, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath
dealt bountifully with thee. Psal.</hi> 116. 7. and it
is even ready to breath out <hi>Simeons</hi> song, <hi>Lord,
now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, Luke</hi>
2. 29. and saith, with <hi>Iacob,</hi> when his old
heart revived at the welcome tidings, <hi>It is
enough, Gen.</hi> 45. 28. When he sees he hath
a God in Covenant to go to; <hi>this is all his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
aud all his desire,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
               <p>Man, is this thy case? Hast thou experienced
this? Why, then blessed art thou of the
Lord. God hath been at work with thee, he
hath laid hold on thine heart by the power of
converting grace, or else thou couldst never
have done this.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mediate</hi> term of Conversion is either
<hi>Principal,</hi> or <hi>less Principal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:43891:43"/>The <hi>Principal</hi> is Christ, the only mediator
between God and Man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. His work
is to bring us to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. he is the
way to the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 6. the only plank
on which we may escape, the only door by
which we may enter, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 9. Conversion
brings over the soul to Christ, to accept of him,
<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6. as the only means to life, as the only
way, the only name given under Heaven,
<hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. He looks not for salvation in any
other, but him; nor in any other with him;
but throws himself on Christ alone; as one
that should cast himself with spread arms upon
the Sea.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>(saith the convinced sinner)</hi> here I will
venture, and if I perish, I perish: If I die, I will
die here. But Lord suffer me not to perish under
the pitiful eyes of thy mercy. Intreat me not to
leave thee, or to turn away from following after
thee, <hi>Ruth 1. 16.</hi> Here I will throw my self. If
thou kick me, if thou kill me, <hi>Job 13. 15.</hi> I will
not go from thy door.</p>
               <p>Thus the poor soul doth venture on Christ,
and resolvedly adhere to him. Before Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,

a fancy, and the talk of great enjoyments for
an idle dream. But now to him to live is
Christ. He sets light by all that he accounted
precious for the excellency of the knowledge of
Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>All of Christ is accepted by the sincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.
He loves not only the wages, but work

16. 24.</p>
               <p>The unsound closes by the halves with
Christ: he is all for the salvation of Christ, but
he is not for sanctification: he is for the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
but appretiates not the person of
Christ. He divides the offices and benefits of
Christ. This is an error in the foundation.
Who so loveth life, let him beware here. 'Tis
an undoing mistake, of which you have been
often warned, and yet none more common.
Jesus is a sweet name, but men love not the

The sound Convert takes a whole Christ, and
takes him for all intents and purposes, without
exceptions, without limitations, without
reserves. He is willing to have Christ, upon
his terms, upon any terms. He is willing of
the dominion of Christ, as well as deliverance
by Christ; he saith with <hi>Paul, Lord what wilt
thou have me to do? Acts</hi> 9. 6. Any thing Lord.

strictness of these bonds, the severity of these
ways, now falls in love with them, and
chuses them as its rule and guide for ever, <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 111, 112.</p>
               <p>Four things (I observe) God doth work
in every sound Convert, with reference to the
Laws and ways of Christ, by which you may
come to know your estates, if you will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to your own souls; and therefore keep your
eyes upon your hearts, as you go along.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Iudgment is brought to approve of them,
and subscribe to them, as most righteous, and
most reasonable, Psal.</hi> 119. 128, 137, 138. The
mind is brought to like the ways of God, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43891:44"/>
the corrupt prejudices that were once against
them, as unreasonable, and intolerable, are
now removed. The understanding assents to
them all, as holy, just, and good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12.
How is <hi>David</hi> taken up with the excellencies

               <p>There is a twofold judgment of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<hi>Iudicum absolutum, &amp; comparatum.</hi>
The absolute judgment is, when a man thinks
such a course best in the general, but not for
him, or not under the present circumstances he

for him. He looks upon the rules of Religion,
not only as tolerable, but desirable, yea more
desirable than gold, fine gold, yea much fine
gold, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 10. His judgment is setledly
determined, that 'tis best to be holy, that
'tis best to be strict: that it is in it self the most

He desires holiness (as one well)
only as a Bridge to Heaven, and enquires

not only for Heaven sake. He would not be

               <p>Again, then be exhorted, O man, that readest,

conscience? Doth it not begin to bite? Doth
it not twitch thee as thou goest? Is this thy
judgement, and this thy choice, and this thy
way? that we have described? If so, then 'tis
well. But doth not thy heart condemn thee,
and tell thee, there is such a sin thou livest in
against thy Conscience? Doth it not tell thee,
there is such and such a secret way of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that thou makest no bones of? Such or such
a duty, that thou makest no conscience of?</p>
               <p>Doth not conscience carry thee to thy closet,
and tell thee how seldom prayer, and reading
is performed there? Doth it not carry thee to
thy family, and shew thee the charge of God,
and the souls of thy children and servants, that
be neglected there? Doth not conscience lead
thee to thy shop, thy trade, and tell thee of
some mistery of iniquity there? Doth it not
carry thee to the Ale-shop, or to the Sack-shop,
and round thee in thine ear for the loose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
thou keepest there, the precious time thou
mispendest there, for the talents of God which
thou throwest down this sink, for thy gaming,
and thy swilling, &amp;c. Doth it not carry thee
into the secret chamber, and read thee a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

               <p>O Conscience do thy duty. In the name of
the living God I command thee, discharge
thine office. Lay hold upon this sinner. Fall
upon him, arrest him, apprehend him, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

What meanest thou, O sleeper? What

hast thou never a reproof in thy mouth? What,

and eternity, and thou altogether hold thy
peace? What, shall he go on still in his trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and yet have peace? O rouze up thy self:
and do thy work. Now let the Preacher in the

3. 3. and yet do you wonder, why your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
do so painfully travel in birth with you?
Think it not strange, that I am earnest with
you to follow after holiness, and long to see
the Image of God upon you. Never did any,
nor shall any enter into Heaven, by any other
way but this. The Conversion described, is
not an high pitch of some taller Christians, but
every soul, that is saved, passes this universal
change.</p>

<hi>Vnum necessarium,</hi> the one thing necessary.
Thine estate is not necessary: thou maist sell all
for the Pearl of great price, and yet be a gainer
by the purchase. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 45. Thy life is not
necessary: thou maist part with it for Christ
to infinite advantage. Thine esteem is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
thou maist be reproached for the name

in reproach, than in repute. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 10, 11. But thy Conversion is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
thy damnation lies upon it, and is it not
needful in so important a case to look about?
Upon this one point depends thy making, or
marring to all eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:43891:48"/>But I shall more particularly shew the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity

shouldst be good for nothing, an unprofitable
burden of the earth, a wart, or wen in the body
of the universe. Thus thou art, while uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,

thy being. Is it not for the divine pleasure
thou art and wert created, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 11. Did not
he make thee for himself, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4. Art
thou a man, and hast thou reason? Why then
bethink thy self, why, and whence thy being
is. Behold Gods workmanship in thy body,
and ask thy self, to what end did God rear this
fabrick? Consider the noble faculties of thy
Heaven-born soul: to what end did God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
these excellencies? To no other, than
that thou shouldst please thy self, and gratifie
thy senses. Did God send men like the swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
into the world, only to gather a few
sticks and dirt, and build their nests, and
breed up their young, and then away? The
very heathens could see further than this. Art
thou so fearfully and wonderfully made, <hi>Psal.</hi>
139. 14. and dost thou not yet think with thy
self, surely it was for some noble and raised
end?</p>
               <p>O man, set thy reason a little in the chair.
Is it not pity such a goodly fabrick should be
raised in vain? Verily thou art in vain, except
thou art for God. Better thou hadst no being,
than not be for him. Wouldst thou serve thy
end? Thou must repent, and be converted.</p>

               <p>Oh abuse unsufferable! to see a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
soul abased to the filthiest drudgery, to
see the glory of Gods creation, the chief of the
ways of God, the Lord of the Universe, a lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
with the prodigal at the trough, or licking
up with greediness the most loathsom vomit.
Was it such a lamentation to see those that did
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43891:50"/>
feed delicately, to sit desolate in the streets? and
the precious sons of Sion comparable to fine
gold, to be esteemed as earthen pitchers; and
those that were cloathed in scarlet to embrace
dunghils? <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 2, 5. And is it not fearful
much more, to see the only thing that hath
immortality in this lower world, and carried the
stamp of God, to become as a vessel wherein
there is no pleasure? (which is but the modest
expression of the vessel, men put to the most
sordid use.) Oh indignity intolerable! Better
thou wert dashed in a thousand pieces, than
continue to be abused to so filthy a service.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Not only man, but the whole visible creation
is in vain, without this.</hi> Beloved, God hath
made all the visible creatures in Heaven and
earth for the service of man, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 28. and
man only is the spokesman for all the rest. Man
is in the universe, like the tongue in the body,
(which speaks for all the members.) The other
creatures cannot praise their maker, but by
dumb signs and hints to man, that he should
speak for them. Man is, as it were, the High-Priest
of Gods creation, to offer the Sacrifice of
praise, for all his fellow creatures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147,
and 148. and 150. The Lord God expecteth
a tribute of praise from all his works, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

22. now all the rest do bring in their tributo to
man, and pay it in by his hand. So then, if
man be false, and faithless, and selfish, God is
wronged of all, and shall have no active glory
from his works.</p>
               <p>Oh dreadful thought to think of! That God
should build such a world as this, and lay out
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43891:50"/>
such infinite power, and wisdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereupon, and all in vain; and man
should be guilty at last, of robbing, and spoiling
him of the glory of all. Oh think of this,
while thou art unconverted, all the offices of
the creatures to thee are in vain: thy meat
nourishes thee in vain, the Sun holds forth his
light to thee in vain, the Stars, that serve thee
in their courses by their most powerful, though
hidden influence, <hi>Iudges</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 21, 22.
do it in vain; thy Cloaths warm thee in vain;
thy Beast carries thee in vain: in a word, the
labour unwearied, and continual travel of the
whole creation (as to thee) is in vain. The
service of all the creatures, that drudge for
thee, and yield forth their strength unto thee
(that therewith thou shouldst serve their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker)
is all but lost labour. Hence the whole
Creation groaneth under the abuse of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22. that pervert them
to the service of their lusts, quite contrary to
the very end of their being.</p>

1. 26. All thy religious performances will be
but lost; for they can neither <hi>please God,</hi> Rom.
8. 8. nor <hi>save thy soul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2, 3. which are
the very ends of Religion. Be thy services never
so specious, yet God hath no pleasure in them.
<hi>Esay.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 10. Is not that mans case
dreadful, whose Sacrifices are as murder, and
whose prayers are a breath of abomination? <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi>

think they will set upon mending, and that a

few prayers and alms will salve all again: but
alas, sirs, while your hearts remain unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
your duties will not pass. How punctual
was <hi>Iehu?</hi> and yet all was rejected, because
his heart was not upright, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. with
<hi>Hos.</hi> 1. 4. How blameless was <hi>Paul?</hi> and yet
being unconverted all was but loss, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6,

               <p>O soul, do not think when thy sins pursue
thee, a little praying and reforming thy course
will pacifie God: thou must begin with thine
heart: if that be not renewed, thou canst no
more please God, than one that having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably
offended thee, should bring thee his
vomit in a dish to pacifie thee, or having fallen
into the mire, should think with his loathed

and envy, but venom in the very heart?
spiritual sloth is but a scurvy in the mind, and
carnal security a mortal lethargy; and how can
that soul have true comfort that is under so
many diseases? But converting grace cures, and
so eases the mind, and prepares the soul for a
setled, standing, immortal peace. <hi>Great peace
have they that love thy commandments, and nothing

He hath destroyed me, I am gone, and my hope is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

in his death, Prov.</hi> 14. 32. When nature is

an eternal end of his confidence, wherein he

hope and will not be beaten out of it. They
hold it fast, they will not let it go. Yea but death
will knock off their fingers. Though we cannot
undeceive them, death and judgment will.
When death strikes his dart through thy liver,
it will let out thy soul, and thy hopes together.
The unsanctified have hope only in this life,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. and therefore are of all men most
miserable. When death comes, it lets them
out into the amazing gulf of endless desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
3. <hi>There is blasphemy in it.</hi> To hope
we shall be saved, though continuing uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
is to hope, we shall prove God a
lier. He hath told you, that so merciful and
pittiful as he is, he will never save you notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
if you go on in ignorance, or a course
of unrighteousness, <hi>Esa. 27. 11. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9.
in a word, he hath told you, that whatever you

without you be new creatures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43891:53"/>
Now to say, God is merciful, and we hope
he will save us nevertheless, is to say in effect,
we hope God will not do as he saith. We may
not set Gods attributes at variance. God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to glorifie mercy, but not with the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of truth, as the presumptuous sinner will
find to his everlasting sorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Why, but we hope in Jesus Christ,
we put our whole trust in God, and therefore
doubt not, but we shall be saved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>This is not to hope in Christ, but against
Christ.</hi> To hope to see the Kingdom of God,
without being born again, to hope to find eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life in the broad way, is to hope Christ will
prove a false Prophet. 'Tis <hi>David's</hi> plea, <hi>I
hope in thy word,</hi> Psal. 119. 81. but this hope
is against the word. Shew me a word of Christ
for thy hope, that he will save thee in thine
ignorance, or prophane neglects of his service,
and I will never go to shake thy confidence.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> You must despair of ever coming to
Heaven as you are, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. that is, while you
remain unconverted. You must despair ever to
see the face of God without holiness: but you
must by no means despair of finding mercy,
upon your thorough repentance and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
neither may you despair of attaining to
repentance and conversion, in the use of Gods
means.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Without this all that Christ hath done and
suffered will be (as to you) in vain; Ioh.</hi> 13. 8.
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. that is, it will no way avail to your
salvation. Many urge this as sufficient ground
for their hopes, that Christ died for sinners: but
I must tell you, Christ never died to save impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
and unconverted sinners (so continuing.)
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. A great divine was wont, in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
dealings with souls, to ask two questions, 1.
What hath Christ done for you? 2. What hath
Christ wrought in you? Without the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the spirit in Regeneration, we can have
no saving interest in the benefits of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I tell you from the Lord, Christ himself
cannot save you, if you go on in this estate.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>It were against his trust.</hi> The Mediatour
is the servant of the Father, <hi>Esay</hi> 42. 1. shews
his commission from him, acts in his name,
and pleads his command for his justification:
<hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 18, 36. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 38, 40. And God
hath committed all things to him, entrusted
his own glory, and the salvation of his elect
with him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 2. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Christ gives his Father an account of both
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43891:54"/>
parts of his trust, before he leaves the world.
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 4, 6, 12. Now Christ should quite
cross his fathers glory, his greatest trust, if he
should save men in their sins; for this were to
overturn all his counsels, and offer violence to
all his attributes.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>To overturn all his counsels;</hi> of which
this is the order, that men should be brought
through sanctification, to salvation, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.
13. He hath chosen them that they should be
holy. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. They are elected to pardon
and life, through sanctification, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2.
If thou canst repeal the Law of Gods immutable
counsel, or corrupt him, whom the Father
hath sealed, to go directly against his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
then, and not otherwise, maist thou
get to Heaven in this condition. To hope that
Christ will save thee while unconverted, is to
hope that Christ will falsify his trust. He never
did, nor will, save one soul, but whom the
Father had given him in election, and drawn
to him in effectual calling, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 37, 44. Be
assured, Christ will save none, in a way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Fathers will, who came on purpose
to do his will, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 38.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>To offer violence to all his attributes</hi>
1. <hi>To his Iustice.</hi> For the righteousness of
Gods Judgment lies, in rendring to all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their work, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5, 6. Now,
should men sow to the flesh, and yet of the
spirit reap everlasting life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. where
were the glory of Divine Justice, since it should
be given to the wicked, according to the work
of the righteous? 2. <hi>To his holiness.</hi> If God
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43891:55"/>
should not only save sinners, but save them in
their sins, his most pure and strict holiness
would be exceedingly defaced. The unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
is in the eyes of Gods holiness, worse than
a swine or viper, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 33. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22.
Now what cleanly nature could endure to
have the filthy swine bed and board with
him in his parlour, or bed chamber? It would
offer extremest violence to the infinite purity
of the divine nature, to have such to dwell
with him. They cannot stand in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they cannot abide in his presence, <hi>Psal.</hi>
1. 5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 4, 5. If holy <hi>David</hi> would not
endure such in his house, no nor in his sight,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 3, 7. shall we think God will? Should
he take men as they be, from the trough to the
table, from the Harlots lips, from the stye and
draught to the glory of Heaven, the world
would think God were at no such a distance
from sin, nor had such dislike of it, as we are
told he hath: they would conclude, God were
altogether such a one as themselves (as they
wickedly did, but from the very forbearance of
God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21.) 3. <hi>To his veracity.</hi> For
God hath declared from Heaven, <hi>That if any
shall say they shall have peace, though he should
go on in the imagination of his heart: his wrath
shall smoak against that man, Deut.</hi> 29. 19, 20.
<hi>That they (only,) that confess, and for sake their
sins, shall find mercy,</hi> Prov. 28. 13. <hi>That they
that shall enter into his hill, must be of clean hands,
and a pure heart,</hi> Psal. 24. 3, 4. Where were
Gods truth, if notwithstanding all this, he
should bring men to salvation without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version?
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43891:55"/>
O desperate sinner, that darest to
hope, that Christ will put the lie upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and nullifie his word to save thee! 4. <hi>To
his wisdom.</hi> For this were to throw away the
choicest mercies, on them that would not value
them, nor were any way suted to them. <hi>First,</hi>
they would not value them. The unsanctified
sinner puts but little price upon Gods great
Salvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 5. He sets no more by
Christ, than the whole by the Physician, <hi>Mat.</hi>
9. 12. he prises not his balm, values not his
cure, tramples upon his blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.
Now, would it stand with wisdom, to force
pardon and life, upon them that would give
him no thanks for them? Will the all-wise God
(when he hath forbidden us to do it) throw
his holy things to dogs, and his pearls to swine,
that would (as it were) but turn again and
rent him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 6. This would make mercy
to be despised indeed. Wisdom requires, that
life be given, in a way sutable to Gods honour;
and that God provide for the securing his own
glory, as well as mans felicity. It would be
dishonourable to God, to set his Jewels in the
snouts of swine (continuing such) and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
his choicest riches on them, that have
more pleasure in their swill, than the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delights that he doth offer. God should
lose the praise and glory of his grace, if he
should cast it away on them, that were not only
unworthy, but unwilling. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they are
no way suited to them. The Divine Wisdom is
seen in suiting things each to other, the means
to the end, the object to the faculty, the quality
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43891:56"/>
of the gift to the capacity of the receiver
Now, if Christ should bring the unregenerate
sinner to Heaven, he could take no more feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
there, than a Beast if you should bring him
into a beautiful room, to the society of learned
men, and a well furnished table; when as the
poor thing had much rather be grazing with
his fellow bruits. Alas, what should an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
creature do in Heaven! He could
take no content, because nothing suits him.
The place doth not suit him, he would be but
<hi>piscis in arido,</hi> quite out of his element, as a
swine in the parlour, or a fish out of water. The
company doth not suit him. What commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
hath darkness with light, corruption
with perfection? Filth and rottenness, with
glory and immortality? The imployment doth
not suit him. The anthems of Heaven fit not
his mouth, suit not his ear. Canst thou charm
thy Beast with Musick? or wilt thou bring him
to thy Organ, and expect that he should make
thee melody, or keep time with the skilful
Quire? Or had he skill, he would have no
will, and so could find no pleasure, no more
than the nauseous stomach in the meat, on
which it hath newly sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eited. Spread thy table
with delicates before a languishing patient, and
it will be but a very offence. Alas, if the poor
man think a Sermon long, and say of a Sabbath,
<hi>What a weariness is it? Mal.</hi> 1. 13. how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
would he think it, to be held to it to all
eternity? 5. <hi>To his Immutability, or else to his
Omnisciency, or Omnipotency.</hi> For this is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
in the Conclave of Heaven, and enrolled
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43891:56"/>
in the degrees of the Court above, that none
but <hi>the pure in heart shall ever see God, Mat.</hi> 5. 8.
This is laid up with him, and sealed among
his treasures. Now if Christ, yet, bring any to
Heaven unconverted, either he must get them in
without his Fathers knowledge, and then where
is his Omnisciency? or against his will, and
then where were his Omnipotency? or he must
change his will, and then where were his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability?</p>
               <p>Sinner, wilt thou not yet give up thy vain
hope of being saved in this condition? Saith
<hi>Bildad, shall the earth be forsaken for thee? or
the rocks removed out of their place? Iob</hi> 18. 4.
May not I much more reason so with thee?
Shall the Laws of Heaven be reversed for thee?
Shall the everlasting foundations be overturned
for thee? Shall Christ put out the eye of his
Fathers Omnisciency, or shorten the arm of his
eternal power for thee? Shall divine justice be
violated for thee? or the brightness of the
glory of his holiness be blemished for thee?
Oh the impossibility, absurdity, blasphemy,
that is in such a confidence! To think Christ
will ever save thee in this condition, is to make
thy Saviour to become a sinner, and to do more
wrong to the infinite Majesty, than all the
Wicked on Earth, or Devils in Hell ever did, or
could. And yet wilt thou not give up such a
blasphemous hope?</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Against his Word.</hi> We need not say, <hi>who
shall ascend into Heaven to bring down Christ from
above? Or who shall descend into the deep to bring
up Christ from beneath? The word is nigh us.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43891:57"/>

not thou hast no part in me, Ioh. 13. 8. Repent or
perish, Luk.</hi> 13. 3. One word, one would think,
were enough from Christ; but how often and
earnestly doth he reiterate it, verily, verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
verily except a man be born again he shall

he doth not only assert, but prove the necessity

Law of his Kingdom, and Rule of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to save thee in this estate.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Against his Oath.</hi> He hath lifted up his
hand to Heaven, he hath sworn, that those that
remain in unbelief, and know not his ways
(that is, are ignorant of them, or disobedient to
them) shall not enter into his rest, <hi>Psal. 95. 11.
Heb.</hi> 3. 18. and wilt thou not yet believe, O
sinner, that he is in earnest? Canst thou hope
he will be forsworn for thee? The Covenant
of Grace is confirmed by an oath, and sealed by
blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 18, 19. <hi>Mat.</hi>
26. 28. But all must be made void, and another
way to Heaven found out, if thou be saved,
living and dying unsanctified. God is come to

his lowest and last terms with man, and hath
condescended as far as with honour he could,
hath set up his pillars, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a <hi>Ne plus ultra.</hi>
Men cannot be saved, while unconverted,
except they could get another Covenant made,
and the whole frame of the Gospel (which
was established for ever, with such dreadful so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities)
quite altered, and would not this be a
distracted hope?</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Against his Honour.</hi> Christ will so shew
his love to the sinner, as withal to shew his
hatred to sin. Therefore he that names the
name of Jesus must depart from iniquity,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. and deny all ungodliness; and
he that hath hope of life by Christ must purifie
himself as he is pure, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12.
otherwise Christ would be thought a fautor of
sin. The Lord Jesus would have all the world
to know, though he pardon sin, he will not
protect it. If holy <hi>David</hi> shall say, <hi>depart from
me all you workers of iniquity, Psal.</hi> 6. 8. and
shall shut the doors against them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 7.
shall not such much more expect it from Christs
holiness? Would it be for his honour, to have
the dogs to the table? or to lodge the swine
with his children? or to have <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
to be a nest of Vipers.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Against his Offices.</hi> God hath exalted
him to be a <hi>Prince and a Saviour, Acts.</hi> 5. 31. he
should act against both, should he save men in
their sins. It is the Office of a King.

(so continuing) and take those to reign
with him, that would not that he should reign

his office. He therefore reigns, that he
may put his enemies under his feet: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
25. now should he lay them in his bosom he
should cross the end of his regal power. It
belongs to Christ, as King, to subdue the
hearts, and slay the lusts of his chosen, <hi>Psal.</hi>
45. 5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3. What King would take
the rebels, in open hostility, into his Court?
What were this but to betray Life, Kingdom,
Government and all together? If Christ be a
King, he must have homage, honour, subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp;c. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. now to save men while in
their natural enmity, were to obscure his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
lose his authority, bring contempt on his
Government, and sell his dear-bought rights for
nought.</p>
               <p>Again, as Christ should not be a Prince, so
neither a Saviour, if he should do this. For
his Salvation is spiritual, he is called Jesus,
because he saves his people <hi>from</hi> their sins,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. So that should he save them <hi>in</hi> their
sins, he should be neither Lord nor Jesus. To
save men from the punishment, and not
from the power of sin, were to do his work by
halves, and be an imperfect Saviour. His office,
as the <hi>Deliverer,</hi> is, <hi>to turn away ungodliness from</hi>
Jacob, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>He is sent to bless men in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43891:58"/>
turning form them their iniquities, Acts</hi> 3. 26.
<hi>to make an end of sin, Dan.</hi> 9. 24. so that he
should destroy his own designs, and nullify
his offices, to save men abiding in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted estate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Application.</hi> Arise then, what meanest thou
O sleeper? Awake, O secure sinner, left thou
be consumed in thine iniquities. Say as the
Lepers, <hi>if we sit here we shall die,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 3, 4.
Verily, it is not more certain thou art now out
of hell, than that thou shalt speedily be in it,
except thou repent and be converted: there is
but this one door for thee to escape by. Arise
then, O sluggard, and shake off thine excuses.
How long wilt thou slumber, and fold thine
hands to sleep? <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 10, 11. Wilt thou lie
down in the midst of the Sea, or sleep on the
top of the mast, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 24. There is no
remedy; but thou must either turn or burn.
There is an unchangeable necessity of the
change of thy condition, except thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to bide the worst of it, and try it out
with the Almighty. If thou lovest thy life,
O man, arise, and come away. Methinks I
see the Lord Jesus laying the merciful hands
of an holy violence upon thee: methinks he
carries it like the Angels to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19. 15.

thou shouldest yet harden thy self in thy sinful
state! But none of you can say, but you have
had fair warning. Yet methinks I cannot tell
how to leave you so. It is not enough to me
to have delivered my own soul. What, shall
I go away without my errand? Will none of
you arise, and follow me? Have I been all
this while speaking in the wind? Have I been
charming the deaf adder, or allaying the tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Ocean with arguments? Do I speak to
the trees or rocks, or to men? to the tombs
and monuments of the dead, or to a living
auditory? If you be men, and not senseless
stocks, stand still, and consider whither you
be going, If you have the reason and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of men, dare not to run into the flames,
and fall into hell with your eyes open: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
your selves, and set to the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
What, men, and yet run into the
pit, when the very beasts will not be forced in!
What, endowed with reason, and yet dally
with death and hell, and the vengeance of the
Almighty! Are men herein distinguished from
the very bruits, that they have no foresight of,
and a care to provide for the things to come;
and will you not hasten your escape from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
torments? O shew your selves men, and let
reason prevail with you: is it a reasonable
thing for you to contend against the Lord your
maker? <hi>Esay</hi> 45. 9. or to harden your selves
against his word? <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 4. as though the
strength of <hi>Israel</hi> would lie? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 29.
Is it reasonable that an understanding creature
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43891:59"/>
should lose, yea live quiet against the very end
of his being, and be as a broken pitcher, only
fit for the dunghill? Is it tolerable, that the
only thing in this world that God hath made
capable of knowing his will, and bringing him
glory, should yet live in ignorance of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and be unserviceable to his use, yea should
be engaged against him, and spit his venom in
the face of his creator? Hear, O Heavens,
and give ear, O earth, and let the creatures

               <p>But I know you will not be perswaded, but
the greatest part will be as they have been, and

to his deceit again, and the lustful wanton to

you where you were! in your ignorance or

some sighs over my perishing hearers.</p>
               <p>O distracted sinners! What will their end

<hi>Whither will they flee for help? Where will they
leave their glory? Esay,</hi> 10. 3. How powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath sin bewitched them? How effectually
hath the God of this world blinded them?
How strong is their delusion? How uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
their ears? How obdurate their hearts?
Satan hath them at his beck: but how long
may I call, and can get no answer? I may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
with them year after year, and they
will give me the hearing, and that is all. They
must and will have their sins, say what I

Sometimes that the terror of the Lord will

as they did. They will not deny me, yet they
will not obey me. They will flock to the
word of God, and sit before me as his people,
and hear my words: but they will not do them.
They value and will plead for Ministers; and
I am to them as the lovely song of one that
hath a pleasant voice: yet I cannot get them
to come under Christs yoke. They love me,
and will be ready to say they will do any thing
for me: but for my life I cannot perswade
them to leave their sins, to forgo their evil
company, their intemperance, their unjust
gains, &amp;c. I cannot prevail with them, to
set up prayer in their families and closets: yet
they will promise me, like the forward son, that

perswade them to learn the principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
though else <hi>they will die without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

but they will not believe, but 'tis well enough.
If I tell them particularly, I fear for such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
their state is bad, they will judge me cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious:
or, if they be at present a little awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,

and have lost the sense of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas for my poor hearers! Must they perish

with them that I have not tryed?</hi> What shall
I do for the daughter of my people? <hi>Jer. 9. 7.</hi>
O Lord God help. Alas, shall I leave them thus!
If they will not hear me, yet do thou hear me. Oh
that they might yet live in thy sight! Lord save
them, or else they perish. My heart would melt to
see their houses on fire about their ears, when they
were fast in their beds: and shall not my soul be
moved within me to see them falling into endless
perdition? Lord have compassion, and save them
out of the burning. Put forth thy divine power, and
the work will be done: but as for me, I can't prevail.</p>

               <p>WHile we keep aloof in generals, there

awakened by the Prophets hovering at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
in parabolical insinuations: he is forced
to close with him, and tell him home, <hi>Thou art

of the new birth; but they have a self delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
confidence, that the work is not now to
do. And because they know themselves free
from that gross hypocrisie, that doth take up
Religion meerly for a colour to deceive others,
and for the covering of wicked designs, they
are confident of their sincerity, and suspect not
that more close hypocrisie (where the greatest

danger lies) by which man deceiveth his own
soul, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 26. But mans deceitful heart is
such a matchless cheat, and self delusion so

displicency, or the necessity of the undeceiving
work that I am now upon. Alas for my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted

or undone. But how shall this be effected?
<hi>Hic labor, hoc opus est.</hi>

               <p>Help, O all searching light, and let thy discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
eye discover the rotten foundation of the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiver;
and lead me, O Lord God, as thou didst
thy Prophet, into the chambers of Imagery, and
dig through the wall of sinners hearts, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the hidden abominations that are lurking out,
of sight in the dark. O send thine Angel before
me; to open the sundry Wards of their hearts, as
thou didst before <hi>Peter,</hi> and make even the Iron
gates to fly open of their own accord. And as
<hi>Jonathan</hi> no sooner tasted the Honey, but his
eyes were enlightned: so grant, O Lord, that
when the poor deceived souls, with whom I have to
do, shall cast their eyes into these lines, their minds
may be illuminated, and their consciences convinced

and hear with their ears, and be converted, and
thou maist heal them.</p>
               <p>This must be premised, before we proceed
to the discovery, that it is most certain men may
have a confident perswasion, that their hearts
and states be good, and yet be unsound. Hear

more covertly. The Apostle reckons up some,

and as I prophesied, there was a noise
and behold a shaking, and the bones came together
bone to his bone. And when I beheld, Loe the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news

So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath

               <p>Sinner, methinks this should go like a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to thine heart, to know that God is thine
enemy. Oh whither wilt thou go, where
wilt thou shelter thee? There is no hope for
thee unless thou lay down thy weapons, and
sue out thy pardon, and get Christ to stand thy
friend, and make thy peace. If it were not
for this, thou mightest go into some howling
wilderness, and there pine in sorrow, and run
mad for anguish of heart and horrible despair.
But in Christ there is a possibility of mercy for
thee, yea a proffer of mercy to thee, that thou
maist have God to be more for thee, than he is
now against thee. But if thou wilt not forsake
thy sins, nor turn throughly and to purpose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, by a sound Conversion, the wrath of
God abideth on thee, and he proclaims himself
to be against thee, as in the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5. 8.
<hi>Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I even
I am against thee.</hi>

whom God shall set his face against. When
he did but look upon the host of the Egyptians,
how terrible was the consequence? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 8.
<hi>I will set my face against that man, and will make
him a sign, and a proverb, and will cut him off
from the midst of my people, and you shall know
that I am the Lord.</hi> 2. <hi>His heart is against thee:

<hi>Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my

               <p>First, <hi>His Iustice is like a flaming sword un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheathed

in which he must be weighed, and the

and wrath, tribulation and anguish, to every
soul that doth evil, Rom.</hi> 2. 8, 9. It curseth every

               <p>Secondly, <hi>The holiness of God is full of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy

<hi>Who shall stand before this holy Lord God?</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The power of God is mounted like a

power is to be displayed, in the wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion

<hi>If he will contend with him, he cannot answer
him one of a thousand. He is wise in heart,
and mighty in strength; who hath hardened
himself against him, and prospered? Which
removeth the Mountains and they know it not,
which overturneth them in his anger. Which
shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars
thereof tremble. Which commandeth the Sun, and
it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. Behold he
taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say
unto him, what dost thou? If God will not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under
him. Job 9. 3, 4, 5, 6. &amp;c.</hi> And art thou a fit
match for such an antagonist? Oh <hi>consider this,
you that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces, and
there be none to deliver you. Ps.</hi> 50. 22. Submit

threatnings of Gods word, that stand upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
against thee? Dost thou believe their truth,
or not? If not, thou art a wretched in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idel,
and not a Christian; and therefore give over
the name and hopes of a Christian. But if thou
dost believe them, O heart of steel that thou
hast, that canst walk up and down in quiet,
when the truth and Faithfulness of God is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43891:77"/>
to destroy thee: that if God Almighty
can do it, thou shalt surely perish, and be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Why man, the whole book of God doth
testifie against thee, while thou remainest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified:
it condemns thee in every leaf, and
is to thee, like <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> roll, written within and
without with lamentation, and mourning, and
woe: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 10. and all this shall surely come
upon thee and overtake thee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 15. except
thou repent. <hi>Heaven and earth shall pass away,
but one jot, or tittle of this word shall never pass
away. Mat.</hi> 5. 18.</p>
               <p>Now put all this together, and tell me, if the
case of the Unconverted be not deplorably mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.
As we read of some persons, that had
bound themselves in an oath, and in a curse
to kill <hi>Paul:</hi> so thou must know, O sinner, to
thy terror, that all the attributes of the infinite
God are bound in an oath to destroy thee, <hi>Heb.</hi>
3. 18. O man what wilt thou do? whither wilt
thou fly? If Gods omnisciency can find thee,
thou shalt not escape. If the true and faithful
God will save his oath, perish thou must, except
thou believe and repent. If the Almighty hath
power to torment thee, thou shalt be perfectly
miserable in soul and body to all eternity, unless
it be prevented by thy speedy Conversion.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>The whole creation of God is against thee.
The whole creation (saith</hi> Paul) <hi>groaneth and
travelleth in pain. Rom.</hi> 8. 22. But what is it
that the creation groaneth under? why, the
fearful abuse that it is subject to, in serving the
lusts of unsanctified men. And what is it that
the creation groaneth for? why, for freedom
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43891:77"/>
and liberty from this abuse; for <hi>the creature is
very unwillingly subject to this bondage. Rom.</hi> 8.
19, 20, 21. If the unreasonable and inanimate
creatures had speech and reason, they would
cry out under it, as bondage unsufferable, to
be abused by the ungodly, contrary to their
natures, and the ends that the great Creatour
made them for. It is a passage of an eminent
Divine; The liquor that the drunkard drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
if it had reason as well as a man, to know
how shamefully 'tis abused and spoiled, it
would groan in the barrels against him, it
would groan in the Cup against him, it would
groan in his throat, in his belly against him. It
would fly in his face, if it could speak. And
if God should open the mouth of the Creatures,
as he did the mouth o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

converted, it would groan against him. This
land would groan to bear him, the air would
groan to give him breathing, their houses
would groan to lodge them, their beds would
groan to ease them, their food to nourish them,
their cloaths to cover them, and the creature
would groan to give them any help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
so long as they live in sin against God.
Thus far he. Methinks this should be a terrour
to an unconverted soul, to think that he is a
burden to the Creation. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Cut

poor inanimate creatures could but speak,
they would say to the ungodly, as <hi>Moses</hi> to

<hi>Lord, Must I give this man breath, to set his
tongue against He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vent his pride and wrath, aud filthy communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and belch out oaths and blasphemy against
thee? No, if thou but say the word: he shall be
breathless for me.</hi> His poor beast would say,
<hi>Lord, must I carry him upon his wicked designs?
No, I will break his bones, I will end his days rather,
if I may have but leave from thee.</hi> A wicked man
the earth groans under him, and Hell groans
for him, till death satisfies both, and unburdens
the earth, and stops the mouth of Hell with
him. While the Lord of Hosts is against thee,
be sure the Hosts of the Lord are against thee,
and all the creatures as it were up in arms, till
upon a mans conversion, the controversie being
taken up between God and him, he makes a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of peace with the creatures for him. <hi>Iob</hi>
5. 22, 23, 24. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>The roaring Lion hath his full power upon

2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Not that they do intend to do him
homage and worship, they will be ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
him, and him that should say so by them;
but all this while they serve him, and come and
go at his beck, and live under his Government.
His servants you are, to whom you yield your
selves to obey. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. O how many then
will be found the real servants of the Devil, that
take themselves for no other than the children
of God? he can no sooner offer a sinful delight
or opportunity for your unlawful advantage,
but you embrace it. If he suggest a lie, or
prompt you to revenge, you readily obey. If
he forbid you to read, or pray, you hearken to
him, and therefore his servants you are. Indeed
he lies behind the curtain, he acts in the dark
and sinners see not who setteth them on work:
but all the while he leads them in a string.
Doubtless the lyar intends not a service to Satan
but his own advantage: yet 'tis he that stands
in the corner unobserved, and putteth the thing
into his heart. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44. Question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>Iudas</hi> when he sold his Master for money,

<hi>Iohn.</hi> 13. 27. <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 12, 15, 17. Men may

O that I could but give thee to see how

thou dost, how merciless a Tyrant thou gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiest,
all whose pleasure is, to set thee on work
to make thy perdition and damnation sure, and

but this is that which seals thy misery upon thee.
While unconverted, none of thy sins are blotted

thee. Regeneration and remission are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. Beloved, it's a fearful

for there is no arrest so formidable as his, no
prison so horrible as his. Look upon an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43891:79"/>
sinner, who feels the weight of his own
guilt, and oh how frightful are his looks, how
fearful are his complaints! His comforts are
turned into wormwood, and his moisture into
drought, and his sleep departeth from his eyes.
He is a terrour to himself and all that are about
him, and is ready to envy the very stones that
lie in the street, because they are sensless, and
feel not his misery; and wishes he had been a
dog, or a toad, or serpent rather than a man,
because then death had put an end to his misery,
whereas now it will be but the biginning of that
which will know no ending.</p>
               <p>How light soever you may make of it now,
you will one day find the guilt of unpardoned
sin to be a heavy burden. This is a milstone that
whosoever falleth upon it shall be broken, but
upon whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him
to powder. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 44. What work did it
make with our Saviour? It pressed the very
blood (to a wonder) out of his veins, and
broke all his bones: and if it did this in the
green tree, what will it do in the dry?</p>
               <p>Oh think of thy case in time. Canst thou
think of that threat without trembling, <hi>Ye shall
die in your sins, Ioh.</hi> 8. 24. Oh better were
it for thee to die in a goal, die in a ditch, in a
dungeon, than die in thy sins. If death, as
it will take away all thy other comforts, would
take away thy sins too, it were some mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But thy sins will follow thee, when thy
friends leave thee, and all worldly enjoyments
shake hands with thee. Thy sins will not die
with thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners

with thee, there to be thine accusers; and
they will to hell with thee, there to be thy tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.
Better to have so many fiends and
furies about thee, than thy sins to fall upon thee
and fasten in thee. Oh the work thot these will
make with thee! Oh look over thy debts in
time! How much art thou in the books of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of Gods laws? How is every one of
Gods commandments ready to arrest thee, and
take thee by the throat for innumerable bonds
that it hath upon thee? What wilt thou then
do, when they shall altogether lay it in against
thee? Hold open the eyes of conscience to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this, that thou maist despair of thy self, and
be driven to Christ, and fly for refuge, to lay hold
upon the hope that is set before thee. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Thy raginglusts do miserably enslave thee.</hi> While
unconverted, thou art a very servant to sin: it
reigns over thee, and holds thee under its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
till thou art brought within the bond
of Gods covenant. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 34, 36. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16, 17. Now there's
no such Tyrant as sin. Oh the filthy and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
work, that it doth ingage its servants in!
would it not pierce a mans heart to see a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of poor creatures drudging and toiling,
and all to carry together faggots and fuell for
their own burning? Why, this is the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sins drudges. Even while they bless
themselves in their unrighteous gains, while
they sing and swill in pleasures, they are but trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
up wrath and vengeance for their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
burning; they are but laying in powder and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43891:80"/>
bullets, and adding to the pile of <hi>Tophet,</hi> and
flinging in Oyl to make the flame rage the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.
Who would serve such a master, whose

<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
               <p>What a woful spectacle was that poor wretch

tombs, cutting, and wounding of himself?
<hi>Mark</hi> 5. 5. This is thy case, such is thy work.
Every stroke is a thrust at thine heart. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
6. 10. Conscience indeed is now asleep; but
when death and judgment shall bring thee to
thy senses, then thou wilt feel the raging smart
and anguish of every wound. The convinced
sinner is a sensible instance of the miserable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of sin. Conscience flies upon him, and

and yet such a slave is he to his lusts, that on he
must, though he see it will be his endless perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and when the temptation comes, lust
gets the bit in his mouth, breaks all the cords of
his vows and promises, and carries him head-long

and ready to wish thy self dead, under the
weight of his finger: how then wilt thou bear
the Weight of his loyns? The most patient man
that ever was, did curse the day that ever he
was born, <hi>Iob</hi> 3. 1. and even woo death to
come and end his misery, <hi>Iob</hi> 7. 15, 16. when
God did but let out one little drop of his wrath.
How then wilt thou endure, when God shall

The man that runs on the cannons mouth, that

that goeth on still in his trespasses. <hi>Psal</hi> 68. 21.
<hi>For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and

He runneth upon him, even upon his neck, upon the

thee, what a case art thou in? Is it for one that
hath his senses to live in such a condition, and
not to make all possible expedition for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

thee, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. that in the matters of the

forecast thy business, foresee thy danger, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the mischief; but in matters of everlasting
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43891:85"/>
consequence should be slight and careless, as if
they little concerned thee? Why is it nothing
to thee to have all the attributes of God enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
against thee? Canst thou do well without
his favour? Canst thou escape his hands, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
his vengeance? Dost thou hear the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
groaning under thee, and hell groaning for
thee, and yet think thy case good enough? Art
thou in the paw of the Lion, under the power
of corruption, in the dark and noysom prison,
fetter'd with thy lusts, working out thine own
damnation, and is not this worth the consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Wilt thou make light of all the terrours
of the law, of all its curses, and thunderbolts,
as if they were but the report of the Childrens
pot-guns, or thou wert to war with their paper
pellets? dost thou laugh at hell and destruction,
or canst drink the envenomed cup of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties
fury, as if it were but a common poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>Gird up now thy loyns like a man, for I will
demand of thee, and answer thou me. <hi>Iob</hi> 40. 7.
Art thou such a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> as that the scales of
thy pride should keep thee from thy makers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
at thee? Wilt thou esteem his arrows as
straw, and the instruments of death as rotten
wood? Art thou chief of all the children of pride,
even that thou shouldst count his darts as stubble,
and laugh at the shaking of his spear? Art thou
made without fear, and contemnest his barbed
irons? <hi>Iob</hi> 41. Art thou like the horse, that
paweth in the valley, and rejoyceth in his
strength: he goeth out to meet the armed men?
Dost thou mock at fear and art not affrighted,

neither turnest back from Gods sword? When
his quiver ratleth against thee, the glittering
Spear and the shield? <hi>Iob</hi> 39. 21, 22, 23.
Well, if the threats and calls of the word will
not fear thee, nor awaken thee, I am sure
death and judgment will. Oh what wilt thou
do when the Lord cometh forth against thee,
and in his fury falleth upon thee, and thou shalt
feel what thou readest? If when <hi>Daniels</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were cast into the den of Lyons both they
and their wives and their children, the Lyons
had the Mastery of them, and brake all their
bones in pieces, ere ever they came at the bottom
of the den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 24. what shall be done
with thee, when thou fallest into the hands of
the living God? When he shall gripe thee in his
Iron arms, and grind and crush thee to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

and to our God for he will abundantly pardon.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mark 10. 17.</hi> And there came one, and
kneeled to him, and asked him; Good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
what shall I do, that I may inherit
eternal life?</p>
               <p>BEfore thou readest these Directions, I
advise thee, yea I charge thee before
God, and his holy Angels, to resolve
to follow them, (as far as conscience shall be
convinced of their agreeableness to Gods word,
and thy estate,) and call in his assistance, and
blessing that they may succeed. And as I have
sought the Lord, and consuited his oracles,
what advice to give thee; so must thou enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, with that awe, reverence, and purpose
of obedience, that the word of the living God
doth require.</p>
               <p>Now then attend. <hi>Set thine heart unto all
that I shall testifie unto thee this day; for it is
not a vain thing, it is your life, Deut.</hi> 32. 4. 6. This
is the end of all that hath been spoken hitherto,
to bring you to set upon turning, and making use
of Gods means for your Conversion. I would not
trouble you, nor torment you before the time
with the forethoughts of your eternal misery,
but in order to your making your escape.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43891:86"/>
Were you shut up under your present misery,
without remedy, it were but mercy (as one
speaks) to let you alone, that you might take
in that little poor comfort, that you are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, here in this world. But you may yet
be happy: if you do not wilfully refuse the
means of your recovery. Behold, I hold open
the door unto you: arise and take your flight.
I set the way of life before you, walk in it, and
you shall live, and not die. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19. <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.
16. It pities me to think, you should be your
own murderers, and throw your selves head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
when God and men cry out to you, as
<hi>Peter</hi> in another case to his master, <hi>Spare thy
self.</hi> A noble Virgin, that attended the Court
of <hi>Spain,</hi> was wickedly ravished by the King;
and hereupon exciting the Duke her Father to
revenge, he called in the Moors to his help,
who when they had executed his design, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
wasted and spoiled the Country: which
this Virgin laying so exceedingly to heart, shut
her self up in a Tower belonging to her Fathers
house, and desired her Father and Mother might
be called forth: and bewailing to them her
own wretchedness, that she should have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
so much misery and desolation to her
Country, for the satisfying of her revenge,
she told them she was resolved to be avenged
upon her self. Her Father and Mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
her to pity her self and them: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would prevail, but she took her leave of
them, and threw her self off the battlements,
and so perished before their faces.</p>
               <p>Just thus is the wilful destruction of ungodly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43891:87"/>
men. The God that made them beseecheth
them, and cryeth out to them, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the
distracted Jaylor, when about to murder him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Do thy self no harm.</hi> The Ministers of
Christ forewarn them and follow them, and
fain would hold them back. But alas! No ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulations,
nor obtestations will prevail; but
men will hurl themselves into perdition, while
pity it self looketh on.</p>
               <p>What shall I say? Would it not grieve a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of any humanity, if in the time of a reigning
plague he should have a receipt (as one well)
that would infallibly cure all the Countrey,
and recover the most hopeless patients, and yet
his friends and neighbours should die by the
hundreds about him, because they would not use
it? Men and Brethren, though you carry
the certain symptoms of death in your faces, yet
I have a receipt that will cure you all, that will
cure infallibly. Follow but these few directions,
and if you do not then win Heaven, I will be
content to lose it.</p>
               <p>Hear then, Oh sinner, and as ever thou
wouldst be converted and saved, embrace this
following counsel.</p>
               <p>Dir. I. <hi>Set it down with thy self as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
truth, that it is impossible for thee ever to
get to Heaven, in this thine unconverted state.</hi>
Can any other but Christ save thee? And he
tells thee he will never do it, except thou be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
and converted. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.
3. Doth he not keep the keys of Heaven? And
canst thou get in without his leave, as thou
must, if ever thou comest thither in thy natural

condition, without a sound and through reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
               <p>Dir. II. <hi>Labour to get a thorow sight and lively
sense and feeling of thy sins.</hi> Till men are weary
and heavy laden, and pricked at the heart, and
stark sick of sin, they will not come to Christ
in his way, for ease and cure, nor to purpose
enquire, <hi>What shall we do? Mat.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 12. They must set themselves
down for dead men, before they will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Labour therefore to set all thy sins in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee. Never be afraid to look upon them,
but let thy spirit make diligent search, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.
6. Enquire into thine heart, and into thy life,
Enter into a thorow examination of thy self,
and of all thy wayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 59. that thou
maist make a full discovery; and call in the help
of Gods spirit, in the sense of thine own ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
hereunto: for it is his proper work to
convince of sin. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 8. Spread all before
the face of thy conscience, till thine heart and
eyes be set abroach. Leave not striving with
God, and thine own soul, till it cry out under
the sense of thy sins, as the enlightned Jaylor,
<hi>What must I do to be saved? Acts</hi> 16. 30. To
this porpose</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meditate of the numerousness of thy sins. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi>
heart failed when he thought of this, and
considered that he had more sins than hairs, <hi>Ps.</hi>
40. 12. This made him to cry out upon the
multitudes of Gods tender-mercies. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 1.
The loathsom carcase doth not more hatefully

soul with filthy lusts. They fill the
head, the heart, the eyes and mouth of him.
Look backward, where was ever the place,
what was ever the time, in which thou didst
not sin? Look inward, what part or power
canst thou find in soul or body, but it is poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with sin? What duty dost thou ever perform
into which this poyson is not shed? Oh how
great is the sum of thy debts, who hast been all
thy life long running upon the hooks, and never

                  <hi>Meditate upon the aggravations of thy sin, as
they are the grand enemies against the God of thy
life, against the life of thy soul; in a word they
are the publick enemies of all mankind.</hi> How do
<hi>David, Ezra, Daniel</hi> and the good <hi>Levites</hi> aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
their sins, from the consideration of their
injuriousness to God, their opposition to his
good and righteous Laws, the mercies, the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
that they were committed against. <hi>Nehem.</hi>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43891:88"/>
Iohn</hi> 8. 34. This is the enemy that hath turned
the creation upside down, and sown dissension
between man and the creatures, between man
and man, yea between man and himself, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sensitive part against the rational, will
against judgment, lust against conscience? yea
worst of all, between God and man, making
the lapsed sinner, both hateful to God, and a
hater of him. <hi>Zec.</hi> 11. 8. O man, how canst
thou make so light of sin? This is the traytor
that sucked the blood of the Son of God, that
sold him, that mocked him, that scourged him,
that spat in his face, that digged his hands, that
pierced his side, that pressed his soul, that
mangled his body, that never left, till it had
bound him, condemned him, nailed him, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
him, and put him to open shame. <hi>Esay.</hi>
53. 4, 5, 6. This is that deadly poyson, so
powerful of operation, as that one drop of it,
shed upon the root of mankind, hath corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
spoiled, and poisoned, and undone his
whole race at once. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. This is the
common butcher, the bloody executioner,
that hath killed the Prophets, that hath burnt
the Martyrs, that hath murdered all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
all the Patriarchs, all the Kings and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
that hath destroyed Cities, swallowed
Empires, butchered and devoured whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
What ever was the weapon that 'twas
done by, sin was it that did the execution.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. dost thou yet think it but a small
thing? If <hi>Adam</hi> and all his children could be
digged out of their graves, and their bodies
piled up to Heaven, and an inquest were made,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43891:89"/>
what matchless murderer were guilty of all this
blood: it would be all found in the skirts of
sin. Study the nature of sin, till thy heart be
brought to fear and loath it. And meditate on
the aggravations of thy particular sins, how
thou hast sinned against all Gods warnings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thine own prayers, against mercies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
corrections, against clearest light, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
freest love, against thine own resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
against promises, vows, covenants of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> charge thy heart home with
these things, till it blush for shame, and be

Its due wages is death, damnation. It pulls
the curse of God upon the soul and body. <hi>Gal.</hi>

3. 6. This is that that hath defiled, corrupted,

where thou must lie scalding and sweltering in a

tremble as thou readest? Do not thy tears bedew
the paper, and thy heart throb in thy bosom?
Dost thou not yet begin to smite on thy breast,
and bethink thy self what need thou hast of a

without any love and pity to thy self?</p>
               <p>Oh study thy misery, till thy heart do cry
out for Christ, as earnestly, as ever a drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Oh sinner, hear and consider. If thou wilt
part with thy sins, God will give thee his Christ:
Is not this a fair exchange? I testifie unto thee
this day, that if thou perish, it is not because

Alas, what will thy sins do for thee, that thou

thy throat while they smile upon thee, and
poyson thee while they please thee, and arm the

my happiness. Oh! be to me a fountain of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
set on me the stamp and impress of thy holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I will thankfully part with all my sins at
thy command. My willful sins I do forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
forsake; and for my infirmities, that I
cannot get rid of, though I would, I will strive
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43891:95"/>
against them in the use of thy means. I detest them,
and will pray and war against them, and never let
them have quiet rest in my soul.</hi> Beloved, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
of you will thus accept the Lord for his
God, he shall have him.</p>
               <p>Again, he tells you; I am the All-sufficient
God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. Will you lay all at my feet,
and give it up to my dispose, and take me for
your only portion? Will you own and honour
mine All-sufficiency? Will you take me as your
happiness and Treasure, your hope and bliss?
I am a Sun and Shield, all in one: will you
have me for your all? <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 11.
Now what dost thou say to this? Doth thy
mouth water after the onions and flesh-pots
of <hi>Egypt?</hi> art thou loath to exchange thy
earthly happiness, for a part in God: and
though thou wouldest be glad to have God and
the world too, yet thou canst not think of
having him, and nothing but him, but hadst
rather take up with the earth below, if God
would but let thee keep it, as long as thou
wouldst? This is a fearful sign. But now if
thou art willing to sell all for the Pearl of
great price; <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 46. If thine heart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>Lord I desire no other portion but thee. Take
the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl whoso will, so
I may have the light of thy countenance. I pitch
upon thee for my happiness. I gladly venture my
self on thee, and trust my self with thee. I set
my hopes in thee, I take up my rest with thee. Let
me hear thee say, I am thy God, thy salvation,
and I have enough, all I wish for. I will make
no terms with thee, but for thy self. Let me but
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43891:95"/>
have thee sure, let me be able to make my claim,
and see my title to thy self, and for other things,
I leave them to thee. Give me more, or less, any
thing or nothing, I will be satisfied in my God.</hi>
Take him thus and he is thine own.</p>
               <p>Again, he tells you; I am the Soveraign
Lord. If you will have me for your God, you
must give me the supremacy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. I
will not be an underling. You must not make
me a second to sin, or any worldly interest. If
you will be my people, I must have the rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you. You must not live at your own list.
Will you come under my yoke? Will you bow
to my Government? Will you submit to my
discipline? to my word, to my rod? Sinner,
what sayest thou to this? <hi>Lord I had rather be at
thy command, than live at mine own list. I had
rather have thy will to be done, than mine. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of and consent to thy laws, and account it my
priviledge to lie under them. And though the flesh
rebel, and often break over bounds, I am resolved
to take no other Lord but thee. I willingly take the
Oath of thy supremacy and acknowledge thee for my
liege Soveraign, and resolve all my days to pay the
tribute of worship, obedience, and love, and service
to thee, and to live to thee as the end of my life.</hi> This
is a right accepting of God.</p>
               <p>To be short, he tells you; I am the true and
faithful God. If you will have me for your God,
you must be content to trust me, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 5. Will you venture your selves upon my
word, &amp; depend on my faithfulness, and take my
bond for your security? Will you be content to
follow me, in poverty, &amp; reproach, and affliction
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43891:96"/>
here, and to see much going out, and little
coming in, and to tarry till the next world for
your preferment? <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 21. I deal much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
trust, will you be content to labour, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and to tarry for your returns till the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the just? <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 14. The womb
of my Promise will not presently bring forth;
will you have the patience to wait? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
36. Now beloved, what say you to this? Will
you have this God for your God? Will you be
content to live by faith, and trust him for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
happiness, an unseen Heaven, an unseen
Glory? Do your hearts answer, <hi>Lord, we will
venture our souls upon thee, we commit our selves
to thee: we roll upon thee, we know whom we have
trusted: we are willing to take thy word: we will
prefer thy promises, before our own possessions; and
the hopes of Heaven, before all the enjoyments of
the Earth. We will wait thy leisure. What thou
wilt here, so that we may have but thy faithful
promise for Heaven hereafter?</hi> If you can in truth,
and upon deliberation, thus accept of God,
he will be yours. Thus there must be, in a
right Conversion to God, a closing with him
suitable to his excellencies. But when men
close with his mercy, but not with his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hating
holiness and purity; or will take him for
their benefactor, but not for their Soveraign;
or for their Patron, but not for their Portion,
this is no thorow, and so no sound Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Dir. VII. <hi>Accept of the Lord Iesus, in all his
Offices, with all his inconveniences, as thine.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these terms Christ may be had. Sinner,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43891:96"/>
thou hast und one thy self, and art plunged into
the ditch of most deplorable misery, out of
which thou art never able to climb up. But
Jesus Christ is able and ready to help thee, and
he freely tenders himself to thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 7. 37. Be thy sins never so many, never
so great, of never so long continuance, yet
thou shalt be most certainly pardoned and saved,
if thou dost not wretchedly neglect the offer,
that in the name of God is here made unto
thee. The Lord Jesus calleth to thee, to look
unto him and be saved, <hi>Esay</hi> 45. 22. to come
unto him, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 37. Yea he is a sutor to thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seecheth

he cryeth in the streets, he knocketh at thy
door, he wooeth thee to except of him, and
live with him: <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. if thou
diest, 'tis because thou wouldst not come to
him for life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 40. Now accept of an
offered Christ, and thou art made for ever.
Now give up thy consent to him, and the
match is made, all the world cannot hinder.
Do not stand off because of thine unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Man, I tell thee, nothing in all the
world can undo thee, but thine unwillingness.
Speak man, art thou willing of the match?
Wilt thou have Christ in all his relations to be
thine; thy King, thy Priest, thy Prophet? Wilt
thou have him with all his inconveniences?
Take not Christ hand over head, but sit down
first, and count the cost. Wilt thou lay all at
his feet? Wilt thou be content to run all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
with him? Wilt thou take thy lot with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43891:97"/>
him, fall where it will? Wilt thou deny thy
self, take up thy Cross, and follow him? Art
thou deliberately, understandingly, freely, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
determined to cleave to him in all times,
and conditions? If so, my soul for thine, thou
shalt never perish, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. but art passed
from death to life. Here lies the main point
of thy salvation, that thou be found in thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-closure
with Jesus Christ, and therefore
if thou love thy life, see that thou be faithful to
God and thy soul here.</p>

me. Come in Lord, to thee I freely open, I consent to

<hi>The memory gives up to Christ:</hi> Lord, here is
a storehouse for thee. Out with this trash; lay
in thy treasure. Let me be a granary, a reposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of thy truths, thy promises, thy Providences,
<hi>The Conscience comes in;</hi> Lord I will ever side
with thee. I will be thy faithful register. I will
warn when the sinner is tempted, and smite when
thou art offended. I will witness for thee, and
judge for thee, and guide into thy ways, and will
never let sin have quiet in this soul. <hi>The affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
also come in to Christ. O faith Love,</hi> I am
sick of thee. <hi>O saith Desire,</hi> now I have my long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Here's the satisfastion I sought for. Here's
the desire of nations. Here's bread for me, and
balm for me, all that I want. <hi>Fear bows the knee
with awe and veneration.</hi> Welcome Lord, to thee
will I pay my homage. Thy word and thy rod shall
command my motions. Thee will I reverence and
adore, before thee will I fall down and worship.
<hi>Grief likewise puts in,</hi> Lord thy displeasure and
thy dishonour, peoples calamities, and mine own
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43891:98"/>
iniquities shall be that, that shall set me abroach.
I will mourn when thou art offended, I will weep
when thy cause is wounded. <hi>Anger likewise comes
in for Christ:</hi> Lord nothing so enrages me, as my
folly against thee, that I should be so befooled and
bewitched, as to hearken to the flatteries of sin, and
temptations of Satan against thee. <hi>Hatred too will
side with Christ.</hi> I protest mortal enmity with
thine enemies, that I will never be friends with thy
foes. I vow an immortal quarrel with every sin. I
will give no quarter, I will make no peace. <hi>Thus
let all thy powers give up to Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, thou must give up thy whole interest
to him. If there be any thing, that thou keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
back from Christ, it will be thine undoing.
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. 33. Unless thou wilt forsake all (in
preparation and resolution of thy heart) thou
canst not be his Disciple. Thou must hate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother, yea and thine own life also in
comparison of him, and as far as it stands in
competition with him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.
26, 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, thou must give
him thy self, and all that thou hast, without
reservation, or else thou canst have no part in
him.</p>
               <p>Dir. IX. <hi>Make choice of the Laws of Christ as
the rule of thy words, thoughts and actions,</hi> Psal.
119. 30. This is the true Converts choice. But
here remember these three rules. 1. <hi>Thou must
choose them all.</hi> There is no coming to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by a partial obedience. Read <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
6, 128, 160. <hi>Ezek,</hi> 18. 21. None may think it
enough to take up with the cheap and easie
part of Religion, and let alone the duties that are
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43891:98"/>
costly, and self-denying, and grate upon the
interest of the flesh. You must take all, or none.
A sincere Convert, though he makes most
conscience of the greatest sins and weightiest
duties; yet he makes true conscience of little
sins, and of all duties, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. 113. <hi>Mat.</hi>
23. 23. 2. <hi>For all times,</hi> for prosperity, and
for adversity; whether it rain, or shine. A
true Convert is resolved in his way: he will
stand to his choice, and will not set his back to
wind, and be of the religion of the times.
<hi>I have stuck to thy testimonies, I have enclined
my heart to perform thy statutes alway, even to the
end. Thy testimonies have I taken, as an heritage
for ever, Psal.</hi> 119. 31, 111, 117, 44, 93. <hi>I will
have respect unto thy statutes continually.</hi> 3. <hi>This

and understandingly.</hi> That disobedient son said,
<hi>I go sir, but he went not Mat.</hi> 24. 30. How
fairly did they promise: <hi>All that the Lord our
God shall speak unto thee, we will do it;</hi> and
it's like they speak as they meant, but when it

they are very spiritual: they reach the very
thoughts and inclinations of the heart; so that
if you will walk by this rule, your very
thoughts, and inward motions must be under
government. Again, that they are very strict
and self-denying, quite contrary to the grain of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43891:99"/>
your natural inclinations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. You
must take the strait gate, the narrow way, and

that they are very large: for <hi>the Commandment

not in generals,</hi> (for there's much deceit in that)
<hi>but bring down thy heart to the particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Christ.</hi> Those Jews in the Prophet
seemed as well resolved as any in the world,
and call God to witness, that they meant, as
they said. But they stuck in generals. When

to be spent in secret before the Lord.</p>

                  <item>2. In considering distinctly all the terms or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Covenant, expressed in the form here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
proposed.</item>
                  <item>3. In searching thine heart, whether thou art
sincerely willing to forsake all thy sins, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
up thy self, body and soul unto God, and his
service, to serve him in holiness and righteousness
all the dayes of thy life</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Compose thy Spirit into the most
serious frame possible, suitable to transaction
of so high importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Lay hold on the Covenant of God,
and rely upon his promise of giving grace and
strength, whereby thou maist be enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
thy promise. Trust not to thine own
strength to, the strength of thine own resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but take hold on his strength.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Resolve to he faithful, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
thine heart, opened thy mouth, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed

               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Being thus prepared, on some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
time set apart for the purpose, set
upon the work, and in the most solemn manner
possible, as if the Lord were visibly present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thine eyes, fall down on thy knees, and

my debts! If this whole world were filled up
from earth to Heaven with paper, and all this
paper written over within and without by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticians:
yet when all were cast up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it would come unconceivably short of
what I owe to the least of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Wo unto me for my debts are infinite,
and my sins are increased. They are wrongs to
an infinite Majesty: and if he that committeth
Treason against a silken mortal, is worthy to be
tacked, drawn and quartered: what have I
deserved, that have so often lifted up my hand
against Heaven, and have struck at the Crown
and dignity of the Almighty?</p>
                  <p>Oh my sins! my sins! Behold a troop com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth!
Multitudes! multitudes! there is no
number of their Armies. Innumerable evils
have compassed me about; mine iniquities
have taken hold upon me; they have set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in array against me. Oh! it were better
to have all the Regiments of Hell come against
me, than to have my sins to fall upon me, to
the spoiling of my Soul. Lord, how am I sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded!
How many are they that rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me! They have beset me behind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
they swarm within me and without me:
they have possessed all my powers, and have

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ortified mine unhappy soul, as a Garrison,
which this brood of Hell doth man, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
against the God that made me.</p>
                  <p>And they are as mighty, as they be many.
The sands are many, but then they are not
great: the mountains great, but then they are
not many. But wo is me, my sins are as many
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43891:108"/>
as the sands, sand as mighty as the Mountains.
Their weight is greater than their number. It
were better that the Rocks and the Mountains
should fall upon them, than the crushing and
unsupportable load of my own sins. Lord, I
am heavy loaden: let mercy help, or I am gone.
Unload me of this heavy guilt, this sinking
load, or I am crushed without hope, and must
be pressed down to Hell. If my grief were
thorowly weighed, and my sins laid in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances
together, they would be heavier than
the sand of the Sea, therefore my words are
swallowed up: they would weigh down all the
rocks and the hills, and turn the ballance against
all the Isles of the Earth. O Lord, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
my manifold transgressions, and my mighty
sins.</p>
                  <p>Ah my soul! Alas my Glory! Whither art

me! Lord, what a case am I in! Sold under
sin, cast out of Gods favour, accursed from the

cursed in my name, in my estate, my relations,

and my soul within a step of death. Alas! what

I look? God is frowning on me from above?
Hell gaping for me beneath; Conscience imiting

What place can hide me from Omnisciency?
What power can secure me from Omnipotency?</p>
                  <p>What meanest thou O my soul to go on thus?

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43891:109"/>
thou took me away in this estate, I had perished
for ever. And now I adore thy Grace, and
accept the offers of thy mercy. I renounce all
my sins and resolve by thy grace to set my self
against them, and to follow thee in holiness and
righteousness all the days of my life,</p>
                  <p>Who am I, Lord, that I should make any
claim unto thee, or have any part or portion in
thee, who am not worthy to lick up the dust of
thy feet? Yet since thou holdest forth the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Scepter, I am bold to come, and touch. To
despair, would be to disparage thy mercy; and
to stand off when thou biddest me come, would
be at once to undo my self, and rebel against
thee, under pretence of humility. Therefore
I bow my soul unto thee, and with all possible
thankfulness accept thee, as mine, and give up
my self to thee, as thine. Thou shalt be Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
over me, my King, and my God. Thou
shalt be in the Throne, and all my powers shall
bow to thee, they shall come, and worship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy feet. Thou shalt be my portion, O
Lord, and I will rest in thee.</p>
                  <p>Thou callest for my heart. Oh that it were
any way fit for thine acceptance! I am unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
O Lord, everlastingly unworthy to be thine.
But since thou wilt have it so, I freely give up
my heart to thee. Take it, it is thine. Oh that
it were better! But Lord, I put it into thine
hand, who alone canst mend it. Mould it after
thine own heart; make it as thou wouldst have
it, holy, humble, heavenly, soft, tender, flexible,
and write thy Law upon it.</p>
                  <p>Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly: enter in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43891:109"/>
triumphantly: take me up for thy self for ever.
I give up to thee, I come to thee, as the only
way to the Father, as the only Mediator, the
means ordained to bring me to God. I have
dostroyed my self, but in thee is my help. Save,
Lord, or else I perish. I come to thee, with the
rope about my neck. I am worthy to die, and
to be damned. Never was the hire more due to
the servant, never was penny more due to the
labourer, than Death and Hell, my j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is due to me for my sins. But I fly to the merits;
I trust alone to the value and vertue of thy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and prevalency of thine intercession. I
submit to thy teaching, I make choice of thy
Government. Stand open ye everlasting doors,
that the King of Glory may come in.</p>
                  <p>O thou spirit of the most high, the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and sanctifier of thy chosen; come in with
all thy glorious train, all thy Courtly attendants,
thy fruits, and graces. Let me be thine habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
I can give thee, but what is thine own
already: but here with the poor Widow, I
cast my two mites, my soul, and my body, in
to thy treasury; fully resigning them up to thee,
to be sanctified by thee, to be servants to thee,
They shall be thy patients; cure thou their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies:
they shall be thy agents; govern thou
their motions. Too long have I served the world;
too long have I hearkned to Satan: but now I
renounce them all, and will be ruled by thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates,
and directions, and guided by thy counsel.</p>
                  <p>O blessed Trinity, O glorious Unity, I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up my self to thee: receive me: write thy
name, O Lord, upon me, and upon all that I
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43891:110"/>
have, as thy proper goods. Set thy mark upon
me, upon every member of my body, and every
faculty of my soul. I have chosen thy precepts.
Thy Law will I lay before me: this shall be the
copy, which I will keep in my eye, and study to
write after. According to this rule do I resolve,
by thy Grace, to walk: after this law shall my
whole man be governed. And though I cannot
per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I will allow my self in the breach of none. I
know my flesh will hang back: but I resolve, in
the power of thy Grace, to cleave to thee, and
thy holy ways, what ever it cost me. I am sure
I cannot come off a loser by thee: and therefore
I will be content with reproach, and difficulties
and hardships here, and will deny my self, and
take up my Cross, and follow thee. Lord Jesus
thy Yoke is easie, thy Cross is welcome, as it is
the way to thee. I lay aside all hopes of a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happiness. I will be content to tarry till I
come to thee. Let me be poor and low, little
and despised here, so I may but be admitted to
live, and raign with thee hereafter. Lord, thou
hast my heart and hand to this agreement. Be it
as the laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> never to
be reversed. To this I will stand: in this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
by Grace, I will live and die. I have
sworn, and will perform it, that I will keep thy
righteous judgments. I have given my free
consent, I have made my everlasting choice.
Lord, Jesus confirm the contract.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Containing the Motives to Conversion.</head>
               <p>THough what is already said of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Conversion, and of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of the unconverted, might be
sufficient to induce any considering
mind to resolve upon a present turning, or
Conversion unto God: yet knowing what a
piece of desperate obstinacy and untractable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the heart of man naturally is, I have thought
it necessary, to add to the means of Conversion,
and Directions for a Covenant-closure with God
in Christ, some <hi>Motives</hi> to perswade you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>O Lord, fail me not now at my last attempts. If
any soul hath read hitherto, and be yet untouched,
now Lord fasten in him, and do thy work: Now
take him by the heart, overcome him, perswade
him, till he say, Thou hast prevailed, for thou
wast stronger than I Lord, didst thou not make me
a fisher of men? And have I toyled all this while
and caught nothing? Alas, that I should have
spent my strength for nought! And now I am cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my last: Lord Iesus stand thou upon the shore,
and direct, how, and where I shall spread my net;
and let me so enclose with arguments the souls I
seek for, that they may not be able to get out. Now
Lord for a multitude of souls! now for a full
draught! O Lord God, remember me I pray thee,
and strengthen me this once, O God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:43891:111"/>But I turn me unto you.</p>
               <p>Men and Brethren, Heaven and Earth do
call upon you, yea Hell it self doth preach the
Doctrine of repentance unto you. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of the Churches travel with you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19.
the Angels of Heaven wait for you, for your
repenting and turning unto God. O sinner, why
should the Devils make merry with thee? why
shouldst thou be a morsel for that devouring
<hi>Leviathan?</hi> Why should harpies and hell-hounds
tear thee, and make a feast upon thee,
and when they have got thee into the snare,
and have fastned their talons in thee, laugh at
thy destruction, and deride thy misery, and
sport themselves with thy damnable folly? This
must be thy case, except thou turn. And were
it not better thou shouldst be a joy to Angels,
than a laughing-stock and sport for devils? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
if thou wouldst but come in, the Heavenly
Host would take up their anthems, and sing,
<hi>Glory be to God in the highest;</hi> the morning Stars
would sing together, and all the sons of God
shout for joy, and celebrate this new creation as
they did the first. Thy repentance would as it
were make holy-day in heaven, and the glorious
spirits would rejoyce, in that there is a new bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
added to their society <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 9. another
heir born to their Lord, and the lost son received
safe and sound. The true penitents tears are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the wine that cheereth both God and man.</p>
               <p>If it be little, that men and Angels would
rejoyce at thy Conversion, know that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
would rejoyce over thee, even with sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and rest in his love, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Esay.</hi> 62. 5.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43891:111"/>
Never did old <hi>Iacob</hi> with such joy weep over
the neck of his <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as thy heavenly Father
would rejoyce over thee, upon thy comming in
to him. Look over the story of the <hi>Prodigal.</hi>
Methinks I see how the aged Fathers laies aside
his state, and forgets his years: behold how
he runneth! <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 20. Oh the hast that
mercy makes! The sinner makes not half that
speed. Methinks I see how his bowels turn,
how his compassions yearn. (How quick sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is love!) Mercy spies him a great way off,
forgets his rigorous courses, unnatural rebellion,
horrid unthankfulness, debauched practices,
(not a word of those) but receives him with
open arms, clasps about his neck, forgets the
nastiness of his rags, kisses the lips that deserve
to be loathed, the lips that had been joyned to
harlots, that had been commoners with the
swine, calls for the fatted Calf, the best Robe,
the ring, the shoos, the best cheer in Heavens
store, the best attire in Heavens Wardrobe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
yea the joy cannot be held in one breast; <hi>Luke</hi>
15. 6, 9, 23. others must be called to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,
the friends must meet and make merry.
Angels must wait, but the <hi>Prodigal</hi> must be set
at the Table under his Fathers wing. He is the
joy of the feast: he is the sweet subject of the
Fathers delight. The friends sympathize, but
none knows the felicity the father takes in
his new born son; whom he hath received from
the dead. Methinks I hear the musik and
the dancing, at a distance. Oh the melody
of the Heavenly Choristers! I cannot learn the
song, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 3. but methinks I over-hear
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43891:112"/>
the burden, at which all the harmonious quire
with one consent strikes sweetly in, for thus
goes the round at Heavens table, <hi>For this my son
was dead, and is alive again; was lost and is
found, Luke</hi> 15. 23, 24, 32. I need not farther
explain the parable. God is the Father, Christ
the cheer, his righteousness the robe, his graces
the ornaments, Ministers, Saints, Angels the
friends and servants, and thou that readest (if
thou wilt but unfeignedly repent and turn) the
welcom <hi>Prodigal,</hi> the happy instance of all this
grace, and the blessed subject of this joy and love.</p>
               <p>Oh Rock! Oh Adamant! What not moved
yet! not yet resolved to turn forthwith and
to close with mercy! I will try thee yet
once again: If one were sent to thee from the
dead, wouldst thou be perswaded? Why hear
the voice from the dead, from the damned,
crying to thee that thou shouldst repent. <hi>I pray
thee that thou wouldst send him to my fathers house:
for I have five brethren, that he may testifie unto
them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
If one went unto them from the dead, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
Luke</hi> 16. 27, 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hear O man, thy
Predecessors in impenitence Preach to thee from
the infernal gibbets, from the flames, from the
rack, that thou shouldst repent. O look down
into the bottomless pit. Seest thou how the
smoak of their torment ascendeth for ever and

How furious are their torments? 'Tis their

meat and drink, to see how their flesh frieth

and their fat droppeth, to drench them with
burning metal, and to rip open their bodies,
and to pour in the fierce burning brass into their
bowels, and the recesses and ventricles of their
hearts. What thinkest thou of those chains of
darkness, of those instruments of cruelty?
Canst thou be content to burn? Seest thou how

how the fire rageth? what saist thou to that

the blasphemies, the weepings and the wailings,

and yell, and gnash their teeth? how deep
are their groans? how feeling are their moans?
how unconceivable their miseries? If the
shrieks of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> were

their moans and miseries, this is the piercing,

Why, as God liveth, that made thy soul, thou

suggest. If there be any point of wisdom in
all the world, it is to repent and come in: if
there be any thing righteous, any thing reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
this is it. If there be any thing in the
world that may be called madness, and folly,
any thing that may be counted sottish, absurd,
brutish, unreasonable, it is this, to go on in thine
unconverted estate. Let me beg thee, as thou
wouldst not wilfully destroy thy self, to sit down
and weigh, besides what hath been said, these
following <hi>Motives,</hi> and let conscience speak, if it
be not reason, that thou shouldst repent and turn.</p>
               <p>1. The God that made thee doth most graciously

what can we do? deeper than hell, what
can we know? <hi>Iob</hi> 11. 7, 8, 9. <hi>He is full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,

to perswade sinners to come in. <hi>Turn unto the
Lord your God, for he is gracious, and merciful,
slow to anger, of great kindness, and repenteth him
of the evil.</hi> If God would not repent of the
evil, it were some discouragement to us, why
we should not repent. If there were no hope
of mercy, it were no such wonder if the rebel did
stand out: but never had subjects such a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

father, if the Prophet had bid thee do some great
thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much
rather, when he saith unto thee, wash and be clean?</hi>
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 13. If God had demanded some
terrible, some severe and rigorous thing of you,
to escape eternal damnation, would you not
have done it? suppose it had been to spend all
your days in sorrow in some howling Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or pine your selves with famine, or to offer
the fruit of your bodies for the sin of your souls,
would you not have thankfully accepted eternal
redemption, though these had been the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Yea further, if God should have told you,
you should have fryed in the fire for millions of
ages, or been tormented so long in Hell, would
you not have gladly accepted it? Alas, all these
are not so much as one sand in the glass of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
If your offended Creator should have held
you but one year upon the rack, and then come
and bid you take your choice, whether you
would renounce your sins, accept his Christ, and
serve him a few years in self-denyal, or lie in this
case for ever and ever: do you think you should
have stuck at the offer, and disputed the terms,
and have been unresolved, whether you were
best to accept of the motion? O sinner return
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43891:118"/>

to be had for the taking, and mercy should be
beholding to thee (as it were) to be saved?
Couldst thou say indeed, <hi>Lord I knew that thou
wast an hard man, Mat.</hi> 25. 24. thou hadst some
little excuse; but when the God of heaven hath

your selves you can do nothing, yet you may do
all things through his spirit enabling you, and
he doth offer his assistance to you. God bids
you, <hi>wash you and make you clean: Esay.</hi> 1. 16.
you say you are unable as much as the Leopard
to wash out his spots: <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. 23. yea but the
Lord doth offer to purge you, so that if you be
filthy still, 'tis through your own wilfulness. <hi>Eze,</hi>
24. 13. <hi>I have purged thee, and thou wast not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>
Jer. 13. 27. <hi>O</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>wilt thou not be
made clean? when shall it once be?</hi> God doth
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43891:119"/>
wait when you will be made clean, when you
will yield to his motions and accept of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
and let him do for and in you, what you
cannot do of your selves. You do not know
how much God will do, upon your importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
if you will but be restless and instant with
him. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 8. <hi>and</hi> 18. 5.</p>
               <p>If God hath not bound himself by express
promise to wicked men, to give them Grace
in the diligent use of the means: yet he hath
given them abundant encouragement to expect
it from him, if they seek it earnestly in his way.
His most gracious nature is abundant encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.
If a rich and most bountiful man
should see thee in misery, and bid thee come to
his door, wouldst thou not with confidence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
at thy coming to find some relief? Thou
art not able to believe, nor repent; God appoints
thee to use such and such means, in order to
thy obtaining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith and repentance: doth not
this argue, that God will bestow these upon thee,
if thou dost ply him diligently in prayer, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
reading, hearing, self-examination, and
the rest of his means? Otherwise, God should
but mock his poor creatures, to put them upon
these self denying endeavours, and then when
they have put hard to it, and continued waiting
upon him for grace, deny them at last. Surely
if a sweet-natured man would not deal thus,
much less will the most merciful and gracious
God.</p>
               <p>I intended to have added many other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:

               <p>And now my brethren let me know your
minds. What do you intend to do? Will you
go on and die, or will you set upon a thorow
and speedy conversion, and hold on eternal
life? how long will you linger in <hi>Sodom?</hi> how
long will you halt between two opinions? 1
<hi>King.</hi> 18. 21. Are you not yet resolved whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christ or <hi>Barabbas,</hi> whether bliss or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether the land <hi>Cabul, 1 Kings</hi> 9.
13. or the Paradise of God, be the better choice?
Is it a disputable case, whether the <hi>Abana</hi> and
<hi>Pharphar</hi> of <hi>Damascus,</hi> be better than all the
streams of <hi>Eden?</hi> or whether the vile puddle
of sin, be to be preferred before the water of
life, clear as Crystal, proceeding out of the
throne of God and of the Lamb? Can the world
in good earnest do that for you, that Christ can?
Will it stand by you to eternity? will pleasures,
titles, lands, treasures, descend with you, <hi>Psal.</hi>
49. 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 7. If not, had you not need
look after somewhat that will? What mean
you to stand wavering, to be off and on? Foolish
Children! how long will you stick between the
womb and the world? Shall I leave you at last
no farther than <hi>Agrippa,</hi> but <hi>almost</hi> perswaded?
Why, you are for ever lost, if left here. As
good not at all, as not altogether Christians.
You are half of the mind to give over your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
negligent life, and to set to a strict and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
course: you could wish that you were as some
others be, and could do as they can do. How
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43891:120"/>
long will you rest in idle wishes, and fruitless
purposes? when will you come to a fixed, full,
and firm resolve? Do not you see how Satan
gulls you, by tempting you to delays? How long
hath he toll'd you on in the way of perdition?
how many years have you been purposing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
what if God should have taken you off
this while?</p>
               <p>Well, put me not off with a dilatory answer.
Tell not me of <hi>hereafter.</hi> I must have your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
consent. If you be not now resolved, while
the Lord is treating with you, and woing of
you, much less are you like to be hereafter, when
these impressions are worn out, and you are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
through the deceitfulness of sin. Will you
give me your hands? Will you set open the
doors, and give the Lord Jesus the full and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
possession? Will you put in your names into
his Covenant? Will you subscribe? What do
you resolve upon? If you are still upon your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
my labour is lost, and all is like to come to
nothing. Fain I would, that you should now put
in your adventures. Come, cast in your lot, make
your choice. <hi>Now is the accepted time, now is
the day of salvation: to day if you will hear his
voice.</hi> Why should not this be the day from
whence thou shouldest be able to date thine hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness?
why shouldest thou venture a day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
in this dangerous and dreadful condition?
What if God should this night require thy soul?
<hi>O that thou mightest know, in this thy day, the
things that belong unto thy peace, before they be hid
from thine eyes! Luke</hi> 16. 42. This is thy day,
and 'tis but a day. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 4. Others have had
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43891:120"/>
their day, and have received their doom; and
now art thou brought upon the stage of this
world, here to act thy part, for a whole eternity
Remember, thou art now upon thy good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
for everlasting. If thou make not a wise
choice now, thou art undone for ever. Look
what thy present choice is, such must thine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
condition be. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 25.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 27, 28, 29.</p>
               <p>And is it true indeed? is life and death at thy
choice? yea, 'tis as true as truth is. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19.
why then, what hinders but that thou shouldest
be happy? Nothing doth or can hinder, but
thine own wilful neglect, or refusal. It was
the passage of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to <hi>Philip: See here is
water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?</hi> So I
may say to thee: see, here is Christ, here is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
pardon, life, what hinders but that thou
shouldst be pardoned, and saved? One of the
Martyrs as he was praying at the stake, had his
pardon set by in a box (which indeed he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
deservedly, because upon unworthy terms.)
But here the terms are most honourable and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:
O sinner, wilt thou burn with thy pardon
by? Why do but forthwith give up thy consent
to Christ, renounce thy sins, deny thy self,
take up the Yoak, and the Cross, and thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest
the day; Christ is thine, pardon, peace,
life, blessedness, all are thine: and is not this
an offer worth the embracing; Why shouldst
thou hesitate, or doubtfully dispute about the
case? Is it not past controversie, whether God
be better than sin, and glory better than vanity?
Why shouldst thou forsake thine own mercy,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43891:121"/>
and sin against thine own life? When wilt thou
sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ke off thy sloth, and lay by thine excuses?
<hi>Boast not thy self of to morrow:</hi> thou knowest not
where this night may lodge thee. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 1.</p>
               <p>Beloved, now the holy Spirit is striving with
you. He will not always strive. Hast thou not
felt thy heart warmed by the word, and been
almost perswaded to leave off thy sins, and come
in to God? Hast thou not felt some good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in thy mind, wherein thou hast been war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of thy danger, and told what thy careless
course would end in? It may be thou art like
young <hi>Samuel,</hi> who when the Lord called once
and again, he knew not the voice of the Lord:
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 6, 7. but these motions and items
are the offers, and essays, and the calls and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of the spirit. O take the advantage of the
tide, and know the day of thy visitation.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord Jesus stretcheth wide his arms
to receive you. He beseecheth you by us. How
movingly, how meltingly, how pitifully, how
passionately he calleth! The Church is put
into a sudden extasie upon the sound of his
voice, <hi>The voice of my beloved! Cant.</hi> 2. 8. O wilt
thou turn a deaf ear to his voice! it is not the
voice that breaketh the Ceders, and maketh
the mountains to skip like a Calf, that shaketh
the Wilderness and divideth the flames of fire,
it is not <hi>Sinai's</hi> Thunder; but the soft and still
voice. It is not the voice of Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> a voice
of cursing, and terror; but the voice of Mount
<hi>Gerizim,</hi> the voice of blessing, and of glad
tidings of good things. It is not the voice
of the Trumpet, nor the noise of War,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43891:121"/>
but a message of peace from the King of peace,
<hi>Eph. 6. 15. 2. Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 20. Methinks it

what shall I do? Will you turn off all my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity?
Have I run in vain? Have I used
so many arguments, and spent so much time to
perswade you, and yet must sit down at last in
disappointment? But it is a small matter that
you turn off me: you put a slight upon the God

                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:43891:124"/>Beloved, if you have any pity for your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
souls, close with the present offers of
mercy. If you would not continue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the pains of your travelling Ministers,
do not stick in the birth. If the God that made
you have any authority with you, obey his
command and come in. If you are not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisers
of grace, and would not shut up the
doors of mercy against your selves, repent and
be converted. Let not Heaven stand open for
you in vain. Let not the Lord Jesus open his
wares, and bid you buy without money and
without price, in vain. Let not his Ministers
and his Spirit, strive with you in vain, and
leave you now at last unperswaded; lest the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
go forth against you, <hi>The Bellows are
burnt, the Lead is consumed of the fire, the Founder
melteth in vain. Reprobate Silver shall men call
them, because the Lord hath rejected them, Ier.</hi>

               <p>Father of Spirits, take the heart in hand that is
too hard for my weakness. Do not thou have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though I have done. Half a word from thine
effectual power, will do the work. O thou that
hast the key of <hi>David,</hi> that openest when no man
shutteth, open thou his heart as thou didst <hi>Lydia's</hi>
and let the King of glory enter in; and make this
soul thy happy captive. Let not the Tempter harden
him in delays. Let him not stir from this place,
nor take his eyes from these lines till he be resolved to

terms. In thy name O Lord God did I go
forth to these Labours, in thy name do I shut them

up. Let not all the time they have lost; be but lost
hours, let not all the thoughts of heart, and all
the pains that have been about them, be but lost
labour. Lord put in thine hand into the heart of
this Reader, and send thy spirit, as once thou didst
<hi>Philip,</hi> to joyn himself to the Chariot of the Eunuch,
while he was reading thy word. And though I
should never know it while I live, yet I beseech thee
Lord God let it be found at that day, that some
souls are converted by these labours: and let some
be able to stand forth and say, that by these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,

            <l>REader, who ere thou art dost chance to look,</l>
            <l>Bless God directed thee to such a Book:</l>
            <l>Be serious when thou readest, 'tis no droul,</l>
            <l>But that which aimeth to convert thy soul.</l>
            <l>What mad besotted desperado can</l>
            <l>Take prejudice against this holy man?</l>
            <l>Who did sincerely nothing else desire,</l>
            <l>But to prevent thy leaping in the fire;</l>
            <l>And pen'd this Book out of a true endeavour</l>
            <l>To keep thee from that lake which burns for</l>
            <l>I do beseech you read it over; why ever.</l>
            <l>Will you be obstinate and choose to dye?</l>
            <l>Know you what Heaven is, or can you tell</l>
            <l>The torments of those damned souls in Hell?</l>
            <l>Now read and pray, O pray that God will give</l>
            <l>A true repentance, that your soul may live:</l>
            <l>This Book needs no <hi>Commendum,</hi> for no doubt</l>
            <l>You will commend it, if you read it out:</l>
            <l>What did I care, so sinners understood,</l>
            <l>If each word were a tear or drop of blood?</l>
