            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THey ſay well, that a man who hath written ſhould not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſuch as write againſt him; but let the world hear on both ears, and then judge. That this in time would do well enough in my caſe, I make as little doubt as another. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, where through ſilence there may be damage, at the tendereſt point or ſeaſon, I hold my ſelf obliged forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="tcp:123654:3"/>
to anſwer the preſent Book, though it be but meer railery or jeſt: and for this cauſe, if I alſo be merry, you will have me excuſed. Another inſtigation or ſpur to this laudable adventure, is, that as gloves which have lain in Spaniſh skins give notice of themſelves in fair aſſemblies: ſo hath ſome Book by having lain in ſome mans pocket. For order, though where there are but two Speakers, I ſhall ſcarce obſerve the Laws of a Play, yet the beſt method I can upon this occaſion fit my ſelf withal, will be by diſtributing my diſcourſe into Acts and Scoenes. The Acts, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have not taken my degrees, as that multitudes of Univerſity-ſcholars (they ſay, ſoberly and ſeriouſly) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves to be converted by Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> ſhall not be Drammatical, but Univerſity Acts: and to theſe, being the Scholars ſlight me for a Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I will for once give ſuch Laws as, let them do what they can, they ſhall never evade; the ſame ſhall be
<pb facs="tcp:123654:3"/>
done in ſuch manner, as, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer nor get looſe from my firſt Act, then will I thereupon declare my ſelf <hi>A Batchelor of Arts:</hi> if they cannot anſwer or get looſe from my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Act, then will I be undenyably <hi>A Maſter of Arts:</hi> the third ſhall make me in like manner <hi>A Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Law;</hi> the fourth, a <hi>Doctor of Law,</hi> and perhaps <hi>of Divinity:</hi> for without confutation by Divines or Lawyers, there will be no reaſon why my Exerciſes are not ſufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and theſe being ſufficiently performed, why have not I legitimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquired my Degrees? Then in the latter end, I will do ſomething to go out <hi>Orator;</hi> and in the last place, ſhall I ſtand to be <hi>Poet Laureate.</hi> But you muſt think that a man may as lawfully be two years, if he have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do, about buſineſs of ſuch importance, as Mr. <hi>Wren</hi> hath been about leſs matters. Be then atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: for the preſent you ſhall have the firſt Act; and what you finde Mr.
<pb facs="tcp:123654:4"/>
               <hi>Wren</hi> or me to be in this, I here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my reputation, that the reſpective characters ſhall be made good through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
            <p>But now upon occaſion of theſe Acts, I warrant you we ſhall have my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt go pitifully complaining unto Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> of <hi>diſ-ingenious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely</hi> thrown upon the Univerſitie. Goodneſs! What is an Univerſity, at leaſt one where they can call ſuch a Writer as Mr. <hi>Wren</hi> ingenious; and ſuch trompery as his writings, full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction or conviction, that it ſhould be unlawful for any man, though but a Ballad-ſinger, to laugh ſuch a white Mother into red cheeks!</p>

            <p>Noble Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> you have declared your ſelf to be of <hi>an aſſembly of men who are known both at home and abroad to be of the moſt learned perſons of this age:</hi> and ſome ſuſpect it to have been under their eye that you have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years in anſwering my laſt Book; an enterpriſe in which you have performed (ſeeing you now own the former) your ſecond adventure in like Chevalry; yet where I vouch <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle, Machiavil,</hi> and like Authors for the undoubted right which a private man may claim in treating upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123654:6"/>
politicks, or upon the nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, you tell me, That this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is not to be extended unto <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very little Writer.</hi> I, againſt whom one of the <hi>aſſembly known both at home and abroad to be of the moſt learned perſons of this age,</hi> hath written twice, and been ſo long about it, <hi>A little Writer!</hi> Sir, you forget your ſelf.</p>
            <p>Again, the Teſtimony of <hi>Machiavil</hi> throughout his works, is, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not careleſly to ſtart ſome <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Opinion,</hi> but applyeth every thing home and expreſly unto <hi>Italy,</hi> though not without ſome deſpair, yet with the ardour (or, if you will have it ſo) with <hi>the heat and paſſion belonging unto</hi> ſo noble a <hi>Deſigne.</hi> Wherefore for you to adoperate this teſtimony quite contrary to the truth of it, as a proof that <hi>my way of writing hath no affinity with this Author's,</hi> is ſuborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a witneſs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Good Sir, beſides the trick you put upon your Reader, in your antecedent, you are quite out in your Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: For how many years, I pray you, had <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> or <hi>Numa Pompili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſpent in the Miniſtry of State before they modelled their Governments? Or what modelling of Government hath been bequeathed unto the world by all the Miniſters of State in <hi>France</hi> ſince the diſſolution of the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, the ancient model of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; or by all the Miniſters of State ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> or have not theſe rather been the ruine of the Engliſh Model? Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> if you will believe me, the main, nay the whole ability of modelling a Commonwealth, lyeth in two things; the One, in being wel verſed in ancient prudence; the Other, in being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:123654:8"/>
from all parties: neither of which qualifications is common with Miniſters of State.</p>
            <p>Talk not to me of <hi>French Taylours;</hi> to model is not ſo eaſie a thing as you take it for, if we may but count our late changes of Government: when the King left the Parliament, and the two Houſes governed without a King, there was one change: when the Peers were excluded, and the Commons go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned without King and Peers, there was two: when the Commons were excluded, and the General governed alone, there was three: when the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral governed with a convention of his own making, there was four: when by the Major-Generals, there was five: when the Protector go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Inſtrument, there was ſix: vvhen he governed by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and Advice, there was ſeven; the preſent ſhould be the eighth: Nor hitherto hath there been any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del at all, or any ſuch as the makers themſelves have approved of. I hope I give no offence; for I ſay but as they ſay: But you are ſuch a man, you can ſhew me no body ſo good at modelling as I, except it be your ſelf; who I am
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:123654:8"/>
ſure have had as little Miniſtry; and yet the <hi>next dung-hill</hi> (which is your own ſweet book) you think fitteſt to be my <hi>Magazine.</hi> Why ſeeing you will have it ſo, come your ways.</p>

Whether Prudence be well diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed into ancient and modern</head>
               <p>FOugh! this ſame mixen in the ſtirring, is like Pepper in the Noſe; but he ſaith, it is Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore for to purge heads.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning purging of heads, Mr. <hi>VVren,</hi> there ſeemeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to peep out a queſtion. Do your Univerſities (gentle Sir) derive their learning from <hi>Nimrod,</hi> from the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> from the Monarchies? (to be equally with <hi>Macedon,</hi> I doubt, as to this point <hi>paſſed over in wiſe ſilence.</hi>) Are they deſcended (do you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me?) from the times in <hi>Greece,</hi> called by <hi>Thucydides, The imbecility of</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:123654:9"/>
                  <hi>ancient times;</hi> from thoſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Florus, The childhood of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:</hi> or ſpeak out, is their whole ſtock of learning, without which they had not had any kind of thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to ſet up, derived from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, the Greek, and the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths? If ſo, Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I pray you call you not now that ſtock of learning <hi>Ancient Learning,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they could not call it ſo then? and if Politicians have no other Pedigree of Prudence, then the ſame that you have of learning; why is not that Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which they have received in the like manner, ancient Prudence, albeit thoſe Commonwealths could not call it ſo then?</p>
               <p>To ſhift theſe things which are thus plain, you are in this Chapter a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Artificer; yet cometh all but to this, That neither <hi>Thucydides</hi> nor <hi>Florus</hi> divide Prudence into ancient and modern. Why, Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> neither did the Commonwealths mentioned divide Learning into ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern: this diſtinction belongs unto latter times, in regard of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Learning that is of latter inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So, Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> in regard of ſome modern Prudence, which firſt I tell
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:123654:10"/>
you what it is, namely, Government by King, Lords and Commons: and ſecondly, how it came in, namely, by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi> I call the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (do you mark?) of thoſe ancient Commonwealths, <hi>Ancient Prudence;</hi> and the Prudence remaining unto us from theſe <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals, Modern Prudence.</hi> What could you deſire more? Nay, and this is according unto the plain ſenſe of <hi>Janotti</hi> too: for, ſaith he, as to his two limits or periods of time, <hi>Of the former, or that wherein</hi> Rome <hi>was oppreſſed by the Arms of</hi> Caeſar, <hi>came the ſecond, or that when</hi> Italy <hi>was overrun by the</hi> Huns, Goths, Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals <hi>and</hi> Lombards; <hi>and of the ſecond came all that alteration which hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the world the face in which we now ſee it, and utterly loſt it that face which it had in the time of the Romans.</hi> VVherein relation unto the two Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments (the one popular, which was the more ancient; and the other by King, Lords and Commons, which is the more modern) is ſo plain, that you are put unto a ſhift, who can ſay no more then that I make <hi>Janotti</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the diviſion of Prudence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ancient and modern. How dare you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:123654:10"/>
you for your reputation do thus, Mr. <hi>Wren?</hi> while firſt by your own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment I infer this diviſion from more ancient Authors, as <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Florus:</hi> and ſecondly, my words relating unto <hi>Janotti</hi> do no where from him derive the diviſion of Prudence into ancient and modern, as to thoſe terms upon which runneth your equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; but fortifie this diviſion of my own, by the two periods of time by him obſerved, and that are of like ſenſe with theſe terms.</p>
               <p>But, Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> there was never the like of you! VVhereas the Queſtion by me propoſed, was, VVhether Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be not rightly divided into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern, you have convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into a Queſtion, whether Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy be not a more ancient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then a Commonwealth. This have I hitherto not diſputed, as that which concerneth not the preſent Controverſie: but ſeeing it may be for your ſervice, I do flatly deny that Monarchy is the more ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; not that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> holdeth<note place="margin">De cor. polit.</note>

                  <hi>Nimrod was a mighty hunter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,</hi> it is reſolved by Divines that <hi>Nimrod</hi> was the firſt Monarch. Now, Sir, <hi>Nimrod</hi> began his reign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the One thouſand eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth year of the world: whence I conclude thus: Either the world had no Government till <hi>Nimrod,</hi> or a Commonwealth may be above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years elder then Monarchy: Nay, unleſs you can finde ſome Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was neither a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth nor a Monarchy, muſt have been no leſs. I know what you will ſay, That the Government till <hi>Nimrod</hi> was by fathers of families: why ſo, I hope, you will yeild it was afterwards, at leaſt in the line of <hi>Shem.</hi> Now let us compute from <hi>Noah,</hi> and conſider in the poſterity of <hi>Shem,</hi> what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be made of the Government by fathers of families; or whether this were indeed, as Divines affirm, Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical, or may not much rather be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed popular.</p>

Now as to this, <hi>it is a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gemara Babylonia ad tit. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed rim.</note> 
                  <hi>with the Rabbins, that there were ſeven precepts delivered to the children of</hi> Noah: 1. <hi>Concerning Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: 2. Concerning Blaſphemy: 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning perverſe worſhip: 4. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncovering of nakedneſs: 5. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſhedding of mans blood: 6. Concerning rapine or theft: 7. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning eating of things ſtrangled, or of a member torn from a living creature.</hi> This tradition throughout the Jewiſh Government, is undoubted: for to ſuch as held theſe precepts, and no more, they gave not onely (as I may ſay) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123654:12"/>
but allowed them to come ſo near unto the temple as the gates, and called them <hi>Proſelytes of the gates.</hi> Nor do I think the proof in Scripture of theſe precepts, though not ſet down together, to be obſcure: as where it is ſaid, <hi>None of you ſhall approach to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

               <p>Again, that two other of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts were given by God unto <hi>Noah,</hi> the Scripture is plain, where he ſaith, <note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note>
                  <hi>Fleſh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, ſhall you not eat. And whoſo ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> VVhence it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that either fathers of families were not ſubject unto this Law; which becauſe it is given generally and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exception, were abſurd to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123654:12"/>
think; or elſe that during Patriarchal Government, they ſubjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto ſome common Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, according unto the firſt of the ſeven precepts. Of which, ſaith <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides, By this the ſons of</hi> Noah <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Judges in every City, to judge of the other ſix precepts, and to govern the people; and the</hi> Gemara Babylonia <hi>ſaith, That this was done after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded Judges to be ſet in the gates throughout the tribes.</hi> By the advice of <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the like ſhould have been the cuſtome of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> who, (as alſo the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> deſcended of the ſame line with the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Nimrod;</hi> and for ought perhaps to the contrary, of as ancient ſtanding) were a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. But above all, it ſhould ſeem by ſome of the Rabbines, that there was a Conſiſtory or Senate inſtituted by <hi>Shem,</hi> which was of uſe with his poſterity. Now if Patriarchal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was exerciſed by or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the common Ligament of a Senate or Conſiſtory, then was the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Patriarchs of a popular nature, or a Commonwealth; at leaſt theſe, Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> muſt be diſproved by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:123654:13"/>
them who will have Monarchy out of all controverſie to be the more ancient Government.</p>
               <p>Good Sir, I do not know, nor do I think that this ſame way (do you ſee?) of diſputation, hath any Predeceſſor. VVhat do you tell me then, <note place="margin">W. <hi>Preface.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>that you have cauſe to think by the laſt or any Book of mine, that my ſtores of Reaſon and Arguments are brought very low?</hi> You ſee already that it is far otherwiſe. Tell not me in this place that <hi>Doderus</hi> is as good a Book as the Bible; nor let Divines (for a thing that I know) run here as they do from the Scripture unto Heathen Authors. It is confeſt that <hi>Diodorus Siculus, Ariſtotle, Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, Saluſt</hi> and <hi>Trogus</hi> ſay, That in the beginning of <hi>things and of Nations, the power was in Monarchs.</hi> But then the Heathen Stories know nothing beyond <hi>Nimrod,</hi> or his Succeſſor <hi>Belus;</hi> which is no excuſe to you, while the Scripture is ſo much a more ancient record; much leſs to Divines, at leaſt ſuch of them as preach againſt the ſquaring of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment according to the rule of Heathen Authors. Mr. <hi>VVren,</hi> (to be plain) there are of theſe that have a ſtrange kinde of frowardneſs: if a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:123654:13"/>
Commonwealth be deſcribed out of Heathen Authors, they will undertake to prove that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to have been a Government of King, Lords and Commons. And if a Commonwealth be out of this of <hi>Iſrael</hi> deſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably otherwiſe, then they run to <hi>Ariſtotle, Trogus,</hi> &amp; the reſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, for the antiquity of Monarchy. When none of this will do, they fall flatly upon conjuring the people to take heed how they hearken unto men of wit, reaſon or learning, and not in any wiſe to be led but by grace, and ſuch grace onely as is without any mixture of wit, reaſon or learning. <hi>Mr. VVren,</hi> I deſire them but to tell us once, what they mean by ſuch grace as is without any mixture of wit, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or learning; and you in the mean time to conſider, That Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, though they give Monarchy the precedence in time, are very far from giving it the van in prudence. Nay, for this matter you will find them ſo much of one minde, that we need<note place="margin">Pol. Lib. 3. Cap. 10, 11</note> hear no more of them then <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who divides <hi>Monarchy</hi> into two kinds; the One whereof he calleth <hi>Barbarous;</hi> and in this he relates to your <hi>Nimrod,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:123654:14"/>
or your Eaſtern Monarchs; the Other <hi>Heroick,</hi> in which he relates expreſly to Principality in a Commonwealth; and namely, that of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Kings. Say you then, To which giveth he the van in dignity; to the Heroick, or to the Barbarous prudence? But it is no matter, ſtrike up, and let us have the <hi>Rodomontado,</hi> which it pleaſeth you ſhall be of or belonging unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Scoene: <hi>This</hi> (ſay you, for you may as well ſay it of this as of any thing elſe) <hi>approaches very near unto raving, and gives me cauſe to ſuſpect I have taken a wrong courſe of curing Mr.</hi> Harrington's <hi>Political diſtempers.

               <p>THe readieſt way, Mr. <hi>VVren,</hi> of diſpatch with the preſent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, will be to ſhew how far you and I are at length agreed; <hi>And we are agreed, that Law proceeds from the will of man (whether a Monarch or a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) that this will muſt have a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and that this Mover is Intereſt.</hi>

               <p>Now, Sir, the intereſt of the people is one thing; it is the publick inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: and where the publick intereſt governeth, it is a Government of Laws, and not of men: the intereſt of a King or of a party, is another thing, it is a private intereſt; and where pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt governeth, it is a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

On the other ſide, hath not <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> been as often repaired by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and the Law being ſo reſtored, was it not a Government of Laws, and not of men? I think you are wilde! Why have our Kings in ſo many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes or Oathes engaged themſelves to govern by Law, if there were not in Kings a capacity of governing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? And if ſo, then by every one of thoſe Oaths or Statutes it is agreed both by King and people, that there is a Government by Laws, and a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by men.

The voyce of the people is as much the voyce of men, as the voyce of a Prince is the voyce of a man; and yet the voyce of the people is the Voyce of God, which the voyce of a Prince is not; no not as to Law-giving, the voyce of the Prince who was a man after Gods own heart: for thus <hi>David</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth unto the Congregation of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; If it ſeem good unto you, and that</hi>

               </q>
               <p>Sir, for this Rime I have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſeeing in a Monarchy, that the Laws being made according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of one man or a few men, muſt needs be more private and partial then ſuits with the nature of juſtice; and in a Commonwealth, that Laws being made by the whole people, muſt come up to the publick intereſt, which is common right and juſtice; are <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Wren</hi> can confeſs <hi>to have indeed ſome ſenſe in them.</hi> But this milk, alas, is kick'd down again, while you add, <hi>that they have not any more truth then thoſe other which wanted ſenſe.</hi> Now this is a ſad caſe; yet ſuch as you ſay, <hi>will be apparent, if we examine the different tempers of a ſingle perſon and a multitude enacting Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:123654:18"/>Are we no farther yet? I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the different temper of a ſingle perſon, and of a popular aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, had been long ſince conſidered in the Propoſitions already granted, in as much as the ſingle perſon is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by a private, the multitude by the publick intereſt: which were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore by your ſelf acknowledged to be the firſt movers of will, and ſo the efficient cauſes of Law. If your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, or what ſhall I call them? would but hold to any thing, we might have ſome end. But for the diſcovery of theſe <hi>different tempers,</hi> you forget all that is paſt, and begin anew in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When a Monarch acts the Legiſlators part, he ought to be ſo far from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, or reſpecting his own private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that he is then chiefly to direct his thoughts to the common good, and take the largeſt proſpect of publick utility, in which his own is ſo eminently included.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Propoſition then of yours is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to mine, or thoſe in which you ſay there is ſome ſenſe, but no truth: ſo in this, both the ſenſe and the truth ſhould be apparent. But Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> if I ſhould ſay, That the father of a family,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:123654:18"/>
in giving rules to the ſame, ought to be ſo far from reſpecting his private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or the regard of keeping his whole eſtate and command unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and holding the ſervants that live upon him, ſhort, or in neceſſity to obey him, and work for him, that he were to take a larger, nay, the largeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of what is the publick utility of the men that ſerve him, which is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto means whereby to live of themſelves: Should I ſay that a father of a family would find the common and natural intereſt of his ſervants, which is to be free, that wherein his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which is <hi>to have ſervants,</hi> is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently included; I am confident you would neither allow this Aſſertion to be truth nor ſenſe. The like ſay I to your Monarchy, whether it be by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon, or by a Nobility. A Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy not keeping the people in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, is no Monarchy; therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervitude muſt be the intereſt of the people, or the intereſt of the people is not that to which a Monarch ought chiefly to direct his thoughts. Yet <hi>can you not believe that there are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to be produced of Princes, who in enacting Laws have conſidered their own</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:123654:19"/>
                  <hi>private perſonal intereſt?</hi> You are coſtive of belief, Mr. <hi>Wren:</hi> conſider the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh and Eaſtern Monarchies, and ſhew me any one of their Laws from any other Principle. It is true, in Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies by a Nobility, or by Parliaments, Princes have not in enacting Laws, been able to make ſo thorough work: for which cauſe, leſt Laws ſo enacted, ſhould give check unto this private intereſt ſo eſſential to Monarchy, they have ſtill been breaking them. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can you believe that Lavvs have been broken by any Prince, <hi>ſeeing that in buying and ſelling, and other private contracts, Princes are content to tye themſelves up to the ſame rules which they preſcribe to others.</hi> Rare! A King that plays fair at Piquet, can never break <hi>Magna Charta. Caeſar</hi> paid no leſs for an horſe then another man; therefore <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Monarchy vvas a lawful purchaſe. O but <hi>ſuch Laws,</hi> as upon that occaſion were made by <hi>Caeſar, were neceſſary to attaining the ends of Government:</hi> Good! and ſo that which is neceſſary unto a private intereſt, or a ſingle perſon, towards the attaining unto the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:123654:19"/>
the ſame cometh up to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick intereſt, which is common right and juſtice. Is this diſputing, Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> or is it fidling? Yet again: <hi>a Prince breaketh not the Law, but for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick tranquillity.</hi> Wonderful! not the Tinkers that fight, but the Conſtable breaks the peace. That the <hi>poſſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatus</hi> is according unto the Laws; or that there is a War in the Law for the maintenance of the publick peace, I have heard; but that the publick peace is in any caſe by the breach of the publick peace (whereof the Laws onely are the bond) to be defended, in good earneſt I have not formerly heard. Yet take heed, I pray. On this ſide of yours, there muſt be no <hi>fond imagination:</hi> But on the other ſide, (ſay you) <hi>there can be no fonder ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, then to think that</hi> (in the Republick of <hi>Iſrael</hi> framed by God or <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the four hundred that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Benjamin,</hi> in all, in any of the Commonwealths) <hi>or when any multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is aſſembled to enact Laws, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary their reſolutions</hi> (though thoſe of a ſingle perſon muſt) <hi>ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to publick juſtice.</hi> I have a weary life with you, Mr. <hi>VVren,</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:123654:20"/>
with ſuch of your Admirers, as if at their pleaſure I pick not ſtraws, can ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly and ſeriouſly reſolve you to be Conquerer of Mr. <hi>Harrington;</hi> what is that? nay, of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Solon,</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> The ſtraw that is your firſt lance in this Encounter, is, that <hi>a great part of this multitude</hi> (ſo you will have it called, though Politicians underſtand not a people under orders by the word <hi>multitude,</hi> but the contrary) <hi>will not, for want of capacity, comprehend what this juſtice and intereſt is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, if a man know not what is his own intereſt, who ſhould know it? and that which is the intereſt of the moſt particular men, the ſame, being ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in the common vote, is the publick intereſt O but the <hi>abler ſort will preſently be divided into factions and juncta's; and under pretence of publick interest, will proſecute their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, good Sir, if theſe abler ſort act as a Council under a ſingle perſon, what ſhould hinder them from doing the like, except they debate onely, and propoſe unto the Prince, who onely may reſolve? Wherefore if in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Government the Senate of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:123654:20"/>
of the people have no more then the Debate, and the Reſult remain wholly unto a popular Council having no power to debate; how can the abler ſort any more divide into Juncta's or Factions under popular Government, then under Monarchical? Speak your Conſcience; the intereſt of the people being as you ſay, That <hi>juſtice be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially adminiſtred, and every man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the enjoyment of his own;</hi> Whether think you the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable way unto this end, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or the abler ſort, propoſe; and a ſingle intereſt, that is, a ſingle perſon, reſolve; or that the abler ſort propoſe, and the common intereſt, that is, the whole people, have the reſult? O but take heed; for <hi>it is to be remembred, that the greateſt part of Laws concern ſuch matters as are the continual occaſion of controverſie between the people of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch regard regulation of trade, priviledges of corporations,</hi> &amp;c. Sweet Mr. <hi>VVren!</hi> are there more Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>England,</hi> then diſtinct Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties in the united Provinces? Have thoſe people no trade in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of ours? Or what quarrels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have they about it? Perſwade them to have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:123654:21"/>
a King; and to this end be ſure you tell them, that if we had not had Kings in <hi>England,</hi> there had certainly inſtead of the Barons Wars, been Wars between the Tanners and Clothiers; and inſtead of thoſe of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> others between the Shoomakers and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers. Say, if you have any ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do you not make me pick ſtraws? But the longeſt ſtraw comes here <hi>after all.</hi> (Say you)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It being eſſential to popular aſſemblies that the plurality of votes ſhould oblige the whole body, thoſe Laws which lay claim to the conſent of all, are very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the reſolutions of but a little more then half, and must conſequently go leſs in their pretenſions to publick inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, here are forty of you, whereof five and twenty ſee in yonder Grove a Rooks-neſt, which the other fifteen of you ſee not; now, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is that leſs a Rooks-neſt for this? or do theſe five and twenty ſee farther then thoſe fifteen? If ſo it be with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that is to be ſeen, felt, heard or underſtood, how cometh the world to be reſolved otherwiſe upon any thing, then that <hi>quod pluribus viſum id</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:123654:21"/>
what appeareth unto the moſt, is moſt authentick? and what can you deſire more of certainty in a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then all that certainty which can be had in the world?</p>
               <p>It was even now that we came from the Prince to the People; now from the people to the Prince again. Good Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> why do you ſay, or whoever ſaid the like, <hi>that thoſe Laws which are reputed the peoples greateſt ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt injuſtice and oppreſſion, have been eſtabliſhed by the authority of ſome Prince?</hi> Do you find any ſuch thing in <hi>Iſrael, Athens, Lacedemon, Rome, Venice, Holland, Switz?</hi> But you equivocate; as to authority in Princes, Magiſtrates or ſole Legiſlators, in matter of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, you well know that I am for it; but not as you impoſe upon this term for their power. Thus be it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>Alfred, Edward, Lewis, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, have been excellent Legiſlators;</hi> What is this to power, or to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſeeing the Laws propoſed by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theſe Princes, were enacted no otherwiſe then as <hi>Poinings</hi> Laws, by the power of the people, or aſſemblies of their three eſtates? <hi>But above all,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>ſeveral of the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:123654:22"/>
                  <hi>and chiefly</hi> Juſtinian, <hi>have fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated thoſe Laws ſo much admired for their reaſon and equity, which have ſtretched themſelves farther then ever the Roman Legions were able to march, and which are ſtill embraced by thoſe people, who have long ſince ceaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Roman Empire.</hi> Herein you have paid your ſelf to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for moſt eloquent Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> who but your ſelf ſaith, That <hi>Juſtinian</hi> fabricated thoſe Laws you ſpeak of? I have heard indeed, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled them; and ſurely, Sir, in that work of his, he did but new vamp the old bootes of the people of <hi>Rome:</hi> Nay, good Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> your Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours at the gallanteſt wore no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for the ful proof whereof, I need go no foot farther then your own ſweet ſelf; for do not you give out of <hi>Justini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> this very definition of a Law; <note place="margin">W<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 59.</note>
                  <hi>Lex est quod Populus Romanus Senatorio Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratu interroganto (veluti conſule) constituebat?</hi> How ſay you then, that <hi>Justinian</hi> fabricated theſe Laws, which he plainly telleth you, were propoſed by the Senate, and reſolved by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome?</hi> Do you ſee what your Emperours themſelves acknowledged
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:123654:22"/>
to have been a Government of Laws, and more excellent then a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, though they themſelves were the men that governed? And you your ſelf have ſaid enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the juſtice of the dead peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple went farther then the arms of the living Emperours; nay, and that ſuch Laws as are yet of the greateſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the world, are ſtill extant of the Roman people, though of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours there remain nothing that is good.</p>
               <p>But ſay you, <hi>On the other ſide</hi> (you may pleaſe to ſay as you will, but it is on the ſame ſide yet) <hi>thoſe Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths that have been most celebrated for their Laws, have received them from the hands of a Sole Legiſlatour</hi> (which both words and things, though you liſt not to acknowledge it, every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> body knows that I taught you: now let us ſee how you can hit me with my own weapon) <hi>therefore it may well be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether theſe people of</hi> Athens <hi>and</hi> Lacedemon <hi>thought ſo well of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Mr.</hi> Harrington <hi>ſeems to do of popular Aſſemblies.</hi> Why, do not I ſay, That a popular Aſſembly, as to the formation or fabricating of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:123654:23"/>
through the want of invention, muſt of neceſſity have ſome ſole Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator? What fault do you find with Mr. <hi>Harrington?</hi> Why, <hi>that with ſuch repeated confidence he aſſerts, that the people never faile to judge truly of the publick interest, where</hi> (the Legiſlator or) <hi>the Senate diſcharge their duty:</hi> And what have you been ſaying all this while in theſe examples of <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> whoſe Laws being by them prudently propoſed unto the people, were as prudently judged, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon enacted by the people? So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for the Roman Decemvirs: for if you think that theſe did any more then propoſe to the people, or that any Law of theirs was otherwiſe good then as voted and commanded by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you ſhould go to ſchool. Yet that if the Legiſlator or the Senate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide well, the people ſhall be ſure to make a good choice, <hi>you must confeſs is too hard for your faith:</hi> why if it be matter of faith, you might have let it alone? but do you think it right in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil matters, that the tenderneſs of faith ſhould ſupply the want of ſenſe in you; or vvhat is the ſcruple can yet remain in your conſcience!

the obſervation which <hi>Anachar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> made, who ſaid of the popular Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in <hi>Greece,</hi> That <hi>wiſe men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded matters, and fools decided them.</hi> Why Mr. <hi>Wren, Anacharſis</hi> would not loſe his jeſt, and you cannot finde it.

But let you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, you will be the Gaſcon ſtill; that which is thrown out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows where-ever you come, is no leſs then the whole houſe; or if you leave any thing, it is but that you are weary <hi>to diſcover all the weak Arguments and falſe Inferences of Mr.</hi> Harrington, <hi>as awork to others of ſmall profit, and to your ſelf of little glory.</hi> Poor Mr. <hi>Harrington!</hi> He will now leave you a while to take breath, and confer a little with your patron.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>VVilkins</hi> having laughed ſo much as in ſuggeſted in the Epiſtle, ſhould not methinks be altogether left out of our game.

made for all the world like a Jack; the whole force of which engine conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in two double Pullies, twelve wheels and a ſail: the ſail is inſtead of the creſt of the Jack, at which a fellow ſtands blowing; and by blowing in this manner, the ſaid Author pretendeth to demonſtrate Mathematically, that the ſaid fellow, with the ſaid Jack, ſhall tear you up the ſtrongeſt Oak by the roots. This, to men who know that ſome ſhip in a ſtorm will break the ſtrongeſt Anchor that is made of Iron, and the ſtrongeſt Cable that is made of Hemp, muſt needs be wonderful: of what then muſt this Jack and this ſtring be made, that it break not before it fetch up this Oak? Nay, how can any man blow a million of years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Or if he could, where would the Oak or the Jack be? and in a leſs time the Oak it is confeſt could not<note place="margin">Ch. 16.</note> by this means be removed one inch.

Why ſure there may, Sir; nay, and ſuch a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be every whit as valid and convincing, as if it vvere Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.

Stand away, I vvill demonſtrate, that's certain: but here is the miſchief; not every man that pretends unto underſtanding in the Politicks, hath converſed vvith them; and ſo in theſe, through meer vvant of underſtanding, a man vvill confidently deny, vvhat in other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, vvhere he is more skilled, he vvould be aſhamed to queſtion. For this cauſe I vvill not fall full butt upon the politicks at firſt daſh, but begin fairly and ſoftly, in <hi>Puris naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That converſation vvhich vvith men
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:123654:25"/>
is moſt general (I apprehend) to be with women: and ſo here I come with my firſt demonſtration.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>What was always ſo, and not otherwiſe, and ſtill is ſo, and not otherwiſe; the ſame ſhall ever be ſo, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, women have been always ſome handſome, and ſome unhandſome, and not otherwiſe; and women ſtill are ſome handſome, and ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, women ſhall ever be ſome handſome and ſome unhandſome, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> the reaſon why I begin to demonſtrate in this manner, or in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing meerly natural and known to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body, is, That otherwiſe I ſhould never ſtave men off from ſaying, That <hi>what was always ſo, and not otherwiſe, and ſtill is ſo, and not other wiſe, muſt ever be ſo, and not otherwiſe,</hi> muſt needs be true; that is, except a man can give a reaſon why it may be otherwiſe. This is that when I come unto the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, things not leſs natural, but onely more remote from mens <hi>knowledge</hi> or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:123654:26"/>
                  <hi>acquaintance,</hi> which they will be all ſure enough to return: Wherefore let them begin here to ſhew me ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as hereafter they will ask, that is, why women, notwithſtanding what is paſt or preſent, may for the future be all handſome. Would not the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of ſuch an adventure, be a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ridiculous piece of Knight-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry? In ſooth, Mr. <hi>VVren,</hi> though men will not ſo eaſily ſee it, it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in the politicks, which are not to be erected upon phanſie, but upon the known courſe of Nature; and therefore are not to be confuted by phanſie, but by the known courſe of Nature. Remember, Sir, Anatomy is an Art; but he that demonſtrates by this Art, demonſtrates by Nature, and is not to be contradicted by phanſie, but by demonſtration out of Nature. It is no otherwiſe in the Politicks. Theſe things therefore being duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I proceed.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>VVhat always was ſo, and ſtill is ſo, and not otherwiſe, the ſame ſhall ever be ſo, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>But where the Senate was upon Rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had not the ultimate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:123654:26"/>
there was not any feud between the Senate and the people; and where the Senate is upon Rotation, and hath not the ultimate reſult, there is no feud between the Senate and the people.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, where the Senate ſhall be upon Rotation, and not have the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate reſult, there ſhall be no feud between the Senate and the people.</p>
               </q>
               <p>I know the humour of theſe times: though any thing that will patch be now called prudence, it will be known that what is after this manner unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably deducible from the Major of theſe Propoſitions, is Prudence or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and no other.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>VVren,</hi> true it is that the demonſtration given is but <hi>Hoti,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <q>
                  <p>Where the Senate hath no intereſt, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:123654:27"/>
or divided from the intereſt of the people, there can be no feud between the Senate and the people.</p>
                  <p>But where the Senate is upon Rotation, and hath not the ultimate reſult, there the Senate can have no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt diſtinct or divided from the intereſt of the people.</p>
                  <p>Therefore where the Senate is upon Rotation, and hath not the ultimate reſult, there can be no feud between the Senate and the people.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Sir, this I ſay is <hi>Dihoti:</hi> and ſeeing it is a cuſtome with you to give my things a turn over the tongue, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved hereafter to <hi>hoti</hi> 'em and <hi>dihoti</hi> 'em in ſuch manner, as ſhall make you take your teeth. You will ſay, that I am a <hi>Paſſionate Gentleman.</hi> But what hath any man to do in this place to tell me of the ſeuds between the Senate and the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> or thoſe of the States in regulated or Gothick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies? did I ever undertake to <hi>hoti</hi> or <hi>dihoti</hi> any of theſe? If they break looſe, let them look to that whom it concerneth. Nevertheleſs, I ſay, that Laws, whether in Commonweatlths or regulated Monarchies, are made by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:123654:27"/>
conſent of the Senate and the people, or by conſent of the States, or Lords and Commons. And I pray you, Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> What is in your Allegation to confute this ſaying? Your words are theſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If any one of theſe States have, in caſe of difference, a juſt power to force the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the other, it is all one as if they were private perſons; but if no one of them be acknowledged to have ſuch power, then it comes in caſe of diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a State of War.</p>
               </q>
               <p>But doth this prove, that in caſe of a Senate upon Rotation, there may be feud between them and the people? or that Laws in regulated Monarchie are not enacted by the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons? You might as well have argued thus, Mr. <hi>Wren:</hi> Theſe ſame Lords and Commons have power enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree, or make Wars; therefore they have no power to agree or to make Laws: Or what doth this concern me?</p>
               <p>But now for the Jig at parting. Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Aristotle and Cicero wrote not the Rules of their Politicks from the principles of nature, but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them into their Books, out of the practice of their own Commonwealths, as</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:123654:28"/>
Grammarians <hi>deſcribe the Rules of Language out of the practice of the times.</hi> Mr. <hi>VVren,</hi> if I had anſwered Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> thus: That the whole force of his Argument amounted but to this, That becauſe Grammarians deſcribe the rules of Language out of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the times, therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> did ſo in their diſcourſes of Government; what would you have ſaid? But becauſe Mr <hi>Hobbes</hi> doth not prove, but illuſtrate what he ſaith by way of ſimilitude; therefore I anſwer him by way of ſimilitude in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <q>That for Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> to ſay, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote not the rules of their Politicks from the principles of Nature, but tranſcribed them into their Books out of the practice of their own Commonwealths, is as if a man ſhould ſay of famous <hi>Harvey,</hi> that he tranſcribed his Circulation of the blood, not out of the principles of Nature, but out of the Anatomy of this or that body.</q> Yet you anſwer me, That <hi>the whole force of this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction amounteth but to this: That becauſe</hi> Harvey <hi>in his Circulation hath followed the principles of Nature, therefore</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle <hi>and</hi> Cicero <hi>have done ſo in their</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:123654:28"/>
                  <hi>diſcourſes of Government.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> I have complained of you for repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me fraudulently, but not ſo often as I might: for whereas upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion I told you, <q>That a ſimilitude is brought for illuſtration, or to ſhew how a thing is, not to prove that it is ſo;</q> You repeat me thus: <hi>Mr.</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington <hi>aſſured me in his laſt Book, that he produced this onely as a ſimilitude, and never intended that any man ſhould look for Reaſon or Argument in it.</hi> Sir, though a ſimilitude have not that proof in it which may draw a man, yet it hath ſuch inducement in it as may lead a man. But, why ſhould I be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſeeing in the cloſe you <hi>heartily crave my pardon?</hi> Good, Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> abundantly enough: Nay, no more; no more, I beſeech you. Look you, do what I can, he will be making me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration too. Well then, if it muſt be ſo, what is it? Why, ſay you, <hi>By way of reparation to Mr.</hi> Harrington, <hi>I make here a ſolemn Declaration, That for the future he ſhall have no cauſe to accuſe for expecting Reaſon or Argument in any of his diſcourſes.</hi> O ingenuity! he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he hath taken my ſimilitude for an Argument, my Gooſe for my
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:123654:29"/>
Pig; and the ſatisfaction promiſed, comes to this, that he will take my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for Similitudes: when he ſhould be ſhooing my Gooſe, he is ſoling my Pig; for which he will make (as ye ſhall find hereafter) this amends, that when he ſhould be ſoling my Pig, he will be ſhooing my Gooſe. Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> good night.</p>
