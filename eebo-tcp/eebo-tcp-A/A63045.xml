            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Prayers and Meditations that were hammer'd out at her Forge. And what was so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>: So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a proportionabl Care to countermine her Policy, there could be littl hope ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of with-drawing any of her Members, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding many of our own, from her Communion.</p>
            <p>But now the Church of England hath both exprest her self sufficiently sensib
<pb facs="tcp:36762:6"/>
of that Defect and made abundant Provision for its Supply, in compiling and publishing such and such store of Books of Devotion in her Mother-Tong, as neither the Roman nor any of the Reformed can boast of more or better. It may therefore be questioned to what purpos this littl Tract should be super-added to those many excellent pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Devout Meditation already in Print; which makes me judg it requisit to giv the Reader som short Account both of its Occasion and Design.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36762:7"/>A most Excellent Person, eminent (not to mention her quallity, which is very considerabl) as wel for her Devotion as Intelligence, being, by a just and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conviction of those gross Errors and Forgeries, on and by which the <hi>Church</hi> (or rather, <hi>Court</hi>) of <hi>Rome</hi> hath founded and upheld her Greatness, reclaimed from her Communion to that of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> to evidence how far she was from being indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therunto by any other Motiv besides that of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interested Religion, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to confine her self to
<pb facs="tcp:36762:7"/>
the same strict Rules of Devotion and Abstinence, in the Exercise of her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Principls, whereby she had exprest her exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Zeal in the Popish Superstition. And that her Soul, in those many hours which she daily allotted for Retirement, might not grow languid and dull in the same Act either of Prayer or Reading (as the Body is apt to becom stiff and unweildy if long held to the self-same Posture or Motion) these brief Aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations on the Gospel-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story were composed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versify her Entertainment,
<pb facs="tcp:36762:8"/>
and fill up those Intervals which a pious Difcretion thought requisit for the better Improvment and more orderly Disposal of the time set apart for such Religious Exercises.</p>
            <p>And what hath been thus used and approved in the Devout Solitude of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat Closet, now appears in Publik with Design to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the vacant Hours of other pious Votaries, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at such times as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wise Authority of our Superiors, or their own particular Resolution, shal dedicat a whol day to the Duties of Prayer and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36762:8"/>But lest that different Order wherinto the several Evangelists hav cast their Relation of our Savior's Acts and Speeches which the Holy Ghost hath thought fit to transfer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to succeeding Ages upon Record, might occasion a fruitless Repetition of any one Part, or an unseemly Confusion in the Whole; I have reduced it to such a Method which <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> hav digested their Harmony of the Four Gospels into: that the Religious Peruser may more regularly pass throu the entire History, or the
