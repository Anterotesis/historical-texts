         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEing come to a point about the
taking in of <hi>Reading,</hi> we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it convenient to give you a
brief account of our ſhort ſiege:</p>
            <p>After ten miles march on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the fifteenth of April, we made
our approaches that night, taking
ſome advantages from hedges and
ditches unſlighted by the enemy.
On Sunday we ſate down before
the Town, batter'd with our Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and plaid it with our ſmall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155860:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 15 -->
ſhot all that day, in which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
received a hurt upon the
head, which rendred him unfit for
further ſervice: we had very warm
worke, and hot returnes from the
Town. On Munday we advanced
our approaches as they could. On
Tueſday in the night the King ſent
in a relief of men and Ammunition,
which we could not prevent by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the ſcituation of the Towne,
and their advantages of Barges
which we could not command, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wholly engaged on <hi>Berkeſhire</hi>
ſide. On Munday laſt at night we
ſent out a party of Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooners
as far as <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> which
did beat up the enemies quarters,
routed their Horſe and Foot, killed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155860:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 15 -->
and took many priſoners: On Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſday
morning laſt the Enemy did
beat a Parley, and accordingly came
out to Treat, and in the interim
while the buſineſſe was depending,
the Kings Army appeared for their
relief, and fell on with their Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
foot &amp; horſe, upon our guards
on <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> ſide, but being
roundly received after above an
hours fight, the enemy was routed
with the loſſe of above a hundred
men, and three hundred Armes.
The King, Prince <hi>Charls,</hi> Prince
<hi>Rupert,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and the
Generall being all in the field, that
night our Capitulation was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and now his Excellency being
very tender of the Town that they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155860:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 16 -->
ſhould not bee plundered, and as
carefull that the ſouldiers might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
due incouragement; hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
twelve ſhillings <hi>per</hi> man for
an extraordinary, and ſo we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
to take poſſeſsion, for the
conſequence of which ſucceſſe I
doubt not but the wiſer and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
will ſee reaſon to think and
thanke God, the buſineſſe having a
bleſsing in it of a great, and growing
conſtitution; if a ſhort ſurvey be but
taken of the conſiderable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
being rendred with ſo little
loſſe of bloud in ſo ſhort a time, and
the King reſolved to relieve it: Not
to mention the ten peices of Canon
they relinquiſh'd, nor the reſtitution
of the VVeſtern-cloaths taken from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155860:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 16 -->
our friends, nor their being forced
upon this to quit <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> and
<hi>Brill,</hi> ſo that had the enemy ſuch
a foundation, they would advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
relate all paſſages to their
honors; which we choſe rather to
point at then inſiſt upon, leaving the
reallity of the ſervice to report it ſelf,
being fewer words and more blows
is our buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>We have here a true Narrative
of the buſineſſe ſince wee came before
Reading, and do thinke fit to adde the
number of the Enemies Forces and
ours, that you may ſee the bleſsing of
God upon us at the late encounter at
<hi>Caverſham:</hi> The Enemy had forty
five Troops of Horſe, and nine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155860:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 17 -->
