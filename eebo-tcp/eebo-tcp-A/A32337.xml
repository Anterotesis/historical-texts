            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MOst Reverend Father in God, We Greet you well: Whereas by an Act made by this present Parliament, in the fourteenth year of Our Reign, for Granting unto Us the Duty of two shillings upon every Fire-Hearth, Stove, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Entituled, <hi>An Act for establishing an additional Revenue upon His Majesty, His Heirs, and Successors, for the better Support of His, and their Crown and Dignity.</hi> It is provided and enacted, That if the Church-wardens and Overseers of the poor of any Parish, together with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the same, or any two of them (whereof the Minister to be one) shall in Writing under their Hands, yearly certifie their belief, that the House wherein any person doth inhabit, is not of greater value than twenty shillings <hi>per annum,</hi> upon the full improved Rent. And that neither the person so inhabiting, nor any other using the same Messu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, hath, useth, or occupieth any Lands or Tenements of their own, or others, of the yearly value of twenty shillings <hi>per annum,</hi> nor hath any Lands, Tenements, Goods, or Chattels of the value of ten pounds in their own possession, or in the possession of any other in trust for them; That then upon such Certificate made in such case to the two next Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of the Peace, and allowed by them (for which Certificate and Allowance, no Fee shall be paid) the person in whose behalf such Certificate is made, shall not be returned by the Constable or other Officer. And the said House is thereby discharged of, and from all the Duties by the said Act imposed.</p>
            <p>And whereas We are informed, That either through the ignorance of some persons in the Law in this behalf, or by partiality and favour, great number of undue Certificates are from time to time signed in all places of the Kingdom, by the respective Ministers, Vicars, and Curates of the places, and the Church-wardens and Overseers of the poor of the same, for persons not qualified, as the Law above recited doth require, to the great diminishing and detriment of Our said Revenue. Now to the end that some better care may be taken for the future in this matter; Our Will and Pleasure is, And We have thought fit hereby, to require you forthwith to write to the Right Reverend Fathers in God the Bishops of the several Dioceses within your Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to direct them, and recommend it to their care, to take effectual Order strictly to charge all Ministers, Parsons, Vicars, Curates, and Church-wardens within their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Dioceses, to use all possible circumspection in the signing of any Certificates, and that they be well assured, that the persons for whom they do certifie, are in all respects qualified as the Law directs. And that they do not certifie for any other persons whatsoever: And you are also to take care, That the same charge be given to all Ministers, Parsons, Vicars, and Curates within your immediate Diocese of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Given at our Court at <hi>Whitehall</hi> this fourth day of <hi>November,</hi> in the six and twentieth Year of our Reign, 1674.</p>
