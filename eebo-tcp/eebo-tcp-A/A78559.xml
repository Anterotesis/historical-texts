            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>RICHARD</hi> Earl of <hi>Ranelagh,</hi> and Eight others (whereof <hi>George Daſhwood</hi> the Appellant's Teſtator was one) by Indenture under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> contracted and became Undertakers with King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to receive the whole Revenue of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to pay the whole Charge of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom contained in the Civil and Military Liſts for five Years, ending the 26th of <hi>December,</hi> 1675; and had two Years time afterwards for Collecting the Arrears, and making good the Payments grown due within the five Years.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">23 <hi>Sept.</hi> 71.</note>A Commiſſion under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> iſſued to the ſaid Undertakers, and in their abſence in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to others therein by them named to be their Repreſentatives; wherein Mr. <hi>Edward Roberts</hi> was named by the ſaid <hi>George Daſhwood,</hi> to be his Repreſentative, and to act on his behalf.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">8 <hi>Nov.</hi>71.</note>In Virtue of which Commiſſion the now Reſpondent was duly conſtituted Deputy-Receiver-General, Vice-Treaſurer, and Treaſurer at War, who entred into Bonds of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> penalty, for the execution of the ſaid Places and Performance of his ſaid Truſt, which he all along faithfully performed.</p>
            <p>But the ſaid Revenue proving defective, or at leaſt not coming in faſt enough to anſwer the Ends and Uſes of the ſaid Undertaking; and the Undertakers being preſſed to make payments according to their Contract, the ſaid Undertakers and their Repreſentatives, or ſo many of them as were requiſite in that behalf, to comply therewith, did by ſeveral Orders and Letters importune and direct the Reſpondent to Advance and Lend, and to procure from others what Money he could, upon the credit, and towards the ſupport of the Undertaking, and Undertakers, under promiſe of being repaid and indempnified, and for which there was to be an allowance of 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> (the uſual Intereſt in <hi>Ireland</hi>) beſides Gratuity and Commiſſion-Money: Many, if not all of which Letters and Orders were ſigned by <hi>George Daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> or the ſaid <hi>Roberts</hi> his Repreſentative.</p>
            <p>Purſuant whereunto, in order to ſupport and preſerve the Credit of the ſaid Undertakers and Undertaking, the Reſpondent did lend and advance great Sums of his own, and by direction of the Undertakers in <hi>England,</hi> did become bound to Sir <hi>John James,</hi> and others, reſiding in <hi>England,</hi> then unknown to the Reſpondent, for great Sums of Money which were procured by the Undertakers; all which Money ſo lent and procured by the Reſpondent, were duly applied to the Uſes of the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and the Undertakers for ſo much were diſcharged againſt the King upon their Contract.</p>
            <p>Two ſeveral Accounts, the one ending <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 72, the other at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 73, between the Undertakers and the Reſpondent, touching the Undertaking, were made up, ſtated, and examined by the ſaid <hi>Roberts,</hi> and others employed by the Undertakers for that purpoſe, and duly ſigned and paſſed, upon the foot of which laſt Account there was a ballance of 5622 <hi>l.</hi> due to the Reſpondent, which together with the other Moneys afterwards lent, and ſecured by the Reſpondent for the Uſe and Credit of the Undertakers and Undertaking (beſides what the Undertaking produced) did amount to above 24000 <hi>l.</hi> principal Money (beſides Intereſt, Commiſſion-Money, &amp; <hi>Gratuity</hi>).</p>
            <p>To obtain ſatisfaction wherein, and to have his Accounts ſetled, the Reſpondent uſed great Importunities with the Undertakers, who all along owned the great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and kindneſs he had done them, by crediting them and the Undertaking ſo far, and promiſed to give Directions for ſtating and ſetling Accounts, and to take effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual care for his payment and ſatisfaction. And in order thereunto about <hi>June</hi> 1677, Sir <hi>James Hayes</hi> one of the Undertakers went into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and he with <hi>John Stepny,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> another Undertaker, and <hi>John Hayes</hi> Brother of Sir <hi>James,</hi> and intereſſed in the Undertaking, having ſufficient power, as they pretended, and as the Reſpondent believes, from all the Undertakers, to ſettle and conclude the Affairs of the Undertaking (they being the only perſons then acting therein), in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 77, impowered the ſaid <hi>Roberts</hi> by an Inſtrument under their hands, to make up, ſtate, and certifie the Reſpondent's Accounts, from the 25. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 73, to the 24th of <hi>June</hi> 77. In purſuance whereof the ſaid Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> (who was the ſame perſon imployed and relied upon by the Undertakers to make up the former Accounts) with the aſſiſtance of the Secretary of the Undertaking, and two of their Clerks, ſpent ſeveral Months in ſtating the Reſpondent's Accounts, and comparing them with the Vouchers, which juſtified the ſaid Accounts in all things; and after the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny imaginable, two diſtinct Accounts were made and cloſed in the ſame method as the two former Accounts; the one commencing the 25th of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 73. and ending 25 <hi>Decemb.</hi> 74, and the other going on from thence to 24 <hi>June</hi> 77, upon the foot of which laſt Account there remained a Ballance for principal Money, (not reckoning Intereſt, Commiſſion-Money, nor Gratuity), the Sum of 36454 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d</hi> ¼: And thereupon all the Reſpondent's Vouchers were delivered up, and Abſtracts thereof, and of the Accounts were delivered to the Undertakers, or their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>

               <note place="margin">12295 <hi>l.</hi>
               </note>But the Sum of 12295 <hi>l.</hi> (which the Reſpondent had received from Sir <hi>John Jame</hi>'s Agent as borrowed Money, and as ſuch had given Bond, and became lyable for the ſame, by the direction of the Undertakers) not appearing at the time of making up the ſaid Accounts, but afterwards to be Money due to the Undertaking, the ſaid <hi>Edward Roberts</hi> thought it proper to enter a Memorandum thereof in the Accounts, which cauſed a change and tranſcribing of ſome of the leaves, but no alteration of any Sum, Article, Figure, or other thing in the ſaid Accounts, ſave the entry of the ſaid Memorandum, which reduced the ballance to 24159 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d</hi> ¼ as is fully in proof in the Cauſe, and hath been cleared to the ſatisfaction of the Courts of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the reſpective Hearings of the cauſe, notwithſtanding any ſeeming Reflections upon the Reſpond<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 1678.</note>The Reſpondent (notwithſtanding many promiſes) not being able to get the Money due to him, was forced to exhibit his Bill for that purpoſe, in the Exchequer in <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt the ſaid Undertakers and their Repreſentatives, ſome of which being brought to hearing, and the Bill againſt others taken <hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> a Decree was made for the now Reſpondent's recovering the ſaid 24159 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> ¼, againſt the then Deſendants, with his Coſts (no mention being made of Intereſt, Commiſſion-Money, or Gratuity, but that left to be recovered afterwards). But the Earl of <hi>Ranelagh</hi> exhibiting a Croſs-bill againſt the now Reſpondent, procured a Re-hearing of the Cauſe, which being had, and taking up ſix ſeveral days, in <hi>June</hi> 1684. The ſaid Court of Exchequer approved the Authority given to <hi>Roberts,</hi> and the Accounts by him made, the Undertakers and their Repreſentatives having free acceſs to all the now Reſpondent's Books, and to all the Offices of Cheque in that Kingdom, and having in their Cuſtody the Reſpondent's Vouchers delivered up, with ſeveral other particular Accounts of his daily Receipts and Payments, the ſaid Court upon full and mature deliberation of the whole matter, was pleaſed to affirm the former Decree, as well againſt the ſaid Earl, as other the Defendents, for paying to the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the ſaid 24159 <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>s.</hi> 8. <hi>d.</hi> ¼.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>May</hi> 1685.</note>That Decree proving in a great meaſure ineffectual in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in regard the Appellant's Teſtator, (upon whoſe credit and ability the Reſpondent mainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in his whole proceedings) and ſome other of the Undertakers having no Eſtates nor Effects there, but living in <hi>England,</hi> the now Reſpondent was forced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill in the Exchequer in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term 1685, againſt the ſurviving Undertakers, and the Executors and Adminiſtrators of thoſe deceas'd, for obtaining what was due to him; being at that time about 56000 <hi>l.</hi> for Principal, Intereſt, Commiſſion-Money, and Gratuity (and no part thereof ſince paid). The Defendants to the ſaid Bill (whereof the now Appellants were ſome) uſed ſo great delay, that it was four years before the Cauſe could be brought to an hearing. And for further delay a Croſs bill was exhibited by the now Appellants, and other the Defendants in the ſame Term, the Reſpondents Cauſe ſtood for hearing, with deſign to put off the hearing of the Reſpondent's Cauſe; however it came to hearing in <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term 1689. And then, and in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term following, it took up eight days; and the Court did decree the two firſt Accounts made up by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> to be final and concluſive. And as to the two laſt Accounts, made up till <hi>Midſummer</hi> 1677, the Court conſidering the impoſſibility the Reſpondent lay under, by reaſon of the length of time, and the preſent ſtate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and delivery up of his Vouchers to come to a new Account for the ſame, did not think fit to adjudge them concluſive, nor to reject or diſallow of the ſame as ſtated and cloſed Accounts; but in caſe the Defendants had any material Objections to offer againſt the particulars thereof, it was referred to the two Auditors of the Impreſts to inſpect and examine the ſame; and alſo whether the ſame were made up and ſtated in the method of the two former Accounts, and wherein they did agree or differ from the ſame; and decreed the Reſpondent to be examined upon Interrogatories, and the Auditors to reſort to the Court for Directions, in, caſe of difficulty.</p>
            <p>That ſome of the Defendants pretending they could ſhew Reaſons why they ſhould be exempted out of the ſaid Decree, from going to an account before the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, there was a Clauſe in the ſaid Decree, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch of the Defendants as ſought to be exempted from accounting, ſhould bring their Caſe to the Barons to conſider of; whereupon (amongſt others) the now Appellant's, whoſe Teſtator lived till the year 1682, brought in their Caſe, pretending their Teſtator in <hi>May,</hi> 1674, aſſigned his Intereſt in the Undertaking to the ſaid Sir <hi>James Hayes,</hi> and pretended that the Reſpondent had notice thereof; and that therefore they ought not to be accountable from that time, or at leaſt longer than <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 1675, when the time of the Undertaking ended.</p>
            <p>Upon hearing of which, and upon full debate of the matter, the Appellants not having proved any Notice, (though they had opportunities for that purpoſe) the Court did (as is humbly conceived was juſt) declare their Opinion, and ſo ordered that the Appellants ſhould be included in the whole Account, they having not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any Interrogatories purſuant to the Decretal Order, though the Reſpondent all along offered himſelf to be examined.</p>
            <p>Againſt which ſaid Orders the ſaid Appellants have appealed to the moſt Honourable Houſe of Lords, under pretence as if the Court of Exchequer refuſed to hear their Witneſſeſ, <hi>viva voce,</hi> to prove Notice to the Reſpondents of their Teſtators Aſſignmment. When as in truth none ſuch were ever produced, and it was in iſſue in the Cauſe, and <hi>Roberts, Daſhwoods</hi> Repreſentative examined upon Interrogatories, as to Notice of the Aſſignment, and all opportunities offered for ſuch proof, if it could have been made out, but it was and is evident that none was; and Mr. <hi>Daſhwood</hi> wrote ſeveral Letters, which were prov'd by ſeveral Witneſſes, and his Repreſentative acted in <hi>Ireland</hi> as concerned in the Undertaking, after the time of the pretended Aſſignment, and during the two Years after the Undertaking ended, which by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture with His Majeſty, they had to collect their Arrears in, and to make good the Payments grown due within the five years.</p>
            <p>As to paſſing the Orders complained of, they were done in uſual method, and the Appellants had time and opportunity to incert what of the Anſwers they pleaſed, the draught of the Decretal Order being left with their Clerk in Court and Soliciter, a Month before it was entred.</p>
            <p>And as to the incerting the pretended Allegations of Council into the laſt Orders, they being meer Suggeſtions, and no Memorial taken of them by the Regiſter, the Order was drawn up without them, as is conceived was both juſt and uſual. Wherefore, and for that the Appellant's pretences are ſome of them vain and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, others utterly untrue, and all of them made only for delay, to keep the Reſpondent from recovering ſo great a Sum of Money juſtly due to him, his being kept out of which for above twelve Years laſt paſt, hath reduced him and his Family to great ſtraits, and all further delays will tend to his utter and inevitable Ruine.</p>
            <p>It is therefore moſt humbly prayed, that the Appeal may be diſmiſſed, and the Reſpondent left to proceed and Proſecute upon the ſaid Orders; and Decrees.</p>
