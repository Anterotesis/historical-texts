            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have formerly in two Sermons ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the two Verſes immediately  going before this Text; The firſt of them before the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Houſe of Peeres; The latter before the Honourable Houſe of Commons; and there ſhewed at large that theſe two Verſes did containe two Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:158580:4"/>
which alwayes accompany the Lords Work of building up of his Church; and they are rendered as two Arguments, why all the world ſhould ſtand in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The one</hi> is, becauſe, when ever the Lord builds up <hi>Zion, Hee dotb appeare in his Glory;</hi> hee appeares like himſelf, magnifying all his Attributes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other,</hi> that he does then return a gracious anſwer unto the Prayers of his afflicted People.</p>
            <p>Theſe two were handled in the valley of <hi>Baca,</hi> the valley of Teares, upon dayes of Humiliation; that out of them you might receive ſome ſtrength in your mourning after the Lord, to help you to wait upon him while you are at his Work, building the Street and Wall of <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in a troubleſome time: But now the Lord having in great meaſure given a gracious experience, and fruit of thoſe two, in this late great and unexpected Victory and Mercy, wherein God hath appeared in his Glory, and anſwered his Peoples Prayers, in our excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding low condition; his Providence having alſo called me by your choice, to meet you in the valley of <hi>Beracah,</hi> the valley of Bleſſing to praiſe God for this; I could not thinke of a fitter Text then of the very next words to thoſe that helped you in the dayes of your Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which containes the uſe which the Church in all ages ſhall make of the Lords building up of <hi>Zion.</hi> And though my time for preparation hath been very ſhort; yet I am incouraged, becauſe I have been taught of God, that a Peace-Offering to himſelf is eaſily found: And I have often found from you, that my poore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, how weak ſoever (being the beſt I have) have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been rejected: And therefore without further A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology and Preface, let us conſider of the words as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:158580:4"/>
they thus lie. <hi>This ſhall bee written for the Generation to come: And the People which ſhall bee created, ſhall praiſe the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are you ſee, two Sentences: And for the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of them, ſome Expoſitors doe conceive, that the firſt Sentence containeth the uſe that the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who receive this Mercy ſhall make of it; <hi>They ſhall Write it for the good of Poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond (they think) containes the uſe that the future Generation ſhall make of former Mercies that are thus written; and and tranſmitted to them, <hi>The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tbat ſhall bee created, ſhall praiſe the Lord;</hi> the unborn Generation ſhall praiſe God for it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note>But others (and I think more rightly) doe conceive,  that both ſentences are meant of the ſame individuall People; and that the one of them is but an Exegeticall interpretation of the other: or rather, the firſt of them is an expreſſion of <hi>one way,</hi> how the redeemed of the Lord ſhall glorifie him; by <hi>writing</hi> the Mercies they have received, and tranſmitting them to poſterity: and the other is a comprehenſion of their <hi>whole Work,</hi> that they ſhall not reſt in any one way of manifeſting their care to glorifie God, but ſhall make it the ſum of their whole life, they being created to no other end; <hi>The People that ſhall bee created, ſhall praiſe the Lord.</hi> And I rather incline to this, becauſe this expreſſion, <hi>The People that ſhall bee created;</hi> does ordinarily in the Scripture ſignifie a People brought from an extreame low, deſpicable condition, to a ſtate of happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe, fit to ſerve God. Theſe are ſaid, A people <note place="margin">Eſa. 43. 1, 2. Jer. 31. 22. Epheſ. 2. 10.</note> created for Gods praiſe.</p>
            <p>But Beloved, wee need not bee ſolicitous about it, chuſe which of them you pleaſe, the difference will not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158580:5"/>
be materiall in reſpect of the practicall Obſervations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from them, both of them afford many and the ſame helps for a day of Thankeſgiving: Some few whereof I ſhall endeavour (by the Lords aſſiſtance) in one houre, or a little more, to ſet before you.</p>

               <note place="margin">Thence I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of God. people whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prived of Gods Ordinances. And when they injoy the libertie of them.</note>One is, that which Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves upon this Text:  <hi>viz.</hi> Wee may here diſcerne what (in the Judgement of Gods People) is the ſtate of the Church when they are deprived of Gods Worſhip and Ordinances, and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among the Heathen: and what their eſtate is, when God is pleaſed again to ſet up his Tabernacle amongſt them.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of theſe conditions they were as if their <hi>Creation were annihilated;</hi> as if they were reſolved into their firſt principles. But when God was pleaſed from Heaven to looke upon them, with a reſtauration of his Temple and Worſhip, and bring them again into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Common-wealth: then they looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as a People that were <hi>new created,</hi> that had a new being beſtowed upon them. Their outward condition was much alike in both, for the things of this life. Bond-men they were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Bond-men they were when they returned into <hi>Canaan,</hi> the ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Kings bore ſway over them, and kept them under; and for ought I can learne, they were richer in their captivity, then in their own Countrey; but when they were brought back, to have liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to ſerve God in the way of his Ordinances, then they looked upon themſelves as people that had a new <note place="margin">Ezek. 37.</note> being. Thus they conſtantly judged of themſelves; when their Temple was burnt, and they ſcattered among the Heathen, then they judged of themſelves, as <hi>dead and ary bones,</hi> as thoſe whoſe bones <hi>lay ſcattered,</hi> as when one cutteth chips about the pits mouth; but when they had againe got a naile in Gods Sanctuary, and might enjoy the liberty of his Sabbaths, Feaſts, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſices,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:158580:6"/>
&amp;c. it was as the founding of a <hi>new Heaven and a new Earth</hi> unto them. This I onely mention.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Obſervat.</hi> A people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from low condition moſt fit to praiſe God.</note>Another is, That when the Lord would engage his  Servants to give him his praiſe and glory for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, hee chuſes to call them by this Name, <hi>A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple created:</hi> that is, reduced out of nothing, brought to a bleſſed ſtate, from a low and meane condition, from a people whom God calls by this Name, hee promiſeth himſelf his glory and praiſe; whoever forget him, yet the people who ſhall thus <hi>bee Created</hi> will praiſe him: And that affords this Leſſon:</p>
            <q>That <hi>the People whom God in Mercy brings from a low and meane condition, are the People from whom God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to receive praiſe and glory.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Indeed, ſuch is the ſelfiſhneſſe of our corrupt Nature, that if we are any thing, or doe any thing, we are prone to forget God, and ſacrifice to our own nets, and burn Incenſe to our own yarne; inſomuch, that when ever God finds a people who ſhall either truſt in <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 11, 12, 13. Pſal. 22. 24, 25, 26.</note> him, or praiſe him, it muſt be an <hi>an afflicted and poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or a people brought from ſuch an eſtate; Free Grace is ever moſt valued by ſuch people. And if you looke all the Scripture over, you will find, that all the praiſes, and Songs of deliverance that have been made to God, have proceeded from a people that have thus judged of themſelves, as thoſe that were brought to nothing; but God in mercy had brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> back again from the gates of death, and uſually untill they had ſuch apprehenſions of themſelves, they never gave unto God the glory due to his name. I could give you a cloud of witneſſes to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the truth of it; but I intended only to point at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:158580:7"/>
this. Onely give mee leave before I paſſe from it, to make a ſhort Application of it to our ſelves in theſe two particulars:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. I came one great cauſe why our miſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries continue: We are not yet brought low in our eyes.</note>Firſt, that hence wee may certainly learne one cauſe why our calamities doe continue thus long; why ſtill  wee are brought lower and lower; why though wee bee lifted up one day, or one moneth, wee are ſuddenly brought and caſt back again into as forlorne a condition as ever we were in: God would bring us to ſuch a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſelves, that wee might praiſe him when we are delivered. I am perſwaded God does intend to have a People here in <hi>England</hi> that ſhall bee for his praiſe, and wee doe not yet looke upon our ſelves as a people out of meere Mercy brought from nothing; in the time of our calamities we ſeek him, and ſay, he onely is our rock and our ſalvation: But it is too evident that the pride of our Nation is not yer laid low; ſtill our Armes of fleſh are prone to bee exalted. It is with us, juſt as it was with the Iſraelites, when God brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> hee made account that hee had done enough to make them know their dependance upon him, that they were created as out of nothing, by ſuch a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous breaking the yoke of their bondage, and bringing them through the red Sea into the Wilderneſſe, and in that howling Wilderneſſe giving them bread from Heaven, and water out of the Rocke; but the people had not <hi>yet</hi> learned it, they were high and proud, they were too rough pieces to bee ſo eaſily hewed; one yeares leading them in the VVilderneſſe would not teach them their dependance upon God: and therefore <hi>God</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to lead them in the wilderneſſe, and kept them out of <hi>Canaan</hi> till they had learned it. VVhat they would not learne in one yeare, God made them learne
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:158580:7"/>
in forty yeeres. And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> told them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 23. That the <hi>Lord led them forty yeeres in the Wilderneſſe, and tryed them, and ſuffered them to hunger, that hee might humble them, and make them know that they lived by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that came out of his mouth:</hi> And till they had learned that leſſon, God never made an end with them. And ſurely it is ſo with us; were wee but once come to that paſſe; that wee looked upon our ſelves as a forlorne Nation, as a people void of wealth, of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, of Strength, of Ability to carry on our Work, and would lie at Gods feet, and acknowledge that it is hee that muſt doe it, or we are diſſolved, and undone; God would ſoone make an end with us, then hee would truſt us to praiſe him; a people who thus look upon themſelves, will give him the praiſe and glory due to his Name.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How great the ſinne of ſuch people is, when they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get this duty.</note>Another thing that I as briefly commend to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration  from it is this, That becauſe God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth expect that a people brought from nothing, a people new created will praiſe him; therefore if <hi>ſuch</hi> a people, for whom the Lord hath done ſuch things, ſhould faile him; if they ſhould prove ungratefull, it would aggravate their ſin beyond all apprehenſions, beyond all expreſſions. It is thus among men, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly abhorre to ſee a Begger mounted on Horſeback, and riding proudly: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, It is one of the <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 21, 22</note> things that the earth cannot bear, to ſee a Handmaid made heire to her Miſtreſſe; A <hi>Hagar</hi> laid in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters boſome, and then ſhee to prove inſolent; this amongſt <hi>Men</hi> is intolerable: Beleeve it, it is much more with <hi>God,</hi> when God ſhall take a People, as from a dunghill, from a deſperate and forlorn condition, and (as it were) create them for his glory, and they ſlight
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:158580:8"/>
him, and undervalue him, and deale ungratefully with him: Thus <hi>Ezra</hi> judged, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>When we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch a deliverance as this, ſhould wee againe breake thy Commandements and prove ungratefull; wouldſt thou not bee angry with us till thou hadſt conſumed us?</hi> This was the ground of that unappeaſable wrath that was kindled in God againſt the people of Iſrael, in the 1. of <hi>Eſay,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſay 1. 2. Ezek. 16. 4, 5, 6, 22.</note> 
               <hi>Heare O Heavens, and give eare O Earth; I have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and brought up Children, and yet they rebell againſt mee.</hi> And eſpecially in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16. Where hee told them, I found thee in thy mothers wombe, thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel not cut, no eye pityed thee, as a baſtard caſt out in the time of her nativity; and there I took thee from a dunghill, and bred thee, and trained thee up to be my wife, and thou playedſt the whore againſt mee; and <hi>in all thy abominations</hi> (ſayes hee) <hi>thou never remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bredſt how I found thee deſolate and naked.</hi> This made God judge her after the manner of harlots. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, ſo will it prove with us, if the Lord ſhould go on thus mercifully to deale with <hi>England,</hi> and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate us again, to raiſe us out of theſe gulfes and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and to eſtabliſh us to bee a people, if we then ſhould goe and ſacrifice to our owne Net, or burne Incenſe to our owne yarne, prove ungratefull to him, kick with the heele againſt him; the wrath of God would bee kindled againſt us ſo farre, that there would bee no remedy. God expects better things from us, hee looks, that a people <hi>ſo created,</hi> ſhould be for his praiſe. But this firſt branch I intended onely to point at; The <hi>Perſons</hi> that ſhould doe this work, <hi>The people that ſhould bee created.</hi>

Whatſoever is powred upon the head of Chriſt, what ointment ſoever of praiſe or glory, it will in a due proportion fall downe to the skirts of his garments; nor is there any other way to have any ſweetneſſe, comfort, praiſe, or glory to bee derived unto themſelves, but by giving all unto

            <p>For the truth of it, it is one of <hi>Gods Ordinances.</hi> You ſhall finde it in the 78 <hi>Pſal. verſ.</hi> 5. where the Prophet had exhorted them to give eare, and learne what God had done for them, that they might teach it to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

the way hee hath taken in carrying on his Church, which is the Kingdome of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But now by the true and faithfull ſetting forth to the World what the Lord hath done for us; you ſhould honour God and advantage his Church as much as in any thing that you can poſſibly doe, unleſſe it be the building of the Church it ſelf. Never could more excellent things tending to advance the goodneſſe, wiſdome, power, and mercy of God bee manifeſted to the world, then this ſtory of our times would afford. The Jews have a ſaying, That when God deſtroyed all the World, there was a Copy of all kept in the Arke with <hi>Noah;</hi> and after the Floud was gone, this Copy was re-printed and ſpread over all the world. The meaning was, that the Creatures that were kept there, did fill all the world with Creatures of the ſame nature that the World had before. Truly, I have often thought, that were all the Copies in the world loſt, of Gods admirable dealing with an unworthy people (except only thoſe mentioned in the Scripture, there might be a re-impreſſion of them out of the admirable things that God hath done for us ſince theſe publike caelamities came upon us; and all the world might learn ſufficient out of our Story, what a God our God is, and learn to know, and truſt, and fear him forever; give me leave onely to name ſome <hi>Capita rerum,</hi> ſome heads of things, which is fit the World ſhould read and know: They ſhould read of a <hi>Parliament</hi> called together by a ſtrange providence; and when they were called, God dealt with them, as hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to deale with his own haire, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 5. one third part of it to be thrown away into the wind, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to be burnt in the City, and another to be againe purged and refined, and kept in the skirt of his garment. They ſhould read of 4 or 500 Commons, and multitude
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:158580:19"/>
of Peeres, ſome of them paſſing through the fire, ſome ſcattered into all the corners of the land, ſeeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Nation that had entruſted them; and a remnant left behind, fined and refined, and humbled again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and kept to do wonderfull things for the Lords glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his peoples good. They ſhould likewiſe read of Army after Army, and fight after fight, which wee have had with our Enemies; of every one whereof they ſhould be able to ſay, what my Noble Lord ſaid immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Kynton</hi> fight, <hi>That there was never any thing wherein there was leſſe of man, and more of God.</hi> They ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in all wee have done, there was little of man, and much of God. There they ſhould likewiſe read, how this famous City, and all the Countries where the Goſpel had prevailed, have faithfully ſtood to God and his cauſe even to their owne exhauſting, in the midſt of infinite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements; and how the reſt that were nurſed up under Popery and ſuperſtition, both Lords and Commons, and Gentlemen, and whole Counties did endeavour to fight themſelves into ſlavery, and labour to deſtroy the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>that is,</hi> themſelves, and all that is theirs. There they ſhould read how God broke all our crutches we lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon, our Counſels, our Treaſuries, our Armies; and never proſpered us really, till he had deeply humbled, and made us to look to himſelf onely for help; how he brought the two Nations into a Covenant with him, and ſet them upon a work of Reformation of Religion, and carryed on that work in a troubleſome time, in a time of Warre, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then (in likelihood) it would have been in a time of Peace. There they ſhould read the fruits and effects of Prayer; how he ſuffered his Almighty hand to be, as it were, directed by it. They ſhould ſee what ſtrange Plots were diſcovered, prevented, detected; how God made ſome of our ſtrong Holds to be eaſily delivered, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:158580:20"/>
others of no ſtrength little leſſe then miraculouſly preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt all the Force of the enemy; how uſually God made our loſſes to bee our gaine, and did us moſt good by undoing us; compelling us often to ſay, <hi>Periſsemus niſi periſsemus,</hi> wee had been undone if we had not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; and how our enemies, that roſe againſt us, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more found their gaine to prove their loſſe; and that which raiſed them up higheſt, inſtantly laid them loweſt. What ſhall I ſay? they ſhall in a thouſand particulars read in this Story our folly and Gods wiſdome, our weaknes and Gods ſtrength, our diviſions and confuſions, and Gods ordering them all to ſerve his holy ends. They ſhould read ſuch things as (I am confident no Hiſtory in the world) is able to hold out the like. Now I beſeech you, is it not pity that theſe things ſhould be loſt? ſhall we deprive the world &amp; poſterity of theſe things; <hi>Serimus arbores,</hi> we plant Trees which may beare fruit to after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ſhall we not doe this, which like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi>

God forbid, rather let ſome of the choiceſt men in the Land be ſet about it: It was ſaid of <hi>Claudian,</hi> that he wanted matter to write of ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <note place="margin">Pſal. 10.</note> to his wit; but what wit is ſuitable to this matter. <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things? who can tell the loving kindneſſe of the Lord? who can ſhew forth all his goodneſſe?</hi> My humble ſuit therefore to the Right Honourable Houſes, is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:158580:20"/>
(a thing which I am aſſured God expects from you) even that you would provide that ſome worthy, faithfull heart, and heads, and pens bee ſet on work, who may undertake this Work, and have leave (as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> had in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths dayes)</hi> to ſearch all the Regiſtries; and be enabled to hold forth all the light that may bee, that the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come may ſee a true picture, a faithfull Story of theſe three or foure laſt years: And let him doe it faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, let him not be diſcouraged with the Politicians fear, <hi>That it is dangerous to write truth in the preſent age, not ſafe to come too neere the heels of truth, leſt it kicke out his teeth:</hi> But as the Penmen of the Scripture, wrote mans folly, and Gods goodneſſe; ſo let him bee encouraged to let the world know great things God hath done for us, and how little we have done for our ſelves: no gratious man ſhall have the leſſe glory in Heaven, by letting God have his glory by us on earth, though it be in publiſhing our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and follies. I once again humbly beſeech you the thing may bee done. And yet further to provoke you, conſider that in all ages the eminenteſt men have been employed in this kind of Work. <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the dealings of God for 2500 years from the Creation to their entring into <hi>Canaan;</hi> and afterward it was carryed on by other chiefe Inſtruments; above half the Old Teſtament is a Chronicle of the things done by the Lord in War and Peace for his people. In the New Teſtament four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts wrote the ſtory of Chriſt; <hi>Luke</hi> writing the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and how ill could the world have wanted one of theſe? How miſerable had we been, if we had been deprived of them? And ſince that time I appeale to all Scholars, whether the choiceſt men in learning have not been imployed in this ſervice; and let all Engliſh men ſpeake, whether they think any book written in our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:158580:21"/>
tongue, hath brought more glory to God, and ſtirred up more zeale for Chriſt, and encouraged people more to a holy life, and to own Gods Cauſe couragiouſly, then Mr. <hi>Foxes</hi> books of Martyrs, the Acts and Monuments of the Church. In all this, I plead not for the honour of any man, or men, let them all be laid in the duſt, ſo God may be glorified, they who doe worthily ſhall have glory enough with God in Heaven; yet God would have them alſo had in everlaſting remembrance: but it is for God and his honour that I plead; there are ſuch things of God, of his Wiſdome, Power, Goodneſſe, Compaſſion, Mercy to be ſet forth; that ſhould the Lord move your hearts to reſolve upon it this day, it were a teſtimony of your thankfulneſſe, next to the going on vigorouſly in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and ſetling of the Church; and you can pitch upon nothing that ſhall bring more eternall glory to the Lord, that hath done theſe great things for us, thn to cauſe theſe things to be <hi>written for the Generations to come, that the people not yet created may praiſe the Lord.</hi>
