            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT cannot be expected that a Perſon, who gives
an Information to a Parliament, taken up with
Multiplicity of Important and Weighty Affairs,
ſhould trouble ſuch a Great and Solemn Aſſembly
with more than what is at that time abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
the bare matter of Fact. But there are ſtill
many other Requiſite and Material Circumſtances,
which are reſerv'd for a more Copious rehearſal. As
to the Firſt, the forwardneſs of ſome Printers has bin
too nimble for me. And therefore as to the Latter,
which was that which I alwayes intended to do, I
have here made publick thoſe Additions and Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
of Memorie, which being Truths neceſſary
to be known, and full Anſwers to the Demands of
Public Satisfaction, I have here joyn'd to the reſt, and
made all into one Body.</p>
            <p>And firſt, that I may give ſome accompt of my ſelf,
(for the Popiſh Prieſts and Traytors, though care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
enough at another time, are very Inſpective into
the Credit and Converſations of thoſe that appear as
Evidence againſt them) I am to tell the World, That
I was born at <hi>Skerr,</hi> in the County of <hi>Glamorgan;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſcended from the Antient Family of the <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills,</hi>
that came in with <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call'd the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> Of whom it is Recorded in
Story, That in the time of <hi>Rufus</hi> the Son of King
<hi>William,</hi> that <hi>Paganus Turbervill,</hi> was one of the Twelve
Knights that aſſiſted <hi>Fitz-Haimon</hi> in the Conqueſt of
the County from one of the Princes of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ancient Seat that belong'd to the Family, was
<hi>Coycey</hi> Caſtle, which after it had continu'd in the Name
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51755:4"/>
for Thirteen Generations ſucceſſively, was at length
carry'd away by Marriage into the Family of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages;</hi>
and after that into That of the Earls of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
in whoſe Poſſeſſion it now remains.</p>
            <p>During my Infancy, my Father and Mother being
both Papiſts, and ſtrict in their Way, even to the height
of Bigottiſme and Superſtition, I was brought up in
all the moſt exact Precepts and Doctrine of the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that it was no ſmall part of my Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not onely to hear, but very often to ſay Prayers
my ſelf for the good Succeſs of the Affairs of the
Church (meaning the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) which were
to be Tranſacted in the Year 1666. And I very
well remember, that one Night, my Fathers Houſe
being full of Strangers, I was lodg'd with two Prieſts,
who at the ſame time told me, <hi>That I had had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Honour then if I had layn with two Angels. For that the
Angels were but the Servants and Meſſengers of God; but that
a Priest could command him from his Heavenly Throne, and
give him to whom they pleas'd to be eaten.</hi> A piece of
Blaſphemy, which I not being then able to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
made me very much admire the vaſt power of
thoſe holy Incarnates: but having better ſince conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
of it, has not a little augmented my aſtoniſhment
at the Irreligion of thoſe pretended Votaries.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1672, which was the Eighteenth of my
Age, being a Younger Brother, I was recommended
to wait upon the Lady <hi>Molineux,</hi> Daughter to the Earl
of <hi>Powis,</hi> as her Gentleman Uſher; in which Capacity
I was by her entertain'd, and liv'd in the ſaid Earl's
Houſe about Three Years. By which means, and by
my Sedulity in Attending and Aſſiſting at Maſs, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
very intimate with Father <hi>William Morgan,</hi> then
Confeſſor to the ſaid Earl of <hi>Powis</hi> and his Family.
This <hi>Morgan</hi> was alſo a Jeſuit, and as it were a kind of
Provincial and Director of all the Jeſuites in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51755:4"/>
Counties of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Shropſhire</hi> and
<hi>Staffordſhire.</hi> I will not undertake to particularize all
the Treaſonable Diſcourſes and Communications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this Jeſuitical Confeſſor, and the ſaid Earl and
his Lady; but among the reſt, this I have often heard
the ſaid <hi>Morgan</hi> ſeveral times repeat to the ſaid Earl
and his Lady, <hi>That the Kingdom was in a high Feaver, and
that nothing but Blood-letting could reſtore it to Health; for
then the Catholick Religion would flouriſh.</hi> To which the
ſaid Earl would many times reply, <hi>That it was not yet
time; However be made no queſtion but that ſuch means would
be us'd with all convenient ſpeed;</hi> or words to that effect.
And ſo confident they were of this Revolution, that I
have often heard the ſaid Lady <hi>Powis</hi> tell the ſaid <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
both publickly and in private, That when the true
Religion (meaning that of <hi>Rome</hi>) ſhould be reſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>,
which ſhe doubted not would be brought to paſs in a
ſhort time, ſhe would perſwade her Husband to make
a Gift of a Parcel of Land to the value of 300 l. <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
toward the Foundation and Maintenance of a
Nunnery.</p>
            <p>And for a farther inſtance of their Confidence and
Aſſurance in this Important Particular, while I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
in the ſaid Family, there was one Madam <hi>Remige,</hi>
a <hi>French</hi> Woman, and a Violent Papiſt, living at the
ſame time with my Lady. This Gentlewoman mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
my Brother, and was a Perſon in whom my Lady
greatly confided; upon which accompt the Counteſs
would frequently take her along with her, when ſhe
went into Confeſſor <hi>Morgan's</hi> Chamber, at ſuch time as
they had their private Conſults; where I have alſo
frequently obſerv'd Father <hi>Gawen, Tow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, Evans, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liard,
Roberts, Parry, Owens, White,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain</hi>
and other Prieſts and Jeſuits to meet. When they
met, they were wont to ſhut up themſelves ſometimes
for one, ſometimes for two hours, more or leſs; and
when their Conſults brake up, the ſaid <hi>Remige</hi> and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51755:5"/>
the Confeſſor would ſeem to be in Raptures, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
repeating their joy for the hopes they had that
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion would ſuddainly be eſtabliſh'd in
<hi>England.</hi> Which they did not doubt but to bring to
paſs, notwithſtanding they had met with a very great
Diſappointment, which was the Peace made up with
<hi>Holland.</hi> For, ſaid they, if the Army at <hi>Black-Heath</hi>
had bin ſent into <hi>Holland</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>French,</hi> when they
lay with their Armies about <hi>Amſterdam, Holland</hi> had
certainly bin Conquer'd, and then the <hi>French</hi> would
have bin able to have aſſiſted them with his Forces to
eſtabliſh Popery in <hi>England.</hi> Which Aſſurances of
theirs in theſe and many other Expreſsions of the ſame
nature, importing their Confidence to ſet up the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Religion, they frequently repeated as well to my ſelf,
and in my hearing. In proſecution of which Deſign,
the ſaid <hi>Morgan,</hi> as I have juſt cauſe to believe, took
ſeveral Journeys to <hi>London</hi> and ſeveral Parts of <hi>England,</hi>
and Voyages alſo into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to give and take directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for carrying on the Grand Plott. Upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
whereof, the ſaid Madam <hi>Remige</hi> and her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
having privately ſold their Eſtate, fled into <hi>France</hi>
either in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> laſt paſt, for fear of being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended:
the ſaid Madam <hi>Remige,</hi> as I am aſſur'd by
many Circumſtances, being privy to all or moſt of the
Tranſactions of the Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>And for the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemaine</hi> himſelf, about <hi>May</hi>
laſt was Two Years, I was preſent at Maſs with the
Lord <hi>Powis</hi> in <hi>Vere</hi>-Street, when the ſaid Earl ſaid Maſs
in his Sacerdotal Habits, according to the Rites and
Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the reſt of the Maſſes at which I aſſiſted for
this ſo earneſtly expected Reſtoration, it happen'd, that
one time a Spider fell into the Challice after the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
of the Wine: Which the Prieſt obſerving, went
on however with his Lurry, till he came to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation
of the Wine; at what time fearing that the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51755:5"/>
Liquor of Life might prove the Potion of Death, he
made a full ſtop, and ſent me away to Father <hi>Morgan</hi>
the Confeſsor, to know what he ſhould do? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Confeſsor conſidering well the danger of the
draught, in a very ſurly manner, as being vex'd either
at the Accident or the Careleſneſs of the Prieſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to bid him let it alone. Which caus'd me
not a little to ſuſpect the Credit of their Faith. For it
was my belief, that the moſt Venomous Animals in the
World muſt of neceſsity loſe their Poiſon in the real
Blood of Chriſt. Nor did I obſerve that the ſaid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was taken out, waſh'd and burnt, and the aſhes
lockt up in the Sacrarie, as ought to have bin done.</p>
            <p>Much about this time great Lamentations were
made, as well by my Lord and Lady, as by the Prieſts
that reſorted to the Houſe, and many Curſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
againſt Capt. <hi>John Scudamore</hi> of <hi>Kent-Church</hi> in
the County of <hi>Hereford,</hi> for having apprehended and
ſent to Gaol one <hi>Eliot,</hi> a Prieſt. Which was a great
diſturbance and diſappointment of their deſigns, and
occaſion'd them to take new Councels, and make new
Proviſions for the carrying on of the Plott.</p>
            <p>Having thus continu'd very devout in this ſame Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
courſe of Superſtition and falſe Worſhip for the
ſpace of Three years or thereabouts in the ſaid Earl
of <hi>Powis</hi>'s Houſe, my Lady his Counteſs, and the ſaid
<hi>Morgan</hi> were very preſsing with their Arguments to
perſwade me to enter into Religious Orders. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the ſaid Counteſs highly encourag'd me thereto,
by willing me, That if I would but follow my Studies,
and make my ſelf Capable of Advancement, I could
not want Eccleſiaſtical preferment. Promiſing withal,
to take care of me her ſelf: and further ſaying, That
ſhe did not queſtion but to get me made a Biſhop in
<hi>England</hi> by her Intereſt. For that upon the Reſtoration
of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, there would be great occaſion
for Men of Parts, of whom to make Biſhops, and to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51755:6"/>
employ in the Management of the Affairs of the
Church.</p>
            <p>This was a Courſe of Life which no way correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with my humour, altogether Martial: However,
being allur'd by the Hopes of Preferment, and relying
upon the Promiſes of my Lady, I reſolv'd to ſubmit
my ſelf to the perſwaſions of the Counteſs, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
gave me Ten pounds to carry me to <hi>Doway.</hi> In
order to this Religious Deſign, as I then thought it, I
took Shipping for <hi>Newport;</hi> Where I was no ſooner
Landed, but I found my ſelf preſently in the embraces
of two Fryers, who upon Intelligence of my coming,
were ſent to meet me. They ſeem'd to be very glad
to ſee me, careſsing and entertaining me with all the
Kindneſs I could expect, all the way to <hi>Doway.</hi> Where
being arriv'd, I was preſently admitted into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of <hi>Recollects,</hi> who are a ſort of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to a Purity above all the reſt, and are therefore
collected together to make that Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>In this ſame Monaſterie I ſpent about Three Weeks;
but inſtead of that Seraphic Piety, and Purity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which I expected, obſerving nothing among thoſe
pretended Brethren, but Malice, Envy, Backbiting and
Detraction of one another; and inſtead of refin'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
nothing but refin'd Hypocriſie, my Zeal grew
cold, and I began to think of nothing more, than how
to make my Eſcape.</p>
            <p>I obſerv'd their Naſtineſs, in the Ceremonious burial
of their Lice. For the Purity of their Religion not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them to ſhift their Habits, once a Fortnight
they make a great Fire, and then ſhake their Naſty gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
over it, to the diſmal conſumption of Thouſands
and Ten Thouſands, ſinging certain Pſalms or Hymns
over the Funeral Piles of their Filthy numerous Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</p>
            <p>I obſerv'd their Hypocriſie, when they carry'd me to
one of their Exerciſes, which they call Diſciplining
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51755:6"/>
themſelves. For the performance of which piece of
ſeverity, they betook themſelves to a dark Gallery, and
there ſtood with their Cloaths tuck'd up about their
Middles, and their Lower parts all bare. Every one
had a kind of Whip in his hand, which is compos'd of
an Iron chain of about a foot long, with three other
ſmaller chains branching from the bigger, well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with Fiſhhooks. But I obſerv'd they layd on
with ſo much mildneſs, and ſo much favour to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
as if it had bin rather a Sport than a Penance.
However, I at that time would not ſeem to take notice
of their remiſsneſs, but looking upon it as my duty,
gave my next Neighbour, an old Fat haunch'd Lay-Porker,
a clawing Laſh, as he did alſo to the Next to
him; which put all the reſt into a very great Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Upon which I ran away to my Chamber, and
lock'd my ſelf in, not without ſome bodily fear of what
might have bin the reward of my pretended Miſtake,
had I ſtaid. But ſoon after the Father or Maſter of the
<hi>Novitiates</hi> came to my Chamber, and bid me not be
ſurpriz'd at the ſight of ſuch a ſevere Penance, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the effect of an extraordinary zeal to ſubjugate and
mortifie our Sins of the Fleſh. Which would have
bin a very ſowr piece of Mortification indeed, had the
puniſhment bin as terrible as they made the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
by the terrible viſage of their Inſtruments of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>Believing therefore that neither Hypocriſie, nor
Naſtineſs were any Signs or Marks of True Religion,
I reſol'vd to make my Eſcape from thoſe Dens of Lice
and Diſſimulation; which I did ſoon after, though not
without great difficulty. For whether they ſuſpected
my Intentions or no, I cannot tell; but this I am ſure
of, that ſome few dayes before I got looſe, one Father
<hi>Cudworth,</hi> Guardian of the Monaſterie, told me, That
if I did not continue with them, I ſhould loſe both my
Life and my Friends: Adding farther, That the King,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51755:7"/>
meaning his Majeſtie, ſhould not laſt long, and that
his Succeſſor ſhould be wholly for their purpoſe. And
after my eſcape, meeting with Father <hi>Croſs,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
of the ſaid Monks, he told me, That had he
bin at <hi>Doway,</hi> when I made my eſcape, I ſhould never
have come into <hi>England</hi> again. With ſuch a mortal
hatred they purſue all thoſe that have had the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to have any knowledg of their vain and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Superſtitions.</p>
            <p>Upon my Return into <hi>England</hi> I found my Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
very cold. For the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
together with all the reſt who had encourag'd me
to betake my ſelf to a Monaſtic Life, were become my
utter Enemies, threatning to take away my Life, or at
leaſt to get my Brother to diſ-inherit me. Which vaſt.
piece of their Malice and Revenge they eaſily wrought
upon my Brother to accompliſh.</p>
            <p>Being thus left Friendleſs and deſtitute in <hi>England,</hi>
I went over to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I had another Brother that
was a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monk in that City.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Paris</hi> I ſtaid a conſiderable time, and during my
Reſidence there, came acquainted with one Father <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
who told me among other things relating to this
Kingdom, That the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was a Perſon of that
undoubted and extraordinary Zeal, that he would run
the utmoſt hazards for the benefit and advantage of the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> further ſaying, That there were a
great many devout and zealous people in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi>
that were Perſons of Diſcretion, and ſuch as were fit to
be entruſted in the management of any Affair that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Support of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Faith.</p>
            <p>Another time, one <hi>Latham,</hi> a Prieſt, and <hi>Benedictine</hi>
Monk, being upon his departure with Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi>
for <hi>Rome,</hi> with great Confidence told me, That though
the Retinue of the Cardinal were at that time but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and ſlender, yet he did not doubt to ſee his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
return into <hi>England,</hi> with a Splendor befitting his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51755:7"/>
degree, and dignify'd with the higheſt Characters that
the Pope could beſtow upon him. And that for his part,
though he had been proffer'd to be made Prior of the
<hi>Benedictines</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> he had refus'd it; rather chooſing
to follow the Cardinal's Fortunes, and to depend upon
the Hopes of that preferment, which he was well aſſur'd
he ſhould obtain by the means and favour of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal.
And indeed it was the general diſcourſe among
the Monks at <hi>Paris,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſhould
be an Abbot, and who a Prior, upon the ſuddain Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Catholic Religion in <hi>England.</hi> More then
that, an Eminent Monk of the great Abby of <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi>
declar'd in public, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were a very
unhappy Nation, that had not a Man, who had the
Courage to Reſtore Religion by taking away the Life
of one Single Perſon. And that the World may be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that there was no Degree in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
that did not concern it ſelf in the Grand Deſign, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> told me, That were he not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
by the Vow of his Order, never to ſtirr from his
Convent, He himſelf, although he were not of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, would be the perſon that would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the Work, for the General Good of the Univerſal
Church of God. One Mr. <hi>Rivers</hi> alſo, a Gentleman
well known to many of this Nation, advis'd me to get
the Recommendations of the Prior of the <hi>Benedictines</hi>
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and of the Lord <hi>Thomas Somerſet,</hi> who was a
Canon of St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> then at <hi>Paris,</hi> with what
other Recommendations I could get, and to haſten to
<hi>Rome,</hi> by which means there was no queſtion but I
might get to be admitted into Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who would ſhortly be in great Authority in <hi>England;</hi>
adding further, That had he not engag'd himſelf to be
Tutor to Sir <hi>Charles Shellies</hi> Children, with whom he
was then going for <hi>La Fleche,</hi> he would take the ſame
courſe as he had propos'd to my ſelf; For that upon
the Reſtoration of Religion, they who had taken the
moſt pains, would be the beſt provided for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:51755:8"/>
But theſe Arguments not prevailing, I was by my
Brother perſwaded to return into <hi>England;</hi> and in order
to that Journey by my ſaid Brother and the ſaid Prior
of the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> recommended to the acquaintance
of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> then at <hi>Paris,</hi> by whom about the
latter end of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1675. I was readily entertain'd,
and being look'd upon as a Gentleman, had the Honor
of a Frequent and Free acceſs to his Lordſhip. During
my Attendance upon my Lord, which was about three
Weeks, his Lordſhip having, as I am apt to believe,
receiv'd ſome private Intimations from the Prior and
my Brother, began very gradually with me, telling me
in the firſt place, That being a Gentleman, who had
bin bred up to no Calling, and was now deſerted by
my Friends and Relations, I muſt inevitably fall into
ſuch ill Courſes, as would bring me to ſome unhappy
end. For the preventing whereof, it would be better
for me to undertake an Action, wherein if I ſucceeded,
it would make me happy in this World; or if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry'd,
would procure me an everlaſting Crown in
Heaven. Having thus rais'd my Expectations, at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
time he added, That he had a piece of Service to
propoſe to me, that would not only reſtore me to the
good Opinion of my own Relations, but for ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
both them and their Poſterity. As I was willing
to embrace all Opportunities to advance my own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
ſo it may be certainly thought, that I was no
leſs inquiſitive, what piece of Service it was, that was
expected from me. But my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
preſently to commit ſo great a diſcovery to my
knowledg, would by no means open his Mind to me,
but exacted from me, all the Imaginable Obligations
to Secreſie, which I gave his Lordſhip in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
manner he could poſſibly invent. Which being
done, he again repeated to me the great Advantages
that would accrue both to my ſelf and the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Cauſe, if I ſtood firm and proſper'd in what I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51755:8"/>
was to undertake; and then told me in direct Terms,
That I might make my ſelf and the Nation happy, by
taking away the Life of the King of <hi>England,</hi> who was
a Heretick, and conſequently a Rebel to God Almighty.
This being a Propoſal very ſurprizing, I deſir'd his
Lordſhip to allow me ſome ſhort time to conſider of
it, and promis'd withall to give him my anſwer at
<hi>Diepe;</hi> where his Lordſhip at that time had ſignify'd
his intentions to me to embarque for <hi>England.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
I went before to the place appointed: but my
Lord altering his Journey, went with Count <hi>Grammont</hi>
to <hi>Calais,</hi> and from thence ſent word to me, expecting
him at <hi>Diepe,</hi> to make haſte for <hi>England,</hi> and to attend
him at <hi>London.</hi> But then growing ſenſible of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
of the Propoſal made me, and well knowing that
my anſwer would be nothing ſatisfactory to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
I reſolv'd to go for <hi>England,</hi> and ſo to avoid all
farther Importunities from his Lordſhip, by receiving
any farther Obligations from Him, I enter'd into the
<hi>French</hi> Service, and had the Honour to be admitted into
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Regiment, by a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
from his Grace, at the humble Requeſt
of my Worthy Friend Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ed. Stradling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſpent ſome time in the <hi>French</hi> Army, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
for <hi>England,</hi> and by the Kind favour of <hi>Philip Hoby</hi>
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> continu'd with him at his houſe at <hi>Neath</hi> Abby in
the County of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> till the late Levies of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
for <hi>Flanders,</hi> at which time I made haſte away for
<hi>London,</hi> and underſtanding the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> was not a
little in the favour of his Royal Highneſs the Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> I made my addreſſes to his Lordſhip, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
me to the Duke for an Employment, giving his
Lordſhip an accompt of my Condition, and deſiring
him to believe, That though I could not conform to a
Religious Life, yet I made no queſtion but by my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
in the Field I ſhould retreive the good will of his
Lordſhip, and the reſt of my Friends and Relations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51755:9"/>
His Lordſhip, with a ſeeming Compaſſion made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That I ought in the firſt place to implore the
Heavenly Aſſiſtance; and that in order thereunto, I
ſhould go and make my Confeſſion to the Earl of <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi>
who was then in my Lords Chamber ready to
ſay Maſs. Accordingly I went and made my Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in obedience to his Lordſhips Directions. But
notwithſtanding my compliance in Spirituals, I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
neglected, as to thoſe Temporal Favors which
I daily ſought by his Lordſhips means. For which as I
have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, I have great Reaſon to thank
his Counteſs, who is ſo much a <hi>Romanist,</hi> as never to
truſt a Perſon whom ſhe has once injur'd.</p>
            <p>Thus finding the Profeſſors of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion
ſo full of Treachery, Malice, Hypocriſie and Revenge,
I abſolutely renounc'd all future hopes and dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
upon it, and ſeriouſly reſolv'd ſincerely and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
to conform to the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
And I hope there is no true Proteſtant will have
the worſe opinion of Me, for liſtening to the Voice of
Conſcience, and chooſing to follow the Light of Truth,
becauſe I was once a wanderer in the By-wayes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Darkneſs. 'Tis not to be thought but that I muſt
expect to be proſecuted and purſu'd by the Malice of
their Tongues: For indeed it was a main endeavour of
my former Friends and ſtill unkind Relations, becauſe
I could not confine my ſelf to one of their Cloyſters, by
expoſing me to hardſhip and neceſſity, to precipitate
me into evil Courſes, that ſo I might become obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to their Fury. But as I am one that know they can
fix nothing upon me for Truth, ſo I value not their
Scandals or Reproaches, from which I make no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but to clear my ſelf, when ever there ſhall be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>At the time of the Tryal of <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi>
when I was to give my Evidence, I was not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51755:9"/>
at firſt, not doubting but that all the Oppoſition
in the World would be made againſt me, and that all
the Scandals and Reproaches would be thrown upon
me, that all the Craft of Papiſtical Equivocations could
fix upon my ſhoulders; But on the other ſide, I was
not a little encourag'd, when I ſaw who the perſons
were that after ſo long a preparation were brought to
make their appearance againſt me.</p>
            <p>The firſt was the Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Butler, whoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
intereſt and dependance I leave to publick Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>The ſecond a Gentleman of <hi>Grey's-Inn,</hi> who has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
declar'd to the World his calamitous Condition,
that he was ſo Pocky and ſo poor, that he was weary
of his life, and for that reaſon provok'd ſeveral people
to cut his Throat, to the end he might be quit of his
miſery; but by the charity of a Gentleman who is Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
to the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> he was patch'd up and
ſupported till he was call'd to the Barr; by the credit
whereof he marry'd a Wife with a ſmall Fortune,
which is now almoſt ſpent.</p>
            <p>Now I leave it to all the World to judge, what ſuch
a man, unprincipl'd, would not do to gratifie a Perſon
that had preſerv'd him from Starving, and to ingratiate
himſelf with a Party, which he thought would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
and from which no doubt he had very large
Promiſes, according to the uſual cuſtome of thoſe
People.</p>
            <p>My Brother appear'd next, who declar'd that my
Elder Brother gave me Seven pounds never to ſee me
more; which Money he ſaid I received, after I went
from <hi>Doway;</hi> though in truth I never did. A very
kind Brother to give, and certainly a very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
Brother to be ſatisfy'd with ſuch a ſmall pittance
of his future Expectations for the continuance of ſuch
a Mortal Separation. But 'tis no wonder, ſince the
Difference in Religion engages Brother againſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51755:10"/>
that they who could prevail with my Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to diſ-inherit me, could prevail with a Younger
Brother to play the Fool in publick, by appearing
againſt me to ſo little purpoſe. However I believe he
was deluded to it, and ſo I pardon him.</p>
            <p>The laſt that appear'd againſt me, was my Lord
<hi>Caſtlemaine</hi>'s Steward, which was more then his Lord
himſelf could do, and therefore a teſtimony of little
value. He pretended, That for Three Years he had
not bin half a Week out of my Lord's Company;
though upon examination it was found that he had
miſtaken Fifteen Months in his accompt.</p>
            <p>From all which we may make this Judgment, What
a ſort of People we have to deal with, and what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
we labour under, that we are not only requir'd
to give in Evidence upon Oath, but muſt be forc'd to
prove by collateral Teſtimonies of our Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,
that Truth is Truth; and that our Evidence
muſt be cavill'd at by thoſe that bring ſuch poor and
pitiful Sons of reproach to confront us. Hoewever, it
was my happineſs, that my Circumſtances were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
by ſeveral Perſons of great Eſtates, and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable
Reputation.</p>
