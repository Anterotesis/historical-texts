            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a bold Expedition which a Writer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, when he ſends his Forces abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World; he is to encounter Enemies of all kinds; not only, vaſt populous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of effeminate underſtanding, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten defeat with their numbers; but Bold, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, Hardy, and invincible Fools who will dye upon the Turfe, rather than yield: nay, and his friends too often break their League, and ſend ſecret ſupplies to his Enemies. All Reputations look on themſelves as invaded, and every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Reputation. Fame is a great Common, where every Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager thinks he has a right, and will rather ſuffer it all to lye waſte, than any part to be incloſed. Every man thinks himſelf by Birth, a Wit, as every <hi>Spaniard</hi> thinks himſelf a Gentleman; he has as good Bloud in his veins, as Perſons of the greateſt Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, onely wants their Titles; that is to ſay, every Man wou'd be a Wit, if he had it. Yet as much value, as they have for it in themſelves, they hate no man more, than he who about <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in that, for which they wou'd have themſelves eſteemed. But the enmity of poor vulgar Heads were nothing, if Men of the firſt rank of Wit, had not Feudes among themſelves; 'Tis a ſtrange Lunacy that poſſeſſes 'em: a man that has the largeſt Habitation in Fame, will yet think all his Windows darkened, if another ſoars over him.
<pb facs="tcp:56676:3"/>
Men have not the ſame Phrenſies in other things. The greateſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Muſique in the World, does not think he ſhares one Note leſs of it, for a croud of Liſtners; what ever quarrels there have been among Trading Nations, about ingroſſing Commerce, none ever fought to ingroſs the Winds, becauſe no Ship had the leſs for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other having his Sails full: and yet Wit-Adventurers, perpetually contend for the breath of the multitude, and think themſelves becalm'd, if any one has a gale. In ſhort, a Writer is lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an Invader of the World; and all Mankind are in Arms againſt him. In ſuch a deſperate condition, he muſt implore, of ſome potent Perſon, either his Conduct, or at leaſt leave to awe the World with his name; and I know no greater Name, nor more able to afford me protection than your Lordſhips. It is but pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Lordſhip favors this Play, and that ſhall give it ſafe Conduct through underſtandings of every Degree and Climate; it can paſs through no Region, where your Lordſhip has not an abſolute Command. The Traders to the hot Southern Climes of Wit, find in your Lordſhip the Golden Coaſt, vaſt heaps of that Wit, which paſſes currant in the World, and bears the Images of others, are known to be coyned out of your Lordſhips Oar; but nothing can be richer, than that of your own Refining. More temperate Heads which ake under the oppreſſion of that Heat, delight themſelves in your Lordſhips Courteſy, Generoſity, Integrity, Honour, and all the more familiar Vertues: no part of Mankind, but may find ſome particular Excellence or other in your Lordſhip, to pleaſe them. The Vertues of this age, methinks converſe with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like the Wits of it, in parties and factions; ſeldom uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together; every Vertue takes a Houſe by it ſelf, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches with a thouſand Vices. How often do we ſee Wit, inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably aſſociating with that Raſcal, Ill Nature; and thoſe Fopps, Conceits, and Selfiſhneſs, and not one vertue in his company? as often do we find courage bluſtring by it ſelf, and Wit, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to come near him. Integrity, Friendſhip, and Honeſty, are ſo miſerably under the hatches, one knows not where to find thoſe poor Creatures; they never in any age, lived in much heighth, they are not born to great fortune, and ſeldom acquire one; Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very has the only <hi>Dutch Genius,</hi> to get an Eſtate, but yet they never were ſo down as now, they now ſcarce at all appear, or if
<pb facs="tcp:56676:3"/>
they do, we find Wit not often in their company. And thus I might diſcourſe, ſhou'd I go round to all the Moral Vertues; But they are not all ſo unſociable, as never to meet, they can come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether when they like the place, and they are ſo fond of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Soul, not one of 'em fails of reſorting thither. And as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple uſe to dreſs themſelves well, when they are to appear in great Aſſemblies; ſo thoſe excellent qualities, which we often find ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Habited in private Lodgings, by themſelves, do now in ſo much good company, ſhine in your Lordſhips Breaſt, in their richeſt Equipage: That repairing to your Lordſhips Protection, I march not ſo much under the Conduct of one, as of many Great Men, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one. But far be it from me, to ſacrifice ſuch a Hecatomb, to the multitude; no, rather let me offer this, and all their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe to your Lordſhip; for after all, that is my real deſign. It is true, my Lord, I have not much of it to lay at your Feet. The Play I preſent you, cannot boaſt of extraordinary Merit; it is not of the firſt kind of Plays, a thing may be good in its kind, and yet an ill thing, becauſe the kind is ill; thoſe who do not like low Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, will not be pleaſed with this, becauſe a great part of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Comedy, almoſt ſunk into Farce; yet, if they will allow it well in its kind, I ſhall deſire no more favour from 'em; any may perceive, I never intended to build high, by the poor foundation I laid, and yet, as it happened, the Building ſtood firmer than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and withſtood the battery of a whole party, who did me the Honor to profeſs themſelves my enemies, and made me appear more conſiderable than ever I thought my ſelf, by ſhewing, that no leſs than a confederacy was neceſſary to ruine my Reputation; had they overturn'd this, they cou'd not have hurt me, ſince I had long before parted from it, as a trifle, where I never intended to repoſe; but as it happened, I had the diverſion to ſee the Play ſtand, and them choakt with the duſt they made about it: if they wou'd have done me the favour to have taken me into their ſociety, I wou'd have joyn'd with them in damning a great part of it; for I deſign'd it for Damnation; but if they had done ſo, I fear we ſhou'd not have agreed in what part: for as if we were deſign'd for enmity, with all that I loath'd, they ſeem'd extreamly diverted. All this, I ſay, my Lord, onely to offer your Lordſhip my Preſent, as clean as I can make it, which I take the more pains about, becauſe I offer it
<pb facs="tcp:56676:4"/>
not as a Bribe, but purely a Preſent. The common declared deſign of Dedication, like the concealed one of Devotion, is in other terms Bribery; Men do not pray to ſerve Heaven, but pray that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven may ſerve them; ſo Dedicators, who trouble great Men, only to gain their Protection, ſacrifice not to their Patrons, but ſacrifice their Patrons to themſelves. I declare, I beg not your Lordſhips Protection, but Acceptance of this Play, and then let it periſh if it will—Victims ought to dye, nor does it come to your Altars, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Crown, and one received from a Royal Hand; a Fortune more Glorious than I could expect I deſigned it, (as any one may ſee by the low Characters) onely to ſerve an Apprentiſhip to the City, but being honor'd with the Kings favour, I thought I ought to treat it with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and I cou'd not do it greater Honor, than to put it in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſervice; and ſo I diſcharged my ſelf of a double Debt, and paid all under one, the duty I owed, to what the King favour'd, and the much greater Duty and Honor I owe to a perſon, whom Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has favour'd with Qualities admir'd by all the World, but by none more than</p>

            <l>OH, Sirs, this is a monſtrous witty Age</l>
            <l>Wit grown a drugg, has quite undone the Stage.</l>
            <l>The mighty Wits now come to a new Play.</l>
            <l>Only to taſte the ſcraps they flung away.</l>
            <l>Poets new Treat you at your own expence,</l>
            <l>All but the Poets now, abound in Sence;</l>
            <l>City and Countrey is with Wit o'rflown,</l>
            <l>Weeds grow not faſter there, than Wits in Town:</l>
            <l>New Wits and Poets every day are bred,</l>
            <l>Each hour, ſome budding Criticque ſhews his Head.</l>
            <l>Playes are ſo common, they ere little priz'd,</l>
            <l>And to be but a Poet, is deſpis'd.</l>
            <l>The ſaucy Tongue, much boldneſs wou'd diſplay,</l>
            <l>That durſt in ſpight of all this plenty, ſay</l>
            <l>Poets and Criticques too, are very rare,</l>
            <l>Yes, Sirs, we to our ſorrow find they are;</l>
            <l>More to the making of a Wit there goes,</l>
            <l>Than niggard Nature commonly beſtows.</l>
            <l>A Writer at the leaſt, 'tis not a Grain,</l>
            <l>Only to ſeaſon, and preſerve the Brain;</l>
            <l>From fav'ring of the Fool, nor at the beſt</l>
            <l>To ſpice Diſcourſe with an inſipid Jeſt.</l>
            <l>Writing, like <hi>Roman</hi> Gloves, ſhould ſcent a room,</l>
            <l>Each thought ſhou'd have in it, a ſtrong perfume.</l>
            <l>But oh, few ſmell of Wit, ſo very rank,</l>
            <l>Nature of Late is turn'd a Mountebank,</l>
            <l>A Winter, or a Daffy, and puts off</l>
            <l>For Wit and Sence, ſome fooliſh Chymick Stuffe.</l>
            <l>A Quinteſſence, but not of Wit, Heaven knows,</l>
            <l>Which ſhe to all moſt liberally throws.</l>
            <l>Noiſe in the Cit, and noiſe upon the Stage,</l>
            <l>Who wou'd not think it were a witty Age</l>
            <l>Never more noiſe and talk of Wit was known,</l>

            <l>Oh, wou'd theſe quacking tricks, but Nature have,</l>
            <l>And not the poor unhappy World deceive</l>
            <l>With Heat which ſeems like Wit, but is not ſo,</l>

I ſhould come off blewly now, if I ſhould not have enough, but be forc'd to cheat her of one half of the reckoning:—No matter, ſhe is rightly ſerv'd to ſurprize me ſo; ſhe ought to have given me fair warning, and not have drawn ſo great a Bill as this on me, to be paid at ſight: ſhe might well think, I that am ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Trader, cannot have much money in Bank: Ay, but ſhe is

in Love; and Love is blind, one may put a falſe piece of Coin on him now and then, eſpecially after I have paid him a great ſum, he will not be ſo ſcrupulous.—Well, I am a Catholick man of ſtrange univerſal uſe, I ought to have a Penſion for the publick ſervice I do the State; but though I am an excellent Subject, I am a trayterous Lover; how like a barbarous villain do I uſe that divine Creature Mrs. <hi>Chriſtina?</hi> if I were fifty <hi>Rambles</hi> bound together, I had not merit enough for her Love; and I, though I am but one, yet parcel my ſelf out every minute to fifty women: yet 'tis not for want of love to her, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of other women, give me not ſo much delight as a ſmile from her: and yet, I gad, the enjoyment of her would not keep me from the chaſe of other women:—Here am I raving mad after a woman, only tickled with an Image in my own fancy, of a young, pretty, melting, twining, burning Creature, who for ought I know may be only an old, ugly, leacherous <hi>Succuba,</hi> like a burning Hill, with ſnow on her top, and fire in her guts; and has inchanted me to her imbraces with a delicate young amorous Picture, put in my head: No, no, it cannot be; if ſhe were ugly, ſhe would not have the impudence to ſend for me; nay ſhe would not have the impudence to Love: No, no, ſhe muſt be handſome, ay and extremely handſome too:—Let me ſee, what kind of woman may ſhe be? ſhe has a large rouling ſmiling black eye, full of fire; a round ſweet juicy melting lip, full of blood; even ſmall Ivory teeth; full, round, white, hard breaſts; a ſmall ſtraight delicate ſhape; a white little hand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to be moiſt; a little neat foot; her ſtature middling:—Ay, this is ſhe, I know her as well as if I were married to her; I am ſure 'tis ſhe,—I gad I am paſſionately in Love with her.—Oh my dear Envoy, come back quickly with full Commiſſion from thy Lady, or I ſhall fall into a Feaver:—Come, come, come:—here ſhe is, here ſhe is;—my dear, let's go, let's go, let's go;—ſhew me the way, ſhew me the way, my dear Scout, for my forces are all up in arms, and they will charge in ſpight of my teeth, I cannot hold 'em in.</p>
