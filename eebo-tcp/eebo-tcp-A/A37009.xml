            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>HOw! the House full! and at a <hi>Royal Play!</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That's strange! I never hop'd to see this day.</l>
            <l>But sure this must some change of Fate fore-tell;</l>
            <l>For th' Pit (methinks) looks like a <hi>Commonweal</hi>;</l>
            <l>Where Monarch Wit's bafl'd by ev'ry Drudge,</l>
            <l>And each pert Railing <hi>Brimigham</hi>'s a Judge.</l>
            <l>But know, ye Criticks of unequal Pride,</l>
            <l>The Dice now give kind chances on our side;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tories</hi> are upmost, and the <hi>Whigs</hi> defy'd.</l>
            <l>Your <hi>Factious Juries</hi> and <hi>Associations</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Must never think to ruine twice Three Nations;</l>
            <l>No, there's one 'bove you has too long had Patience.</l>
            <l>Changing of sides is now not counted strange;</l>
            <l>Some for <hi>Religion,</hi> some for <hi>Faction</hi> change:</l>
            <l>And (lest Examples should be too remote,)</l>
            <l>A <hi>Rev'rend Clergy-man</hi> of famous note</l>
            <l>Hath chang'd his <hi>Cassock</hi> for a <hi>Campaign-Coat</hi>;</l>
            <l>Amongst the Saints doth most devoutly <hi>Stickle,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And holy Bag-pipe squeals in <hi>Conventicle.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Another sort there are that rore and rant;</l>
            <l>Are <hi>Loyal</hi>; but all other Vertues want:</l>
            <l>Ask their Religion, they cry, <hi>What a Pox,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Damn me ye Dog, I'm stanch, I'm <hi>Orthodox.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>These are as bad as t'other ev'ry way,</l>
            <l>And much unlike my part I act to day;</l>
            <l>A <hi>Royallist</hi> by <hi>Nature,</hi> not by <hi>Art,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That loves his Prince and Countrey at his Heart;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Addresses</hi> loves, to all Mankind is civil;</l>
            <l>But hates <hi>Petitions</hi> as he hates the Devil;</l>
            <l>Perfect in Honour, constant to his Friend;</l>
            <l>And only hath one fault, is wondrous kind.</l>

Yet who here would refuse a kind Intrigue;</l>
            <l>Faith none who does it is a Rigling <hi>Whig.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>This is his Character, and is't not pity</l>
            <l>But such as he bore Office in the City?</l>
            <l>How would all honest Hearts their Fates esteem,</l>
            <l>Were all our Common-Council-men like him?</l>
            <l>How glad to be preserv'd from Factious Furies,</l>
            <l>If such as he was Fore-man of the Juries.</l>
            <l>This point once gain'd, Sedition would want force,</l>

            <l>Who rores in Coffee-house, and wasts his Wealth,</l>

            <l>This part should have been given some hardy Fool,</l>
            <l>That had more sense for Int'rest than his Soul.</l>
            <l>I never had the knack of Truth-denying,</l>
            <l>Loving Sedition, Loyalty defying;</l>
            <l>Nor could I take Ten Pound a week for Lying.</l>
            <l>But since 'tis so, I must intreat the pity</l>
            <l>Of you our (never failing) Friends i'th' City.</l>
            <l>For though I was not e're brought up to th' Trade,</l>
            <l>Like Setting-Dog I may with Art be made.</l>

            </l>
            <l>And faith, that thought hath raised my ambition:</l>

            <l>Cry up the <hi>Play,</hi> and always let me find</l>
