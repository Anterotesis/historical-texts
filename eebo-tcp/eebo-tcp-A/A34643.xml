            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Epistle to Sir Clifford Clifton, then
sitting in Parliament.</head>
            <l>WHEN from thy kind hand, my dearest, dear brother,</l>
            <l>Whom I love as th'adst been the Son of my Mother,</l>
            <l>Nay, better, to tell you the truth of the story,</l>
            <l>Had you into the World but two minutes before me;</l>
            <l>I receiv'd thy kind Letter, good Lord, how it eas'd me</l>
            <l>Of the villanous Spleen that for six days had seiz'd me:</l>
            <l>I start from my Couch, where I lay dull and muddy,</l>
            <l>Of my Servants inquiring the way to my Study,</l>
            <l>For, in truth, of late days I so little do mind it,</l>
            <l>Should one turn me twice about I never should find it:</l>
            <l>But by help of direction, I soon did arrive at</l>
            <l>The place where I us'd to sit fooling in private.</l>
            <l>So soon as got thither, I straight fell to calling,</l>
            <l>Some call it invoking, but mine was plain bawling;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:106881:166"/>
I call'd for my Muse, but no answer she made me,</l>
            <l>Nor could I conceive why the Slut should evade me.</l>
            <l>I knew I there left her, and lock't her so safe in,</l>
            <l>There could be no likelihood of her escaping:</l>
            <l>Besides, had she scap't, I was sure to retrieve her,</l>
            <l>She being so ugly that none would receive her:</l>

               </gap> tumbled my Papers, and rifled each Packet,</l>
            <l>Threw my Books all on heaps, and kept such a racket,</l>

Fy, fy on this Idleness, get up, and rowze you,</l>

            <l>Has sent here a Letter, a kind and a good one:</l>
            <l>Which must be suddenly answer'd, and finely,</l>
            <l>Or the Knight will take it exceeding unkindly;</l>
            <l>To which having some time sat musing and mute,</l>
            <l>She answer'd sh'ad broke all the strings of her Lute;</l>
            <l>And had got such a Rheum with lying alone,</l>
            <l>That her Voice was utterly broken and gone:</l>
            <l>Besides this, she had heard, that of late I had made</l>
            <l>A Friendship with one that had since bin her Maid;</l>
            <l>One Prose, a slatternly ill-favour'd toad,</l>
            <l>As common as Hackney, and beaten as Road,</l>
            <l>With whom I sat up somtimes whole Nights together,</l>
            <l>Whil'st she was exposed to the Wind and weather.</l>
            <l>Wherefore, since that I did so slight and abuse her,</l>
            <l>She likewise now hop'd I would please to excuse her.</l>
            <l>At this sudden reply I was basely confounded,</l>
            <l>I star'd like a Quaker, and groan'd like a Round-head</l>
            <l>And in such a case, what the Fiend could one do?</l>
            <l>My conscience convinc'd her Reproaches were true</l>

To swagger, I durst not, I else could have beat her,</l>

            <l>To quarrel her then had been quite out of season,</l>

            <l>I therefore was fain to dissemble Repentance,</l>

            <l>And wrigling away, fairly left me without it:</l>
            <l>I caught her, and offered her Mony, a little,</l>
            <l>At which, she cry'd that were to plunder the Spittle:</l>
            <l>I then, to allure her, propos'd to her, Fame,</l>
            <l>Which she so much despised, she pish't at the name;</l>
            <l>And told me in answer, that she could not glory at</l>
            <l>The Sail-bearing Title of Muse to a Laureat,</l>
            <l>Much less to a Rhymer, did nought but disgust one,</l>
            <l>And pretended to nothing but pittiful Fustion.</l>
            <l>But oh, at that word, how I rated, and call'd her,</l>
            <l>And had my Fist up, with intent to have maul'd her:</l>
            <l>At which, the poor Slut, half afraid of the matter,</l>

            <l>I had been extremely unjust to her Passion.</l>

            <l>I'de advise thee beware falling out with thy betters;</l>
            <l>I have heard of two Dogs once that fought for a bone,</l>
            <l>But the Proverb's so greazy, I'll let it alone;</l>
            <l>A <hi>word</hi> is enough to the <hi>wise;</hi> then resent it,</l>
            <l>A rash Act than mended is sooner repented:</l>
            <l>And, as for the thing call'd a Traytor; if any</l>
            <l>Be prov'd to be such, as I doubt there's too many;</l>

            <l>What a pox were blocks, gibbets, and gallowses made for?</l>
            <l>But I grow monstrous weary, and how should I chuse,</l>
            <l>This galloping Rhyme has quite jaded my Muse:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:106881:169"/>
And I swear, if thou look'st for more posting of hers,</l>
            <l>Little K<hi rend="sup">nt</hi>, thou must needs lend her one of thy Spurs.</l>
            <l>Farewel then, dear Bully, but ne're look for a Name,</l>
            <l>For, expecting no honour, I will have no shame:</l>
            <l>Yet, that you may ghess at the Party that writes t'ee,</l>
            <l>And not grope in the dark, I'll hold up these Lights t'ee.</l>
            <l>For his Stature, he's but a contemptible Male,</l>
            <l>And grown something swab with drinking good Ale;</l>
            <l>His Looks, than your brown, a little thought brighter,</l>
            <l>Which gray hairs make every year whiter &amp; whiter,</l>
            <l>His Visage, which all the rest mainly disgraces,</l>
            <l>Is warp't, or by Age, or cutting of Faces.</l>
            <l>So that, whether 't were made so, or whether 't were marr'd,</l>
            <l>In good sooth, he's a very unpromising Bard:</l>
            <l>His Legs, which creep out of two old-fashion'd Knapsacks,</l>
            <l>Are neither two Mill-posts, nor yet are they trap-sticks;</l>
            <l>They bear him, when sober, bestir 'em and spare not,</l>
            <l>And who the Devil can stand when they are not?</l>
            <l>Thus much for his Person, now for his condition,</l>
            <l>That's sick enough full to require a Physician:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:106881:169"/>He always wants Mony, which makes him want ease,</l>
            <l>And he's always besieg'd, tho himself of the Peace,</l>
            <l>By an Army of Duns, who batter with Scandals,</l>
            <l>And are Foemen more fierce than the <hi>Goths</hi> or the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But when he does sally, as somtimes he does,</l>
            <l>Then hey for <hi>Bess Iuckson,</hi> and a Fig for his Foes:</l>
            <l>He's good Fellow enough to do every one right,</l>
            <l>And never was first that ask't, what time of Night:</l>
            <l>His delight is to toss the Cann merrily round,</l>
            <l>And loves to be wet, but hates to be drow'nd:</l>
            <l>He fain would be just, but sometimes he cannot,</l>
            <l>Which gives him the trouble that other men ha' not.</l>
            <l>He honours his Friend, but he wants means to show it,</l>
            <l>And loves to be rhyming, but is the worst Poet.</l>
            <l>Yet among all these Vices, to give him his due,</l>
            <l>He has the Vertue to be a true Lover of you.</l>
            <l>But how much he loves you, he says you may ghess it,</l>
            <l>Since nor Prose, nor yet Meeter, he swears can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it.</l>

            <l>THanks for this rescue <hi>Time;</hi> for thou hast won</l>
            <l>In this more glory than the <hi>States</hi> have done</l>
            <l>In all their <hi>Conquests;</hi> they have conquer'd <hi>Men,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But thou hast conquer'd that would conquer them,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Famine;</hi> and in this <hi>Parricide</hi> hast-shown</l>
            <l>A greater courage than their <hi>Acts</hi> dare own;</l>
            <l>Thou'st slain thy eating <hi>Brother,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Fame</hi>

            <l>Greater than all past <hi>Heroes</hi> e're could claim:</l>
            <l>Nor do I think thou could'st have conquer'd him</l>
            <l>By force, it surely was by <hi>Stratage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </l>
            <l>There was a Dearth when he gave up the <hi>Ghost:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For, (on my life) his Stomack he ne're lost,</l>
            <l>That never fail'd him, and without all doubt</l>
            <l>Had he been victual'd he had still held out:</l>
            <l>Howe're, it happen'd for the <hi>Nation</hi> well,</l>
            <l>All fear of <hi>Famine</hi> now's impossible,</l>
            <l>

Since we have scap't his reign; Blest were my Rhymes,</l>
            <l>Could they but prove, that for the peoples Crimes</l>
            <l>He an atonement fell; for in him dy'd</l>
            <l>
               <hi>More Bulls,</hi> and <hi>Rams,</hi> than in all times beside,</l>
            <l>Though we the numbers of them all ingrost,</l>
            <l>Offer'd with antique <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Cost:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And 'tmight have well become the <hi>Peoples</hi> care</l>
            <l>To have embowel'd him, if such there were,</l>
            <l>Who, in respect of their <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> peace,</l>
            <l>Would have attempted such a task as this,</l>
            <l>For 'tis discreetly doubted he'll go hard</l>
            <l>To eat up all his fellows i'th' <hi>Church-yard:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then, as from several parts each mangled Limb</l>
            <l>Meet at the last, they all will rise in him;</l>
            <l>And he (as once a <hi>Pleader</hi>) may arise</l>
            <l>A general <hi>Advocate</hi> at the last <hi>Assize.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I wonder, <hi>Death</hi> durst venture on this prize,</l>
            <l>His jaws more greedy were, and wide than his,</l>
            <l>'Twas well he only was compos'd of Bone,</l>
            <l>Had he been Flesh, this <hi>Eater</hi> had not gone;</l>
            <l>Or had they not been empty <hi>Skelletons,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>As sure as Death he'd crush't his Marrow-bones;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:106881:213"/>
And knockt 'em too, his stomack was so rife,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Rogue</hi> lov'd Marrow, as he lov'd his life.</l>
            <l>Behold! behold, O <hi>Brethren!</hi> you may see</l>
            <l>By this late <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Mortality,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>'Tis not the lining of the <hi>Inward Man,</hi>

            <l>(Though ne're so soundly stuff't, and cramb'd) that can</l>
            <l>Keep Life, and Soul together; for if that</l>
            <l>Could have preserv'd him, he had kick't at <hi>Fate</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With his <hi>High shooes,</hi> and liv'd to make a prey</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Butchers</hi> stinking Offal to this day.</l>
            <l>But he is gone, and 't had been excellent sport</l>
            <l>When first he stalked into <hi>Pluto</hi>'s <hi>Court,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Had one but seen with what an angry gust</l>
            <l>The greedy <hi>Rascal</hi> worried <hi>Cerberus;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I know he'd do't before he would retreat,</l>
            <l>And, he and 's <hi>stomack</hi> are not parted yet;</l>
            <l>But, that digested, how he'll do for meat</l>
            <l>I can't imagine: for the <hi>Devil</hi> a bit</l>
            <l>He'll purchase there, unless this tedious time</l>
            <l>The tree of <hi>Tantalus</hi> was sav'd for him;</l>
            <l>Should it prove so, no doubt he would rejoyce,</l>
            <l>Spight of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi>'s horrid noise.</l>

            <l>That, rather than confess them to his <hi>Sire,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He would, like <hi>Porcia,</hi> swallow coals of Fire,</l>

            <l>Eternal pains, void ashes, and repent;</l>
            <l>For, without that, his torments still would last,</l>

               <l>OLd Fop, why should you take such pains</l>
               <l>To Paint, and Perriwig it so?</l>
               <l>My nobler Love alas! disdains</l>
               <l>To stoop so infamously low.</l>
               <l>Time that does mow the fairest Flowers,</l>
               <l>Has made so very bold with yours,</l>
               <l>You should expect to be deny'd:</l>
               <l>The Footmen can no more endure you,</l>
               <l>And, if no sport in Hell, assure you</l>

               <head>To his Honor'd Friend, the
Author of this Excellent
POEM.</head>
               <l>I Took, <hi>Sir,</hi> of your Book a short survay,</l>
               <l>And swiftly ran it over without stay;</l>
               <l>Yet stumbled not, I found the Work to be</l>
               <l>So smoothly wrought, and coucht so evenly.</l>
               <l>Some Muses seem to gambol and curvet;</l>
               <l>But yours, though frolick Feet on Ground she set,</l>
               <l>Goes (as she swam in Blood) an easie pace,</l>
               <l>Or rather runs a wreath-deserving Race.</l>
               <l>Some rave in Verse, as they would seem to be</l>
               <l>Full (like the Sibylls) of some Deity,</l>
               <l>When Wine inflates them; but you, in your height</l>
               <l>Of Fury, give your wing'd Phansies weight,</l>
               <l>With Reason temper Rage, and like a strong</l>
               <l>Well-fraighted Bark, pass steadily along.</l>
               <l>You (as a true bred Stanhop) write in State,</l>
               <l>Brave lines compose, yet ne're Luxuriate;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="659" facs="tcp:106881:340"/>But keep within your sober bounds, most fit</l>
               <l>To give restraint to a high-working Wit.</l>
               <l>As a Wise <hi>King</hi>'s a Subject of your lines,</l>
               <l>So you considerately bring on designs,</l>
               <l>Not rush (like <hi>Curtius</hi>) into th' vastitys</l>
               <l>Of danger, but approach by fair degrees,</l>
               <l>Relating from what troubled Sourse arose</l>
               <l>Th' discord, and what troops of Gallant Foes</l>
               <l>Gave Luster to the Field, as here with fine</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Phaebean</hi> Phansies your Narrations shine.</l>
               <l>Now when brave Metal to the stroke you bring,</l>
               <l>Your Verse then sparkles, fervently you sing,</l>
               <l>Spur up your <hi>Pegasus,</hi> and make him fly</l>
               <l>A gallant pitch of rare sublimity,</l>
               <l>And when his Head into a Cloud doth dash,</l>
               <l>Cause it to Thunder, as your Wit doth flash.</l>
               <l>Great <hi>Mars,</hi> when <hi>Diomed</hi> his Wast did wound,</l>
               <l>From his deep Throat sent froth a hideous sound:</l>
               <l>But (sure) he bellows not in <hi>Homer</hi> more</l>
               <l>To terror, than your Poem makes him roar.</l>
               <l>As your high enterprize did merit Praise,</l>
               <l>So for th' atchievement claim your Crown of Bayes.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="660" facs="tcp:106881:341"/>Your Worth was in the bud, but now 'tis blown</l>
               <l>By Fame, and to more Eminency grown,</l>
               <l>By this strong work, a work that may defy</l>
               <l>The Tooth of Time, and Tongue of Calumny.</l>
