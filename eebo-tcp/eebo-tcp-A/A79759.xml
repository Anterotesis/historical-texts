         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Kings MAJESTY who lately reigned, being contrary to the Diſſent and Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Kingdom, now removed by a violent death, The Eſtates of Parliament have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and proclaimed the Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of <hi>Wales</hi> to be King, as you will perceive by the incloſed Proclamation; and have reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make addreſſes to him with all poſſible ſpeed about theſe things that concern the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Religion, and the Peace of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. And becauſe of the great importance of his MAJESTIES diſpoſition and of theſe Affaires, we hope that you will be carefull to deale earneſtly with God both in private and publick, in behalfe of His MAJESTY who now is; And we have thought fit that a ſolemn pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Humiliation be kept on Thurſday the 22. of this inſtant, as for all the ſins and provocations of the land, ſo to pray the Lord in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for theſe things following. 1. That he would deliver the King from the ſnare of evill Counſell in which he is now involed, and teach him in his youth in the knwledge of his way, that he may fear his name: and imploy his power for eſtabliſhing and advancing the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, and the work of Reformation. 2. That the Lord would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bleſſe thoſe addreſſes that are now to be made to his MAJESTIE for the ſecurity of Religion, the union betwixt the Kingdomes, and the peace and ſafety of this Kingdome. 3. That he would ſtrenthen and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our afflicted Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> who ſuffer by the violence and ſtrange practiſes of the Sectaries. 4. That he would in his mercy prevent all thoſe calamities and confuſions that the preſent great revolution of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires doth threaten theſe Kingdomes with. So hoping that you will be carefull to ſtirre up your ſelves and others to wraſtle with God in ſuch an exigent, and to intimate the Faſt timouſly, and to keep the ſame in your ſeverall congregations the foreſaid day.</p>
            <p>We ſhall only adde that if there be any in your congregations who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to renew the Covenant, and are not excluded by the Act; Our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that after you have conveened them before you, and found them obſtinate, that you make publick intimation of their names from your Pulpits, as of perſons that are diſſaffected, and enemies to the cauſe of God; and that you referre them to the next Generall Aſſembly; till which time you are to ſuſpend them from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and from all Eccleſiaſtick charge, that ſo they may be in the ſame caſe with thoſe who are excluded becauſe of their malignancy and acceſſion to the engagement. We commend you to his Grace and reſts,</p>
