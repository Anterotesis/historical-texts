            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His preſent occaſion ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely
be fitting me, I am
reſolved to treat of that
which hath beene omitted,
and ſlipped out of memory
long ſince, concerning divers
and ſundry changes and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in <hi>England,</hi> in former
times: Nor will it be any way burthenſome to
write of that, whereby every good and carefull

and the danger and feare of cruell death.
I will therefore ſpeake of that which hath laine

men who have been led away by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93627:3"/>
a moſt ſhamefull and ignominious death: a famous
example, to deter all men from practiſing thoſe
or the like courſes.</p>
            <p>ABout the yeere of Chriſt, 1386, at ſuch time
as <hi>Richard,</hi> the ſecond of that name, then in
prime of his youth, ſwayed the Imperiall Scepter
of our Realme, there flouriſhed famous in his
Court certain Peeres, though ſome of them not
of any honourable deſcent, yet favoured by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
by name, <hi>Alexander Nevill,</hi> Archbiſhop of
<hi>Yorke; Robert Vere,</hi> D. of <hi>Ireland; Michael de la Pool,</hi>
Earle of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> then Lord Chancelor; <hi>Robert Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilian,</hi>
Lord Chiefe Juſtice of <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
Brambre,</hi> ſometimes Major of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe men being raiſed from meane eſtates by
the ſpeciall favour of the King, and advanced to
the degree of Privie Counſellors, were the men
who had the onely rule of the Common-wealth
which they, under the King, governed for ſome
ſmall ſpace with careful diligence, meriting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
deſerved commendations. But not long did
they thus ſteere the Ship of the Kingdome; for
many of them being of inferiour ranke by birth,
not having their veines dignified with the
ſtreams of noble blood, they were the ſooner
enticed with the libidinous baits of voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and infected with inſatiable itch of avarice:
inſomuch, that deſpiſing the authority of the
King, and neglecting the commoditie of the
Realme, but onely deſiring to keepe up the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnes
of the Kingdome, ſo wrought, that by their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93627:3"/>
policie the King is impoveriſhed, the Treaſure
exhauſted; the Commons murmure at the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of Tenths, Levies, and Subſidies; the
Peeres repine to ſee themſelves diſgraced, and
their inferiors honoured; and in a word,
the whole Kingdome endures an univerſall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.</p>
            <p>The nobility ſeeing the miſerable eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Kingdome lay, bleeding as it were to death,
urged their King to ſummon a Parliament; which
was done ſhortly after. In which amongſt many
other acts, the afore-named <hi>Michaell de la Poole</hi> is
diſmiſt of his Chancelourſhip; and being accuſed
of divers and many points of injuſtice, as briberie,
Extortion and the like, he was ſone after caſt into
the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor,</hi> and all his Lands, which
were of no ſmall Revenue, were confiſcated to
the King. Neither did the Parliament here give
over, but provided further for the whole ſtate;
by the mutuall conſent of the King and Prelates,
Barons, and Commons, with an unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
they conſtitute and give plenarie and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
power to certain Commiſsioners, as well
of the Spiritualty as of the Temporalty; for the
ordering and diſpoſing of the publique affaires,
according as ſhall ſeeme beſt and moſt neceſſary
for the deſperate eſtate of the Commonwealth to
depreſſe civill diſſentions, and to pacifie and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
the grudgings of the people.</p>
            <p>Of the Spiritualty, were choſen the Arch
Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the afore-named Biſhop of
<hi>Yorke,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> lately made Chancelor of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93627:4"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
Lord Treaſurer; Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> Abbot of
<hi>Waleham,</hi> and the Lord <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Waltham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Layty were elected the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi>
the Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> the Lord <hi>Coltham,</hi> the Lord
<hi>scroope,</hi> and <hi>John Devoureux</hi> Knight: theſe, as men
eminent in vertue, were choſen by the generall
Suffrage, and ſworne to carry themſelves as duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and obedient ſubjects in all their actions. And
it was further enacted, That if any ſhould refuſe
or diſobey the Ordinances ſo made for publique
good, the puniſhment of his firſt offence, ſhould
be the confiſcation of his goods; and for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
the loſſe of life. Thus diſpoſing all things
for the beſt, the Parliament being diſſolved, every
man returned to his own houſe.</p>
            <p>Soone after, the afore-named Chancelor, with
others of their Confederates, being moved with
implacable fury againſt the Statute of the late
Parliament, they buzzed into the Kings eares,
That the Statutes lately enacted, were very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
to the honour of his Crowne, and much
derogatory to his Princely Prerogative: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that he ſhould not have power, without
the conſent of the new appointed Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
to doe any thing befitting a King, no, not ſo
much as to beſtow a Largeſſe; a principal means
to gain the peoples love upon any, though never
ſo well deſerving.</p>
            <p>By theſe and other the like impious inſtigations,
with which the Devil (as never unmindfull of the
end of thoſe, who by their lives doe prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93627:4"/>
did continually ſupply them, they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to annihilate and diſanull theſe Acts of the
Parliament, which ſeemed any wayes to abbrevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
or curbe their uſurped authority.</p>
            <p>And firſt, by their ſerpentine tongues, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
projects, flattery painted out with gloſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
and covered over with the ſhadow of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancie
for the good of the Kingdome, they ſo
bewitched the Noble inclination of the youthfull
King, whom they induced to beleeve, that all the
ill they did was a generall good; that hee began
to diſtaſte, and at laſt to abhorre the laſt paſſed
Acts, as treacherous Plots and moſt wicked
Devices.</p>
            <p>Next, they ſtudied how to ingroſſe all or the
moſt part of the Wealth and Riches of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
into their owne Coffers; and to the ſame
end, dealt ſo cunningly, yet pleaſingly, with the
King, that hee gave to the D. of <hi>Ireland, John</hi> of
<hi>Bloys,</hi> the Heire of the Duchie of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and his
Ranſome; to others, Townes; to others, Cities;
to others, Lands; to others, Mony, amounting to
the ſumme of 100000 Marks, to the great impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhment
both of King and Kingdome: Neither
did theſe King-eaters and Realme-devourers any
thing regard it, but ſetting unskilfull and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Captaines and Governours over Townes and
Forts ſo obtained, gave occaſion to the Enemies
of the Crowne to ſurprize them, and diſpoſſeſſe
the King of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, vilifying the dignity of the King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their allegeance, they drew the King to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93627:5"/>
ſweare, That with all his power, during his life, he
ſhould maintaine and defend them from all their
Enemies, whether foraine or domeſtick.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whereas it was enacted by the laſt
Parliament, That the King at certaine ſeaſonable
times, and when his leyſure would permit him,
ſhould ſit at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with his Councell there,
to conſult of the publique Affaires; through the
perſwaſions of the aforeſaid Conſpirators, hee
was drawne into the moſt remoteſt parts of the
Realme, to the great diſparagement of the fidelity
of thoſe Honourable, grave, and faithfull Peeres,
late made joynt Commiſſioners, in whoſe hands
the whole ſafety and proſperity of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
did reſide.</p>
            <p>And when as the Lord Chancellor, the Lord
Treaſurer, Keeper of the Privie Seale, or any other
of the Privie Councell, came to relate any of
their owne actions, or the ſtate of the Realme,
they could not be granted acceſſe, unleſſe they
related the buſineſſe in the preſence and hearing
of the Conſpirators, who were alwayes ready to
upbraid them if they uttered any thing that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
them, and to commend them for any
thing (though moſt nefarious) that did content
them, for thus could they the ſooner learne and
dive into the acts of the Commiſsioners, and the
better finde evaſions for their accuſations: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
when as the King in company of the
Conſpirators went in progreſſe towards the parts
of <hi>Cheſhire, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> they made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
in the Kings Name throughout the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93627:5"/>
Shires as they journyed, That all Barons, Knights,
Eſquires, with the greateſt part of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
able to beare Armes, ſhould ſpeedily repaire
to the King for his defence againſt the power of
the Commiſſioners, chiefly of the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>
and the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> becauſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reſt, did with their chiefeſt endevours, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſuppreſſe and quell the devices of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, contrary to the aforeſaid Acts, they
cauſed the D. of <hi>Ireland</hi> to bee created Chiefe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> thereby ſelling Juſtice as they
liſted, condemning the guiltleſſe, and remitting
the guilty, never reſpecting or looking unto the
equall ballance of Juſtice, but poyzing downe the
Scales with heaps of Bribery.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, by the procurement of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
they cauſed certaine honeſt perſons, who
would not conſent to their extortions, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and ſummoned to their Court, and there to
anſwer to certaine falſe accuſations, wherewith
they were unjuſtly charged by perjured hirelings;
of which men ſo accuſed, ſome were put to death,
ſome caſt into priſon, all were vexed and troubled
with delayes, length of their iourney to and fro,
and exceſſive charges; neither were they eaſed of
any of theſe burthens, unleſſe they would part
with round ſummes of money to the D. and his
Complices.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, they gave pardons under the broad
Scale, to Felons, Murtherers, and ſuch like, only
with this condition, that they ſhould murther any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93627:6"/>
whomſoever they thought did miſlike their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.</p>
            <p>Eightly, they taught the Country of <hi>Ireland</hi> to
looke to its priſtine eſtate, I meane, of having a
King; for they plotted to have the Duke created
King of <hi>Ireland:</hi> and for the confirmation of which
their deſigned, they allured the King to ſend his
Letters to the Pope.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, the aforeſaid <hi>Nicholas Brambre,</hi> in the
time of his Maioraltie, cauſed two and twenty to
be falſly accuſed of Felonies, and layd into <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
under pretext and colour of divers Crimes,
and in the ſilent and dead time of the night to be
faſt bound, and by a ſtrong hand to be carried into
<hi>Kent,</hi> to a place commonly called <hi>Fawlocks,</hi> and
then to have their heads ſtruck off, except one,
who being favoured by the murtherers, ſafely
eſcaped; the bloud of the reſt dyed the ſtreames
of a ſmall Rivelet adjoyning.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, ſoone after, to adde one miſchiefe to
another, they ſent Letters under the Kings Signet,
to the Maior of <hi>London,</hi> by <hi>John Rippon</hi> Clerke,
with a certaine Libell or Schedule incloſed in the
ſaid Letters, the tenor of which is as followeth.</p>
            <p>That the afore-named three Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Arundel</hi> and
<hi>Warwick,</hi> and other of the Councell, were to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted,
indicted, condemned, &amp; put to lamentable
death, as being ſuch as had conſpired againſt the
King, againſt his Prerogative, and againſt his
Crowne and Imperiall Dignity; and to this, they
did in a manner conſtrain the King to aſſent unto.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93627:6"/>
Upon receit of theſe Letters, the Major and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
of the City of <hi>London,</hi> called a Common
Councell, wherein they conſulted what courſe
were beſt to be taken in this matter; and after long
debate <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> it was on all ſides agreed, to deny
and not to ſuffer that cruell and unheard of Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Complot to be executed.</p>
            <p>It ever happeneth one wicked Act drawes on a
ſecond, and that ſecond a third, and ſo forwards,
till the weight cracks the Supporter.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſaid Conſpiratours being blinded
with raſhneſſe, principally ſent Letters by <hi>John
Godfrey</hi> knight to the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Kings
adverſary, to conclude a five yeares Truce, ſhould
come over to <hi>Callis,</hi> and from thence ſhould ſend
for the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Arundel</hi>
and <hi>Warwick,</hi> and for ſome other of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
as though the King were unwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of any thing without their advice; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus circumvented, ſhould be condemned as
Traitors, and ſo put to an ignominious and cruell
death.</p>
            <p>And for the doing and performing of theſe
things, the King of <hi>France</hi> was to recover all the
Caſtles, Townes, and Lands lying in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
and belonging to the King of <hi>England:</hi> To
prove theſe things to be true, there were certaine
Writings produced by the Commiſſioners, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were contained Letters from the King of <hi>France</hi>
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and from the Conſpirators
in the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Name, to the King of
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:93627:7"/>
Moreover, there were other Letters intercepted
directed to the ſaid King of <hi>France;</hi> the ſubſtance
whereof, was to incite the King of <hi>France</hi> to levie
a puiſſant power both horſe and foot, and to draw
them down to <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> and thence to tranſport
them into <hi>England,</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi>
the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Warwick,</hi> and the reſt of
the Commiſſioners, and all thoſe that did either
countenance or favour the ſaid Statute and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners;
which as they falſly alleaged, was made
in derogation of the Kings Prerogative, and the
aforeſaid Commiſſioners to vanquiſh, oppreſſe, and
put to death, and conſequently, the whole Nation
and Language utterly to ruine.</p>
            <p>Not here concluding their devilliſh Conſpiracy,
the five aforeſaid Conſpiratours departed from
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to the Caſtle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and ſent
a writ for <hi>Robert Beale,</hi> Lord chiefe Juſtice of the
Common Pleas, <hi>John Holt, Roger Fulthorp,</hi> and
<hi>William Burleigh,</hi> Judges of the ſaid court, and
for <hi>John Locton,</hi> the Kings Sergeant at Law: who
being come into the Councel Chamber, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they were ſent for, the aforeſaid Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
cauſed the Gates and Doores of the Caſtle
to be ſhut, and then propounded theſe Queſtions
following unto them.</p>
            <p>Firſt Whether thoſe Statutes, Ordinances, and
Commiſſion made in the late Parliament at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
were derogatory to the Kings Dignity
and Kingly prerogative; and becauſe they were
to be puniſhed who did procure thoſe Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and did incite and move the King to conſent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93627:7"/>
unto them, &amp; did as much as in them lay to hinder
the King from exerciſing his Royall Prerogative.</p>
            <p>To theſe and other the like queſtions, with a joynt
conſent they anſwered, That they were to ſuffer
death as Traitors, or elſe to endure ſome capitall
puniſhment: in witneſſe of which aſſertion, being
terrified with the fear of preſent death, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Judges, together with <hi>John Carey,</hi> Lord Chief
Baron of the Exchequer, they ſigned and ſealed a
certain Writing, in manner of a proteſtation, in
preſence of theſe Witneſſes, <hi>Alex. Nevill,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Bangor, Robert</hi> Duke
of <hi>Ireland, Michael</hi> Earle of <hi>Suffolk, John Rippon</hi>
Clerk, and <hi>John Blake</hi> Fruiterer; dated the 19 of
<hi>September, Anno Dom.</hi> 1387, in the 11 yeere of the
Reigne of K. <hi>Richard</hi> the Second. Then were they
compelled to ſweare, that they ſhould keepe the
paſſages undiſcovered, upon pain of death; and ſo
they had licence to depart. And when they had
plotted thoſe and many other Devilliſh Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
they bound themſelves by an Oath, to try all
wayes and uſe all means, as far forth as lay in their
power, to diſanull and utterly abrogate the Acts
and Statutes of the laſt Parliament.</p>
            <p>And that which is worſe, they cauſed the King
to ſweare, That in his proper perſon with his whole
power he ſhould take revenge of the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>
of the two Earles and their adherents, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them to be put to death.</p>
            <p>The carriage of all which Actions may more
eaſily be known, if the time and the order of them
be duly conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:93627:8"/>
But our mercifull and ever-gracious God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there were ſo many Plots, ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies,
ſo many Treaſons wrought againſt our
State, whereby many miſeries did accrue to our
kingdome; yet unwilling to take revenge, or to
puniſh us for our ſinnes, but rather according to his
gracious pitie, to eaſe us of our burthenous calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
inſpired into the hearts of the aforeſaid Duke
of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Warwick,</hi>
the ſpirit of valour and magnanimitie: who ſeeing
the heap of ils that daily did ariſe by the practices
of thoſe Conſpirators; they ſet almoſt in every
part of the kingdome Intelligencers, who ſhould
apprehend all Meſſengers, and intercept all Letters
of the kings, or that went under the kings Name,
and ſhould ſend them to the Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>And thus did they come to have intelligence of
the whole plot of the Conſpirators; all their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being indorſed with <hi>Glory be to God on high, on
Earth peace, and good will towards men:</hi> and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the knowledge of each circumſtance, they
found, that the kingdome was at the point of
deſtruction; according to that Evangelicall ſaying,
<hi>Every Kingdome divided againſt it ſelfe, ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved:</hi>
wherefore they ſought for a Remedy; for
by the Law of Nature, it is tolerable to repell
violence by violence: ſithence it is better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them to apply a Remedy to a wound, every man
according to his ability levied a power for the
preſervation of the king and kingdome; all which
Forces being united, amounting to the number of
20000 fighting men, and couragiouſly reſolving to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93627:8"/>
fruſtrate all the intended deſignes of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
&amp; to open the Nut by cracking the Shell;
they divided their Army, committing part of it to
the Earle of <hi>Arundel:</hi> who by night marched away
with his Forces, and pitched his Tents neere to
<hi>London,</hi> there fortifying himſelf in the Forreſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning,
untill ſuch time as hee had gained more
convenient time and greater force, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of his Conſorts: And in the meane time he
uſed ſuch diſcipline in his Campe, that he lacked
nothing, but all things were there ſold at reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
rates, as it had beene at a Market; and hardly
could he contain the common people for joyning
with him, for the overthrow of the Conſpirators
and their adherents.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the Conſpirators intending
to prevent their purpoſes, by power of a certaine
Spirituall Commiſsion, and by vertue of certaine
Letters Patents in the hands of the Conſpirators,
though nothing to the purpoſe; yet to blind the
people, they cauſed to be proclaimed throughout
the whole Citie of <hi>London,</hi> That none upon paine
of the forfeiture of all their Goods, ſhould neither
ſell, give, or communicate privately or publiquely
Victuall, Armour, or any other neceſſaries to the
Army of the Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> but ſhould debarre
them of ſuſtentation, comfort, or help, as Rebels
to the King and Country. But on the other ſide,
they began to feare when they were denied their
hoped for Aid by the Major and Commonalty of
the Citie of <hi>London;</hi> and againe, they were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at the riſing of the Commoners, to invade
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93627:9"/>
them. Wherefore they counſelled the King to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
himſelfe from the Parliament (which was to
begin at <hi>Candlemas</hi> next, according as the King and
Commiſſioners had appointed it) and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of the Affairs of the Kingdom, nor of his own
Eſtate, commodity or diſcommodity, unleſſe the
Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the two Earles of <hi>Arundel</hi> and
<hi>Warwick,</hi> with the reſt of the Commiſſioners,
would ſweare, That neither they, nor any in their
name, ſhould accuſe them or urge any accuſation
againſt them.</p>
            <p>And they cauſed it to be proclaimed through
the City of <hi>London,</hi> That none under pain of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation
of all their goods, ſhould ſpeake any
upbraiding ſpeeches concerning the King or the
Conſpiratours; which was a thing impoſſible to
hinder.</p>
            <p>Not long after it hapned, that the King, with
the aforeſaid five Conſpiratours, came from his
Mannor of <hi>Sheeve</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to Saint <hi>Edmonds</hi>
Tombe, for the ſolemnizing of a Pilgrimage.
The Maior and Aldermen of the Citie of <hi>London</hi>
met him on horſebacke ſumptuouſly attyred, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
him very much. And when they came to
the <hi>Mews,</hi> they deſcended from their Horſes, and
went bare-foot to the Tombe of Saint <hi>Edmond;</hi>
whereas the Chaplain of the Commiſſioners, with
the Abbot and Covent, met them with a ſtately
Proceſſion.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the three Noblemen, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and the Earles of <hi>Arundel</hi>
and <hi>Warwick</hi> having muſtered their troups on the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93627:9"/>
foureteenth of <hi>November,</hi> in the ſame yeare, at
<hi>Waltham Croſſe,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and
from thence ſent for the Commiſsioners that
were there at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in Parliament with the
King, ſending an Accuſation in writing to the King
againſt the aforeſaid Conſpirators, <hi>viz.</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Earle of <hi>Suffolke,
Robert Treſilian,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Brembre;</hi> wherein
they accuſed them of high Treaſon: Which their
Appellation they did offer to maintaine, and that
they were willing to proſecute the ſame; and to
prove it to be true, they cauſed alſo the reſt of the
Commiſsioners to ſubſcribe, as parties to their
Appellation.</p>
            <p>When theſe things came to the eares of the
King, he ſent unto them, requiring to know what
their requeſt was, and what they wiſhed to have
beene done: They returned anſwer thus; That
they did deſire, that the Traytors which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
about him, filling his eares with falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
and did dayly commit inſufferable Crimes
and Injuries, might be rewarded with condigne
puniſhment; for it were better that ſome few
ſhould dye for the people, then the whole Nation
ſhould periſh.</p>
            <p>And they likewiſe craved, that they might
have ſafe liberty of going and comming to his
Grace.</p>
            <p>When the King heard their Requeſt, hee gave
them his Royall conſent, and commanded them
to appeare at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and the King ſitting on
his Throne in the great Hall, the three aforeſaid
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93627:10"/>
Peeres Appellants, with a gallant Troup of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
entred, and making three lowly obeyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
on their bended knees, they reverenced the
King: and drawing neere (the cauſe of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
being alledged) they there againe appealed
the Archbiſhop, Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Earle Treaſurer,
and <hi>Brambre</hi> of high Treaſon, according as they
had done before at <hi>Waltham Croſſe;</hi> but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taked
themſelves to the private corners of the
Palace, even as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> from the preſence
of God, not having the heart to appeare, to juſtifie
themſelves.</p>
            <p>The King called forth the Appellants, to prove
and proſecute the Appellation, preſcribing them
a day and place for the Tryall, which was to be
on the morrow after <hi>Candlemas</hi> day; and in the
meane time, the King commanded them upon
their Honours, not any party to moleſt the other,
untill the next Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thoſe things thus paſſed, were publiquely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
throughout all <hi>England,</hi> and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
joyfully.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the guide of his
Grand Captain the devil, marching into <hi>Cheſhire,
Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> raiſed a new power, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the number of 6000 fighting men, in the
Kings name, to overthrow and confound the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellants;
from thence marched towards <hi>London</hi>
with his Armie, with a furious intent and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to performe his bloudy deſigne. But God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
their fooliſh hearts, filled them with vain
hopes, that they ſhould acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh their enterpriſes.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93627:10"/>
And whileſt theſe Plots were laid, the Appellants
being ſuddenly advertiſed thereof, raiſed a power,
and joyning with them the Earle of <hi>Derby,</hi> and the
Earle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and other Commiſsioners,
marched with long and wearied Marches into a
Field neere a Village called <hi>Whitney,</hi> at a place
called <hi>Locford Bridge:</hi> In which Field the Duke
of <hi>Ireland</hi> was with the Army, having a River on
the one ſide of them, whereas they ſtood ready
prepared to give an overthrow to the Appellants,
and diſplaying the Kings Standard, contrary to the
Laws of the Land: But although they were ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
at the beginning, yet were they diſcouraged
at the end; for when they ſaw the Army of the
Appellants march downe from the Mountaines
like a Hive of Bees, and with ſuch a violent fury,
feare benummed them, and they were ſo amazed,
that when they ſhould give the Aſſault (God not
ſuffering the effuſion of bloud) they ſtood like a
Hive of Bees, or a flock of Cattell without a head,
making no ſhew or countenance of reſiſting; but
without any ſtroke given, they flung downe their
Armes, and yielded themſelves to the mercy of
the Appellants; and a few being ſlaine, and ſome
drowned in the River, gave an eaſie Victory to the
Conquerors. The Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> himſelfe put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſpurres to his Horſe, tooke the River, and
hardly eſcaped; and though he was purſued, yet
hee eſcaped through the middeſt of the Troupes.
And thus by the mercy of God they obtained the
glorious Palme of Victory from the Hand of
Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:93627:11"/>
When the news of the Victory was blowne to
the eares of the reſt of the Conſpirators, who went
then ſtricken with feare, and carefull for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
under covert of the night they fled by
Water to the Tower, drawing the king along with
them.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Nicholas Brambre</hi> with a bold
and reſolute courage, in the kings Name cauſed
all the Gates of the City to be ſhut againſt the
Appellants, and to be guarded with an able and
ſufficient Watch: But theſe worthy and dauntleſſe
Members of the Common-wealth marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>London,</hi> to conferre with the king; but when
they heard that the ſaid <hi>Nicholas Brambre</hi> had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Gates of the City to be ſhut againſt them,
and to be ſtrongly guarded, and that the whole
City did purpoſe to keepe them out, they ſtayed
their reſolution.</p>
            <p>On the 27 day of <hi>September,</hi> in the ſame yeare,
with a melodious ſound of divers kinds of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as well of Warre as of Peace, they encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
themſelves in <hi>Clarkenwell,</hi> within the Liberties
of the Citie of <hi>London;</hi> not purpoſing on the one
ſide, raſhly or unadviſedly to enter the City, nor on
the other ſide, to make any ſhew of feare; but with
a ſtayed minde (as befitting wiſe men) with good
deliberation to conclude every thing in its due
time. And when as the Major, with the Citizens,
came unto them with pleaſing words, promiſing
unto them all that the City could afford, with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and equity; the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> ſaid, Now
I know, that Lyers ſpeakes nothing but Lyes,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93627:11"/>
neither can any man hinder them from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
Where upon, by a joint conſent, in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
they removed their tents, and pitched them
before divers Gates of the City.</p>
            <p>On the morrow there hapned an enterview
betweene the King and the Appellants, ſo farre,
that they opened their minds one to the other: but
becauſe the king loathed to ſpeak with them, with
ſuch a rabble of men, and in regard of an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
boldnes, and ſome quarrell, which was like to
ariſe; and on the otherſide, refuſing to goe out of
the <hi>Tower</hi> to ſpeake with them, and the Apellants
fearing ſome violence or wrong to bee offered to
them, would not ſpeake with the King without a
ſtrong guard of valiant Warriours: Therefore the
moſt wiſe of the Appellants, after divers diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had reſolved to goe and conferre with the
King: but firſt they ſent a ſtrong troupe well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
to ſearch all the Corners and Caves of the
<hi>Tower?</hi> and relation being made of the ſafety of
the place, with a ſelected band of valiant Cavaliers
they entred the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſeiſing the Gates, and
placing a guard appeared before the King; and
there the third time appealed the aforeſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,
in the ſame ſort and forme as before:
which Appellation being ended, the King ſwore,
That he would adhere to their connſell, as a good
King and a juſt Judg ſo farre as the rule of Law,
Reaſon and Equity did require.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being accompliſhed, they departed
from the <hi>Tower</hi> to their Tenements and Lodgings:
And then it was publiſhed and made known in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93627:12"/>
the preſence of the King, and throughout the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
That on the morrow after <hi>Candlemas</hi>
day the aforeſaid Conſpirators ſhould perſonally
appeare, to anſwer to the Appellation, whereby
they were charged of ſo many Treaſons.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Harveſt was now ripe, &amp; time
convenient to cut up thoſe peſtiferous Cockles
and Thiſtles, by the aſſent of the King, &amp; conſent
of the ſaid Commiſſioners and Appellants, they
expulſed divers of the Officers of the Houſhold;
<hi>viz.</hi> in the place of <hi>John Beauchamp,</hi> Steward of the
Houſhold, they appointed <hi>John Devourex,</hi> Knight,
one of the Commiſsioners; <hi>Peter Couriney,</hi> Knight,
was made Chamberlaine, in the ſtead of <hi>Robert</hi>
Duke of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And the aforeſaid <hi>John de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ,
Simon de Burleigh,</hi> Vice-Chamberlaine,
<hi>John Salisbury, Thomas Trynett, James Barats,
William Ellingham,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Nagworth,</hi>
Knights; and Officers of the Clergie, <hi>(viz.) Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Metford</hi> Secretary, <hi>John Blake</hi> Deane of the
Chappell, <hi>John Lincolne</hi> Chancelour of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
and <hi>John Clifford</hi> Clerke of the Chappell
were kept under arreſt too, and were as partakers
in the aforeſaid Treaſon; for that they knowing
and having intelligence of the ſaid Conſpiracie,
they did not diſcover them.</p>
            <p>Others alſo as Servants of the aforeſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,
and drawn in by craft, yet guiltleſs, were
diſmiſſed and ſent away as men unprofitable, and
good for no uſe.</p>
            <p>And thus this hideous brood of Monſters, ſo
often ſhaken, was quite overthrown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93627:12"/>
And on the Vigil of the Purification of Saint
<hi>Mary,</hi> in the Privie Chamber at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by
joynt conſent of all the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid

                  </gap> John Holt, Roger Fulthorp, William
Burleigh, John Locton,</hi> and <hi>John Carey</hi> were diſplaced
from their Offices, and without any further adoe
arreſted of Treaſon, and by the command of the
Chancelor were clapt into the Tower; and <hi>Roger
Carleton</hi> in the place of <hi>Belknap, Walter Clapton</hi> in
the place of <hi>Treſsilian,</hi> were conſtituted: and ſo for
that time they departed, and went to dinner.</p>
            <p>And becauſe Shrovetide was thought a fit time
to puniſh the Delinquents, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts;
therefore the great Parliament began the
ſecond of February following, in this manner.</p>
            <p>All the Peeres, as well of the Spiritualty as of
the Temporalty, being aſſembled in the great Hall
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the King ſoone after came and ſate
down in his Throne; and after him appeared the
five Noblemen Appellants, (the fame of whoſe
admired worth ecchoed through all the Land) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Houſe in their coſtly Robes, leading one
another hand in hand, with an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
following them; and beholding where the
King ſate, all at once, with ſubmiſsive geſtures,
they reverenced the King. The Hall was ſo full of
Spectators, that the very Roofes were filled with
them: and yet amongſt this infinite multitude of
the people, there could not be found any of the
Conſpirators, or of their Complices; but <hi>Brambre</hi>
was taken a little before, and caſt into the Gaole
of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93627:13"/>
The Clergie then placing themſelves on the
right hand, and the Nobility on the left hand of
the King, according to the ancient Cuſtome of the
High Court of Parliament; the Lord Chancelor
ſtanding with his back towards the King, by the
Kings command declared the cauſe of their Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to the Parliament: Which being ended, the
five foreſaid Appellants ariſing, declared their
Appellation by the mouth of <hi>Robert Pleaſington</hi>
their Speaker, who thus ſpake:</p>
            <p>Behold, the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> comes to purge
himſelfe of Treaſons which are laid to his charge
by the Conſpirators. To whom the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor,
by the command of the King anſwered:
My Lord Duke, the King conceiveth ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
of you, that hee cannot be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that you, who are of affinity to him in a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall
Line, ſhould attempt any Treaſon againſt
his ſacred Majeſtie. The Duke, with his foure
Companions, upon their knees humbly gave
thanks to the King, for his gracious opinion of
their fidelity.</p>
            <p>Then after ſilence proclaymed, they aroſe, and
delivered in certaine Articles in Writing, wherein
were contained the particularity of the Treaſon.
Which ſaid Articles were read by <hi>Godfrey Martin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
the Clerk of the Crowne, ſtanding in the midſt
of the Parliament Houſe, by the ſpace of two
houres, with an audible voice. At the reading of
which, there was a wonderfull alteration in the
Houſe: For, whereas before the people were glad
of the diſcovery of the Treaſon; at the rehearſall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93627:13"/>
of it, their hearts were ſo overcome with griefe,
that they could not refrain from teares. When
the Articles were read, the Appellants requeſted
the King, that ſentence of condemnation might
be given againſt the Conſpirators, and they to
receive the guerdon of their deſerts; which the
king promiſed to grant. This was the firſt dayes
worke. The ſecond was ended with variation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
conſultations which I will not relate in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
but treat of the whole Parliament in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
            <p>And when the third day came of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
againſt the conſpirators, the Lord Chancelor
in the name of the Clergie, in open Parliament
made an Oration, ſhewing that they could not by
any meanes by preſent at the proceeding, whereas
there is any cenſure of death to be paſſed. For the
confirmation whereof, they delivered in a Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which being read, they ſpake, That neither in
reſpect of any favour, nor for feare of any mans
hate, nor in hope of any reward, they did deſire to
abſent themſelves, but onely, that they were bound
by the Canon, not to be preſent at any mans Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment
or condemnation. They likewiſe ſent
their Proteſtation to the Chappell of the Abbey,
where the Commons ſate; which was allowed of.
And then, when the Appellants called for Juſtice
againſt the conſpirators, the Lords of the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
aroſe, and went into the Kings chamber neere
adjoyning.</p>
            <p>But the King being moved in conſcience, and
in charitie, perceiving that in every worke they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93627:14"/>
are to remember the end; and being willing (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the rigour of the Law) to favour rather
theſe that were guilty then the Actours in that
Treaſon; if they were able to alledge any thing in
their defence, cauſed the Proceſſe to ceaſe: but
the Peeres (being earneſt) requeſted, That no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
paſt, preſent, or to come, might be debated,
untill this Treaſon were adjudged; to which Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the king graciouſly granted his aſſent.</p>
            <p>On the 11 day of <hi>February,</hi> when nothing could
be alledged, nor no witneſſe produced, in juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the conſpiratours, but that the definitive
Sentence of condemnation muſt be pronounced
againſt them; the aforeſaid <hi>John Devoreux,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall
of the Court, and for that time the Kings
Lievtenant, adjudged them this heavy Doome;
That the ſaid Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
Earle of <hi>Suffolke, Treſsilian,</hi> and <hi>Brambre,</hi>
ſhould be drawn from the Tower to Tyburne, and
there to be hanged upon a Gibbet untill they were
dead, and all their Lands and Goods to be confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
that none of their poſterity might be by
them any way enriched.</p>
            <p>On the 12 day of <hi>February,</hi> which was the firſt
day of <hi>Shrovetide, Nicholas Brambre</hi> appeared in
Parliament; and being charged with the aforeſaid
Articles of Treaſon, hee craved favour to adviſe of
Counſell learned, and ſome longer time for his
more full anſwer to his Accuſation; but yet hee
deſired a thing neither uſuall, nor allowable by the
Law, and required a thing which the rigour of
the Law, in caſe of that nature, would not afford.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93627:14"/>
But the Judges charged him to anſwer ſeverally
to every point in the Articles contained: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<hi>Brambre</hi> anſwered, Whoſoever hath branded
me with this ignominious mark, with him I am
ready to fight in the Liſts, to maintaine my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
whenſoever the King ſhall appoint. And
this he ſpake with ſuch a fury, that his eyes ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled
with rage, and he breathed as if an <hi>Aetna</hi> had
lay hid in his breſt; chuſing rather to die glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
in the field, then diſgracefully on a Gibbet.</p>
            <p>The Appellants hearing this couragious Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
with reſolute countenance anſwered, That
they would willingly accept of the Combat, and
thereupon flung downe their Gages before the
King; and on a ſuddaine the whole company of
Lords, Knights, Eſquires, and Commons flung
down their Gages ſo thick, that they ſeemed like
Snow in a Winters day, crying out, Wee alſo will
accept of the Combat, and will prove theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
to be true to thy head, moſt damnable Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and ſo they departed for that day.</p>
            <p>And although the Appellants were not idle in
the night, yet on the next day, to aggravate their
Appellation againſt the Conſpirators, there came
divers Companies of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of the manifold injuries they had ſuffered
by <hi>Brembre,</hi> and other Extortioners and Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wherewith they had been dayly charged; and
yet they proteſted, that they did not accuſe him
either for hate to his perſon, or for love, feare, or
hope of reward from his enemies, but onely they
charged him with the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:93627:15"/>
But before they proceed with his tryall, they
were ſtayed by moſt unfortunate <hi>Treſsilian,</hi> who
being got upon the top of an houſe adjoyning to
the Palace, and had deſcended into a gutter one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to looke about him, he was diſcovered by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the Peeres, who preſently ſent ſome of
the Guard to apprehend him, who entring into
the houſe where hee was, and having ſpent long
time in vaine in looking for him, at length one
of the Guard ſtept to the Maſter of the houſe, and
taking him by the ſhoulder with his Dagger
drawne, thus ſaid, Shew us where thou haſt hid
<hi>Treſsilian,</hi> or elſe reſolve thy dayes are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed;
the Maſter trembled, ready to yeeld up
the ghoſt, for feare anſwered, Yonder is the place
where he lyes, and ſhewes him a round Table co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with branches of Bay, under which <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilian</hi>
lay cloſe covered; when they had found
him they drew him out by the heeles, wondring
to ſee him, as vipers uſe, to weare his head and
beard o'r-growne, with old clowted ſhooes, and
patched hoſe, more like a miſerable poore begger,
then a Judge.</p>
            <p>When this came to the eares of the Peeres, the
five Appellants ſuddenly aroſe up, and without
expreſsing any reaſon, departed out of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Houſe, which bred great alteration in the
Houſe, inſomuch that many followed them, and
when they come to the Gate of the Hall, they
met the Guard leading of <hi>Treſsilian</hi> bound, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as they came, We have him, we have him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Treſsilian</hi> being come into the Hall, was asked
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93627:15"/>
what he could ſay for himſelfe, why judgement
ſhould not paſſe upon him for his treaſon ſo often
committed, hee became as one that had beene
ſtruck dumb, and his heart was as it were hardned
to the very laſt, and would not confeſſe himſelfe
guilty of any thing: And for this cauſe the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
aroſe, deferring <hi>Brembres</hi> triall till the next
day. But <hi>Treſsilian</hi> was without delay led to the
Tower, that he might ſuffer the execution of the
ſentence paſſed againſt him, his wife and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
did with maine teares accompany him to
the Tower, but his wife was ſo overcome with
dolour and griefe, that ſhe fell down in a ſwound
as if ſhe had beene dead.</p>
            <p>Immediatly <hi>Treſsilian</hi> is upon a hurdle, and
drawne thorow the ſtreets of the Citie, with a
wonderfull concourſe of people following him,
at every furlongs end he was ſuffered to ſtand ſtill
to reſt himſelfe, and to ſee if hee would confeſſe
and report himſelfe of any thing, but what he ſaid
to the Fryer his Confeſſor is not knowne, neither
am I able to ſearch it out; when hee came to the
place of execution hee would not climb the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
untill ſuch time as being ſoundly beaten with
bats and ſtaves he was forced to goe up, and when
he was up, hee ſaid, So long as I doe weare any
thing upon me I ſhall not dye, wherefore the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
ſtripped him, and found certaine Images
painted like to the ſignes of Heaven, and the head
of a devill painted, and the names of many of the
devills wrote in Parchment; the exorciſing toyes
being taken away, hee was hanged up naked,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93627:16"/>
and becauſe the ſpectators ſhould be certainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
that he was dead, they cut his throat, and
becauſe the night approached, they let him hang
untill the next morning, and then his wife having
obtained a licence of the King, tooke downe his
body, and carried it to the Grey-Fryers, where
it was buried. On the morrow ſentence was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
pronounced againſt <hi>Brembre,</hi> who being
drawne upon a hurdle from the Tower to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
thorow the City, ſhewed himſelfe very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
humbly craving mercy and forgiveneſſe at
the hands of God and men, whom he had ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
offended, and whom he had ſo injuriouſly
wronged in time paſt, and did earneſtly deſire
them all to pray for him; when the rope was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his neck ready to be turned off, a certaine
young man, the ſonne of one <hi>Northampton,</hi> asked
him if hee had done juſtice to his Father or not,
for <hi>Northampton</hi> was ſometimes Maior of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>London,</hi> more wealthy and more ſubſtantiall
then any elſe in the Citie, him did <hi>Brembre</hi> and
<hi>Treſilian</hi> accuſe of Treaſon &amp; Conſpiracie againſt
the State, and condemned him to dye, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoyled
of his eſtate, he himſelfe at length hardly
eſcaped, to whom <hi>Brembre</hi> anſwered and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with bitter teares, that what hee did was moſt
vile and wicked, and with an intent only to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and overthrow the ſaid <hi>Northampton,</hi> for
which craving pardon of the young man being
ſuddenly turned off, and the Executioner cutting
his throat, hee dyed. Behold how pleaſant and
delightfull it is to climbe up to honour, I ſuppoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93627:16"/>
it is better to live meanely at home with quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
amongſt poore men, then to lord it amongſt
Princes, and in the end to climb a ladder amongſt
Thieves, it is even better to undergoe the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
then to aſſume the name of honour; therefore
whoſoever that doth not regard the Lawes, let
them obſerve and conſider the end of theſe men,
and with what period they finiſhed their days.</p>
            <p>Theſe men being diſpatched, the Parliament
diſcontinued their proceedings againſt the reſt of
the Conſpirators till a more convenient time; and
tooke into their conſiderations other more
weighty affaires of the weale publike, they made
the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> Lord Admirall, giving him
authority to reſiſt and to repulſe either by Sea or
Land the enemies of the Crowne whereſoever he
ſhould find them.</p>
            <p>And it was further agreed on, that for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing
of all private diſcontents (if any were) the
King, and the reſt of the Appellants with the reſt
of the commiſsioners ſhould dine together in the
great Hall, which they did, and there was great
joy at this reconciliation through all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>When theſe things were concluded, they then
began againe this araignment of the Traytors,
whereupon <hi>John Blake</hi> and <hi>Thomas Vske</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
on the 4. day of March, who although
they were men of inferiour quality yet were
they found to bee parties in the ſaid Treaſon;
<hi>Vſke</hi> was a Sergeant at Armes, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
amongſt the Conſpirators, ſo that b<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

late made Sheriffe of <hi>Middleſex</hi> hee had indicted
the five Appellants and the Commiſſioners as
Traytors, and <hi>Blake</hi> was an Intelligencer of <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians,</hi>
one that uſed to goe and come betweeue
the Conſpirators, aud relate the ſtate and ſucceſſe
of the treaſon from one to another.</p>
            <p>And when they could ſay nothing to prove
themſelves cleare, ſentence was pronounced upon
them as their Maſters were before them, they
were carried to the Tower, and from thence were
dragged at the Horſe taile to Tyborne, and there
hanged.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Vſke</hi> obtained this favour, that his head
was cut off after hee was hanged and ſet aloft up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Newgate for Fowles of the aire to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.</p>
            <p>On the ſixth day of March there were called
to anſwer, <hi>Robert Belknap, John Holt, Roger Falthorp,
William Burleigh, Iohn Locton,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Carey</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
of the Exchequer, for their conſpiracy againſt
the Commiſſioners at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> but becauſe it
is not needfull to rehearſe every part of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
they were all condemned like as the
reſt.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Peeres were trying them, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
were retired into the Kings Chambers, but
when word was brought to them of the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Judges, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> the Chancellor, the
Treaſurer, Lord Keeper of the Privie Seale aroſe
haſtily and went into the Parliament houſe, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
forth their complaints before the King and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93627:17"/>
the Peeres humbly upon their knees beſeeching
them that for the love of God, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
and of all the Saints, even as they hoped to have
mercy at the day of Judgement, they ſhould ſhew
favour and not put to death the ſaid Judges then
preſent, and bitterly bewayling their iniquities in
whoſe hearts the very life, ſoule, and ſpirit of our
Engliſh Lawes lived, flouriſhed, and appeared,
and there appeared great ſorrow both on the one
part of the Complainants, and alſo of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> likewiſe with the
Earles of <hi>Arundel, Warwick, Nottingham,</hi> and <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
whoſe hearts began to be mollified, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them in their lamentable Petition.</p>
            <p>At length by interceſſion of the Clergy, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
upon the perſons was ceaſed, and their
lives were granted them, but were ſent to the
Tower to be kept cloſe priſoners.</p>
            <p>On the 12. of March, being thurſday, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that the afore-ſaid Knights, <hi>Simon de Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,
Iohn de Beauchamp, Iames Baroverſe,</hi> and <hi>Iohn
Salisbury</hi> were brought into the Parliament houſe
where their accuſations were read, proved, they
found guilty, and not any way able to cleare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves.</p>
            <p>From this day almoſt till the Aſcenſion of our
Lord, the Parliament houſe was only taken up
with the tryall of Sir <hi>Symon Burleugh,</hi> for three
Appellants, <hi>viz.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> the Earles
of <hi>Arundell</hi> and <hi>Warwicke,</hi> with the whole houſe
of Commons, vrged that execution might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93627:18"/>
according to the Law: And on the other
ſide, the King, and Queene, the Earles of <hi>Darby,</hi>
and <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and the Prior of Saint <hi>John</hi> his
Vncle, with the major part of the uper Houſe, did
labour to have him ſaved.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Commons were tyred with ſo
long delayes, and excuſes in the Parliament; and
fearing, as it was moſt like, that all their paines
would be to little or no purpoſe, they humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
leave of the King, to goe to their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>There was alſo ſome muttering amongſt the
Common people, and it was reported to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that the Commons did riſe in diverſe parts
of the Realme, but eſpecially about <hi>Kent,</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the ſaid Sir <hi>Simon Burleigh,</hi> which when
they heard thoſe, that before ſpake and ſtood for
him, now flew cleane from him, and by joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
on the fifth day of <hi>May,</hi> ſentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
only againſt the ſaid Sir <hi>Symon,</hi> that hee
ſhould be drawne from the Tower to Tyborne; and
then to be hanged till hee were dead, and then to
have his head ſtrooke from his body. But becauſe
he was a knight of the Garter, a gallant Courtier,
powerfull, and once a Favourite of the Kings, and
much reſpected of all the Court, the King of his
ſpeciall Grace, was pleaſed to mittigate his doome,
that he ſhould only be led to Tower-hill, and ther
be beheaded.</p>
            <p>On the twelfe of <hi>May,</hi> the Thurſday before
Whitſontyde, in like manner were condemned,
<hi>John Beauchamp</hi> Steward of the houſhold to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93627:18"/>
King, <hi>Iames Bereverous,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Salsbury</hi> knights,
Gentlemen of the privie Chamber, whereof the
two firſt, <hi>viz. Iohn Beauchamp,</hi> and <hi>Iames Bereverous</hi>
were beheaded on Tower-hill, but <hi>Iohn Salsbury</hi>
was drawn from Tower-hill to Tyborne, and there
was hanged.</p>
            <p>On the ſame day alſo, was condemned the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> the Kings Confeſſor, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of his great dignitie, he was pardoned. Now
they began to loath the ſhedding of ſo much Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
blood, they tooke into conſideration, other
more weighty affaires for the good of the Realme
concerning the Wars with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French,</hi>
concerning Loanes and Subſidues, and of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of Wine and Wooll.</p>
            <p>And alſo concerning the tranſlation of ſome Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
becauſe Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the ſixth, after it came
to his eares, that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
to avoyd all hope of Irregularity, he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him Archbiſhop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> in <hi>Scotland:</hi>
which Archbiſhop was under the power of <hi>Scots,</hi>
enemies to the Crown; and in the gift of the Arch-Pope:
and becauſe the Pope did chalenge halfe the
title of all <hi>England</hi> to maintaine his Wars, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he craved it, yet he was denyed: therefore
hee dealt warily and craftily; hoping to make up
his mouth, by the tranſlation of Biſhops: the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Ely,</hi> then Lord Chancellor, was made
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Dublyn</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in his place; the Biſhop of <hi>Bathan-Wells</hi> in
his place: the Biſhop of <hi>Sarum</hi> in his place, and
the Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Waltham,</hi> Lord-keeper of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93627:19"/>
Seale in his place: And this by his tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Biſhops, he gained himſelfe much money,
according to the Lawes of the Canon; and when
this came to the eares of the Parliament, that ſuch
a ſumme of money ſhould be tranſported out of
the Land, they ſtrove what they could to hinder
it, but could not, becauſe the Clergie gave their
conſent.</p>
            <p>On the laſt day of May, the King appointed
both houſes to meet at <hi>Keemington,</hi> whereas they

            <p>Moreover, the ſix Iuſtices, with the Biſhop of

to be out of Towne above the ſpace of two miles

            <p>Behold theſe men who feared not God, nor
regarded men, but having the Lawes in their owne
hands, wreſted them now this way, now that way,
as pleaſed beſt their appetites, wreſting them at
their pleaſures for their owne commoditie, were
at the laſt brought downe to the depth of miſerie
from whence they were never able to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>On the third day of Iune, which was the laſt
day of the Parliament, the King, the Queene, the
Peeres of both Eſtates with the Commons, came
to the Abbey at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whereas the Biſhop
of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe it was in his Dioceſſe ſung
Maſſe, and the Maſſe being ended, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> made an Oration concerning
the former danger of the Oath, which being,
although the Peeres and Commons had taken the
Oath of Allegeance, and homage to the King,
yet becauſe the King was young when they tooke
the Oath a new (as at the firſt) at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ceremonies being performed, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan

preſent, having lighted a Candle, and putting it
under a ſtoole, put it out, thereby excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all ſuch as ſhould ſeeme to diſtaſte, diſlike, or
contradict any of the fore-paſſed Acts in the laſt
Parliament; And the Lord Chancellor, by the
Kings appointment, cauſed all that were preſent
to ſweare to keepe the ſaid Statutes inviolably
whole, and undiſſolved, as good and faithfull
Liege-people of the Kings, and the forme of the
Parliament was obſerved throughout all the
Realme.</p>
            <p>On the morrow, which was the fourth day of
June, many courteous ſalutations and congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
having paſſed betweene the King, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and Comminalty, the Parliament was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and every man returned home.</p>
            <p>And now let <hi>England</hi> rejoyce in Chriſt, for
that the net which was laid ſo cunningly for our

            <p>BY Parliament Sir <hi>Thomas Wayland</hi> chiefe

of five perſons received five ſeverall bribes, which in
