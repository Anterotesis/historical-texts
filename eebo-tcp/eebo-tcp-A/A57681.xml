            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

yet I thought it not adviseable for me to

without providing him a friend
before-hand; especially seeing he is to

therefore, worthy Sir, amidst the

Fancies he was prepossest with, but the
Clock-Maker, whom he supposes behind
the Curtain to hear all they say, steps out,
and by opening the Clock, shews how wide

               </gap> all of the Truth, by letting them
see the Spring, and the contrivance of
the Wheels, on which the Motion of his
Engine depends, and that it was he who
made it. In the same Manner, Nature
her self, by the Pen of this Observing
<hi>Italian,</hi> seems modestly to give a check to
the presumption of her pretended Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
who will pass a Iudgment on her
most hidden Works, where they never
could pretend to make the least observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
on which to found their Iudgment.
The respect the Author shews to Scripture
Authority, is the rather remarkable in
<pb facs="tcp:99636:4"/>
him, that he is a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi>
who by us are charged with the contrary
Vice, which makes the fault of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
a professed <hi>Protestant,</hi> more black,
that is so bold in contradicting it, and
making it speak untruth to accommodate
it self to the capacity of the Vulgar,
which tho' some P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous Divines have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in passages of Scripture, where the
Phaenomena of Nature are spoken of by the
by, (which yet I prove to be a mistake in
the Confutation of the Theory) yet to
make the whole first chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi>
wherein the Spirit of God does <hi>è com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posito,</hi>
give an account of the Creation
false, is a piece of Presumption few have
been guilty of besides our Theorist.</p>
            <p>As for the Confutation of the Theory,
tho' the performance may be short of what
the Subject requir'd, yet I hope the design
will please you, which is to vindicate the
truth of the Scriptures, for which I know
you have a great veneration, from the
false glosses and perversions of some that
seem to have studied Divinity, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but to ridicule it, which they do
the more remarkably, that almost in the
same breath they pretend a great respect
<pb facs="tcp:99636:4"/>
to it, in which I endeavour to prove, that
the passages the Theorist cavils at, are to
be understood to speak according to the
Truth of the thing, and not according to
the false Opinion of the Ignorant vulgar.
If in this my small endeavour, I may find
your Patrocin, I shall not care for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of these men of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> whose
made it is to make Shrines to this their
<hi>Diana</hi> of Hypothetical Philosophy, I mean
who in their Closets make Systems of the
World, prescribe Laws to Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever consulting her by Observation
and Experience, who (to use the Noble
Lord <hi>Verulams</hi> words) like the Spider,
with great labour, spin a curious Cob-web
out of their Brains, that is good fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to be swept down, which tho' it
has a great shew of reason, in effect, has
no better right to that venerable Title,
than the Fancies of those who are said
to make Wind-mills in their Head. I
have given the whole Book the Title of
<hi>The Abyssinian Philosophy confuted,</hi>
because as the Preface is a confutation of
the Theory, so if you read <hi>Rammazzini</hi>
from <hi>page</hi> 88, at the end, to <hi>page</hi> 102.
you will find that the Theory is much the

same with the <hi>Abyssinian Philosophy,</hi> if
not taken from it, which being evident to
be a mere fiction, is ground enough for
the Title, and Confuta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

this I think every one according to his
ability ought to oppose it. Yet what
satisfactory account can we expect
from such, of the Old World, and its
great Change, so remote from us, that
can give us so little account of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
World, and the things in it,
which yet would be by far more useful
to us.</p>
            <p>The Theorist has indeed set out this
Fiction of his, with all the advantages
of a smooth stile, which I believe hath
procur'd it so good a reception with
the generality, who are more taken
with fine Words, than plain, tho' so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
<pb facs="tcp:99636:8"/>
Reasons; but if we may judge of
the Buyers Inclination by the tendency
of the Book, I am yet willing to have
the Charity for the Theorist, that
'twas not the design of the Author;
they are the same Persons, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
they will not believe many things
in Scripture, because they cannot see a
Reason for them, and yet they do
greedily entertain this Theory, and
the Fictions of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
little from the <hi>Abyssinian</hi> Fiction or
Hypothesis, as will appear to any that
compares both, with what is in this
Book translated from the <hi>Italian,</hi> only
they have new vamp'd it, and set it out
in another Dress to make it pass for
their own. But after I had taken a
nearer view of the Author's Opinion,
and what he advances in favour of it,
I found it so full of contradictions to
Scripture and Reason, yet join'd with
a very high conceit of his own Fancies,
(a fault I find very common among the
<hi>Abyssinian</hi> Philosophers) that I had
once thought of not meddling with it,
as an endless labour, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
also, I have not meddled with
a Book Printed at <hi>Oxford, Anno
<pb facs="tcp:99636:9"/>
De Antris Laethiferis,</hi> especially seeing
the Learned and Pious Mr. <hi>Warren</hi> has
already done it so fully, that he has left
little to be added to it; but consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the bigness of his Book might
obstruct the attaining of the end for
which he design'd it, <hi>viz.</hi> to undeceive
the generality of Readers, who being
the least considering, perhaps have not
allowed themselves Time to read so large
a Treatise, or at least so attentively as
it deserves; upon this consideration,
(I say) I resum'd my former thoughts,
with design to be as brief as possible,
yet without omitting any thing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
in the Theory that deserv'd an
Answer. The Author begins <hi>Tell.
Theor. ch.</hi> IV. <hi>The Form of the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian
Earth, was different from the
present Form of it, which that he
might not seem to dictate with an
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he promises to prove first from
Scripture, secondly by Reasons, both a</hi>
Priori &amp; Posteriori.</p>
            <p>Now that we may see if the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
answer to so great undertakings,
we shall first examine his main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from Scripture, and especially
that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 11. ch. 3. 5, 6. ver. <hi>For
<pb facs="tcp:99636:9"/>
this they willingly are ignorant of, that
by the Word of God the Heavens were of
Old, and the Earth standing out of the
Water and in the Water.</hi> v. 6. <hi>Whereby
the World that then was, being over flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Water, perished. Vpon this
Rock</hi> (says the Theorist, prophanely
alluding to our Saviours words to St.
Peter) do we chiefly build the Theory as
to Scripture Authority; and we always
thought this an unmoveable foundation,
Which yet we shall find upon a due
search, to be unstable as Water, and
therefore cannot hold.</p>
            <p>The words of the Text the Theory
explains thus, The Apostle manifestly
distinguishes between the Old World
and the New, and especially because of
the different natural states, or their
different shapes and qualities of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Secondly, He intimates that the

thereby intend to instruct us in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philosophy, but to infuse into our
Minds Holy Affections, and a Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the God of</hi> Israel, <hi>whom they
Preach.</hi> May we not thence infer,
that to have prosecuted this noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
would have been fitter for a Divine,
than thus to abuse the Scriptures to
another end, than that for which they
were Written, when he founds a point
of Philosophy upon this Text; and
farther, that seeing what he founds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, was contrary to the common
opinion of the times that the Apostle
wrote in, the Theorist has mist the
meaning of the Text. For whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Writers of the Apostles time,
or before, can he produce that was of
the opinion, that the <hi>Earth did encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
the Waters, as an Egg-shell does the
White and Yolk;</hi> surely, seeing he
seems so conversant in Antiquities, he
might have thought it his interest to
find at least one passage among them,
to favour this Paradox of this, that it
might not be reproach'd with being the
Opinion of one Dr. only.</p>
            <p>And further we may infer, that as
the Pen-Men of the Scripture, did not
<pb facs="tcp:99636:10"/>
write to teach us Philosophy, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does the Apostle here reprove
Men for Ignorance in a point of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
(especially Abyssinian) but for
Atheistical Principles, as first in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God's Providence, <hi>v. 3. There shall
come in the last day Scoffers, walking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their own lusts, and saying where is
the promise of his coming, for since the
Fathers fell asleep, all things continue
as they were from the beginning of the
Creation.</hi> Where the Apostle reproves
Scoffers, who imagin'd that things went
on by chance, and continued so in this
first state from the Creation, without
God's Direction, which he carries yet
higher, that they disown the Power of
God in the Creation, <hi>For this they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
are ignorant of, that by the Word
of God,</hi> &amp;c. and as the charging of Men
with wilful ignorance in a point of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
that there was no possibility of
knowing, before this new found Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
would have been very unjust,
so it would have been a <hi>Coque à lasne,</hi> to
have thus past from his subject and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of reproving Atheists, to reprove ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
in a point of natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and that without giving any notice
<pb facs="tcp:99636:11"/>
of it before hand, and such a reproof
would have been no more suitableto the
scope of the Apostle, than to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
them for ignorance of such a
place as <hi>America,</hi> which was discovered
but of late.</p>
            <p>But farther, this Text which the
<hi>Abyssinian</hi> makes his unmoveable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
if the scope be seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
gives a strong foundation of
an Argument against him. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
(as we have already proved) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
those who are willingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Power of God, and who
either denied it altogether, as the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi>
did, who were a famous Sect
at that time, and who disputed with
St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> Acts 17. 18. Or
else such as pretended to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the first Formation of all
things, without taking notice of the
Power of God in it, which was or
among the Greek Philosophers in those
times; now this is the fault the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
guilty of in the account
Creation, all the Six days Works are
in Scripture said to be performed by
the Word or Power of God, but in
the Theory all is said to be carried on
by the Laws of Gravitation, without
<pb facs="tcp:99636:11"/>
any mention made of the Power of
God, which is the very thing that is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere condemned by the Apostle, and

from the Theories own words, <hi>Tell.
The.</hi> ch. 6. <hi>I have followed the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Laws of Gravitation and Levity,
and by their guidance alone, we have seen
the Promogenial Mass after one or two
alterations, and an unconstant shape, to
have come into that stable form of the
Earth built upon the Waters, that was
to continue for some Ages.</hi> Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Theorist has willingly left out
any mention of the Power of God in
his whole Theory, contrary to the
Tenour of the Scriptures, which
ascribes all the Works both of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Providence, to the Wisdom
and Power of God, he may be said to
be willingly ignorant of both, and to
have written rather like a Disciple of
<hi>Orpheus,</hi> than a Disciple of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet his Laws of Gravitation, if
rightly considered, will not answer the
Phaenomena of the Creation, for the

might be then compar'd to the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of a Clock, before an Ingenious
Artisicer, which could never point out
the Hours and Strike, imitate the
motions of the Sun and Moon, as some
are made to do, till the Artificer had
first made the several Wheels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
due proportion, and fitted them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and last of all put a Spring or
Motion to them, which I judge to have
been compleated about that time, when
he said all was very good, which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has been continued ever since, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
when he hath been pleased by his
Finger, to put a stop to some of the
Wheels, as he did when the Sun and
Moon stood still, or to make them run
backward, as he did when the Shadow
went back on the Dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> or to
accelerate their Motions more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
among which may be reckon'd
this of the Deluge, of which, and the
Creation, 'tis as easie for the Theorist
to give an account, as if he had been
one God Almighty's Counsel at that
time. One might think that the sense
of our natural blindness, even in things
that most concern our selves, and that
we have daily in our hands, might give
<pb facs="tcp:99636:13"/>
a check to this presumption, <hi>but vain

               </gap>he Author hopes never to be beat, he

               </gap>nd as he is pleas'd to explain them,

               </gap>eem to favour his Cause very much,
yet after examination, will be found
to make no more for him than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
One is taken from <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 2.
<hi>For he hath founded it upon the Sea, and
establisht it upon the Floods,</hi> or upon
the Rivers. What could one think
of, more favourable for the Theory
than this? But if we compare this with
other places of Scripture, it will not
be found to make for his purpose; for
example, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. ver. 3. <hi>And he shall
be like a Tree planted upon the Rivers;</hi>
no body I believe, will make a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ophical
Argument of this, to prove
that Trees in <hi>David</hi>'s time were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon the surface of Rivers, but
contenting himself with the scope of
the Psalmist, which is to hold forth
by this Simile, the flourishing condition
of the Righteous, will never once call
it in question, if Trees did grow on
<pb facs="tcp:99636:14"/>
the surface of Rivers, and take it for
granted, that by <hi>upon,</hi> the Psalmist
meant upon the Banks of Rivers, in
which sense we say, Lands lye upon
such Seas as they are adjacent to, and
Houses or Cities, seated upon the Banks
of Rivers, to stand upon the Rivers:
For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the original, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
this, and in this sense may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
<hi>Prov. 6. 27. When he set a
compass upon the Face of the deep,</hi> of
which the Theorist says, <hi>If I rightly
understand the matter, this is the place
of the Earth firmly encompassing the
Abyss, and what else can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by this Girth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with which
God is said to have encompass'd the
Abyss, what is there in the present
form of the Earth that can answer it,
or to the Bounds or Globe which he
hath put about the Sea.</hi> Yes the
Theorist might have found another
meaning in, <hi>Iob 38. Who hath shut
up the Sea with doors,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 11. <hi>And
set Bars and Doors, and said, hitherto
shalt thou come, and no farther, and here
shall the pride of thy Waves be stay'd;</hi>
these Bars or Bounds are by all judged
to be the Sea shore, by which God
<pb facs="tcp:99636:14"/>
hath limited the Sea, that it shall no
more return to overflow the Earth as it
did before, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 104, 9. <hi>Thou
hast set bounds that they pass not over,
that they turn not again to cover the
Earth.</hi> And in the common way of
speaking among our Hydrographers,
this Bounds is called a Girth, so they
call the Coast round about <hi>England,</hi> the
Girth of <hi>England.</hi> Since the Theorist
contrary to his own position, will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Scripture to prove his Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Paradoxes, by the same liberty we
from <hi>ver.</hi> 5. of this Psalm, <hi>Who hath
laid the Foundation of the Earth, that
it should not be removed for ever.</hi> Infer
that the Theorists Foundation is none
of God's making, since it is suppos'd
by him to have been removed, by falling
under the Abyss, whereas before it was
above it. And may not we infer from
God's challenge to <hi>Iob,</hi> ch. 38. ver. 4.
<hi>Where wast thou when I laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Earth? Declare if thou hast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
v. 6. <hi>Whereupon are the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
thereof fastened?</hi> (the very thing
the Theorist pretends to tell) and to
which <hi>Iob</hi> (whom without disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Theorist, we may imagine
<pb facs="tcp:99636:15"/>
both a better Man and a Philosopher
than he) answers, <hi>chap. 42. ver. 3.
Therefore have I utter'd that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not, things too wonderful for me,
which I knew not;</hi> may not we (I say)
infer, that the Theorist is very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
in thus taking up the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against God Almighty? And
may not we without breach of respect
say, <hi>Theorice quid animum minorem aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
consilijs Fatigas?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Philosophy the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> bids us beware of, <hi>Col. 2. 8. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
lest any man spoil you through Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
and vain deceits,</hi> which will be
very clear if we consider, that the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical
was at that time the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
in vogue among the Grecians,
to whom being puft up with a conceit of
their own Knowledge, the Gospel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
Foolishness; surely, the Apostle
does not hereby condemn him that
studies to know the nature of things,
with their causes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <q>Vt varios usus meditando extunderet
artes.</q>
Which is Natural Philosophy; for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99636:15"/>
the wisest of Kings, is in the
Scripture commended for this, or him
that studies the nature of, and way to
manage his own Spirit, and its
Thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is Metaphysicks
and Moral Philosophy, both in their
places very subservient to Religion;
but he condemns the Abyssinian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
or the imposing of Poetical
Fictions instead of solid Truth, on the
understandings of People.</p>
            <p>Now that we have view'd the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist's
strongest holds, and I hope beat
him out of them, I think it will not be
worth while to seek him out any where
else, as to his pretences to Sacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
we come next to view his
Philosophical holds, I hope though it
be War time, we may view them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger from Canons or Grenades,
or at the worst they will be but Paper
ones, and will do no great hurt; and
this comes in course, for after the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
has made the best he can of this
place in St, <hi>Peter</hi> he distrusts the
strength of his own Argument, for in
the beginning he confesses,<note place="margin">Tell. Th. l. 1. c. 5.</note>
that the meaning of these
words seems not to be so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<pb facs="tcp:99636:16"/>
and open, that the form of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>luvian
Earth may be thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
&amp; therefore he has recourse to
his Abyssinian Philosophy a very good
second, as we shall find: <hi>Dignum patellâ
operculum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He supposes the Chaos
to have been made up of
Particles,<note place="margin">Tell. Th. c. 5. p. 35, 36, 37.</note> different as to
shape, bulk, weight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and that the grossest solid Particles by
their weight falling downward, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
toward the Center, formed the
Kernel of his Primogenial Earth, and
that immediately there followed a new
division of the remaining part into
two, and no more, <hi>viz.</hi> Fluid and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile,
or Air and Water, of which
the thinnest and lightest part keeping
uppermost, made the Air, and the grosser
the Water, out of which were separated
the Oily parts, which being lighter float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above it; and last of all he supposes
another purgation of the Air, from
its Earthy Particles, which falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Oily Particles, were by their
viscidity entangled, and thus hindred
from descending into the Abyss, and
these Earthy Particles he supposes by
the heat of the Sun, to have been burnt
<pb facs="tcp:99636:16"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nto a hard crust, which made the Shell
of the Primogenial Earth.</p>
            <p>This is the substance of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
from which as a Corollary,
tho' not heeded by the Theorist, we
may infer, a new sett of Principles,
<hi>viz.</hi> Oil and Earth, unknown to the
Learned World before this Abyssinian
Philosophy. Now may <hi>Paracelsus</hi> keep
to himself his three Principles Salt,
Sulphur and Mercury, <hi>Aristotle</hi> his four
Elements, <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of <hi>Materia subtilis, globuli se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundi
elementi, &amp; materia tertii elementi,</hi>
and the most experienc'd <hi>Van Helmont,</hi>
his Axiom <hi>Of Water and Seminal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
all things are made;</hi> tho' expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
taught him, and others since
him, that not only Oil, but also Salt,
Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are made of Water, which
is known <hi>à posteriori,</hi> or by the effect,
or experiment (the Foundation of all
the Knowledge we have of Nature.)
But as for the Antediluvian World,
since it doth not so much concern us
now, I shall leave the consideration of
its Principles to the Abyssinian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
who demonstrate all things
<hi>à priori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99636:17"/>
And yet in these separations, the
Theorist is not so Philosophical as he
pretends to be, for his division of the
Chaos, into Fluid and Volatile, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Air, this is purely Abyssinian
or Fictitious, the Air being own'd by
all Philosophers Eluid as well as Water,
nay rather more.</p>
            <p>But the Fifth and Last Separation of
the Earth from the Air, is contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to common sense, as well as his own
Laws of Gravitation; for how could
it come to pass that there remain'd so
much Earth in the Air (which is 1000
times lighter than Water) after the
four Separations mention'd, as to be
sufficient to make up the crust of the
Antediluvian Earth? Why was it not
carried down toward the Center, as
fast as the Water, or at least the Oil?
The simile of Snow and Hail falling
down from the Air, will not answer
the case in hand, for they rise into the
middle Region of the Air in form of a
Vapour much rarify'd, by which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction
the Surface of every particle
of Water, being made larger, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
becomes lighter than so much Air,
and so ascends till it come to the
<pb facs="tcp:99636:17"/>
middle Region, where by its cold, 'tis
condens'd, and so falls down in Rain,
Hail or Snow, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
degrees of cold; that I may not
seem to say this <hi>gratis,</hi> I shall illustrate
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t with an experiment, that will qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate
better with what I have said,
than the Theorist's Simile; let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a small Carps Bladder, with the
Air squeezed out, and the Mouth close
tyed, to be thrown into a wide mouth'd
Glass full of Water, it will sink to the
bottom, but if the Vessel and all be
put into the Pneumatick Engine or
Air-Pump, and a Receiver fitted to it,
upon exhausting the Air from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
that little which remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
in the Bladder, will expand i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
self very much, and so both togethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
will make an aggregate, lighter than
Water, upon whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it will rise to the
top, because it has more Surface ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to its Pressure, than it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Now if the Theorist can prove
that his Earthy Particles were thus ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of expansion and dilation, this
Assertion of his, tho' but the Opinion
of one Dr. shall have place among the
probable ones, otherwise we will take it
<pb facs="tcp:99636:18"/>
for no other than Abyssinian, or
Fictitious. But suppose it to be true,
we have no reason to think Fabulous or
Strange <hi>Pliny</hi>'s and <hi>Livy</hi>'s Stories of
Showers of Flesh, Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> seeing
the whole Earth, the Mother of All
did this Shower down out of the Air.
And since our Author is Arbitrary in
supposing, I think he might as well have
suppos'd the Abyss to have been shut up
in a Bag of Raw Hides, which would
have supported the Earth from falling
into his Abyss, till by being bak'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a hard crust, it had been able to
support it self; and this will better fit
his Interpretation of <hi>Ps.</hi> 33. 7. where
the Sea is by him said, to be gathered
as in a Bag, for the hard crust of the
Earth might be better compar'd to a
Bottle than to a Bag. I would not
have the Theorist think I put a jest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, in mentioning this of the Raw
Hides, because notable Feats, past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
in the laying of Foundations have
been perform'd by this means, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
instance of which is to be seen
to this day in the English Church at
<hi>Vtrecht,</hi> where is a great Massy Pillar
that was thus founded; the account I
<pb facs="tcp:99636:18"/>
had of it when I was at <hi>Vtrecht</hi> was this,
when the Bishop of <hi>Vtrecht</hi> was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Church, as they digg'd to lay
the Foundation of this Pillar, they
came to a Quick-Sand that swallowed
up every thing that was put upon it, so
that the raising of it was look'd upon
as unpracticable, till the Bishop propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a great reward to any that could
bring the Foundation to bear, a <hi>Friez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
found out the way, and being
overjoyed at the discovery, he told it
to his Wife, which his Son hearing,
told it to his Play-fellows in the Street,
by this means it came to the Bishop's
Ears, so that when the Ingineer came
to demand his Reward, he refus'd to
pay him, saying, he knew it already,
which so incens'd the cruel <hi>Friezelander,</hi>
that he kill'd his Child and Wife for
divulging his Secret, and the Bishop for
defrauding him of his Reward; in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of this there is a Picture of an
Ox upon the Pillar, with this Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<q>
                  <l>Accipe posteritas quod per tua saeculaa
nerres,</l>
                  <l>Taurinis cutibus fundo solidata columna
est.</l>
               </q>
               <pb facs="tcp:99636:19"/>
Upon a Pillar at the end of the Church,
are twenty or thirty Hexameter Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
giving an account of the whole
Story. The Theorist needs not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that the heat of the Sun, which
is suppos'd to bake the Earth into a
hard crust, might burn the Hides, for
the Water in the Abyss will secure him
from this fear, a confirmation of which
may be seen in <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s History,
where he gives an account of a way
practis'd in these times for boiling of
Meat in raw Hides, by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
hard like Iron, and were not
burnt. But if we admit that the after-birth
of the Earthy Particles, did (in
the order suppos'd by the Theorist)
fall upon the Oil, and there were by
the heat of the Sun, bak'd into a hard
crust, how will this agree with the
Scripture? Gen. 1. 9 <hi>Let the Dry
Land appear, and it was so;</hi> ver. 10.
<hi>And God called the Dry Land Earth,</hi> &amp;c.
How was the Earth hardened by the
heat of the Sun that was not yet made?
For the Earth was made on the third,
and the Sun on the fourth, ver. 16.
<hi>God made two great Lights, the greater
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Rule the Day, and the lesser to Rule
<pb facs="tcp:99636:19"/>
the Night.</hi> But suppose the Sun could
do this under the Line, how came it
to be so soon bak'd under the Poles,
(where according to the Theory's sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Poles, of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and Aequator coinciding) the Sun
could never rise above the Horizon?
Seeing now tho' the Sun shines half a
year to these places, the Air is always
very cold, and the Earth covered with
Snow.</p>
            <p>But let us suppose the Earth to have
been thus hardened by the heat of the
Sun and Winds, then it must be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it hardened sooner under the
Line, than towards the Poles, and that
before the crust was hard enough to
support it self from falling into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byss,
it had acquired some considerable
weight, by reason of which pressing
on the Surface of the Abyss, it would,
according to the nature of all Fluids,
give way, and rise towards the Poles;
where by reason of the greater rawness
of the Crust, the Water would meet
with less resistance, and so break the
continuity of the Egg-shell; for I do
not see by any thing the Theorist ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
how the Water which in the
<pb facs="tcp:99636:20"/>
natural Ballance alters its place with
the 1/200000 of its weight, more on one
side than on another, should in this
case hold firm, except by the above
mentioned supposition of the raw
Hides. Methinks I see the Oil'd Cake
or Crust, thus falling in at the sides,
and rising towards the Poles, and so
the whole Fabrick of the Egg-shell
spoil'd: and therefore Gentlemen I
will by your leave take the liberty to
entertain you with another Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
while the Theorist is making a
surer and better foundation than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for his Primogenial Earth, or Egg-shell,
but first crave leave to make an
end of this search. The Theorist does
not tell in what proportion the Earth
was mixt with the Oil, for Nature does
all her Work in proportion; this the
Apothecaries know in making their
Plaisters,<note place="margin">☞</note> where according to the Rule
of Art, there is of Oil and Wax each
an ounce, and of Powders half an
ounce, for a soft Plaister; and for the
hardest Plaister there is one ounce of
Oil, two ounces of Wax, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
six drachms, which being cold
makes a Mass hard, almost like a Stone;
<pb facs="tcp:99636:20"/>
but this, seeing it melts again with the
heat, will not answer the end; the
good Women know a certain propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Butter and Flower, which,
tho' I am ignorant of, yet seeing it
bakes into a very hard substance, might
do here, were it not very brittle.
The Theorist may think this a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
comparison, yet this I may be
bold to say, and can make out if need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that a good Woman that makes
Butter'd Cakes to sell them again, does
more service to the Publick, than the
Doctor has done by his Theory. But
he does very well to decline this, as
being a thing impracticable, except he
had been then on God Almighty's
Council, or dispens'd out the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients;
for if he had been then present,
and but a bare Spectator, he could have
done no more than now, <hi>i. e.</hi> to make
a Conjecture good for nothing.</p>
            <p>But farther, the Oil must have been
of some depth, to incorporate so great
a quantity of Earth; now the Theory
does not tell where so great a quantity
of Earth did stop in the Oil, whether
near the surface, in the middle, or
near the bottom, if they settled to the <pb facs="tcp:99636:130"/>confines of the Oil and Water, the
heat of the Sun, even under the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Zone</hi> could not reach so far as to
bake it into a hard Crust, except he
be suppos'd to have been far more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
in his Actions, in his own, and
the World's Infancy, than he is how
in his old declining Age; for at Sea,
within the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> we do not find
now, that the Sun-beams penetrate
much below the surface of the Water,
this is known by the experience of the
Seamen, when (under the Line) they
let down their Plumets; for after
they have been some time under Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
200 fathom deep, they bring them
up so cold, that one cannot long hold
his hand upon them, which observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Mariners have improved to the
cooling of their Liquors, better than
we do here with Ice and Snow. It will
be most convenient therefore, in my
judgment, to suppose this forming of
the Crust, on or near the surface of the
Oil; but by this means 'tis very likely
there would be a great quantity of Oil
under that never incorporated with
the Earth, or was never bak'd, so that
when the Egg-shell broke, the Sea
<pb facs="tcp:99636:130"/>
would be covered with it, like so much
fat Broth, which, there being no more
Earth to Rain out of the Air to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
with it, must have continued so
to this day, except consum'd with the
superfluous Waters after the Deluge.
Yet further the Egg-shell or Crust was
made before the Fishes and Fowls were
produc'd out of the Water, which was
on the Fifth day, <hi>Gen. 1. 20. And God
said, let the Waters bring forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
the living Creature that hath
life, and the Fowls,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 23. <hi>And
the Evening and the Morning were the
fifth Day.</hi> Now how can this be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with a Crust of the Earth encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
the Abyss, in which there must
be no opening or <hi>hiatus?</hi> Or else how
could the Crust when it was first form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
be kept from falling in? In which
case this Abyss must be a very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place for Fishes to live in, far more
for their encreasing and multiplying;
for 'tis observ'd now in Fish-Ponds, if
the Water be quite Frozen, that the
Fish dye for want of Air, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in <hi>Holland</hi> where they have a great
many Fish Ponds about their Houses,
and great Frosts, they break the Ice
<pb facs="tcp:99636:131"/>
from time to time, lest their Fish should
dye for want of Air.</p>
            <p>'Tis remarkable that the Plants were
produc'd the same day with the Earth,
before the Sun and Moon, but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fishes and
Fowls were not made till after the
fourth day, in which the Luminaries
were made, that they might have the
benefit of the Sun and Moon to direct
them by their Light, in their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to and fro to seek their Food;
but the Plants which receive their Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
standing still in the Ground,
had not so great need of that Light,
and therefore were made before.</p>
            <p>From this we may infer, that the
order kept in this short History; is not
only to comply with the weak capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Ignorant People, but to tell
the Matter of Fact, and that there is
no less reason for the Order of all the
other parts of the History, tho' the
Theorist has the confidence to ridicule
it, as being fitted only to the capacities
of Ignorant Slaves, newly come out of
<hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But supposing Fishes might live there
for 1600 years as the <hi>Faetus</hi> does in the
<pb facs="tcp:99636:131"/>
Mothers Womb, shut up in darkness,
from the Air, and the Prolifick heat of
the Sun; how can our Theorist give an
account of the production of Fowls
out of the Water, that is consistent
with the Scripture, for the Earth was
made the third day, and firm enough
to produce Plants, how, or at what
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent got the Fowls out into the open
Air? Suppose they could make their
way through the Egg-shell, in places
nearer the Poles, where 'twas still but
like Mudd; or was our Oil'd Cake not
strong enough by this time to keep the
Birds from flying out? if not, surely
they would be so daub'd with Oil or
Earth, that they would never be able
to raise themselves out of the Mudd,
or when raised, to fly.</p>
            <p>But again, if the Fishes were thus
inclos'd within the Crust, how could
the Blessing of God upon Man take
place? <hi>Ver.</hi> 28. viz. <hi>That he should have
Dominion over the Fishes of the Sea,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for 16 hundred years they were
so far remov'd from his Habitation,
likely some hundreds of miles, the
whole Crust of the Earth being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
between him and them.

would be derogatory from the subtlety
of the Cartesian Aether, upon which he
and Seignor <hi>Spoletti</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour's
Physician, were pleas'd to
honour me with a visit at my Chamber;
the Experiment was this, I had a Glass
Pipe, such as they make the Baroscopes
of, blown into the shape of a round ball
at the end, that was Hermetically seal'd
and bended into a Syphon, whose legs
were parallel; but distant from another
three inches, so that the leg on which
the Ball stood, was nine inches long,
but the other two feet long; the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Leg, and the intermedial Pipe I
fill'd quite with Water, to the lower
end of the great Leg, so that there was
no Air left in the space, then I put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it some filings of Steel, about a
drachm and an half, and after the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
were laid along in the intermedial
Pipe, I put to it Oil of Vitriol 30 or
40 drops, which mixing with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(for otherwise strong Oil of Vitriol
does not work upon the filings) did
immediately corrode the Iron, and
sent up to the Ball so great a quantity
of this generated Air as to fill it, and
<pb facs="tcp:99636:132"/>
half the shorter Leg in a very little
space, in which it was remarkable,
that applying my warm hand to the
Ball, it did expand it self in an instant,
so much as to drive out the Water at
the longer Pipe, but on with-drawing
my hand, it contracted it self into half
the Ball, where it has stood ever since
<hi>December</hi> last year, now it's <hi>November;</hi>
another thing very remarkable in this
is, a considerable heat that is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
ever since, on the top of the
Ball, such as is observed in the great
end of fresh Eggs, and this tho' the
Water, the other half, be very cold,
and at the same time some of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
got out into the open Air. At
the first it had a saltish taste on the top
of the Ball, which I could not observe
in the Summer, but now in <hi>November</hi>
I observe it very remarkable with the
heat, and so it appeared to a young
Gentleman that was with me at that
time.</p>
            <p>Before I come to apply this to the
subject in hand, it will be necessary to
remark from Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 11.
that there were then and still are, great
Cavities in the Bowels of the Earth,
<pb facs="tcp:99636:133"/>
full of Water, to which agree the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of the Authors mentioned in
<hi>Ramazzini.</hi> These Cavities, seeing
the Scripture says nothing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
we may suppose to have been
made from the beginning,
not as Deformities,<note place="margin">Ram. p. 58, 76.</note> but for
noble and excellen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> uses,
and that by taking off the
upper Crust from some parts of the
Earth, and laying it on others, the
everlasting Mountains, and a Bed for
the Ocean were fram'd at the same
time, and thus a passage was open'd
for the Waters, that before encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
the Earth, to run into these
Cavities: 'tis not material for our
purpose, whether this was all done
in one day, as the Theory objects, or
whether the Water could run so fast
away from the Inland places, as to
leave them quite bare, it is enough,
if in that day the dry land did appear, as
doubtless a great part of it did. The The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist
thinks this a very laborious Work:
as if it were a hard thing for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Nature (who tells his Servants,
that if they had Faith but as a grain of
<pb facs="tcp:99636:133"/>
Mustard-Seed, they might remove
Mountains into the Sea) to remove
the Mountains out of the Sea.</p>

            <p>3. That in these Cavities might be
generated Minerals and Metals, <hi>Ram.</hi>
p. 32. and that by the colluctation of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
contrary Salts in the Abyss, might
be generated an Air and sometimes so
suddenly as to make Explosions; of
which, and the first Supposition,
Earthquakes, and the rocking of the
Earth seem to be a pregnant instance,
<hi>Vid. Brit. Bac.</hi> P. 73. Where 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
that the Earth rose nine foot
high, and was thrown some distance

or Wind pented in, and suddenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded.</p>
            <p>5. We may allow also that there
were Mountains in the beginning,
which seems to be plain by <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 2.
in which the formation of the Earth,
and the Mountains are mention'd as
coaeval, and therefore are called ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Mountains, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 26. This
<pb facs="tcp:99636:134"/>
may be by good consequence also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from the second chapter of
<hi>Gen.</hi> wherein 'tis said, there were Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
one of which, <hi>viz. Euphrates</hi>
is to this day known by the name that
it had then: from whence we may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude, that the same Rivers had
the same Mountains, from which they
descended, that they have now. Now
if we suppose, that at the time of the
Deluge there happen'd such a conflict
of contrary Salts, Acid and Alcali,
as we have now mention'd in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of the Earth, there would be an
Air generated, which in many places
being penned up, might cause Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
and at the same time some of
this Exhalation might escape into the
open Air, from which might proceed
the great Rains of forty days continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
accompanied likely with great
Thunder, Lightning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to strike the
greater terror into the Wicked, that
in their fright they might not find the
way to the Ark they had formerly so
much despis'd, and that if they had
thought of such things, they might be
hindred by the great Rains; by the
Air inclos'd in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owels of the Earth
<pb facs="tcp:99636:134"/>
we may (as it happens in our Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
imagine, that the Water of the
Abyss was dislodg'd, and so came out
to overflow the Earth: (by which we
may interpret the opening of the great
depths) and this at the passages by
which the Abyss and Ocean did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
which so swell'd by degrees,
till the top of the highest Mountains
were covered; Further we may infer,
that the Antediluvian Air being infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Mineral Seams, and in a
great measure compos'd of them, might
occasion that shortning of Man's Life,
which happen'd quickly after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge;
which tho' it did not so visibly
affect the stronger Constitutions of
<hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, might lay such a
foundation of infirmities in their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
as might in <hi>Moses</hi> days shorten
their Life to 70 or 80 years. We may
suppose likewise that (as in our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment) when the heat of the Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence
was over, the Water fell in
the greater Pipe, and rose in the shorter,
so when this Ebullition was over in the
Bowels of the Earth, the Waters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
by degrees into the Bowels of
the Earth, and so the Ocean into the
<pb facs="tcp:99636:135"/>
bounds set to it by God, as in <hi>Psal.
104. 6. Thou coverest it with the deep
as with a garment: The Waters stood
above the Mountains. ver. 7. At thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
they fled, at the voice of thy thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Ocean to circulate thro' the

to the Neck, throw in by this Pipe
some filings of Steel, after which some
Oil of Vitriol, and keep the Ball in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining,
so that the steams arising may
not get out at the hole, but being pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in may drive out the Water at the
Pipe, which if the Ball were the
Center of the Earth, would over flow
<pb facs="tcp:99636:135"/>
all the surface of the Glass, and cover
the Mountains of it, but this being
wanted, we may imagine another
glass <hi>c c c</hi> divided in two as you see,
so that they may be cemented together
when the other glass ball is inclos'd,

            <p>This is the substance of what I have
to say of my Hypothesis, which if fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with a good Library, with large
Indexes, it were easie to make swell
into a Volume big enough to deserve
the title of a Theory; among which I
might perhaps find, even in the Relicts
of the Fidler <hi>Orpheus</hi> himself, so much
esteemed by our Theorist, or at least
among the other <hi>PLACITA PHILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHORVM,</hi>
enough to favour it.

               <head>Of Perpetual Lamps.</head>
               <p>THere has been much written of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Lamps, said to be found in
Burying places of the old <hi>Romans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
which at first seems past all belief; for
how can it be that a Lamp should have
fuel for some hundreds of years, to
maintain it in life? And if it had fuel
how could it in those close Vaults escape
being suffocated in its own smoke? I
believe that the appearing of some light
by the Work-mens Tools, hitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
some hard Stone or Brick in the
dark, and so striking fire, might give
rise to the first report, which Fame;
that never loses by going, has increas'd
almost to a Miracle. For they say of
them, that upon the Air's coming to
them, they, contrary to all other fires,
do presently die. Or they might have
met with such an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Observation as a
noble Lord told me he had communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him when at <hi>Rome,</hi> by a Gentleman
of that place who made it; and it was
this, that searching <hi>Roma Subterranea</hi>
for Antiquities, he came to a Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,
<pb facs="tcp:99636:136"/>
which ordering to be digg'd
thro', he found to be the Wall of a
Vault, or Burying-place, in which
before the Light was brought in, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
something like a Candle burning,
which he lost sight of as soon as the
Candle was brought in: and therefore
removing it again, and directing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by his Hand kept between the
Light and his Eye, he found it, and by
the description I had of it from that
noble person, it was of the nature of
Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi>'s <hi>Glacial Noctiluca,</hi> for it was
solid, and in a fortnights time did run
<hi>per deliquium.</hi> But whatever be of
truth in it, the Ingenious have made
many Conjectures about the salving of
this wonderful Phaenomenon. <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> has attempted it by applying his
Principles to it, but seeing they are
<hi>Abyssinian, i. e.</hi> precarious, and the
explication hardly intelligible, we pass
it in silence. <hi>Athanasius Kircher,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> has given us his conjecture,
which seeing it depends upon a Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Principle, is by far more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
than any we can expect out of the
Mint of a mere <hi>Abyssinian.</hi> He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
that these Lamps are seated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Asbeston which never wastes in the
fire; so that Nature constantly furnish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
fresh fuel, and the Wick never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the flame may continue forever. But
how plausible so ever this Conjecture be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it will be of small use, because it cannot
be had every where. Therefore the
Ingenious Dr. <hi>Hooke</hi> has contriv'd, and
imparted to the World several pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y
ways, which are found to answer very
well; for by the poysing of his Lamp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he orders it so, that the Oil may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be kept to the same height, upon
the Wick, and consequently the flame,
and that therefore the Wyck can never
waste, because always in the flame,
for it wastes not tho' in the midst of
the flame, till it be expos'd to the open
Air; of which one may see more at
large in his Treatise of Lamps: but
with submission I am of opinion, that
the weight of the Oil when the Lamp
is full, will make the Lamp move hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily,
and also make it wear out quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
I have therefore a good while ago,
<pb facs="tcp:99636:137"/>
thought these inconveniencies might be
prevented by some Hydrostatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
seeing the main thing sought
for here, is to keep the flame at the
same height on the Wyck; my way is
this, let a Vessel <hi>a a a,</hi> be shap'd after
the fashion here mark'd, an inch or
more deep, and as broad as you may
think fitting for the quantity of Oil
you are to burn, let also a Pipe <hi>b b b,</hi>
coming from the bottom almost as
high as the Cistern, be filled first with
Water <hi>c c c,</hi> so high as to cover the
hole of the Pipe at the bottom, that
the Oil <hi>d d d</hi> poured in afterwards
may not get out at the Pipe <hi>b b b,</hi> and
so be lost; let the Vessel being almost
brimsul, have a cover'd pierc'd with
as many holes as 'tis design'd to have
Wycks, be fitted to the mouth of the
Vessel, when the Wycks are lighted,
if Water falls in by drops at the Pipe,
it will keep the Oil always to the same
heighth, or very near (the weight of
Water to that of Oil, being as 20 8/11
to 19) which in the depth of an inch
or two, will make no great difference
of height in the Oil, if the Water
runs faster than the Oil wastes; it will
<pb facs="tcp:99636:138"/>
only run over at the top of the Pipe,
what does not run over coming under
the Oil, will keep it to the same height,
this it will do perpetually without any
fear of rub or let, the cover will keep
the Soot of the Lamp from falling in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
the Oil, and keep it from thickening
with it, The main use of such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
is, where there is occasion for
long digestions with a gentle heat.</p>

it, which they have hitherto done but in

have discovered it to be a Mineral Oil,
coagulated by a mineral Acid, and also
the same is made evident, by the
composition of it; for if you mix Oil
of Sulphur with Oil of Turpentine,
they will coagulate into a gummy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

Brimstone. The main experiment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted

AUTHOR'S
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF the Searchers after Nature, of
which this Age has not a few,
whose study is spent about things
of greater Concern, and therefore are
deservedly admired; if, I say, these
found it as easie to search into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
parts of the Earth, as 'tis to the
Anatomists to take an exact View of
the Bowels of a Man, and other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creatures, the one needed not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
the other; and we should have as
full a Knowledge of the Earth, as
we have now of Living Animals, by
the Industry of Anatomists. We know
now, yea to our own no small Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb facs="tcp:99636:142"/>
with our Eyes we see, how
the Blood circulates, what is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Chyle, the Lympha; and
other Fluids; so that now to use
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> his own Words, The
Fountains of Humane Nature, and
the Rivers with which the Body is
watered, seem to be open'd. But as
for the Earth, out of whose Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
we draw our Nourishment, we
can observe nothing but its outward
side, and therefore we are ignorant
of the more beautiful things that
are hid; and, which is to be grieved
for, there is no way by which they
may be known. For although the
Miners have gone down into the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of the Earth many Fathoms, yet
they have never gone much deeper
than half a Mile, which by <hi>Agricola</hi>
is said to be the greatest Depth of
the Mines. But what is that to the
Depth of the Earth, whose Seme.
diameter is said to be 3600 Mile.
Wherefore, to tell the Truth, we
<pb facs="tcp:99636:142"/>
know the Body of the Earth only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially,
and not within: Yet 'tis
lawful to judge, that 'tis neither a
sluggish nor unshapely Body, nor yet
that all its Dignity is plac'd in its
outward Surface, as in Statues, but
that its more beautiful Parts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
yea, we must think that 'tis so
shap'd and figur'd by the Great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
as to contain a Specimen of the
Vital O Economy, and that the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Functions thereof are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
in its Bowels, by a Law no
less certain than unknown to us, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Circular Motion of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
of which, though they cannot be
demonstrated to the Senses, yet by
what appears outwardly, 'tis evident
that the matter is so; neither has
the Wit of Men stopt, till they had
by all Art searcht into the State and
Condition of the Subterraneous Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as far as could be. But seeing
there is no other way by which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Earth, but by such Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb facs="tcp:99636:143"/>
as either Nature has made of
her own accord, or by Mines and
Wells, which the Covetousness of
Men has digged for Metals, or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
has put them on, for finding
Veins of Waters; and seeing that
in this City there is a frequent dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Wells to a notable Depth,
(as much as can be in a very plain
place, and remote from Mountains)
from which a wonderful Spring of
Water rises; I thought good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to examine these Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to communicate to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of Natural Knowledge, what I
have observed of them, and my
Thoughts threupon, seeing none has
Written of these things expresly. I am
not ignorant that some idle Men will
speak ill of me, and others will not
be wanting who will accuse me, as
having spent may time about a thing
of no moment: But that does little
disquiet me, seeing I have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the most Learned, who have
<pb facs="tcp:99636:143"/>
been taken up with the most minute
things, of whom <hi>Virgil</hi> says,
<q>In tenui labor, at tenuis non
gloria—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I can Answer such Men with
the Words of</hi> Seneca <hi>treating of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philosophy,</hi> You will say, what
Profit is there in these things? No
greater can be; To know Nature.
Neither has the treating of this
Subject any thing more beautiful,
seeing it contains many things that
may be useful, than that its Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
takes up a Man; nor is it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
for Profit, but for its Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfulness.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Structure of these Fountains is

things which appear in the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

            <p>WE may be bold to say
that <hi>Modena,</hi> a most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
City, which <hi>Tully</hi>
has of old Dignified with the Title
of the most Noble Colony of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> has been well situated by
its first Founders: For seeing it
stands in a great Plain, ten Miles
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99636:145"/>
distant from the Foot of the Rising
Hills, it has such a Situation, that,
with the wholsom Temper of the
Air, and a fruitful Soil, it has
a great abundance of most pure
Water, which neither can cease
through length of Time, nor be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
vitiated or diverted by the
Craft of Enemies: For this City
has under its very Foundations a
great Repository of Waters, or
whatever else it may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be called, out
of which it draws an inexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Stock of Waters; and, which
is very rare, is got at a very small
Charge; seeing for the getting of
this Treasure (for VVater, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Testimony of <hi>Pindarus,</hi>
is the best of all things) there is
no need of great stir, in digging
through Mountains, or keeping a
great many VVorkmen, as is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
elsewhere, and such as <hi>Rome</hi>
formerly had divided, as <hi>Frontinus</hi>
says, into Searchers, VVater-Fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

VVater-Bayliffs, Conveyors,
Distributers, and many other
VVorkmen.</p>
            <p>But that I may not keep the
Reader longer in Suspence, you
must know for a certain Truth,
which many Thousands of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
have already confirmed,
<hi>That in any place within, or without
the City, for some Miles round, one
may open a Spring which shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
send forth most pure Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And seeing every Citizen may
take out of this great Stock, as
much VVater for his private Uses
as he pleases, without fear of
wronging the Publick, or being
Fin'd for it: Therefore when any
will have a Spring in his own
House, he calls some VVorkmen,
and having agreed for the Price,
which for the most part does not
exceed the Sum of Forty Crowns,
he shews them the place which he
thinks most fit, and they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99636:147"/>
further consideration dig a <hi>Well</hi> in
a place mark'd out for them; and
when they have come to the depth
of about 63 Foot, they pierce the
bottom with a great Auger, which
when it has been driven down 5
Foot deep, immediately the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
gushes out with so great Force,
throwing up Stones and Sand, that
almost in a Moment all the VVell
is filled to the top, and the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
flows out thence constantly.</p>
            <p>Moreover, that which in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
these Wells gives the greatest
Trouble to the VVorkmen, is, the
great abundance of VVaters flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the sides, by which they
are sometimes much troubled, till
they come to the depth of 28 Foot,
where first the Potters Clay begins
to appear: And therefore to keep
off these VVaters which are none
of the cleanest, when they first
break Earth, they make a VVell
pretty large, drawing out the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99636:147"/>
that flow together on every
side, till they come to the Bed of
Clay; then they build upon it, as
on a solid Foudation, a VVall
round about of Lime and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnt
Bricks, made for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that so the VVell may be
narrower; and they carefully pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the outer Surface of it with
Clay, well wrought, pressing it
with their Feet; and thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to do till they come to the
Surface of the Earth: For by this
means they hinder the Influx of
VVaters from the sides, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, as if all were safe, and
there were no more fear of the
VVater coming from the sides,
they carry on their digging to the
lowermost place so successfully,
that from the appearing of the
Clay, they observe no more water
to drop; yea, which is wonderful,
they are forc'd sometimes to moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99636:148"/>
the Earth with VVater, that
it may be more easily digged.</p>
            <p>'Tis also no small Disadvantage
to the Diggers, before they come
to the beginning of the Chalky or
Clayie Ground, that the soft Earth
falls in upon them by the Force of
the Side-VVaters; which Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not overcome but with
great Labour: But when at length
they come to the Bed of Clay, and
from thence to the greatest Depth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
there is nothing to hinder them
form getting by the usual boring
the usual Eruption of VVater. For
no Case is remembred in any place
whatsoever within the City, or
without the City, for some Miles,
in which upon opening a Hole,
and giving Vent to the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
VVaters, they did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
spring up on high. For
the Diggers do with as great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
and Confidence fasten
down their Augers in the bottom
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99636:148"/>
of the VVells, as one being to draw
VVine, would pierce a Hogshead
when 'tis full. I was often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
when this Phlebotomy, if I
may so call it, was practis'd; and
I always observed the VVater
to break out almost with the
same Force, which at the first
is muddy and full of Sand, but
the next Day it appears clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
But when the VVater has
broke out, and the Borer is pulled
out, sitting on the Arms of the
Auger, immediately two or three
VVorkmen that are about the
Mouth of the VVell draw out the
VVater with all possible Diligence;
for seeing at that time the Force
of the VVater drives out much
Sand and Gravel, they say that by
this means the Course of the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is promoted, and the VVells
are made to send forth VVater
more plentifully; neither can the
Stuff settling to the bottom stop
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99636:149"/>
the Hole. The Diggers of the
VVells say, That some new-made
Fountains have thrown up some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so much VVater with the
Gravel and Sand, that the Ground
giving way on every side, and
threatning the Ruine of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Buildings, they have been
forc'd to fill up the Fountain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with Earth and hewn Stones.
But the Pebble Stones, which are
thrown up by the force of the
VVater, differ not much from
those which are seen in the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Rivers; neither are they
small, but some of them weigh 3
or 4 Ounces: Some of these are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with Veins of Gold, and
pretty hard; others are harder,
and like the Rudiments of Pebble
Stones. In some places where
the Situation of the City is lower,
the VVater arises above the Plain,
from whence it runs easily down,
but in higher places it stops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99636:149"/>
the Surface of the Plain; so
that 'tis necessary to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits
under Ground, thro' which
it falls into the publick Canals,
which afterwards meet into one
Canal that is Navigable, and by
which they Sail conveniently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
even to <hi>Venice.</hi> For this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
falls into the <hi>Scultenna,</hi> and the
<hi>Scultenna</hi> into the <hi>Po.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Number of these Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
is very great, so that now
almost every House has one; and
their Numbers being increas'd, the
old Fountains become fewer, as
may be seen in the most Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Family of the <hi>Sadalets,</hi> now
belonging to the <hi>Castelvitrys,</hi> where
the Pipes that now send forth no
more VVater, are higher than
those that at present do. These
Fountains also are in the Gardens
about the Town, and in the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Villages, some of which rise
above the Surface of the Earth.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99636:150"/>
Moreover, the Diggers of the
VVells say, that they have on
Trial found them seven Miles from
the City, beyond <hi>Scultenna:</hi> For
having made an hole with an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
they say the VVater did
boil up freely enough, throwing
up Sand and Gravel. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Limits of this hidden
Spring are not known enough;
yet 'tis reasonable to think, that
it is extended farther from East to
VVest, than from North to South,
seeing in this Tract they are
not found extended above four
Miles.</p>
            <p>This is remarkable, that when
the Hole is bor'd, and the VVater
begins to break out, the next Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
cease from running for some
time; yet after a little time they
run again. I have been told by
a Person of Credit, that when a
VVell was bor'd in the Cloysters of
the Nuns of St. <hi>Francis des Sales,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99636:150"/>
he saw in another VVell near it
the VVater sunk in a moment,
which afterward ascended, till
both the VVells being in an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium,
the VVater settled in the
same Horizontal Surface. I have
often observed this Decrease, but
not with so great Swiftness, in
which the VVater did not sink so
deep on a sudden, but rather by
degrees; and raising a few Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
I observed it to decrease;
but when the new <hi>Well</hi> was filled,
it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ose again to its former height.</p>
            <p>Having often understood by the
Diggers of the <hi>Wells,</hi> that they
heard a great noise of the water
running under the bottom of the
<hi>Wells,</hi> and that when it first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to be heard they take it as a
sign, that 'tis time to Bore. To
be assur'd of this, I went down
into the bottom of a <hi>Well</hi> in the
beginning of <hi>February,</hi> holding a
lighted Candle in my Hand, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99636:151"/>
               <hi>Well</hi> being built in a place of no
great light; having staid there a
little, I perceived a manifest Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
and Noise, yet not such as I
expected. Then I stampt on the
Ground with all my force, upon
which the Ground made a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Noise, so that I thought I had
to do with Hell, and therefore
quickly gave notice to those that
were above, to pull me up with
all possible speed, remembring that
once the force of the Water throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Earth prevented the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
But though I did not stay
long there, seeing nothing beside
occurred to be observed but the
oise of the Water, yet I felt so
great a Heat there, that I did run
down in Sweat; and it was no
small Pleasure to me to observe,
when I was drawn up from that
Thermometer, in so small an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
of time, so many gradual
Changes of Heat and Cold. At
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99636:151"/>
another time I try'd what was the
temper of these <hi>Wells,</hi> in their
greatest Depth, by letting down a
Thermometer in the midst of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and I found that it differ'd lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
from the Heat of the Dog-days
in our Climate. The Diggers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no less Cold in the Summer-time
in these <hi>Wells,</hi> and upon that
account they refuse to undertake
such a work in the middle of
Summer; seeing, beside the great
Cold which oppresses them, such
a difficulty of breathing also seises
them, that they are almost suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated;
a great quantity of Smoke
rises likewise at the same time,
so as to put out the Candles, which
never happens in the Winter, for
then they breath easily enough,
and the Candle stands unmoved.
The Diggers complain much of a
bad Smell, when they dig in the
<hi>Wells</hi> in a hot Season; especially
when they light on Stumps of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99636:152"/>
Trees: For the rotten wood sends
forth a most vile stink, which in
the Winter-time they do not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
though at that time they
perceive a great Heat in these
<hi>Wells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But seldom are these <hi>Wells</hi> dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
in which they do not meet
with several sorts of Trees, as
Oaks, Walnut-trees, Elm, Ash,
some of which stand upright, and
some lie along. But it appears
not by any Mark, that they have
been cut by Men's Hands; and
therefore we must think that these
Woods were only the Habitations
of wild Beasts in former times.
These Trees when they are cut by
the Diggers are soft enough, but
when they are exposed to the Air,
they grow hard like Coral.</p>
            <p>When they were making such
a <hi>Well</hi> as this in the middle of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi>
I observed the rising of such a
smoaky Exhalation, that the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99636:152"/>
could scarcely be observ'd in
the bottom; who also said he was
very cold; and that he could hardly
breath; and at the same time was
troubled with a Cough: But when
the Air on a sudden was changed
to Cold, immediately the said Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation
evanisht, and the Digger
could breath freely enough; and
he said, he felt a moderate Heat.
Being to try what Temper these
<hi>Wells</hi> were of in the Months next
to the Summer, I went down into
a <hi>Well</hi> which a French Jeweller
was digging in his House about the
end of <hi>May,</hi> before it was bor'd,
and I found such degrees of Cold,
as are observ'd in this Climate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the beginning of Winter.
During the time that I staid there
my Chest and my Breast was so
straitned, that my Heart did pant
very much. I did not perceive a
great noise of Waters in this as
in others, yet the Ground being
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99636:153"/>
beat, did give a frightful Sound as
before.</p>
            <p>While I was writing this, I
thought fit to try the Temper of
the Subterraneous Air in a <hi>Well</hi>
that was then digging, by letting
down into it at the same time a
Thermometer and Barometer to
several Depths, and marking the
difference that is between the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Air, and that which is in the
<hi>Wells</hi> when they are a digging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and especially in the Summer
Months, in which the Workmen
seldom undertake such a business,
by reason of the Inconveniences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned.
Wherefore I have
set down the following Table, that
it may be better known what is
the difference between the Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
and the Open Air; which
would be also very convenient and
curious, if try'd in the VVinter
time: But I do not doubt but the
quite contrary things happen then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99636:153"/>
which I will try with the first op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.

it happen at any time, that any
of these flow something flowly
they draw out the Water as fast
as they can; and by this kind of
Remedy (even as in Men's Bodies
the Blood is taken away, that it
may move more quick through its
Passages) the Load being as 'twere
taken off, they easily drive away
the Sickness of these Fountains
which is their flowness of Motion
For the same end, they also either
make a new Hole, or open the
old one with an Instrument made
of many wooden Cylinders, which
they let down into the <hi>Wells</hi> with

great Auger fastned in the end

            <p>But these Fountains are subject
to no other Fault; they maintain
the same Purity of their Waters
uncorrupted; and as in moist Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
they feel no Increase, so in the
greatest Droughts (such as we
observ'd in these last Years, in
which the whole Region on this

want Water) they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe
no Decrease. Moreover, these
Waters are very warm in Winter,
so that they send forth a Smoak;
but in Summer they are very cold.
Some Days after the Eruption is
made, when the Water has setled,
they usually cover the <hi>Well</hi> with a
Marble Stone, and as it were seal
it, and afterwards convey the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by Earthen Pipes from the

 Bed of Clay is about
11 Feet, and sometimes 'tis full of
Cockle-shells; it ends therefore
about the depth of 39 Feet; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that there appears another Bed
of marshy Earth, about 2 Foot
thick, compos'd of Rushes, Leaves
of Plants, and Branches. This
marshy Bed being taken away by
the Diggers, another Bed of Clay
of the same thickness with the
former, presents it self, which
terminates in the depth of about
52 Foot; which being digg'd up,
another Bed of marshy ground, not
unlike the former, is seen; which
being removed, another Bed of
Clayie Ground of the same nature
with the former two, but not so
thick, appears; which lies upon
another Bed of marshy Earth,
which at last terminates on that
last Plain, in which the Auger is
fix'd, which is soft, and sandy,
and mixt with much Gravel, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99636:21"/>
sometimes full of Sea-Products.
These several Beds, with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals,

            <p>Seeing in digging they often fall
on Stocks of Trees, as I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

great trouble in the boring, to the

that this Ground was once expos'd
to the Air; but I could never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
those Stocks of Trees in the
Beds of Chalk, but in the marshy
ones only, or in that space which
lies between the Foundation and
the beginning of the Clay. There

               </gap>oes make it manifest enough.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99636:23"/>
Neither can any object, that even
stagnant VVaters are subject to
great Commotions, as is known
of the <hi>Vulsinian</hi> Lake, <hi>Thrasumenus</hi>
and <hi>Benacus,</hi> of which the chief of
the poets says,

For that is not constant; yea, these
Lakes for the most part are very

heard, which I always perceiv'd
distinctly as oft as I descended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these <hi>Wells;</hi> and to this agree
the Undertakers of these <hi>Wells</hi>
who by the noise of the VVater
guess that they have done with
digging. But seeing the VVate
rises so suddenly to the height <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99636:23"/>
68 Feet, casting forth Sand and
Stones with force, 'tis most certain
that these Subterraneous VVaters
descend from a high place, and
are continually prest on by others
that follow. Neither do I think
that such a sudden rising of the
VVater can be attributed to the
weight of the superincumbent
Earth, which drives the VVater
upward by its Pressure. I know
indeed, that VVater may be eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above its Surface, when 'tis
driven up by some force lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; as <hi>Scaliger,</hi> writing against
<hi>Cardan,</hi> demonstrates, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of a Cylindrical Vessel with
Pipes on both sides, and a Plug
fitted exactly to its Capacity; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which, being full of VVater, if
you force down the Plug, it will
raise the VVater in the Pipes, above
the Surface of the VVater that is in
the Vessel. But if, by the weight
of the incumbent Earth, these VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99636:24"/>
were elevated, the Earth so
superincumbent would be broke
off from the rest, which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
improbable, there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Marks of it. Beside, by
what way could it come to pass,
that these Waters should be so
excellent, as to surpass all others,
if they were without Motion, and
kept as it were captive? For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body knows, that standing Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do no less differ from those
that are moved, than dead Bodies
differ from live ones, seeing we
commonly call such as run, <hi>Living
Waters.</hi> These Waters therefore
do move, and stand not still here,
but run down constantly either to
the Sea, or are swallowed up in
some Gulph.</p>
            <p>But whilst I conclude these VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be running, an Objection
of no small Value does occur, and
'tis this: If the VVaters run away
so violently, there seems to be no
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99636:24"/>
Reason why these <hi>Wells</hi> being dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
they should rise upwards. But
it may be demonstrated by a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Experiment, that the Water
cannot ascend in such as case. For
let there be a Vessel full
of Water,<note place="margin">Fig. 1.</note> at whose side
near the bottom, a Pipe is inserted
at right Angles pierc't with many
Holes, <hi>EFG;</hi> and in the lower
part let it have a Slit, <hi>HI.</hi> If now
you give the Water free vent to
run out, not only it will not ascend
at the Holes, but neither will it
descend at the Slit, but will all run
out at the wide Mouth of the
Pipe; and it will be pleasant to
see the Water hang out at the Slit,
and not fall, (till at the latter end)
the Vessel being almost empty, the
Water will no more run out at the
wide Mouth, but will all run down
through the Slit.</p>
            <p>If therefore this Experiment hold,
the supposed running of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99636:25"/>
to places farther off, and their
manifest ascent into these <hi>Wells</hi>
at the same time, seem not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the Laws of Hydrosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
For if they flow freely, and
without stopping, without doubt
they cannot rise on high; which
is confirmed by what
the most Learned, <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi>
says in his <hi>Exercitations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exer. 100.</note>
who, enquiring whether VVaters
may run under other waters, says,
That near the River <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tus</hi> there is
a <hi>Well</hi> on a high Hill, and that at
the bottom a Stream runs swiftly
and with great Noise.</p>
            <p>Altho' all this seems to be true
and obvious to the Senses, yet the
further Progress of these waters
may in our case consist with the
rising in these <hi>Wells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which may be
demonstrated in the same First Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
For if you put your Finger
to the Mouth of the Pipe <hi>D,</hi> yet
so as not to stop it altogether, the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99636:25"/>
Water will leap out on high at the
same time, by the holes <hi>E, F, G,</hi>
and flow down by the Slit <hi>H,</hi> and
withal at the Mouth of the Pipe,
the one Action not hindring the
other; and so according as there
is more or less of the Orifice of the
Pipe stopt with your Finger, more
or less Water will be raised by the
said Holes; but it will never be
rais'd to that height it would be,
if the Mouth were quite stopt. It
does not therefore disagree with
the Laws of Hydrostaticks, if these
Subterraneous Waters are running
and go further, that at the fame
time they should be raised to the
height of 68 Feet in the <hi>Wells,</hi> yet
so as not to exceed the height of
the Cistern from whence they
come, because the Passage at which
they flow out is not large enough.</p>
            <p>'Tis convenient that some Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
be given of these Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
observ'd hither to by none that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99636:26"/>
I know, seeing there is no part of
Philosophy more curious, yet less
cultivated, than Hydrostaticks.
First therefore, 'tis no wonder
that the Water (while it has a
free Course and Passage through
the wide Mouth of the Pipe) does
not run also at the Holes; yea, of
necessity it must be so: For the
Water has a free Descent, neither
does it meet with any Obstacle to
make it rise, as it does in Pipes
bended upwards; so neither will
it descend by the Cleft, because of
the Pressure and the Force it has
acquir'd in descending, like a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Body, which suffer it not to
turn from its Course; in the same
manner as Bodies thrown, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricd
in a Horizontal Line for some
space, while the Force continues.</p>
            <p>But the Reason why the Orifice
of the Pipe being straightned, the
Water presently leaps on high, and
runs down through the Slit, in my
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99636:26"/>
Opinion is this: That when the
lower parts of the Water are pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the upper (as the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> has made evident
in his Hydrostatical Paradoxes)
and are urged with Violence to
run out, the Passage being strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by applying the Finger to the
Mouth of the Pipe; some of the
Water when it cannot overcome
the Obstacle, seeks a Passage to it
self where it can: From whence
it comes to pass, that the less the
Water runs out at the Mouth of
the Pipe, with the greater Force
it runs out at these Holes. But
when the Pressure is abated, and
the Vessel is almost empty, none
runs out at the Mouth of the Pipe,
but what remains, runs slowly
through the Slit, being the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
way.</p>
            <p>From hence it appears, that the
direct Pressure must be estimated
by the weight of the Pillar of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99636:27"/>
whose Base is equal to the
Horizontal Surface it rests on, and
its Height equal to the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Depth of the Water. For
Example: In a Vessel constituted
in a Horizontal Plain, any part of
the bottom that can be assigned
may be a Base to a Pillar of water
of the same Height with the whole
water in the Vessel. And in the
foregoing Figure, when it flows
freely through the Pipe <hi>C D,</hi> 'tis
prest by a Pillar of water, which
has the same Base with the Orifice
of the Pipe <hi>CD;</hi> which Pillar of
water forces it self by a lateral
Pressure into the Pipe, and so to
run out; by the force of which
Pressure it comes to pass, that all
the water in the Vessel runs out
by this Imaginary Pillar. Many
things are said of this Pressure of
the water by Hydrostatical VVri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to wit, that the under parts
are prest by the upper, and the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99636:27"/>
upper parts are prest by those that
are under. Moreover, they are
prest side ways by one another;
which Diversity of Pressures they
endeavour to prove by several Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments;
and in effect, every
one may experience this lateral
pressure in himself, when he is
in the watery up to the Neck; for
he will feel a pressure on every side,
and some difficulty of Breathing,
which yet is not to be thought to
proceed only from the lateral pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the water, but another
Cause: For when the Expansion of
the Chest is necessary to Respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
'tis not so easily perform'd
in the water Element, as in the
Air, by reason of its Grossness:
For as Fishes need a greater force
for swimming, than Birds
for flying,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De motu A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim.</hi> P. 1. prop. 215.</note> as <hi>Borellus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates,
by reason of
the grosser Body of the
water, which must be moved out
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99636:28"/>
of its place, and circulate into that
left by the Fish: So a Man sunk
in the Water up to the Neck,
needs a greater force for opening
his Chest, than if he were in the
Air. And from hence it is, that
Inspiration in the Water is more
difficult than Expiration. <hi>This
happens only because the pressure is
unequal; for the pressure of the
Pillar of Air and Water on the
Chest without, exceeds the pressure of
the Pillar within the Chest, that is
only of Air, so much as the weight of
the Pillar of Water which covers the
Chest, exceeds the weight or pressure
of the Pillar of Air within the
Lungs, and of the same height with
the Water about the Chest; for Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids
press only according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
heights, and not the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Pillars, as is plain in
Syphons, in whose Legs, tho' of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
thickness, the Liquor rises but
to the same Horizonal Height.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99636:28"/>
Likewise all do agree, that not
only the bottom, but also the sides
of the Vessel are prest; which
pressure some say is considerable,
but others not. <hi>Tho. Cornelius</hi>
thinks it to be equal to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
Pressure: For supposing
the Water to press by inclin'd
Lines, and that a Body sliding
down by inclin'd Lines, acquires
as great a Velocity as if it fell
down by a Perpendicular, equal
to the height of the Plain, he
thinks the lateral Pressure to be
equal to the Perpendicular. On
the other Hand, <hi>Becher,</hi> in his
<hi>Physica Subterranea,</hi> says, That the
Water presses directly on the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
but far less on the sides;
which Conjecture he grounds on
this, That the little Ramparts of
Earth sustain the Pressure of the
Ocean it self, that it overflows
not the adjacent Fields; yea, he
endeavours to make it out by a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99636:29"/>
Mechanical Experiment, that the
Pressure of the Water is only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and downward.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Becher</hi> had considered that
Hydrostatical Axiom, <hi>viz.</hi> That Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids
press only according to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
Altitudes, he would not
have been frighted by the Extent of
the great Sea at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> from
owning so evident an Hydrostatical
Truth as this is, That the Lateral
Pressure of Fluids is equal to the
Perpendicular: For suppose the Banks
there to be Three Fathom, or Eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Feet, above the <hi>Harlem Meer,</hi>
and the adjacent Lands, which they
defend from the Inundation of the
Sea, and that the weight of every
Cubical Foot of Water is 76 <abbr>lb.</abbr>
9 ℥ ½, and 48 <hi>gr.</hi> this multiplied by
18 f. the Perpendicular Height will
amount to 1381 ½ <abbr>lb,</abbr> ℥ 1. g. 384.
which is the Weight or Lateral Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that lies on a Square Foot at
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99636:29"/>
the bottom, which a Rampart of
Earth, made strong for the purpose,
and 100 Foot thick, may be well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
able to support. 'Tis true,
this Computation is made for fresh
Water; but the addition of Salt in
the Sea-water, which is about 1 <abbr>lb</abbr> of
Salt to 41 <abbr>lb</abbr> of Water, will not so
much alter the Reckning.</p>
            <p>For my part, as I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the lateral pressure of the
VVater to be equal to the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular,
so I do not think it despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable;
for it may be shown, that
the lateral pressure is less than the
perpendicular, by taking notice of
this only, That there is a greater
Endeavour of the VVater to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
by a perpendicular Line than
an inclin'd one: But suppose that
some parts in the sides of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
suffer a pressure, equal to the
perpendicular pressure, as are these
which be at the bottom, and in
which those inclin'd ones would
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99636:30"/>
end, which have the same Depth
with the whole VVater; yet in
other parts the lateral pressure can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be admitted so great.</p>
            <p>The Author here seems like one
groping in the dark for the Truth,
and yet when he has got it between
his Hands he lets it slip: For he
supposes, that the Pressure by inclin'd
Lines is, at the bottom, equal to the
Pressure by Perpendicular Lines; yet
he will not own the same in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedial
parts. Indeed the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
by Inclin'd Lines in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medial
Parts is not equal to that
Perpendicular Pressure which is at
the bottom; but 'tis equal to that
perpendicular Pressure which is on the
same Horizontal Surface, which may
be made evident thus: Take a Glass
Tube, such as they use for Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes,
but open at both ends, <hi>a b;</hi>
stop the upper end a with your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and so immerse it into the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99636:30"/>
               <hi>e f g h,</hi> filled with Water to
<hi>m l,</hi> inclining, till it come to the
Horizontal Surface <hi>i k,</hi> and then
take your Finger off, the Water will
rise by the Pressure at the Orifice <hi>b,</hi>
till it has come to the Surface <hi>m l,</hi>
which is the same height it would
have come to if the Pipe had been
Perpendicular, as in <hi>c d.</hi> Farther,
Suppose a Pipe bended in the end at
the right Angles <hi>p q,</hi> immersed to
the same Surface <hi>i k,</hi> as before; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
taking away your Finger form <hi>p,</hi>
it will rise up as high as before, to
the Surface <hi>m l:</hi> Now 'tis evident
to any that considers the Figure of
the Pipe, that the Pressure at <hi>q</hi> is
Lateral, and as forcible as if it were
Perpendicular: This may be made
more pleasant to the Eye by putting
Oil into the Pipe, as the Honourable
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> shews in his <hi>Paradoxa
Hydrostatica,</hi> Paradox. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:99636:31"/>
And yet 'tis not to be thought
so little of as <hi>Becherus</hi> says: for
seeing the sides of Vessel are no
small hindrance to the Fluid that it
descends not, the Force which the
Fluid exerces on the sides cannot
be small.</p>
            <p>Seeing then, as was before said,
the parts of a Fluid are crowded
on one another, as if they were in
a Press, 'tis not without Reason
that Moderns from this do fetch a
Solution of that old, yet difficult,
Problem, which has wearied sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
VVits, VVhy a Diver, in the
bottom of the Sea, is not opprest
by the incumbent VVater. They
commonly say that it happens, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Diver is lifted up by the
water under him, and on the sides
the parts of his Body are prest with
the same force; neither can they
be driven inward, seeing all is full;
so that there is no fear of the Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of a Member, or painful
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99636:31"/>
Compression. Yet the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> thinks the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
is not answered enough; for
though by reason of the equal Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Ambient Fluid, there
follows no Luxation, yet there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
no Reason why there is no
Pain felt by the compression of the
Parts one against another. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the same Author recurs to
the strong Texture of the Animal,
which can resist the Pressure.</p>
            <p>It might be solv'd thus. There
is an Air lodged in the Pores of all
Animal Iuices, which two together
keep distended and full the Fibres,
which are tubulous, as Sir <hi>Edmund
King</hi> has very ingeniously discovered
long ago; and it is by the Pressure
of the Ambient Fluid (which is equal
on every side) that this Air being
forc'd into less Compass, the sides of
the Fibres come closer together, which
causes no more pain to the Fibres, than
the Bladder, (which yet is a very
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99636:32"/>
sensible part) suffers upon its being
contracted, when the Urine is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
            <p>If it were not Rashness to think
any thing can be added to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of so many most famous Men,
I would say, that seeing the Body
of a Living Man is specifically ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than VVater, tho' not much;
and therefore being more prest by
the Collateral VVater, according
to the Principle of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> the
Syphon in which the Diver is that
is less prest ought to be lifted up,
and therefore he ought to feel no
Pressure. But because the Diver
under water may be diversly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
either as he descends by a
perpendicular Line, or ascends by
it, or is moved by inclining Lines,
or as being fastned to the bottom,
and sticking on a Rock, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
immovable; in any of these
cases he cannot be subject to a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
Pressure. I have learned
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99636:32"/>
from a skilful Diver, that when a
Swimmer will descend perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
and go to the bottom in a
straight Posture, he drives the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upward with his Hands as with
Oars; and when he will rise again,
driving the water with his hands
towards the bottom, he returns
the same way. From whence it
comes to pass, that such as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
in Swimming, when they
strike the water contrary ways,
are stifled. It is worth the while
to enquire into the Reason of
these Effects, having never seen
them in any Author, tho' there
were need of a <hi>Delian</hi> Swimmer
here, as they say.</p>
            <p>I think then, that when a Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
drives the superincumbent
water with his hand upward, he
therefore descends; because such
a Syphon being so smitten is less
prest, and therefore is lifted up, the
other being deprest in which the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99636:33"/>
Swimmer is; just as in a Scale su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended,
and put in an Aequilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
if one of the Scales be hit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that will be lifted up, and
the other of necessity will descend.
Therefore the Body of the Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
being put in the Pillar that is
more prest, will of necessity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend;
but when at the same time
he does this with both hands, he
makes his Descent more easie.</p>
            <p>But when he will rise perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
and in a straight Posture
from the bottom, by striking the
water with his hands toward the
bottom, he makes that Syphon
more prest; and therefore the
Swimmer being plac'd in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
must of necessity ascend:
Just as when the Scale is put in
an Aequilibrium, if I hit the Scale
in the hollow part, that will be
deprest, and the other lifted up.
The same Reason holds, when he
ascends or descends by Lines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99636:33"/>
to the Horizon. Therefore
whether he ascend or descend, or
whatever way he move, he ought
to be under no dolorous Pressure,
how deep soever the Water be.
For seeing, according to the most
ingenious <hi>Borellus,</hi> Bodies do not
appear heavy but when they are
in rest; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> appears in an Example
given by him of two Sacks of
Wool, one of which being put on
the other, does not exerce its
weight, or press it, but when
'tis resting, and not when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Swimmer descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the Water perpendicularly,
ought not to suffer any Pressure in
the VVater descending with the
same Swiftness. But when he is
carry'd up by the same way, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by his Body he thrusts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the VVater lying upon him,
which he does not by his own
Strength, but by the help of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99636:34"/>
Collateral Syphon, and therefore
needs no help of his Muscles to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
the Resistance of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perincumbent
VVater; neither
ought he to have the sense of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
Pressure, to which the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the Ambient Fluid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in behind, does not a little
contribute, by not suffering any
part of the Body to be mov'd out
of its place. Upon the same Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he ought not to feel any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
Pressure, if he ascend or
descend by inclin'd Lines, or stick
without Motion to the bottom:
For the other Collateral Syphon
being more prest, does always
exerce its Force, and the subjacent
VVater lifts up the Diver, that is
specifically lighter than its self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>The Author here supposes the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be specifically lighter than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which I judge to proceed from
the Air inclosed in the Chest; for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99636:34"/>
when that is out, the Body sinks by its
own weight; and this gave perhaps
the first rise to Anatomists to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
whether a Child was Still-born,
or not; for if its Lungs do swim in
the Water, 'twas not Still born, but
has breathed the Air; but if they
sink, then they conclude the Child to
have been Still-born. As for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
rising or falling by the Motion
of his Hands, 'tis the same Case as in
an Oar, when the Blade of it moves
with greater force than the Water,
it makes resistance to the Oar, which
therefore not advancing, the Boat of
necessity must: So when a Man presses
the Water quickly downward, it makes
resistance to his Hands; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Water not giving way fast
enough, the Body must be thrust up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
just as in the Air, if a Man
between two Chairs did forcibly thrust
them down with his two Hands, he
must be lifted up, because they do not
give way. The Author says, the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99636:35"/>
Pressure is not felt when the Diver
is ascending or descending, because
the Water being in motion, does not
press upon the Body: But it might be
made manifest that it does; and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
makes it beyond Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they feel no Pressure when
the Water is at rest; and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
do own, that they feel a Pressure
rather in the going down in the
Diving-Bell, than afterward; as
the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> told me
be had communicated to him by the
Laird of <hi>Melgum,</hi> who practis'd
this way of Diving, in these Words;
<hi>The Compression of the Air being
such, as going down did hurt me;
but below, and staying there, was
as familiar to me as that above.</hi>

            <p>SEing then that it is clear enough
from what was said before,
that the flowing of these VVaters
toward the Sea, may consist with
their rising here, and in any place,
it seems to follow, that there is a
great subterraneous River under it,
from which these Fountains do
spring: And truly this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Opinion among us, which
yet I cannot assent to. I am not
ignorant, that there are some Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that hide their Head under
Ground, and after some time do
rise again. Some again there are
that never rise above Ground, as
it happens in the Veins of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99636:36"/>
some do appear in the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,

<hi>Seneca</hi> speaks very well. Nature
governs the Earth as it does our

it like our Bodies, that our

<hi>Pliny</hi> says, That the <hi>Nile</hi> is often
swallowed up in Gulphs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long time is spew'd up again.
They report the same of <hi>Niger,</hi> a
River of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which rising
out of the same Lake that the
<hi>Nile</hi> does, and running towards
the VVest, when it meets with a
Chain of Mountains, it finds hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ways; and appearing again
on the other side of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
discharges it self into the
<hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean. In like manner,
<hi>Tigris</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> being stopt
by the Mountain <hi>Cancasus,</hi> hides
it self under Ground, and is lost in
a great Cave; but afterward
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99636:36"/>

of <hi>Alphaeus,</hi> a River in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia,</hi>
whom the Poets feign to
pass a great way not only under
Ground, but also under the Sea
it self, and to rise again in the
Fountain called <hi>Arethusa:</hi> This is
known by the Offals of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
which being thrown down
the River, were, every fifth Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
at the time of the <hi>Olympiack</hi>
Games, cast up by this Fountain.
And also the Seas themselves are
thought to communicate by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Passages, as the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
with the <hi>Red</hi> Sea, and the

most Learned <hi>Kircher</hi> makes out
by good Conjectures.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Avril</hi> a Iesuit, in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
into <hi>Tartary,</hi> says, that 'tis more
probable that it discharges its self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulph, of which this
is his main Proof; That they who
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99636:37"/>
inhabit about the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulph, do
every Year at the end of <hi>Autumn</hi>
observe a vast quantity of Willow-Leaves:
Now, in regard this sort
of Tree is altogether unknown in the
Southerin part of <hi>Persia,</hi> which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
upon that Sea; and for that
quite the contrary, the Northern
part, which is bounded by the Sea of
<hi>Kilan,</hi> or the <hi>Caspian-Sea,</hi> has all
the Sea-Coasts of it shaded with these
Trees; we may assure our selves with
Probability enough, that these Leaves
are not carried from one end of the
Empire to the other, but only by the
Water that rowls them along thro'
the Caverns of the Earth. <hi>So far
Father</hi> Avril.</p>
            <p>Who further, for establishing
a Circulation of VVaters from
Pole to Pole, describes a great
VVhirlpool under the North
Pole, of which also <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi>
and <hi>Helmont</hi> have written, by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99636:37"/>
which a great quantity of VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is absonb'd, which falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bowels of the Earth, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
by the South Pole.</p>
            <p>Some say that this changes its
Course once in half a year, going in
at the South Pole, and coming out
again at the North.</p>
            <p>Tho' all this be true, supposing
also that within the Bowels of this
Earth there is exercised something
like an Animal O Economy; and
that one may, not without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
imagine divers Ebbings and
Flowings of VVaters, seeing, as
<hi>Seneca</hi> says, the whole Earth is not
folid, but hollow in a great many
parts; yet I cannot allow as some
do, that this is a great broad River,
from which these Fountains break
forth. This Opinion of a great
River has so firmly possest the
Minds of all Men, that if a little
Earth quake happen, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
are in great Foar lest the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99636:38"/>
Town, which otherwise is greatly
shaken with Earthquakes, should
be swallow'd in a moment of time;
imagining it to be plac't on the
arch'd Roof of a great River.</p>
            <p>I confess the Conjectures are not
slight, on which may be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Opinion of such a Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
River, which gives Water
to these Fountains; especially the
Noise of the VVaters in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Well before the Perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and the assurance Men
have, that in every place where
a Well is digg'd, Water will boil
up, casting up Sand, Pebbles, and
many other things; which seem
to evidence its being some great
River, or at least some great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle.
But one Reason, to wit,
the super-exceeding Greatness of
this imaginary River, which must
be admitted of Necessity, is of so
great weight, that it overturns all
Conjectures that would seem to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99636:38"/>
confirm the Opinion of so great a
River running under this Ground.
For <hi>Europe</hi> has no River so big as
this subterraneous River must be,
to which neither the <hi>Po,</hi> nor the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> nor the <hi>Danube,</hi> are to be
compared. 'Tis known well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
by what we have before
said, and all the Inhabitants are
convinced, that not only within
the Compass of the City, which
is a Mile in Diameter, in any place,
may be made a Fountain, which
will constantly send forth Water;
but also without the Town for
some Miles, without having any
regard to the Situation, such Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
may be made, but especially
by the <hi>Aemilian</hi> way; as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the River <hi>Scultenna</hi> a great
plenty of these Springs and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
is observ'd. Therefore the
breadth of this subterraneous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
(unless its Course were along
this way, in which case it would
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99636:39"/>
be extended 4 Miles) should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
6 or 7 Miles.</p>
            <p>But who can believe that under
this Plain, on which this City is
plac'd, a River of so great Extent
should continually flow, with so
great a weight lying upon it! I
will not deny, that from South to
North the Source is not so much
extended, seeing these Fountains
are not observ'd above 4 Miles;
which, whether it be for want of
Experience, or that this is truly its
Bounds, I dare not affirm. But
if we will suppose a subterraneous
River, which hath a Channel of
4 Miles, every one I think will
doubt it: Nor will he so easily
give Credit to this Opinion, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing this Arch that must
keep up so great a VVeight 68
Feet deep, is not of Flint or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice-stone,
but altogether made
up of Earth gathered by degrees.
Truly, if this Prodigy of Nature
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99636:39"/>
were situated in a Mountainous
Region, I should not be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
admitting the greatest Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
width. For if we take
notice of the Caves and Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Recesses which are fam'd in
Geographers, we shall find them
to be made amongst the Rocky
and steep Caverns of the Earth,
seeing Rocks and Stones are the
Bones and Strength of it. From

            <p>The most Learned <hi>Kircher</hi> does
very well explain the Cause of this
prodigious Increase, and how the
River keeps its VVaters free from
Saltness, even to its Mouth. For
he says, That a great abundance
of VVater is cast out from the
Bowels of a Mountain near a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
called <hi>St. Cantians,</hi> about 14
Miles distance from the Nine Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Timavus,</hi> and that there
'tis swallowed up by a manifest
Gulph, nor does it appear more:
He thinks therefore, that the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99636:41"/>
being swallow'd up by hidden
Channels, runs into the Sea; and
that therefore in the flowing of
the Sea; the Salt VVater drives
back the Fresh that meets it with
great Violence, as being of less
Force; and so this Subterraneous
River is stopt in its Course, which
not finding room to which it may
retire, breaks violently out at the
foremention'd Fountains in the
Mountain <hi>Timavus,</hi> communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the same Subterraneous
River.

Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea,
there appears so proportionate a
Vicissitude of Ebbing and Flowing

hence is the prodigious Increase of
the River <hi>Timavus.</hi> But when
the Sea ebbs, and gives leave to
that Subterraneous River to run,
<hi>Timavus</hi> also at the same time,
when that great Regurgitation of
the Water ceases, runs quietly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and with all his Sweetness,
into the <hi>Adriatick.</hi>

Neither <hi>Kircher</hi> nor <hi>Falloppius,</hi>
determine what Sea they suppose to
flow into these Cavities; for the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi>
does not rise high enough
to answer the case, seeing it flows but
a Foot at the most, which is in the
<hi>Adriatick;</hi> if they meant the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick,</hi>
which in some places is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to rise 9 Fathom, in many to
2 1/2, to 3 or 5; yet perhaps that will
not answer the case neither; for it
has a great way to come, before it can
come to reach the place; and when it
has swelled to the height there, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the Nine Mouths of <hi>Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
are in a Mountanous Countrey,
which may be justly supposed elevated
far above the Sea when at the highest,
this Solution of the <hi>Phenomen</hi> will
not hold. It seems to me more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
to explain it thus: I suppose
the Water comes from <hi>St. Cantians,</hi>
to run under Ground in a Canale <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which it fills quite (so that there is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99636:43"/>
no passage for the Air that way) till
it come to the Basin <hi>a b c,</hi> which it
fills so, as to overflow into the Sea
below, and that this Basin is not
much lower than the Mouth of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mavus;</hi>
for thus the Ascent of the
Water into these Nine Mouths will be
more easily procured. I suppose like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that this Basin <hi>a b c</hi> has another
Passage <hi>g h<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> by which the outer Air
communicates with the Water in this
Basin, and by which the Water in the
Flux of the Sea runs out at <hi>h;</hi> then
the Water that overflow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and fall
into the Sea when it is at the Ebb,
because the Air gets out at the Holes
below near the Surface; when the
Surface of the Sea <hi>k k k</hi> is elevated
by the Waters flowing into this lower
Basin through Subterraneous Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
and the Holes near its Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
(by which the Air got out before)
being now stopt, the Air is crowded
between the Surface <hi>k k k</hi> below, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99636:43"/>
that in the Basin, and thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> acquires
a greater Elasticity than the Air that
presses the Surface within the Pipe
<hi>g h;</hi> and therefore, according to the
Laws of Hydrostatisks, the Water
in that Pipe must ascend: Now if
the Sea flow two Eathom below, it
may raise the Waters in the Pipes
<hi>g h</hi> near as much, so that it may
run out at <hi>h.</hi> I think, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Springs and Lakes, such as
the Ingenious Mr. <hi>VValker</hi> told
me is reported to be found in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi>
on the top of a Hill, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, may be explained very
well after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Countrey-man</hi> Falloppius
<hi>gives a Reason of this surprizing
Phaenomenon of Nature, not much
differing from this, whose words
I thought fit to add here:</hi> But you
must note, that although the River
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd with Water, yet that
Water is fresh, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tis also when it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99636:44"/>
decreases; for 'tis always fresh; but
from whence does that come? You
must understand, that in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Carni</hi> there is a Castle called
<hi>St. Cantians,</hi> from whence rises a
great quantity of Water, which when
it has scarcely appear'd, is swallow'd
up by the Earth, and appears no more.
Now the Village of <hi>St. Cantians</hi> is
14 Miles distant from the River <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mavus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe therefore that the Water
flowing from the Mountain in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
is the Cause of the Increase of
<hi>Timavus;</hi> for I think that this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
flows plentifully by these Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Passages, which meeteth with
other secret Passages, by which the
Sea runs into the Mountain next to
the River; and that so there is a
Congress made, and dashing of the
Sea Water against the other, which
runs down from the Mountain far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off; and seeing the flowing of
the Sea is more forcible than the fresh
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99636:44"/>
Water, (for the Salt Water is more
gross than the fresh) it happens
that the fresh Water flowing from
the high Mountains, yields to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when it meets with it; from
whence it comes, that when in can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
run to the Sea, it recoils up to
the top of the Mountain; and from
hence 'tis, that all the Mountain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with Water, and the <hi>Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
increases and decreases.</p>
            <p>Such <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature
sporting it self, may be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
observ'd in the Mountainous
Countries than elsewhere, seeing
the Mountains, because of their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Texture, have empty Spaces
and Kettles, which serve not only
for Cisterns of Water, but also for
Receptacles of Fire, as in <hi>Sicily;</hi>
which therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls, full
of Caverns. So <hi>Virgil,</hi> describing
<hi>Aristaeus</hi> going down into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

            <p>There are many of these Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Rivers in this and other
Countries: There is one very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99636:45"/>
at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
which runs under the Church of St.
<hi>Sorine;</hi> and it seems under or near
a Pillar of that Church, in which
there is made a hole large enough to
put in ones Head, which has another,
hole at the bottom going down thro
the Pillar to the River, to which if
you apply your Ear, you may hear the
noise of the Water falling down, even
at the time when the Organs (which
make a great Noise) are playing:
There is upon the Right Hand a broad
pair of Stairs, with a great Arched
Gate, that take down to this Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
River, from which they force
Water into a Marble Cistern that
stands in the Church-yard covered
with another great Stone, yet open on
the sides, at which the ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
take up Water; believing, by the
Insinuation of the Crafty Priests,
that 'tis by the Gift of St. <hi>Sorin</hi> an
Excellent <hi>Collyrium</hi> for sore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Eyes
This Water as they force into the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99636:46"/>
Cistern by the Pipes laid under ground
on the Waxing of the Moon, so they
let it gradually out by other Pipes on
the Wane of the Moon; which makes
the People think that it depends on
the Course of the Moon. <hi>Populus
vult decipi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us hear <hi>Seneca,</hi> speaking to
the purpose; <hi>There are also under
the Earth less known Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but as sure; believe the same
to be below, that is above: There are
also great Caves, there are great
Vaults and wide Places formed by
the Mountains hanging over them.</hi>
Then although we must confess,
that in some places Rivers of great
bigness flow under the Earth, we
must not therefore believe that in
this great Plain on this side the <hi>Po,</hi>
there is so great a subterraneous
Cavity, and that Fields of so great
a largeness could stand without
Ruine for so long time. I must
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99636:46"/>
add moreover, that the Depth of
this River, in respect to its Breadth,
ought not to be small, because Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
builds all her Caves and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
Passages Archwise;
which all must have a Depth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the Breadth, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they lose their Force; and
commonly they are of a Circular
Figure, or coming near to it, <hi>i. e.</hi>
As deep as they are broad, which
in this case must be at least 4 Mile.<note place="margin">☜</note>
But this Cavity is of no Depth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
yea, but a few Feet, <hi>viz.</hi>
As much as the Auger had made
in boring: For passing an Iron
Rod throw the Hole, the bottom
is presently found, as I have often
try'd with others that have been
with me.</p>
            <p>Moreover, seeing the Diggers
in the very Terebration, often fall
on Stocks of Trees, as my self have
often observed; we must confess
therefore, that these Trees have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99636:47"/>
been before in open Air: And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the bottoms of these Wells
are often found Bones, Coals, and
Pieces of Iron, we are likewise
forc'd to believe, that People have
formerly liv'd on that Ground; or
we must think, that this great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
at that time had a Cover of 6
or 8 Foot, and that this our Plain
did afterwards grow higher, by
the daily Descent of Waters from
the <hi>Apennine,</hi> and the paring off
of the upper Ground. But the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mention'd Difficulties do still
occur.</p>
            <p>But let us suppose this great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
runs this way, and that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he has suffer'd a Bridge; from
whence, I pray, comes so great a
plenty of Water to fill this great
Cavity, which we must always
suppose to be full, to make the
Water rise up in the Wells? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to sustain the Royal Dignity
of the <hi>Po,</hi> scarcely so many Rivers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99636:47"/>
running into it from the <hi>Apennine</hi>
and the <hi>Alps</hi> are sufficient? And
on the other hand, we may affirm
that the <hi>Po</hi> comes far short of this
Subterraneous River. Lastly, If
this River must be 4 Miles broad,
I do not see why in all the Extent
of this Source, the Depth of the
Wells is always found the same;
for the Wells which are digg'd
near the sides of this great Arch,
would be deeper than those else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
But there is almost no
difference in the Depth of these
Wells. We cannot therefore give
way to the Vulgar Opinion of this
Subterraneous River, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Conjectures mentioned,
which we shall shortly Answer.
And far less must we believe, that
there are many Subterraneous
Streams flowing from the same
Cistern, and distinguish'd by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals,
which give Water conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to these Fountains. For how
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99636:48"/>
can it be, seeing there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands of Fountains, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
such Wells are made both
in the City and Suburbs, that the
Undertakers never fell upon such
Interstices in the boring? As I have
often told; and which one can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
admire enough, there is no
need of any Caution here; no
need of Diligence in choosing a
place, seeing any place markt out
either in the City or without, for
many Miles, is fit for the Building
of these Wells; and all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in digging these Wells, is
in keeping out the Side-waters,
which sometimes flow in in great
quantity, so that they need a Wall
of Bricks to keep it out: But
when the VVorkmen have come
to this last Bottom, then as having
got their wish, they begin their
Perforation with as great Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of getting VVater by their
Auger, as if they had <hi>Moses</hi> his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99636:48"/>
Rod. Neither is the Opinion of
some to be entertain'd, who think
that the subterraneous Spaces from
which these VVaters flow, were
formerly the Channels of <hi>Sculten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
and <hi>Gabellus,</hi> between which
two Rivers <hi>Modena</hi> is now plac'd;
which Rivers, as they imagine,
after they had descended from the
<hi>Apennine,</hi> did join their Waters in
this place; and therefore, through
length of Time, the Mountains de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
and the Fields rising, the
Water rises to this height in these
Wells when they are digg'd; or in
a hole made with Sand wet with
Water, which is supply'd from
these Rivers by hidden Passages;
And the Sand it self, that they
may give Credit to so plausible a
Thought, they give an Example;
for they say, That near a Stream,
a Hole being made in the Sand,
tho' dry on the Surface, the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
appears; which also by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99636:49"/>
of <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger, is
known to be done in the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore.
For after this Author,
with his accustomed Elegancy in
a Letter to <hi>Plin. Gallus,</hi> described
the Pleasantness of his Countrey-Village
by the Sea-side, in the end
of his Epistle he makes this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as worthy to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of: <hi>It has Wells, or rather
Fountains; for the Nature of all
that Shore is wonderful; in whatever
place you move the Ground, you meet
with Water; and that so fresh, as
not to have the least saltness from
the Vicinity of the Sea.</hi> By these
words the most Learned Man seems
to give some Specimen of our Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
seeing there also, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
place the Ground is digg'd,
there is Moisture: Yet 'tis ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd,
by the same <hi>Pliny</hi>'s words,
that the VVaters of these VVells
did not spring up. I believe the
same will happen in any Sea-Coast,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99636:49"/>
except some Bed of Clay intervene,
for the VVaters do easily follow
the Sand: Therefore 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that in any place of <hi>Pliny</hi>'s
Countrey-House the VVater ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
fresh, being strain'd through
the Sand from the nearest Sea, and
so depriv'd of its Saltness. But 'tis
no way probable, that the Case is
so in our Ground: For tho' I do
not deny that these Rivers did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
run in deeper Channels, yet
that that they give VVater to this
Spring, I can no ways be induc'd to
believe.<note place="margin">☜</note> For these Springs are
perpetual, neither do they know
any Increase or Decrease; when
yet these Rivers, not only in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but also sometimes in VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
have their Sands dry, as we
have seen of late Years, by reason
of the hot Season; seeing all the
VVells except these, tho' digg'd
deep, gave no VVater in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Countreys, to the great
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99636:50"/>
loss both of Men and Cattel. But
the flowing of a most pure VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from these Fountains is so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and constant, that 'tis impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
they should depend on the
unconstant and unequal state and
course of these Rivers; for the
VVater decreasing in the deeper
Veins, the Pressure would also
decrease, and so these Fountains
would be diminished. Moreover,
seeing the Countrey of <hi>Rhegium,
Parma,</hi> and all on this side the <hi>Po,</hi>
is plac'd in the same Plain; and
many Rivers descending from the
<hi>Apennine,</hi> glide over these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
I do not see, why they do
not enjoy the same Prerogative
when VVells are digg'd deep in
them. But no where that I know
of are such Fountains observ'd, so
everlasting, and subject to no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.
Therefore we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
judge the Cistern that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
VVater at the same rate to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99636:50"/>
this Source, to be perpetual, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
failing, and not temporary.</p>

            <p>THerefore having discuss'd the
Opinions which take most
among our Countrymen, of the
Nature of this hidden Source, it
may be thought fit that I should
now tell my own: But before I do
that, I think it worth while to
enquire, and as far as Conjecture
will allow to discover, what was
in those times the outward Face of
this Countrey which we inhabit;
seeing by the digging of these
VVells in the Land of <hi>Modena,</hi> 'tis
known enough, that the Situation
of this Countrey, which is called
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99636:51"/>
               <hi>Gallia Cispadana,</hi> and <hi>Transpadana,</hi>
was very low and deprest in old
times, in comparison of what 'tis
now. <hi>Plato,</hi> when he brings in
<hi>Critias</hi> speaking, writes, that there
are two things which bring great
and sudden Changes in the Earth,
and totally abolish the Monuments
of the most ancient Countreys.
The VVorld felt the first Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Universal Deluge, the
other being reserved against the
Day of Judgment, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

as <hi>Peter</hi> says,<note place="margin">Ep. 2.</note> when a <hi>New
Heaven,</hi> and a <hi>New Earth</hi> shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
'Tis most certain, that the
Face of the whole Earth was most
notably changed, in that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Drowning and Overturning
of all things. But some think that
such a Change follow'd, that the
state of the VVorld before the
Flood was quite different from
what 'twas afterwards, which yet
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99636:51"/>
I cannot assent to. There is lately
come from <hi>England</hi> a Book, whose

                  </gap>net.</hi> This
Learned Man endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
that the Earth before
the Deluge in its first Original, had
another Form than now it appears
to have; so that there were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Seas nor Isles, nor Mountains
nor Valleys, nor Rivers any where,
but the whole Body of the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
lodg'd in the Caverns of the
Earth. Now he feign'd such a
Face of the Earth, to the end that
it may be perceiv'd without the
Creation of new VVaters, from
what Store-house a quantity of
VVater may be drawn sufficient
to cover the Face of the Earth,
tho' it had Mountains, which we
must imagine to have been higher
by far than the present ones: So
that, according to his Reasoning,

Abyss of VVaters hid in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns

for that Universal Deluge.
But he thinks that the Mountains,
Valleys, Seas, Isles and Rocks,
might have appeared in that great
cleaving of the whole Body of the
Earth, pieces of it being broke off
here and there, and swallow'd up
in the great Gulph; while those,
which stood in their former state,
made a shew of Isles, Mountains,
and Rocks; but these which were
wholly covered by the VVaters,
had the Name of Sea and Lakes;
and so the Earth appeared after the
Deluge all broken, torn, and of a
quite different Aspect.</p>

pleasant Story, which he says <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Strozza</hi> had from Count <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazzar
Castillon,</hi> and he had from
a certain <hi>Abyssine</hi> Philosopher in
<hi>Spain.</hi> This wise <hi>Abyssinian</hi> did
say, That in the most ancient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> there is a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Destruction of Mankind,
and the breaking of the Earth:
That in the beginning of the
World the Earth was far bigger
than now 'tis, and nearer to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
perfectly round, without
Mountains and Valleys, yet all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernous
within like a Spunge, and
that Men dwelling in it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
a most pure <hi>Aether,</hi> did lead
a pleasant Life; and that the Earth
brought forth excellent Corn and
Fruits without Labour. But when,
after a long Flux of Ages, Men
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99636:53"/>
were puft up with Pride, and so
fell from their first Goodness, the
Gods in Anger did shake the Earth,
so that a great part of it fell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its own Caverns; and by this
means the Water, that before was
shut up in dark Holes, was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
squeez'd out, and so Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Lakes, Rivers, and the Sea
it self, took its Original: But that
Portion of the Earth, which did
not fall into these Caverns, but
stood higher than the rest, made
the Mountains: That the Isles and
Rocks in the midst of the Sea, are
nothing but Segments of the Earth
remaining after the sudden fall
of its Mass. I am willing, for the
satisfaction of the Curious, to give
the Author's own words, as more
tending to our purpose.</p>
            <q>
               <p>In the first Ages, said the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Old Man, after the last
Renovation of the VVorld, the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99636:53"/>
Earth we dwell on was not of
that Form, nor so little as 'tis at
present, but far greater, and of
a perfect roundness; because
then it did take up as much place,
as it now takes up with the whole
VVater and Air together: So
that between it and Heaven there
was not any thing interpos'd, but
a most pure Fire, which is called
<hi>Aether,</hi> being of a most pure and
vital Heat. The Earth then was
of so large an Extent, and so
near to Heaven. But within, and
in the Surface, 'twas very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernous,
within which were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the Elements of Air and
VVater; and towards the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was scattered a Fire, to warm
the places remotest from Heaven,
and therefore obscure and cold.
Because the other Caverns near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Surface of the Earth were
illuminated from Heaven by the
Openings above, and by its
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99636:54"/>
VVarmth filled with Life; and
all these Caverns were inhabited
by Men, and other Animals, for
the use of which the VVater
and Air were scattered over the
Caverns. The Earth then was
like a Spunge, and Men dwelt
within it; their Life was very
happy, and without any Evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was not among Men
either War or Sedition. Nor did
they live inclos'd in Cities, as they
do now, for fear of wild Beasts and
other Men; but they liv'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously,
and the Earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
its Fruits for their Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without any Labour of theirs.
Further, the Mildness of the Air
and <hi>Aether</hi> were so great, that
the Seasons did not vary as they
do now: And knowing then the
Truth and the Vertues of all
things, they found they were
good; they knew also the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the Stars, their Senses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99636:54"/>
nourished in a most pure <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
from whence they had the
Knowledge of things Celestial
and Elemental. 'Tis come to our
Knowledge, that in the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Annals of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> among
many others, were found <hi>Aegypt,
Aethiopia, Persia, Assyria,</hi> and
<hi>Thracia.</hi> Now hearken, O Count,
says the <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> attentively,
what occasioned the Fall of the
Earth, and the Ruine of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
The Men of <hi>Assyria</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things, and by means of
their VVisdom doing VVon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
were well pleased with it;
from this Self conceit grew in
them a great Love of themselves;
by which the Flower of their
VVisdom being darkned by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
they waxed proud, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to think themselves Gods,
and to compare themselves to
<hi>Saturn,</hi> that then had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the VVorld; who,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99636:55"/>
as he is slow to Anger, and ripe
in Counsel, was not at all moved
at the first: But when their Pride
increas'd, he in Anger depriv'd
them of the Influxes of his Mind;
from which Privation there
grew in them Ignorance, from
which flow Pride and Insolence;
and they began to seek how to
get up into Heaven, and dethrone
him: which when <hi>Saturn</hi> saw,
being in his great VVisdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to defile his Hands with
Humane Blood, of himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
the Government, and gave
it into the Hand of <hi>Iupiter</hi> his
Son; who, after he had taken
on him the Government of the
VVorld, being born to Action,
made a League with his Brother
<hi>Pluto,</hi> who Reign'd in the Roots
of the VVorld toward the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
The one began to shake it
terribly below, and the other to
thunder upon it from above, with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99636:55"/>
which terrible shaking and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
the Earth open'd in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places, and broke, so that it
fell into its own Caverns, which
by that were raised and filled up.
From whence it came to pass,
that it both became less, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
further off from Heaven,
and was buryed in its self, with
all the things contained in it.
And the Elements which stood
highest, were, by its weight and
restriction, squeez'd out, the
lighter and purer did fly higher,
and drew nigher to Heaven;
but of them which were shut up
in the Ruins, and were before
lodg'd in the Caverns, part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
below, and part chang'd
their place. And it came to pass,
that where the great Bulk of
Earth fell, and could not be
swallowed up of the Caverns, it
remained on high, and afterwards
being prest hard together by its
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99636:56"/>
own weight, and condens'd by
the Cold, because of its distance
from Heaven, became Mountains
and Rocks; and where in the fall
great pieces of thick Earth were
swallowed up, the VVaters were
by this discovered, from whence
came Seas and Lakes, Rivers and
Fountains, great and little Isles,
and Rocks scattered up and down
the wide Sea. The Gold, the
Silver, and other Metals, which
in the beginning had been most
fair and precious Trees, were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Ruins. But there
are some Remains of the Seeds
shak'd off at that time, which
now are digg'd with so great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
being neither so pure, nor
of great Vertue, as formerly:
And the Diamonds, Carbuncles,
Rubies, Emeralds and Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liths,
Saphires, Topazes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jewels, which be now found,
are the thickning of the Rocks of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99636:56"/>
the first Age; and they are, in
memory of these first times, to
this day had in great Esteem,
admir'd and reverenced as the
most ancient things. The Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyres,
the Alabasters, Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
and other fair Marbles of
different Colours, are no other
than some Particles of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Earth, which was nearest to
Heaven, and in the Fall were
thickned, and united, either by
their own Weight, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or by Cold: From whence
'tis, that by the Searchers after
Metals and Marble, there have
been found many both Sea and
Land Animals, turn'd into Stone
and Volatils; yea, many times
Mens Bodies that have been all
taken hence, inclos'd in their first
shape in most solid Stone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any opening. And from hence
'tis, that there are seen so many
thousands of Fishes, Oysters, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99636:57"/>
Cockles congealed, and Figure
of divers Animals; which some

long, and their Childrens
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99636:57"/>
There was also among Men a
Stupidity, which made them ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of all things, and was the
Effect of the first Astonishment
after the Fall of their first Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and yet if they seem'd to
know any thing, they saw it
through a thick Cloud. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
since the Fall, if a Man had
the Truth revealed to him by
chance, Fear made him keep it
secret; for in all remain'd a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
the Knowledge of Truth
being the occasion of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
Pride, and that of their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.
For if any had the Boldness
to discover it, he darkned it a
thousand ways, for fear of being
reproved, and severely punisht
by another. For this Reason the
Sciences have been taught in
dark Sayings, in Fables, in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and Numbers, in Sacred
Rites, and in a thousand other
hidden ways. And from thence
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99636:58"/>
'tis belike, that Princes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who would be powerful
in the Earth, have chosen to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Opinion of the common
People, and have persecuted with
all Rigour those that would tell
the Truth. Fear therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
possessed all Men, by which
they were disperst, such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
began to join themselves
together, and to beget Children,
to help them and defend them;
they encompast themselves with
Fences and Ditches, in which time
they reverenc'd and perform'd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Aged. After this
as the number of their Posterity
increas'd, and the Ties of Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
decreas'd, they divided their
Goods that were hitherto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and so parted Friendship.
After which all things went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Confusion, every one robbing,
cheating, and killing another, and
inventing new Tricks to defraud
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99636:58"/>
his Neighbour: From this, as
Boldness grew in those that were
of fiercer Spirits, and more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
to hurt, others became
more fearful; which Fear sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their Wit, so that consulting
together, they found out the
Name of Peace and Justice. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
they contrived a long
Chain of Words, with which
tying Justice and Peace by the
Feet, by the Arms, by the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and by the Neck, in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
ways, they thought to keep
her, that she should not depart
from their State, committing the
keeping of these Chains, which
they call'd <hi>Laws,</hi> into the Hands
of wary Men, and of their own
Temper, which they called Judges
and Magistrates.</p>
               <p>By these Artifices did the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
secure their Lives and
Goods from the Injuries of the
more powerful; till at length
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99636:59"/>
one that was bolder than the rest,
associating himself with the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and weak, became their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.
These also were thrust
from their place. After this rate
have the Societies of Men been
managed hitherto, and so they
are at present, and will be for
the time to come. When the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
join'd themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there arose Counsellors;
and when they were called into
Judgment, there arose Judges.
This now, Noble Sir, is the great
History which the wise <hi>Abyssinian</hi>
told the Count, worthy to be
had in great Veneration, and
highly to be esteem'd.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Helmont <hi>seems to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
an Opinion about the Face
of the Earth before the Deluge, not
unlike to this; his Words are
these:</hi> From whence I conceive the
Earth to have been in one piece, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99636:59"/>
undivided; for asmuch as 'twas be-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
with one Fountain; and lastly,
to have had no Isles, but the whole
Globe was Sea on one side, and
Earth on the other. This was the
Face of the World before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
after which the Earth did open
into several shapes, and out of the
Abyss of these Chinks did the Waters
break out.</p>
            <p>But let us leave the Opinion, no
less disagreeing with the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Sacred Scriptures,
than with Nature it self. <hi>Scaliger</hi>
speaking of the Asserters of that
Opinion, about the Generation of
the Mountains, says, <hi>That they pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
dote, who have told, that the
Earth was pulled out of, and sav'd
from the Deluge.</hi> Yet 'tis certain,
that the Earth in that Universal
Deluge did not suffer an ordinary
Change, so that the Fortune of
things being changed, <hi>Thetis</hi> and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99636:60"/>
               <hi>Vesta</hi> chang'd their places; from
whence <hi>Ovid</hi> says,
<q>
                  <l>Quodque fuit campus, vallem decursus
aquarum</l>
                  <l>Fecit, &amp; eluvie mons est deductus in
aequor,</l>
                  <l>E'que paludosa siccis humus aret are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In English thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <l>Torrents have made a Valley of a
Plain,</l>
                  <l>High Hills by Deluges born to the
Main;</l>
                  <l>Steep standing Lakes suckt dry by
thirsty Sand,</l>
                  <l>And on late thirsty Earth now Lakes
do stand.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I believe it has not happened o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to this Countrey of ours:
For I conceive, that in the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World, all this
Plain, than which <hi>Italy</hi> has not a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99636:60"/>
greater, and which the <hi>Po</hi> does
now divide into <hi>Gallia Cispadana,</hi>
and <hi>Transpadana,</hi> was once a Sea,
and a part of the <hi>Adriatick.</hi> So
in the Universal Deluge, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
being par'd off, and bar'd,
so that they lookt like Bodies exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
by a Disease, as <hi>Plato</hi> wrote
of the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Island; we have
reason to think that this Bay of
the Sea was filled with Sand, and
so became a Valley; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
in process of time, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Descent of Waters from the

<hi>Nile</hi> is derived from <hi>Limus,</hi> Slime)
which he likewise says of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
about <hi>Ilium, Teuthrania,</hi> and
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> to wit, that they were
sometime a part of the Sea: Yea,
the same <hi>Herodot</hi> hath left it in

Course into the <hi>Arabick</hi> Gulph,
it would at length cover
it all with Slime.<note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Polybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
says, that the Lake <hi>Maeotis</hi> and
the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea are constantly fill'd
with plenty of Sand, which great
Rivers do continually bring into
it, and that the time would be
when they should be made even
with the Continent; taking an
Argument from the Taste of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99636:61"/>
Water, <hi>viz.</hi> That as <hi>Maeotis</hi> is
sweeter than the <hi>Pontick,</hi> so the
<hi>Pontick</hi> is sweeter than the <hi>Euxine.</hi>
Modern Writers think no less of
the great and plain Countreys, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom is the most Learned
<hi>Kircher,</hi> who in his <hi>Mundus Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneus,</hi>
says, from the <hi>Arabick</hi>
Antiquities, and other Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
That the great Plain, which
lies between the <hi>Arabick</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Gulph, before the common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
was covered with Sea-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
And he also thinks, That
the Sandy Desarts of <hi>Tartary</hi> were
formerly the place of Waters, and
all one with the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and
afterwards in length of time to
have been rais'd to a greater height,
and turned into great Fields. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
need we to go so far off for
Examples. We understand by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
that <hi>Ravenna,</hi> as well as
<hi>Venice,</hi> was plac'd in the Sea; but
seeing now 'tis 5 Miles from the

Sea, no body knows how much
Land has accrew'd to it by the

worthy of Wonder, that where

               <hi>Aemilian</hi> Way (in the

his most Learned Book against <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
Mengolus</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> shews,
by strong Reasons and Authorities,
that no River from <hi>Splacentia</hi> to
the Coast of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea,
did come into the Channel of the
<hi>Po,</hi> but that they all discharged
themselves into this <hi>Padusa;</hi> for
which he brings the Authority of
<hi>Strabo,</hi> who writes, That this Lake
was a great Hindrance to <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
when he would have pass'd
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99636:63"/>
his Army into <hi>Etruria;</hi> which Lake
being not long after, by the Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of <hi>M. Scaurus</hi> the Surveyor,
dried up, was turned into most
fruitful Fields, many Rivers being
brought within their own Banks
to enter into the <hi>Po,</hi> as <hi>Tarus, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
Entia, Gabellus, Scultenna,</hi> the
<hi>Rheine,</hi> and other Rivers of no
small Note. Upon this account
we may reasonably think, that
the <hi>Po</hi> was not so famous of old,
nor had the Name of <hi>Royal,</hi> till
by the Accession of so many Rivers
he had enlarg'd his Power. And
therefore <hi>Herodot,</hi> a most ancient
Writer, deny'd that there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
River found, called <hi>Eridanus;</hi>
which was no small matter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
to <hi>Pliny,</hi> that when <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodot</hi>
wrote his History at <hi>Thuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> he knew no River by
the Name of <hi>Eridanus.</hi> But seeing
<hi>Herodot,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> relates, made
his History 310 Years after the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99636:64"/>
founding of <hi>Rome,</hi> we may thence
conjecture, That the <hi>Po</hi> did at
that time run with less Glory, and
in a straiter Channel; or that the
Historian spoke of another River.</p>
            <p>There is distinct enough menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made of this Lake in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<hi>Iohan. de Argenta,</hi> and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in <hi>Leander Albertus</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of <hi>Italy,</hi> who measures
the Length of this Lake from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
by <hi>Ravenna,</hi> even to <hi>Sculten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and tells all the Rivers which
within this space descended from
the Mountains into this Lake, and
there ended their Course; and
that <hi>Hercules,</hi> the first Duke of
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> suffered the <hi>Bononians</hi> to
bring the <hi>Rheine</hi> within his Banks,
that so he might enter into the <hi>Po;</hi>
by which it came to pass, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Valleys of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and also
<hi>Bononia,</hi> were turned into most
fruitful Lands. But when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>Rheine</hi> had broke over
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99636:64"/>
his Banks in the time of <hi>Hercules</hi>
the Second, when the Fields were
again turn'd into Water, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Contentions arose among the
<hi>Bononians</hi> and <hi>Ferrarians;</hi> at length
the same Prince granted, that the
<hi>Rheine</hi> might be again brought
into the <hi>Po.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we must observe,
that the Situation of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
in which <hi>Modena</hi> is now
plac'd, was very low, seeing this
Countrey border'd upon <hi>Padusa,</hi>
into which so many Rivers did
run; of the lowness of which
Rushes, Coals, Bones, Stocks of
Trees, found in the Depths of 63
Feet, are most sure Proofs; all
which make it evident, that this
Ground was sometime exposed to
the Air, and that it had no other
Aspect than now the Valleys of
<hi>Como</hi> have.</p>
            <p>Therefore 'tis not without cause,
that <hi>Cluverius,</hi> in his Description
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99636:65"/>
of <hi>Italy,</hi> thinks a certain place o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> deserves amendment. For
<hi>Pliny,</hi> when he had described cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Islands floating in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
like the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> as in the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuban</hi>
Lands, the <hi>Reatine,</hi> the Lake
of <hi>Vadimon,</hi> writes, that the same
is observ'd in the Land of <hi>Modena.</hi>
But <hi>Cluverius</hi> for <hi>Matiensis</hi> plac'd
<hi>Mutinensis;</hi> forasmuch as one may
see such floating Islands made of
Slime and Reeds in the Valleys of
<hi>Como.</hi> Yet 'tis out of all question,
that the Situation of this Town, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the adjacent Lands,
in the space of 1800 Years, has
grown 14 Foot; for in this Depth
Causways of Flint, and Shops of
Artificers are found by digging,
which certainly then was the Plain
of the Town, when the Colony
of the <hi>Romans</hi> was brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Further, when I was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this, there was found a Piece
of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperours Coin, of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99636:65"/>
               <hi>Corinthian</hi> Brass, in the Depth of
18 Feet.</p>
            <p>History testifies, that <hi>Mantuae</hi> at
that time was not far from the
Marshes; for <hi>Appianus Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
tells us, that <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi>
and <hi>Pansa,</hi> in the Siege of <hi>Mutina,</hi>
did fight amongst the Fenns, and
in Grounds overgrown with Reeds;
and afterwards near <hi>Mutina,</hi> in a
little Isle of the River <hi>Labinius,</hi>
(when at that time the Land of
<hi>Modena</hi> was extended so far) the
<hi>Triumviri</hi> met, and establisht that
horrible Banishment of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen;
when yet in this our Age
there are no Vestigies either of
Fenns or Islands, only most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Fields are to be seen. So that
with the Prince of Poets we may
cry out,
<q>
                  <l>Tantum aevi long inqua valet mutare
vetustas.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:99636:66"/>
Such wondrous Changes great length
of time does bring.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this growing up of the
Ground, which is observ'd by the
great Depth of these Wells, (I do
not speak of the deeper parts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Humane Industry cannot
reach) was but slowly made, and
by Slices, as it were, through
length of time, as the several Lays
of Earth do witness, which are
observed in all Wells constantly in
an equal Order and Distances
when they are digged; so that
this growing up of the Ground so
well distinguish'd, and so remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the digging of all Wells,
ought to be thought rather the
Product of so many Ages, than
the tumultuary and confus'd
Work of the common Deluge.</p>
            <p>This doubtless then was the Face
of the Countrey on this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99636:66"/>
side of the <hi>Po,</hi> which being
formerly covered with Waters, and
not habitable, now is remarkable
for its Largeness, and the Fertility
of its Fields, and has in it many
Towns and Cities: For if we turn
over old Authors, we shall find no
mention made of Towns or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
below <hi>Brixillus</hi> and <hi>Cremona,</hi>
near the <hi>Po,</hi> even to the <hi>Adriatick;</hi>
but as many as were, and yet are
in the Region on this side the <hi>Po,</hi>
were built either near the Roots of
the <hi>Apennine,</hi> or not far from them,
as <hi>Bononia, Modena, Regium, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
&amp;c. But we may infer, both
from what was said before, and
also from the little that this Sandy
Bed, through which these Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Waters do run, wants of
being in the same Level with the
Sea, that the Sea did cover this
Countrey in the beginning of the
World. For if, according to the
Observation of <hi>Aleottus de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genta,</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:99636:67"/>
a most diligent Hydrogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
whom we before cited, the
<hi>Rheine,</hi> from the Foot of the Hills
near <hi>Bononia</hi> to the <hi>Po,</hi> into which
it does now no more run, has a
Declivity of 123 Feet, 7 Inches;
and the <hi>Po</hi> from thence to the Sea
has a Descent of 15 Foot 7 Inches;
and therefore the whole Declivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Rheine,</hi> and perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Height to the Sea-shore, will be
139 Foot, omitting the smaller
measures, the Plain out of which
these Fountains spring, and that
<hi>Mutina</hi> stands on (which is distant
about 10 Mile from the Roots of
the Mountains) will differ no more
than 20 or 40 Foot from the Level
of the Sea, as one may conjecture,
seeing I have not leisure to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
these matters exactly, nor is
it any great matter: But if we
might dig further down, other
Beds would doubtless appear, till
we meet at last with the Plain,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99636:67"/>
which was formerly the bottom of
the Sea. But 'tis better to search
into other things, and to get out
of these profound Abysses, if we
can go no further.</p>

            <p>AS in the Works of Art, 'tis
not so safe from the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Effects which fall under
our Eye, nor without fear of a
Mistake, to infer the same Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Mechanical Parts; as may
be seen by the Example of two
VVatches, which tho' they have
the same outward Form, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
perform the same Operations
as to time, yet may have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Structure quite different; so
'tis less safe to make the same
Judgments of the curious VVorks
of Nature, and to determine what
Instruments it uses, and what is
its ways of working: VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis much, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> says,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99636:68"/>
if things obscure and hid to our
Senses be explained by Possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Seeing I am come so far,
that I must at length tell what I
think of the Nature of this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Spring, I believe I have done
the part of a good Guesser, if by
sounding this Ford, I can tell things
probable and agreeable to the
Laws of Nature, instead of things
certain.</p>
            <p>VVe may therefore conjecture,
that the Sea in this our Countrey
had secret Commerce with the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennine,</hi>
to which it was adjacent
in the beginning of the World, and
that it still has; and that it laid a
Foundation by several subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Passages in its Bowels for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Storehouses of Waters, of which
this may be believed to be one,
from whence these Fountains de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
their Original, and that the
Water is expanded over all this
Vein of Sand, in which such a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99636:69"/>
Spring is discovered: But when
the Stop is taken away, and the
Flood-gates are opened, it rises on
high as in Aqueducts. And this
Thought of mine, as it does not
contradict Nature, so it shuns
those Difficulties, which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
Opinion of an Immense
Space, through which a subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
River flows, does incur.
That a great abundance of VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
may secretly flow a long way,
through Sand, is neither against
Reason nor Experience, seeing 'tis
the Property of Sand easily to
drink up VVater, and therefore
has the Name of Sinking Sand.
<hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> say,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. Hist. Nat. c. 9. c. 35.</note>
that the <hi>Nile,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Rivers, being
swallowed up in the Sands, runs
hid a great way, tho' nothing of
that is known in our
Times.<note place="margin">Lib. 3 Quaest. Nat. c. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Seneca</hi> also te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies,
that some Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99636:69"/>
fall into Caves, some are by
degrees consumed, and never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
again. The most Learned
<hi>Kircher</hi> says, that in <hi>Westphalia,</hi>
near the Village <hi>Altembechem,</hi> there
is a certain sandy Plain, in which
every Day the Water breaks out
with great Violence, so as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
the whole Countrey, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
sinking into the Sand,
disappears, the Surface of the Sand
remaining dry. The River <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> as some relate who
have observ'd it, when it has
come to a certain Plain, is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
swallowed up, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
noise of the Earth; which is
a most certain Proof, that this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
does not fall into a Gulph, but
runs away by these Beds of Sand.
In like manner I do believe, that
the VVater descends by secret Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
from a Cistern in the Roots
of the adjacent Mountains, that
communicates with the Sea, till it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99636:70"/>
come into this deep sandy Plain,
mixt with much Gravel; so that
there is no need to conceive any
Plain of great width and depth,
by which these subterraneous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
may constantly run down, but
a few intersperst spaces may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
because of the Mixture of
Sand and Gravel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Helmont</hi> says, that Sand is Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Earth, and the Seat of the
VVaters, but that the rest of the
Earth is the Fruit of this Original
Earth, and that not without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
seeing the reducing of this
Sand into VVater is more difficult
than of any other Body. This same
Author makes this Sand the last
Bounds of digging, beyond which
to proceed were lost Labour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the continual Conflux of
Sand and VVater. But he thinks
that this Sand is extended from
the Shell of the Earth to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and abundance of Water lodges
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99636:70"/>
in it; so that the Water which is
kept in it is a thousand times big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than what is in the whole O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean.
All Seas, Rivers and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
even in the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
owe their Original to this
invisible Ocean, so that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
does every where follow the
vital Sand. <hi>Telesus</hi> seems to have
been of the same Judgment, who
said, the bottom of the Sea was a
Fountain of that Interiour Ocean,
which agrees with that Opinion
of <hi>Plato</hi> concerning the Gulph,
from whose Bosom all Waters go
out, and into which they all fall
back again.</p>
            <p>Whatever be of Truth in this
Opinion, of an Invisible Ocean lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the Sand, which <hi>Helmont</hi>
conceiv'd ingeniously, and upon
probable enough Arguments; yet
I think none will deny, but Water
may run a long way through Beds
of Sand; and when some Passage
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99636:71"/>
is open, may be rais'd again, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if it be urg'd by Water de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
from a higher Ground.
And I think that 'tis probable the
matter is so in our Fountains, to
wit, the Water flows out of some
Cistern plac'd in the neighbouring
Mountains, by subterraneous Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
where the Earth is firm and
hard; but when it has come into
the Plain, it expatiates far over
the Sand, and in the way is lifted
up to this height when a Hole is
made with an Auger, according
to the Laws of Hydrostaticks.</p>
            <p>And I think this is a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious
and easie way of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Nature of this never-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough-admired
Spring, than to
imagine a great Vault, (of which
there are no Marks) and a Town
with a whole Countrey hanging
over it.</p>
            <p>To give some Specimen how
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his flowing of the Water may
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99636:71"/>
be according to my Explication:
Suppose, as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. that there
is a Cistern in the Bowels of the
<hi>Apennine,</hi> drawing Water from the
Sea, and that the Water is carry'd
by subterraneous Pipes from the
same Cistern, and spread over this
deep and sandy Plain <hi>A B C,</hi> mixt
with much Gravel; which sandy
Plain being brought into much
lesser Bounds, the Water is forc'd
to run down by a more narrow
space than it had in the beginning,
and to follow its Course till it
come into the Sea, or some great
Gulph. Therefore Wells <hi>EFGH</hi>
being digg'd, without any Choice
in all the Tract lying upon this
Spring, and a Hole being made by
the Auger, the Water of necessity
must be lifted up on high, being
forc't by another, which descending
from a higher Ground, presses on
that which goes before, and drives
it up. By this means these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99636:72"/>
receive a plentiful Supply
from their Father <hi>Apennine,</hi> as
does the Well of Waters which
flows from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> of which
there is mention in the
Sacred History.</p>
            <p>But 'tis,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.</note> by far, more probable,
that the Water is sent from the Sea
into such a Cistern, than from
Showers, or melted Snows, seeing
Rain and Snow-waters run away
for the most part by Rivers above
Ground; neither can they enter
into the ground so deep;
as <hi>Seneca</hi> also testifies,<note place="margin">L. 3. Quae. Nat. c. 7.</note>
That there is no Rain
so great, which wets the ground
above Ten Foot: For as he says,
when the Earth is glutted, if any
more fall, it shuts it out. And
truly, how could it come to pass,
that they should flow at the same
rate as well in moist as in dry Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
if the Rain-Water came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and they did not rather get
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99636:72"/>
their VVaters from the Sea, which
being strained through the Sand,
and deprived of all Salt, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Sea again with Interest.
Truly, I could never yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
how that secret Cistern,
from which VVaters are sent to
these Fountains, should not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant,
if they received Moisture
for a time from the Rains and
Snows; and sometimes increase,
sometimes decrease; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
according to the Increase and
Decrease of the Pressure, some Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
should appear in these
Fountains.</p>
            <p>But the Beds of Clay, which
divide the impure from the most
pure VVaters, as most strong Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
do hinder the Rain VVaters
from being mix'd with these sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
VVaters. And
<hi>Plato</hi> thought,<note place="margin">De Leg. Dial. 8.</note> that a
clayie Ground was the last
Bounds of digging in the search
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99636:73"/>
of VVell-waters, obliging every
one to dig to the Chalk; and if
there was no VVater found in
that Depth, he suffer'd as much to
be taken from the Neighbours as
they had need of, to which <hi>Pliny</hi>
subscribes, saying, <hi>That when Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Clay appears, there is no more
hopes of getting Water, nor need
Men dig longer;</hi> which yet agrees
not with what is observed here.</p>
            <p>As I have deduc'd the Original
of this VVater from the Sea, so
I do not deny, that many Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
owe their Originals to Rains
and melted Snow; yet with this
difference, that the Fountains
which have their Spring from the
Sea by hidden Passages continue
perpetual, but those which rise
from Showers and temporary
Springs at some time of the year,
are diminished, and quite dry up;
as happens in great Droughts;
such as <hi>Baccius</hi> mentions to have
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99636:73"/>
been <hi>Anno</hi> 1556. in which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all the Fountains, but also great
Rivers dried up. The Countrey
on this and the other side of the
<hi>Po</hi> did experience such a Season al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
for two Years together, <hi>viz.</hi>
in 1687. and 88 in which time the
Lands were unpleasant because of
the Drought, and VVells were
digg'd in other places, but to no
purpose; yet little alteration was
to be observed in these our Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
nor yet in the moistest Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of all; which made the Year
1690. fatal for Dearness of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
and Epidemick Diseases;
so that these our Fountains seem
to be of the same nature with that
Fountain in <hi>Tyanus,</hi> consecrated to
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> of which <hi>Philostratus</hi> says,
<hi>That it suffer'd neither Increase nor
Decrease;</hi> and therefore by the
Natives is called <hi>Vnquenchable.</hi> Or
like the VVell of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> which
as <hi>Aelius Aristides,</hi> a most famous
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99636:74"/>
Orator, relates, was a VVell of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi>
a City of <hi>Asia,</hi> of such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it was always full to the
brim; and how much soever was
drawn from it, it never decreas'd.</p>
            <p>Neither have we Reason only
to think, that many Fountains
take their Original from the Sea,
but also many Lakes communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with it. The Lake of the
<hi>Vulsinians,</hi> whose Depth is not yet
found out, for discovering of which
I have seen between <hi>Narthana</hi> and
<hi>Bisentina</hi> Ropes let down for some
Hundreds of Fathoms, but in vain.
This Lake, I say, both Summer
and VVinter, discharges it self by
the River <hi>Martha</hi> perpetnally into
the <hi>Tyrrhenian Sea,</hi> neither does it
receive any Rivers, and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
which encompass it are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
white with Snow. Beside, in
the same Lake, when the Air was
very calm, and the surface of the
VVater was smooth, I observed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99636:74"/>
often intestine Motions like Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in the Ocean, which was
known by the Fishermens Nets,
which being sunk under Water,
were snatcht violently from their
hands; an evident Proof of some
hidden Commerce with the Sea.
<hi>Iulius Obsequens,</hi> in his Book of
Prodigies, relates, That the Lake
<hi>Albinus,</hi> in the Consulate of <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
and <hi>M. Valerius,</hi> was sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
raised up, when no Rain fell
from Heaven, neither could there
be known any Cause of so sudden
a swelling. I cannot be ignorant
that the Original of Fountains and
Rivers from the Sea is called in
question. <hi>Gaspar Bartholinus,</hi> who
follows the glorious Footsteps of
his Ancestors, Printed a Treatise
at <hi>Hafnia,</hi> wherein he endeavours
to prove that Opinion to be absurd,
which deduces the Original of
Fountains and Rivers from the
Sea; so that all Fountains, as well
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99636:75"/>
temporary as perpetual, according
to him, owe their Original to Rain.
Suppose, as he ingeniously endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to prove, that for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Perpetuity of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in a dry Season, a Collection
of the Water of the precedent
Rains in some Receptacle within
the Cavity of the Mountains is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
But truly, I cannot see
how in some Fountains their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
and equal flowing can
hold out for so long a time, as is
observ'd in ours for so many Ages;
seeing in whatever Season, either
dry or moist, there appears no
sign of Increase or Decrease.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Scaliger</hi> answers to those
things which use to be objected
against the Opinion of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of the Fountains and Rivers
from the Sea, in opposition to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
saying, There is no reason
why the Sea-water, before it come
to the Mountains, does not break
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99636:75"/>
out every where, in these words:
<hi>But,</hi> O Cardan, <hi>he whom in the 2d
of</hi> Genesis, <hi>the Divine Man says to
have finisht all things, was so good
an Architect, so wise a Water-Bailif,
that</hi> Julius Frontinus <hi>is nothing to
him: He therefore did so skilfully
join the Pipes of his Aqueducts,
and fit them for bearing the Burthen,
as to free you from this fear.</hi> But
truly, this Difficulty which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
about the sufficient strength
of the subterraneous Passages, gives
no less trouble (excepting the
greater distance) to the Asserters
of the other Opinion, who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the Original of Fountains and
Rivers to Rains.</p>
            <p>But how Water is furnisht to
the Fountains from the Sea, which
being heavy of its own nature,
must flow back into the Sea from
whence it came, making as it
were a Circle, is not agreed upon
among those, who admit the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99636:76"/>
of Fountains to be from the
Sea, as may be seen in <hi>Gaspar
Schottus,</hi> who rehearses many O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of the Ancients and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns,
and examines them. So
true is it what <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, <hi>That
'twas an old Doubt, why seeing so
great a quantity of Water runs to
the Sea, it does not thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
bigger.</hi> Some think that the
Sea-water ascends above its own
Original by the attractive force of
the Earth, some by shaking and
the Sea-tide, some by force of the
inclosed Spirit, which drives up
the Water to the top of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Mountains; others do attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
it to the Pressure of the Air,
which by perpetually breaking
down the Surface, lifts the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
up on high; some recur to the
Divine Providence: There are
others who say, That the Sea-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
flows with a natural Motion,
whether from the bottom of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99636:76"/>
Sea, or the sides, to the Springs
of Fountains plac'd in the most
high Mountains, because the Sea
is higher than the Earth, as the
same <hi>Schottus</hi> thinks. But I like
better the Opinion of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi>
of which was also our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Falloppius,</hi> who thinks that
the Sea-water, by reason of the
subterraneous Heat, is raised in
form of a Vapor to the highest
Mountains; and there, by reason
of the ambient Rocks condens'd
into Water, as is usual in Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Distillations, so that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are like Heads of the Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicks,
by the Cold of which the
exalted Vapors are condensed into
Water, which afterwards breaks
out into Springs. <hi>Iulius Caesar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupitus</hi>
tells, in his History of the
burning of <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> that at the
same time it did send forth two
Streams, one of Fire towards the
shoar, another of Water on the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99636:77"/>
other side that looks to the Plain
of <hi>Nola,</hi> the Fire not only keeping
time with the Waters, but also
producing them: For 'tis to be
thought that by force of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
Heat diffus'd over the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
so great a quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
was exhaled from some Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
that held the Sea-water, that
it was sufficient for making a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it might be as convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
deduc'd from the Rarefaction of the
Air inclos'd within the Bowels of
the Mountains, pressing down the
Surface of the Water, and so forcing
it out another way.</p>
            <p>Neither do the Beds of Stone
and Chalk, which <hi>Bartholine</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
withstand the lifting of the
Vapors upward: For supposing
the Mountains are, as all confess
them to be, cavernous within,
such Beds as these might afford
this use, to stop the Vapors lifted
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99636:77"/>
upward by force of the Heat, and
let them fall down by various
Chinks as Veins, to which these
Beds, especially such as are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velly
and stony, are passable; from
whence the Fountains arise, which
are called Mouths of the Veins.
Therefore 'tis a more ready way,
and more agreeable to the Laws of
Nature, to draw the Original of
Fountains, which are perpetual,
and subject to no Alteration from
the Sea, by the continual Ascent
of Vapors in the great Receptacles
of Nature. And 'tis reasonable to
think it so in our Case, both from
the old state of the Countrey on
this side the <hi>Po,</hi> and also the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Fires that the Neighbouring
Mountains maintain, which at
their wide Mouths sometimes
throw up much Fire and Ashes,
with Stones, with so great a Noise
and Crashing, that it is heard
sometimes 12 Miles off; which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99636:78"/>
truly is not new, seeing <hi>Pliny</hi>
mentions this, who writes, That
in the Land of <hi>Modena</hi> the Fire
comes out on set Days; and tells
it as a Prodigy, that two Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
met together, Smoke and
Fire coming out; and that in the
Day time a great multitude of
<hi>Roman</hi> Horsemen and Travellers
were looking on. But that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
seen in Mount <hi>Gibbius,</hi>
where there are many Fountains,
from which <hi>Petroleum</hi> flows.</p>
            <p>An Account of some very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ones I had from my Brother
who saw them, and was confirmed to
me by Seignior <hi>Spoletti,</hi> Physician
to the late Ambassadors from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and Professor of Physick at
<hi>Padoua,</hi> when he was at my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
They be seen on a side of one
of the <hi>Apennine</hi> Mountains, half
way betwixt <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi>
near a place called <hi>Petra Mala,</hi> about
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99636:78"/>
Five Miles from <hi>Fierenzola;</hi> 'tis
in a spot of Ground of three or four
Yards Diameter, which incessantly
sends up a Flame rising very high,
with no Noise, Smoak, or Smell, but
gives a very great Heat, and has
been observed to be thus in all times,
except of great Rains which put it
out for a while; but when that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
it burns with greater violence
than before; the Sand about it when
turn'd up sends forth a Flame, but
within 3 or 4 Yards round about it
there are Corn Fields. The People
that live near to it, believe that
there is a deep Hole there; but he
found it to be firm Ground. There
are 3 or 4 more of those near, but
they do not burn so vehement by as
this.</p>
            <p>When I was thinking on a more
exact History of these Fountains
of <hi>Petroleum,</hi> than is in Writers. I
understood by Letters from <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liabecchius,</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:99636:79"/>
(to whom, as Prince
of the Learned) whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
new in Learning is presently
brought) that the most Learned
<hi>D. Olinger,</hi> the Kings Professor at
<hi>Copenhagen,</hi> had lately Published a
Book, which he found among
some Manuscripts, under the Name
of <hi>Franciscus Areostus,</hi> of the Oil
of Mount <hi>Zibinius,</hi> or the <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum</hi>
of <hi>Modena,</hi> which Book that
most Renowned Author Dedicated
to the same <hi>Malliabecehius,</hi> with
a Preface to the Reader: A great
Reproach of our floth, who stay
till some rise from the remotest
Countreys to illustrate our Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
by our own Writings.</p>
            <p>Though I derive the Original
of our Fountains from the Sea
first, then from some Cistern of
VVater plac'd in our Mountains,
into which the Vapors, sent up by
the inclos'd Heat, are returned in
form of VVaters. I would not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99636:79"/>
thence infer, that this Cistern is
plac'd in the tops of the <hi>Apennine</hi>
Mountains, but I believe rather
that 'tis plac'd in the Foot of the
Mountain, than in the top; for
though, as I show'd before, 'tis
not always, necessary, that the
VVaters, though inclos'd within
Pipes, should reach to the height
of their Cistern, which happens
as often as their Passage being
stratinted, they have not free Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to flow out, as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 1.
But if we should place this Cistern
in the tops of the <hi>Apennine</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
probably the VVaters might
rise higher in them, when yet
they do not rise to the surface of
the Ground. But I cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
conjecture in what part,
whether near the foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
or in their inner parts, this
Cistern of VVaters is plac'd by
the Divine Architect. I have
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99636:80"/>
spar'd no Labour nor Experiences
to find out the Head of this Spring,
and therefore I diligently viewed
not only the Plain towards the
Mountains, but the Mountains
themselves, and could find no
Marks of it. I observ'd indeed
some small Lakes, but such as dry
up in the Summer, and so become
Pasture for Cattel; of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of which is the Lake <hi>Paulinus,</hi>
25 Miles distant from this. I
thought best therefore to fetch
the Original of these Waters from
another source, <hi>viz.</hi> From some
secret Cistern of water plac'd in
the inner parts of the <hi>Apennine</hi>
Mountains. And it is certain, that
the inner parts of the Mountains
are cavernous, and that there are
in them Cisterns of water, from
whence Fountains and Rivers draw
their Original. <hi>Lucan</hi> feign'd to
himself a great Cistern of water in
the heart of the <hi>Apennine,</hi> from
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99636:80"/>
which all the Rivers of <hi>Italy</hi> did
flow, that run into both the Seas.
I am willing to bring in here his
Verses, seeing to reason in so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
matters with the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
or to conjecture with the
Poets, is the same thing.

            </p>
            <p>But seeing 'tis known enough
by what we have related in the
History of these Fountains, that
this Spring is not so old as the
world, seeing the last Plain in
which the Auger was fastned was
formerly in the open Air, as the
Trees in it make evident. If in the
beginning of the World these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99636:81"/>
had flown as they do now, the
force of the water would easily
have thrown off that weight, as
it happens sometime when the
boring is delay'd. Then one will
say, When, and how had this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Source its Original? To
this I may answer, That there are
no Monuments of this, nor can it
be absolutely known when these
waters began to flow; yet 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that this Accumulation of
the Ground hath not happen'd but
after great Land-Floods, they leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great deal of Mud here; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
as I was saying, the force
of the water would have thrown
off the weight. Therefore I am
inclin'd to believe, that after the
Plain was thus rais'd, some new
ways were open'd by a great
Earthquake, so that the waters
might flow from the Cistern pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the adjacent Mountains,
which receives them by a continal
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99636:82"/>
evaporation from the Sea, and
so might flow from that sandy
Ground, and so to have kept their
Course for many Ages, before the
wit of Man reach'd hither, and
open'd the Veins of the Earth
with the Auger as with a Launce.
And 'tis known by many Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that some Fountains die by
Earthquakes, and some rise; as

            <p>'TIS worth the Enquiry, What
is the Progress of these our
waters that flow under ground,
and whether they go? But here I
stick, and there is no place but
for Conjecture. I have often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
of the Undertakers, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they felt the Auger to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by Violence to any side; but
I could understand nothing certain
of them. But seeing the length
of this Source is far greater than
its breadth, I think it more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

flow from East to VVest, according
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99636:83"/>
to the lenghth of the <hi>Aemilian</hi> way,

as I have had occasion to observe;

by secret turnings and windings
falls into the Sea, according to the

               </q>
But also is proved by the most
grave and modern VVriters, with
many Reasons, as <hi>Arias Montanus,
Varenius, Vossius, Becher,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others, whom the most famous
<hi>Lanzon,</hi> Physician of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> cites
in his Animadversions, full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.
It may be doubted, and that
not without reason, whether the
course of these waters must be for
ever. And truly, seeing from the
times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
even to this Age, there
hath been so great an accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Earth, as well in the
City as in the adjacent Lands, and
in the Channels of Rivers, there is
no place left of doubting, but the
course of these Fountains will at
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99636:84"/>
length cease, the Causes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same, to wit, while the
next Rivers take away with them
the spoil of the Mountains, and
therewith cover the Plains that
lie under. Therefore, as these
Fountains for a far better use did
rise many Feet above the Surface
of the Earth, but now rarely reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
its Surface; so we must think,
that the time will come in which
these waters must stand in their
VVells, having no descent by
which to run down: And these
Changes, which succeed in great
length of time, and without a
VVitness, if we consider the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of things, hardly deserve
Credit; yet the thing it self speaks
that they have truly happened,
and will still follow: But because
(to use <hi>Aristotile</hi>'s words) the things
are done in great length of time
in respect of our Life, they are hid
from us, and the ruine of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99636:84"/>
does happen before the
change of these things, is told from
the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p>But this is the common Fate of
Cities that are plac'd in the Plains,
that after many Ages they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
half buried; or, (as the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
Priest in <hi>Plato</hi> says of the
Cities of <hi>Greece)</hi> are carried by
the force of the Rivers into the
Sea; though on the other hand,
Towns which are plac'd on the
tops of the mountains, their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
being par'd, do tell the
Injuries of Time: A sure Proof,
that there is nothing constant and
firm in this world, but that we
must look for the City that is on
high, and is to continue for ever.</p>
            <p>But why these Fountains, seeing
they are supposed to take their
Original from the Sea, have no
ebbing or flowing, as some Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
of which Writers take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
as is that which <hi>Pliny</hi> the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99636:85"/>
Younger mentions in the Land of
<hi>Como,</hi> which ebbs and flows three
times in a Day. I think this to
happen, because water is furnisht
to these Fountains from the Sea,
by the Ascent of Vapors; which
evaporation, though it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
equal, because of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
Fires sometimes weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
sometimes stronger, yet 'tis
enough if it be such as is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to keep the Cistern full always
to the same height, on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
the Equality of Flux of these
our Fountains for so many Ages,
whatever come of the water that
sometimes overflows, and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
another way. But why
some Fountains at certain times
flow, and at other times ebb, many
Causes are brought, of which (I
mean those which draw their
Source from the Sea) the Cause is
the ebbing and flowing of the Sea,
by force of which it comes to pass,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99636:85"/>
that as the Sea ebbs and flows,
these Fountains are sometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
full, and sometimes empty.</p>
            <p>We said, that in the Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
a great Heat was perceiv'd in
these Fountains, and in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time a great Cold; as appears
also by the The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mometer let down
to several Depths, and the Table
before marked shews: Which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
seem not a little to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Defenders of an Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristasis;
and so much the rather,
that these Observations were not
made in a Mountanous, but in a
Champion Countrey. For I do
not think it safe to try it in Mines,
and the Caverns of the Mountains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
because of the Metallick Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and divers Salts and kinds of
Marcasites, with which they are
pregnant; for when such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
are sprinkled with Water,
they grow hot like Quick lime,
and raise divers Exhalations, which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99636:86"/>
the Mineral Waters do testifie that
break out hot; to which you may
add, there are many Store houses
of Fire, which may not a little
alter the subterraneous Region,
which happens not in great Plains,
as is the Countrey on this and the
other side of the <hi>Po.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the most Learn'd Mr.
<hi>Boyle</hi> has gathered many things of
the Temper of the Air under
Ground; all which yet he says he
had from such as made Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on many Mines; where he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
relates, that in the same places,
and at the same times of the Year,
there is found a different temper
of the subterraneous Regions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the different Nature of
Salts. And he says, That from
some Mines are felt hot <hi>Effluvia</hi>
in the Summer-time. And 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that not only out of the
Caverns of the Mountains, hot Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations
breath in the Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99636:86"/>
but also frequently a most
cold Air. In <hi>Etruria,</hi> near the
Lake of the <hi>Vulsinenses,</hi> near the
Town <hi>Martha,</hi> is a little Cave at
the foot of a most high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
which is not above 6 or 8
Feet deep; but in the side of the
Cave at a little Chink the Wind
blows so cold that it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to the Coldness of the North
Winds. The Fathers of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Mimims of <hi>St. Francis de
Paula,</hi> who have a Church with a
Monastery near it, use this Cave
as a Vault for their Wine; and in
the Summer-time draw their Wine
from thence as cold, as if it had
been in Snow; yea, if they keep
their Summer Fruits there some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
they draw them out sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with a cold Dew, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
during my stay with them,
in the Dog days.</p>
            <p>But in the great Plains where
all the Earth is solid, and does not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99636:87"/>
keep so many kinds of Salts or
Fires inclos'd, if we might go
down deeper by digging, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Certitude might be had of this
subterraneous Temperature. But
in these VVells of ours I perceived
this Reciprocation of Heat and
Cold sensible enough, as often as
I descended into them at different
times; but that there might happen
no Deception by the Senses being
preposses'd with Heat or Cold, I
observed it manifestly by a Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer
exactly sealed. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is the nature of Cold or Heat,
(for 'tis not proper in this place
to enquire whether they are bare
Qualities or Corpuscles causing
such a Sensation in us.) <hi>Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastis,</hi>
as I think, ought not to be
banish'd out of the Schools; for it
may be explained right enough
both ways. Whether therefore,
according to the Diversity of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
and Countreys, there be a
<pb facs="tcp:99636:87"/>
different Temper of the Air under
Ground, yet 'tis certain that the
Thermometer being let down, does
speak with distinct Notes, that
there is at least in the first Region
of the Earth, (whatever be of the
deeper and Central parts of the
Earth) this Reciprocation of Heat
and Cold, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Changes of the Year; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in a quality opposite to that
which the external Air, in which
we live, hath: So that here may
be used that Sentence of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Hippocrates, Lux orco tenebrae
Iovi; Lux Iovi tenebrae orco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before we come out of these
VVells, it will be fit to give the
Reasons of some <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that
are observ'd in the digging of
them. It was said before, that
there is a great Rest in the Air in
the VVinter-time, so that the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
continue burning; there is no
smoaky Exhalation, and they easily
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99636:88"/>
draw their Breath; but in the
Summer-time there is raised a
thick Cloud, the Lights are put
out, and the Diggers are almost
kill'd. But from whence this?
VVhen rather in the Winter-time,
because of the Heat, more intense
at that time, and equal to the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
Heat, it might seem conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Reason, that in a moist
place a smoaky Exhalation should
be rais'd, which should trouble the
Air, and put out the Lights; but
in the Summer, by reason of the
Cold which lodges in these VVells,
not much unlike the Cold in the
VVinter, it would seem reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the Air should be more
pure, nor so intangled with gross
Vapours, as to be unfit for Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration!
VVhether 'tis that the
Heat, which in the VVinter-time
is in these <hi>Wells</hi> by reason of an
Antiperistasis, being greater, hath
force to dissipate these Vapors;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99636:88"/>
but in the Summer-time, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Cold, they cannot be
dissolved! Or rather, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations
in the Winter, that are
raised by the Heat in these VVells,
are lighter than the external and
thicker Air, and so do ascend
more easily, but in the Summer are
heavier than the external Air;
and therefore stagnating there,
cause a difficulty of breathing, and
put out the Lights when kindled.
But here I cannot but wonder, why
in the Mines, though of great
depth, as are those in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the
Miners continue any time of the
Year with their Candles lighted,
and that in any season; nor do
they feel so great an Inconvenience
in breathing: But in our Wells
that are in the open Air, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with the open Air, not
by turnings, but in a streight Line,
the VVorkmen in the Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
are almost suffocated, and
their Lights put out; so that in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99636:89"/>
Dog-Days there is no hiring of
them to work. Perhaps this falls
out, because the Mines in the
Mountains and dry places have
not so gross an Air, but such as
is sufficient for Respiration; but
these being digg'd in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
Countrey, and moist Ground,
send forth Streams more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
so the Air being filled with
them is unfit for Respiration.
I deny not but in the Mines the
Miners are sometimes troubled
with shortness of Breath, partly
by reason of their own Breaths,
and partly because of the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Exhalations; yea, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
killed; so that to prevent
the Danger of being stifled, they
use Air-Pumps, for taking up the
fowl Air, and letting in fresh; a
Description of which
you may see in <hi>Agricola.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 7. De re Metallica.</note>
Beside, they dig a Pit
some distance from the Mine, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
downwards, from which a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99636:89"/>
Mine is extended to the place
where the Diggers work, which
serves for a Wind Pipe; and by
bringing in fresh Air, and driving
the old to the Mouth of the Pit,
does much refresh the VVorkmen,
and frees them from the danger
of being stifled; but that is only
done in the deeper Mines, as <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> relate. The
Lights therefore are put out in the
Summer-time in these VVells, and
the Diggers are seiz'd with a great
Difficulty of breathing, because
the Air in it is fill'd with gross Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours;
which thick and ponderous
Vapors cannot ascend in the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and lighter Air, but are to
lodge there by reason of their
weight. But the Vital Light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of necessity a thinness, and
empty spaces in the Air, in which
it may lay down its Fulginous <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia,</hi>
and needs fresh Air for its
Food, otherwise it quickly dies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:99636:90"/>
It was observed before, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsing
the curious things that
occur in the digging of these
VVells, that there are three Beds
of Clay two of 11 Foot, another
below it of less thickness, with
marshy Beds between them of
two Feet thick. I have often times
studied to find out the Generation
of these-Beds, examining with my
self how they are distinguish'd in
this Order of time thro' the whole
Tract. I know there have been
amongst our Countreymen some
who think, that these Beds of
Clay are the Product of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Deluge. But this Author,
whose Name I now pass in silence,
lest I should seem to contend with
the Ghosts, (for he died this year)
tho' he was born in this Countrey,
yet having liv'd always abroad,
was surely never present at the
digging of those Wells, but hath
had from others all that he says
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99636:90"/>
of them: For if he had seen the
Structure of these Fountains, he
would never have written, that
the Clay in these VVells was 24
Feet deep, and the marshy Ground
as thick: For there are three Beds
of Clay, two of 11 Foot apiece,
and one less, with their Beds of
marshy Ground between of two
Foot a piece. Therefore this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
for the Truth of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Deluge, taken from the
thickness of the Clay, is of no
weight.</p>
            <p>I am perswaded therefore, that
after the Universal Deluge, whose
Vestigies are perhaps deeper, these
Beds of Clay were produc'd by
three particular Floods, yet great
and most ancient; so that from
one Flood to another much time
interceded, in which the stagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Water, and the Ground
putrifying together with the leaves
and roots of Reeds, gave Original
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99636:91"/>
to these intermedial marshy Beds.</p>
            <p>I can easily believe, that this
Bulk of Clay was made of the
Earth drawn down from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
by the hasty Descent of the
Waters into these Valleys; seeing
for gathering of Clay for the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
'tis usual with us to convey
the VVater into Pits made by art,
out of the Rivers <hi>Scultenna</hi> and
<hi>Gabellus,</hi> by which means the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being exhaled by the Heat of
the Summer, there settles much
Clay in them, which the Potters
afterwards use for making their
Vessels. And <hi>Pliny</hi> testifies, That
the Potters Art excelled in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of old, because of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Clay, and its tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
saying, <hi>That</hi> Modena <hi>was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in</hi> Italy <hi>for Potters Work;
when at that time,</hi> as he says, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury
had come to that height, that
Potters Work cost more than Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:99636:91"/>
And we have reason to think,
that this diversity of Beds, which
is seen in great Plains, has been
made by several inundations and
accumulations of the Ground: But
from whence that diversity of Beds
comes, which is also found in the
Mountains, is not so easie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
<hi>Agricola</hi> says, there
were sixteen Beds of different Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
in the Mines of the Mountain
<hi>Melibochus,</hi> and of different heights;
but if one could dig deeper, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a great many others would
appear. If we would stick to the
Opinion of our <hi>Faloppius,</hi> 'twill not
be a hard matter to understand
the Generation of these Beds, and
their Diversity in the Mountains <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for he thinks, that the Mountains
were made by a dry Exhalation
shut up in the Bowels of the Earth,
which he gathers from their Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midical
Figure; yea, he thinks
they are nourished by such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99636:92"/>
and grow by peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal;
from whence it comes to
pass, that, as in Sublimation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,
Flowers of different sorts
are gathered according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of the Pots, so he thinks
the same to happen in the Caverns
of the Mountains, according to the
different Generation of Metals and
Fossils. But when in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Mountains were built by the
great Artificer, 'tis fit to own they
were made in their whole Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
(as being the first Former of
all things) and with so many Beds
for various uses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bartholine,</hi> in the Discourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cited, shews ingeniously the
use which these Beds give, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
those of Clay, for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Fountains, whether they
be made of Rains, as the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
ones; or of Sea-water, as
the perpetual or regular ones: For
these Beds are of special use for the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99636:92"/>
Collection of Waters into one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle,
and likewise for their
running a long way, otherwise
they should be lost; neither would
there be any Reason, why they
should break forth in one place
more than another; which use,
without doubt, these Beds of Clay
perform in these Fountains; for
while these Waters run through
the sandy Plain, 'tis reasonable to
think, that there is another Bed
of Clay lying under; so that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shut up above and below, they
follow their course as it were thro'
a Pipe, except when they break
out into the Air, a way being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to them by these Wells.</p>
            <p>Therefore supposing the hidden
Expansion of these Waters over
the Sandy and Gravelly Plain, 'tis
no wonder if a Noise be perceiv'd
in the bottom of these Wells,
while the Water runs through the
Gravel, (which Gravel 'tis more
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99636:93"/>
probable to be there made of the
Sand, than to fall from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
(seeing a great part of it is
so soft, that by the only rubbing
of your Fingers it is broke) and if
the Water be rais'd in all the Wells
to the same height, seeing there is
the same Cause which drives it
on high, to wit, the pressure of
the Water descending from an
higher place, and from the same
Receptacle. And lastly, If they
be equally pure and wholsom, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are of the same Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For the same Reason the
same Waters are the more lively,
the more is drawn from them, and
their slowness is corrected when it
happens; because by the Sand
thrown up, and sinking to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
the hole made with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is sometimes stopt; a sure
Proof that these VVaters run
through a sandy Plain, but not
at all through an immense wide
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99636:93"/>
Space; which may be further
known by the depression and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Ground, that is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
sometimes to happen when
too much Water and Sand has
run out.</p>

               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:99636:94"/>
a Noble Mathematician of
<hi>Bononia,</hi> have chiefly cultivated
this most noble part of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;
who though they all, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Observations and Hydrostatical
Experiments have dived far into
the wonderful Properties of Fluids,
yet have left room for a further
Enquiry: For if in any case <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>'s
words are of value, 'tis in
this the greatest and most intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
of all, in which even when
much is done, the Age following
will find something more to do.</p>
            <p>Seeing then, according to our
Hypothesis, the Waters of this
hidden Source are movable and
running, and withal ascend on
high; because, as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Passage by which they
go out, and fall into a Gulph, is
straitned; and seeing the Ascent
into these Wells is constant and
perpetual, nor can be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some proportion to the height
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99636:95"/>
of their Cistern; because this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
is supposed by us to be in
the Foot of the nearest <hi>Apennine</hi>
Mountains, and higher by far than
the Elevation of these Waters
from the bottom of the Wells to
the top; therefore I thought it
would not be unprosftable nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant,
if I endeavoured to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
out, if not exactly to describe,
such a Proportion. Suppose then
there be a Vessel <hi>ABC</hi> full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to which a Pipe <hi>DE</hi> is fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in a Horizontal Line, and
whose Orifice is half shut, so that
the water does not flow with a full
Stream: Let there be likewise in
the middle of the Pipe <hi>D F</hi> another
glass Pipe <hi>HI</hi> inserted perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly;
therefore granting a free
Passage to the water, I say, that
the water will be lifted in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Pipe <hi>HI</hi> to such a height, that
if the height of the water contain'd
in the Vessel be of eight parts, the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99636:95"/>
elevation of the water in the
streight Pipe <hi>HI</hi> shall be of six
parts; and such a Proportion will
answer to any Division of the
Mouth of the Pipe <hi>D F.</hi>

            <p>For if the Orifice of the Pipe <hi>D F</hi>
be wholly shut, so that no water
runs down, none is ignorant that
the water in the Pipe <hi>HI</hi> of its
own nature must place its self in
the same Horizontal Line with the
water contain'd in the Vessel, to
which effect two things doubtless
concur with equal force, to wit,
the pressure of the water contain'd
in the Vessel, and the resistance of
the Obstacle that wholly obstructs
the Hole in the Pipe, which stop is
eqvivalent to a Power pressing
with equal force against the water
stagnating in the Vessel; if then
the elevation of the water in such
a case is a produce arising from
two Causes equally working, to
wit, the pressure of the water, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99636:96"/>
the resistance of the stop, it will
follow, that when the Orifice of
the same Pipe <hi>D F</hi> shall only be
stopt in part, the ascent of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the intermedial Pipe <hi>H I,</hi>
whatever it be, will be a Product
of the same Pressure, as in the first
Case, and the virtual Pressure of
the Stop, but working unequally;
from hence it comes to pass, that
when the Pressure of the superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
water in the Vessel that
presses it to flow out, is in the
same degree and energy as before;
and on the other hand, the force
of the Stop is removed, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cannot be lifted up so high in
the Pipe erected perpendicularly,
as to reach the height of the water
contain'd in the Vessel, but must
of necessity be under it; so that
if the height of the water were
in supposition eight Foot, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
with such a Pressure as
were equal to that height, but the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99636:96"/>
Stop should not act but half, <hi>i. e.</hi>
as four; these two working toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and making the ascent of the
water, there cannot but happen
an Effect, which is between these
two Agents, as 6 is between 8 and
4, <hi>i. e.</hi> in an Arithmetical Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore in the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Case the Water will be only
raised in the streight Pipe <hi>H I</hi> to 6
parts, which Elevation is half the
Aggregate of the height of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contain'd in the Vessel, and the
power of the Stop.</p>
            <p>This was my Reasoning before
I try'd whether the thing agreed
to it; which I did, by inserting a
wooden and square Pipe into the
side of the Vessel, as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. and
fitting a glass Pipe divided into 8
parts, and erected perpendicularly
to the same Pipe; then putting a
stop to the Pipe, which might on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obstruct the half of it, I let the
water run out, and observed that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99636:97"/>
the water did rise in the glass Pipe
in the same proportion, to wit, as
6 to 8: Yet I must confess, that
the ascent of the water did not so
exactly answer to the greater or
lesser Obstacles put to the hole of
the Pipe, because perhaps of the
difficulty of fitting divers Doors
to the Orifice, and because of the
Undulation of the water produc'd
in the Glass Pipe from the <hi>Impetus,</hi>
where 'tis observed to go out. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therefore communicated these
my Observations to the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Bocchabadatus,</hi> Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
to the Great Duke, and my
intimate Friend from our Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
(for I always thought it the
part of an ingenuous Man, that I
may use <hi>Pliny</hi>'s words, to confess
by whom I have profited) he prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
me with a Method by which I
might obtain my Desire. When
therefore he thought that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Stops might be supplied,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99636:97"/>
if to the hole of the Pipe, from
whence the water should come
out, another streight Pipe of the
same bigness were set, but with a
proportion to the height of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern.
I made Trial, and the thing
succeeded according to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Fig.</hi> 4. supposing the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Water in the Vessel
to be of 8 parts, and the Pipe <hi>MN</hi>
to be only of 4 parts, by which
means 'tis equivalent to an Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that takes up half the breadth
of the Aperture, letting the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
run out, and the Vessel always
remaining full, the water in the
Pipe <hi>HG</hi> appear'd suspended in <hi>E,</hi>
to wit, in the height of 6 parts,
which is half the Sum of 8 and 4,
the height of the Water and the
resistence of the Obex. In like
manner in <hi>Fig.</hi> 5. when the Pipe is
of the height of 6 parts, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Glass Pipe <hi>E F</hi> was seen
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99636:98"/>
to rise to <hi>S,</hi> to wit, to 7 parts
The same was observed (as in <hi>Fig.</hi>
6.) when the Pipe <hi>E H</hi> pouring
forth the water, was of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> parts,
<hi>i. e.</hi> equivalent to an Obstacle stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the fourth part of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
for in the Glass Pipe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
stood in <hi>T, i. e.</hi> in part 5. and
that as exactly as Physical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will admit, as every one
may easily try. I do not doubt
but the same will happen in any
other case; therefore Reason and
Experience do sufficiently prove,
that the Water is raised in a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Arithmetical Proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the force of the Obstacle,
and the height of the water in the
Cistern.</p>
            <p>While on this occasion I diverted
my self in making various Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical
Experiments in the Dog-days,
I happened to make a very
curious Observation, to wit. That
though the height of the water be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99636:98"/>
the same in the Vessel, and the
same Horizontal Pipe be inserted
into it; yet in the perpendicular
Pipes, according to the difference
of their Situation, there is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
difference of the altitude of the
water in one and the other, as in
<hi>Fig.</hi> 7. Let the Vessel <hi>A B C D</hi>
be full of Water, the Pipe <hi>D H</hi>
be inserted into it, and shut in the
Extremity, and let <hi>F G H I</hi> be the
Glass Pipes erected perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but <hi>M</hi> the Pipe pouring out wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Therefore in the Pipe <hi>F G,</hi>
according to what was said before,
the water will rise to <hi>O, i. e.</hi> to
parts 5. for the height of the Pipe
<hi>M</hi> pouring out the water is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
2. and the height of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contain'd in the Vessel is as 8.
But if the Pipe <hi>F G</hi> be transferred
to <hi>H I</hi> (the Orifice where it was
fastned being stopt) the water will
be raised higher, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>N,</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
7 degrees; which would
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99636:99"/>
likewise happen, if at the same
time two Glass Pipes <hi>F G H I</hi> stood
upright, and the Pipe <hi>M</hi> should
pour out water, the Vessel being
always full; for this different
height of waters is perceiv'd well
enough in every case. One may
try the same, not only when the
Pipe that pour'd out the water is
longer or shorter, but also when
many Pipes of different lengths,
and with proportion to the height
of the water contain'd in the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
send forth water at the same
time, and many Glass Pipes are
interjected, seeing many cases may
be fain'd according to every ones
Fancy. But seeing there is no
small Undulation in the Glass
Pipes, because the water running
out at <hi>M,</hi> falls back upon its self;
this Inconveniency will in some
measure be shunned, if the Pipe
<hi>F H</hi> be something bended, that so
both the Glass Pipes, and the Pipes
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99636:99"/>
sending forth the water be inclin'd
to one side; for in this case there
will happen less Undulation, and
the different heights of the water
may be more easily viewed.</p>
            <p>The Reason of this Phaenomenon
I judge to be, that the <hi>Impetus</hi> of
the Water running from the Cistern
out at <hi>M,</hi> withdraws some of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the Pipe <hi>F G,</hi> so that it
cannot rise so high; and the same
<hi>Impetus</hi> coming to <hi>H I,</hi> finding now
no Vent, makes it rise higher, even
to <hi>N.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This new Observation I commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to the same <hi>Boccabadatus,</hi>
who, as he did not a little wonder
at the novelty of the thing, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a most ingenious and exact
Searcher into natural things, he
did not cease to enquire into the
Cause of it; yea, afterwards he
told me he had the Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, which he said he would
insert into his Work which he is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99636:100"/>
to publish, about Mechanick Force.
I thought fit to propose this <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi>
to the Lovers of Hydrosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
thinking it worthy of the
consideration of the more acute
VVits, to the end it may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
from whence this Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Pressures proceeds.</p>

            <p>THerefore having sail'd over

as far as I could in a

with a dry Foot the nature of these
Fountains, so far as they are useful
to Men; and lest, as the Custom
is of those that are thirsty, I drink
quietly. I shall touch only at
some things relating to this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99636:101"/>
though it seem to be beyond
my purpose. 'Tis an old Dispute,
what in the Class of Simple Waters
is most wholsom? seeing some
prefer Rain-waters, others prefer
Fountain-waters; in some places
River-waters are most preferred,
in others Well-waters. <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
seem'd to prefer Rain-waters to
all others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for these he called the
sweetest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the thinnest, and the
clearest of all; seeing what is thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and lightest of the water is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
and drawn up by the Sun:
Yet 'tis certain <hi>Hippocrates</hi> spoke
of Rain waters in the Summer-time,
which they call <hi>Horaiae, i. e.</hi>
Early, seeing among waters that
want Art, he commends these,
which in the Summer time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fall
down from the Sky when it thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
but these that fall in Storms
he pronounces bad. <hi>Celsus, Galen,
Avicenna, Paulus,</hi> and others, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> judge the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:99636:101"/>
On the other hand, <hi>Pliny</hi> does
greatly discommend Rain-waters;
yea, he is so angry, that he thinks
the O pinion which commends
them, to endanger Men's Lives;
neither does he think it an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Levity that they have been
raised to Heaven, seeing Stones al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
have been rais'd to Heaven;
and further, VVaters, when they
fall from the Clouds, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the Exhalations of the
Earth, so that Fountain-water to
him seems preferable to them,
when Plenty of them may be
had.</p>
            <p>But if the thing be duly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
there will be no place left
to dispute; for all Rain-waters, as
also Fountain-waters being not of
the same Goodness, seeing every
Countrey has not the same Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere,
nor the same Ground thro'
which the water passes, seeing also;
according to <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> such as
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99636:102"/>
the Earth is, such is the Water) it
often happens, as <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>taeus</hi> adverts,
that in some places for the Purity
of the Air, the Rain-waters are
better, but in other places the
Fountain or River-waters are the
best; as the water of the River
<hi>Nile,</hi> whose much wish'd-for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
keeps all <hi>Egypt</hi> every
Year solicitous. But 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the water of the <hi>Nile</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
in Goodness all others, seeing
running a long way over a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
burnt with the heat of the
Sun, 'tis concocted, and is tossed
by sudden Falls from the highest
Mountains, and attenuated. Hence
<hi>Athenaeus</hi> testifies, That when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphus</hi>
King of <hi>Egypt</hi> betroth'd
his Daughter <hi>Berenice</hi> to <hi>Antiochus</hi>
King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> he willed her to
take with her the Water of the
<hi>Nile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet when other things do not
agree, it seems the Fountain-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99636:102"/>
ought to be preferred to Rain-waters,
and all others; for Rain-waters
are drawn from all sorts of
Filth, Dung and Dead Bodies
themselves; and though <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
judged them best, yet he adds,
That they have need of being
boil'd and strain'd. Wherefore
'tis not without Reason, that some
do disprove making of Syrup of
Poppeys with Rain-water; and
they think that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> spoke
according to Reason, and not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
So among the Moderns,
the most experienc'd <hi>Etmuller</hi> says,
<hi>That Rain-water kept always some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Earthy behind it, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
a hundred times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But so will any Water do as well as
Rain water.</p>
            <p>But Well-waters, seeing they
have no Motion but when they
are stirred, and in the bottom
have much Slime, and Rain-waters
being gathered of Snow and Rains,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99636:103"/>
and running over divers kinds o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Earths, and are therefore by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
call'd <hi>disagreeing,</hi> cannot
have that Purity and Simplicity
which the Fountain-waters have,
which are concocted by the Heat
pent up in the Bowels of the Earth,
and are strain'd through the same
Earth.</p>
            <p>Therefore our most pure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-waters,
as they have the first
place in the Rank of plain waters,
so they yield to none of the most
famous Fountains of our Times;
for as much as the Marks, by which
the most sincere Waters, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
for Humane Use, are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
do appear in these in a most
eminent manner. The chief Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that is wanted in water, and
which contains the rest, by way of
Excellency, is, <hi>that it partake most
of the nature of the Air.</hi> So <hi>Pliny</hi>
hath written, That wholsom wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ought to be most like to the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99636:103"/>
Air. On which Account <hi>Cassiodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
commended the Virgin Water,
so famous then at <hi>Rome, that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
most purely it resambled the Air.</hi>
For water ought to be pure, like
the Air, light and clear, free of
smell and taste, thin, and suscep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
of Heat and Cold. But the
waters of these Fountains are such;
for they are clear like the Air, free
of smell and taste, do most quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive any other quality, and
being weigh'd are lighter than any
others.</p>
            <p>Though Physicians do not seem
to value much the Argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Lightness; and the
Divine Master calls
these light,<note place="margin">5 Aph. 26.</note> 
               <hi>which are
soon hot and soon cold.</hi>
And <hi>Pliny</hi> writes,<note place="margin">Lib. 31. N. 11. c. 3.</note> 
               <hi>That
'tis in vain to examine
by the Balance the goodness of the
Waters;</hi> seeing it seldom happens
that one is lighter than the other;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99636:104"/>
which <hi>Brasavolus</hi> try'd in several
kinds of Waters, before <hi>Hercules</hi>
the Second Duke of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> Yet
seeing there are not wanting more
subtile ways of knowing even the
least difference of weight in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
according to the Doctrine of
<hi>Archimedes,</hi> Levity is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be neglected, for Levity
signifies the absence of the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
parts,<note place="margin">One may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</note> and is a sure
Proof of greater simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
Truly 'tis without
doubt, that if there were two
Vessels of the same capacity, and
full of the same water, and in one
of these, divers kinds of Salts were
dissolved in a certain quantity,
though the water did not grow in
bulk, yet the one will be of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
weight than the other, and will
be filled with strange qualities;
wherefore Gravity and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Levity are
not to be slighted. I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that some waters naturally
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99636:104"/>
light, are worse than others that
are heavier, because of the evil
qualities of the Soil through which
they pass. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> says, That
the waters of <hi>Amphiaraus</hi> and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>treria
being compar'd together, do
not differ in weight, yet the one
is wholsom and the other not. So
<hi>Tit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aresius,</hi> a River of which <hi>Homer</hi>
speaks, running into <hi>Penaeus,</hi> is not
mixt with it, but swims over it
like Oil: Yet <hi>Pliny</hi> says, his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are deadly. And he says,
That <hi>Penaeus</hi> refuses to suffer his
silver-colour'd waters to be mix'd
with the others deadly waters.
If we infuse a whole Glass of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
in water, otherwise light,
no weight will be added to it to
judge of; but none is ignorant
what Disorders it raises in the
Body.</p>
            <p>And it is necessary to confess
these things to be true of the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the water considered alone,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99636:105"/>
but if with other marks of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
there be lightness join'd, it
will be no small accession to its
goodness.<note place="margin">In Thal.</note> 
               <hi>Herodotus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
a Fountain of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi>
the water of which he
says was of such lightness, that
nothing could swim in it, no,
not a Stick, nor what was light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than a Stick; and such as
used those waters were called
<hi>Macrobii, i. e.</hi> Long-liv'd. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
himself commends
the lightness of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for a probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
of its goodness.<note place="margin">De Bonit. aq. c. 1.</note> But if the
lightness be alone, says he, 'twill
not be a sufficient mark of good
water: which one may also say
of all the other Signs, seeing none
of it self, and separately is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Mark of its goodness.</p>
            <p>But a surer Mark of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of water is, if it be not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
in the Bowels; for this is truly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99636:105"/>
the lightest, and this kind of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is more to be esteemed than
that which may be try'd with the
Scale. For we must not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all quality, so as to be pure,
clear, void of smell and taste, give
Sentence, and pronounce it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent;
but we must bring ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proof, <hi>viz.</hi> How they affect
the Bowels; for it may be that
it has all external Marks of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yet has a more secret Nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iousness,
which cannot be found
out by the external Sense. This
therefore will be the true and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
judgment of waters, which is
brought from Experience it self:
And truly that water is to be
thought light by the Effect, which
makes not the Bowels feel any
weight in passing; for which kind
of lightness the waters of <hi>Modena</hi>
are very commendable, as not
weighting the Stomach when one
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99636:106"/>
drinks a full Draught of them,
but easily pass through the whole
Body, and are voided by Sweat
and Urine.</p>
            <p>But above all these, <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
chiefly commends these Fountains,
whose waters come forth of deep
Springs, which are cold in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and warm in Winter; but
all these things are observed in
these Fountains, seeing they rise
68 Foot high; and in Summer are
very cold, but in Winter are warm,
yea, exhale some small Vapors.
Neither must we refer the Heat
which is found in these waters in
the Winter-time to metallick Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
or a mixture of Salts with
an acid Mineral, seeing that is
perceiv'd only in the Winter-time
by an Antiperistasis.</p>
            <p>All know that there are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
differences of Waters as of
Places; for Fountain and Well-waters
do easily drink up the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99636:106"/>
qualities of the Ground,
through which they pass, which
are innumerable; yet those waters
are thought more wholsom, that
run through thick Sand and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
because they carry nothing
from such a matter upward, which
cannot be said of that which runs
through Clay and soft Sand. But
the waters of these Fountains flow
a long way through Sand, which is
called <hi>Male,</hi> a Proof of which is
a great abundance of Dross, Sand,
and Gravel, which these Fountains
use to throw up at their first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
forth.</p>
            <p>Moreover, these waters, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my Observation, and of
many others, continue without
Corruption for a long time. For
it is found by Experiment in long
Navigations, that the water of
<hi>Neuceria</hi> did stink, but ours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
pure. I am not ignorant,
'tis a Question among Physicians
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99636:107"/>
no less curious than worthy to be
known, Whether the sudden Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the water be a mark of
its Goodness or Badness? Perhaps
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> himself gave cause of
doubting, who, after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
Rain water, says, <hi>They
soon putrifie, except they be boil'd
and strained again. Galen, Paulus,
Avicenna,</hi> and some of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;
amongst the Moderns, <hi>Iou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus,
Salius, Augenius, Bruvie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi>
and many others, take the
waters readiness to putrifie for a
sign of goodness, providing other
Notes agree. For the chief Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of water is, say they, that they
be quickly altered by any external
Cause; and from thence they
think its inclinableness to Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to arise: But these which
continue long free of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
say they, partake of an alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
nature: Such are the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Tyber,</hi> which are kept in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99636:107"/>
Earthen Vessels for Months and
Years, under Ground, without
Corruption. On the other hand,
there are some who think an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinableness
to Putrefaction among
the faults of water; among whom
is <hi>Costaeus,</hi> who says, <hi>That it is a
mark of the best water, that they do
not so easily corrupt:</hi> And is deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
oppos'd to <hi>Avicenna,</hi> who
thought that Rain-waters were
soon corrupted, because they were
thinner: For rather from thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Substance one might
argue, that their Substances are
less subject to Corruption, as is
known of distilled waters, and
Spirits of VVine, which truly is
thinner than VVine, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
does not putrifie it self, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
preserves other Bodies free from
Corruption.</p>
            <p>Seeing then Experience it self
makes it plain, that those which
are most simple do less putrifie,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99636:108"/>
but those which have a greater
Heterogenity, because of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
of the Internal Parts,
and a continual Fermentation, are
more easily corrupted. Therefore
I am easily induc'd to believe, that
the Curruption of the water is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be attributed to its Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
than Goodness. But the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why the Rain waters sooner
putrifie, may be this, that when
by the Heat of the Sun the water
is rais'd from the Earth, all sorts
of Filth are raised with it, and a
great quantity of Volatile Salts is
mixed with it: which made <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi>
say, <hi>That all Rain-waters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
putrified and distilled, did give
an ardent Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if promptitude to Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
were a Sign of Goodness,
why may we not say the same of
Eatables, which naturally do soon
putrifie; such as are Fleshes, Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
VVorts, early Ripe Fruits, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99636:108"/>
the like, <hi>viz.</hi> That these Aliments
are better than those which do not
so soon putrifie, seeing they are
sooner alter'd by the concocting
Faculty. Weaker Foods have a
shorter Life. <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesius</hi>
interprets, says, they make
Men's Lives shorter; and such as
cat these Meats are infirm and
weak, and cannot live so long. So
Bread of Wheat well fermented,
and well bak'd, gives a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Nourishment, and long
Life, to sound Bodies; and Bread
of all Food does least putrefie. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which account 'tis, that <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Lemnius</hi> commendeth it. <hi>For</hi>
(says he) <hi>Bread long kept does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
grow mouldy, and grows dry,
but does not putrefie.</hi> Therefore
'tis not a little to the Praise of
our Fountains, that they do not
corrupt; so that having other
Marks of Goodness, they are to
be reckon'd the best of Waters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:99636:109"/>
'Tis an old Commendation of
Waters, if Pulse be quickly boil'd
in them, as <hi>Pliny, Athenaeus, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius,
Galeus, Paulus;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Modern Physicians, <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,
Costaeus, Bruvierinus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
do testifie. But 'tis known,
that this also is common to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsom
Waters; for the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of boiling some Pulse is not
always by the Fault of the Waters,
but very often of the Grains them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as they have grown in this
or the other Ground, as <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
testifies, when he said, <hi>That
there are many places which always
bring forth Pulse that are easily
boil'd, others there are which bring
forth Grains hard to be boil'd</hi> Yea,
<hi>Plutarch</hi> says, <hi>That of two Furrows
join'd together, one brings forth a
hard Crop, the other not.</hi> The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
themselves know that well
enough, who if they have Pulse
that are not easily boil'd, use to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99636:109"/>
macerate them a Night in water
with a Sack full of Ashes, by
which means the close Texture of
the Grain is open'd by the force
of the Salt in the Ashes. And I
think none will look upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so made lixivial, as simple;
or will commend it for daily drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in whole Bodies. Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny, that salt and crude wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
very far distant from the best,
may be for some sickly Natures;
or in a neutral state of Health, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Medicine, which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
hath taught expresly in these
words: <hi>But whatever are salt and
crude, are not fit for all to drink of;
yet there are some Natures to whom
such Waters are convenient to be
drunk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever were hard to be boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the <hi>Greek</hi> call'd <hi>Ateramnia,</hi>
transferring likewise the same
word to a stubborn and inflexible
Mind. So Grains hard to be boil'd
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99636:110"/>
were call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, such as
are those which <hi>Theophrastus</hi> says,
grow in a thick tough Earth, and
as it were clayie; as at <hi>Philippi,</hi>
when the Pulse which <hi>Egypt</hi> bears,
both by reason of the nitrous Soil,
and the Heat, are easily boil'd.
Likewise water, in which Grains
were hardly boil'd, was called
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which word <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
us'd to signifie the crudity of water in many
occasions, of which <hi>Erotianus</hi> hath
in his <hi>Onomasticon</hi> made a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Therefore, as the Difficulty
of the Pulses being boil'd is not
always the Fault of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
so their being easily boil'd is
not a Mark of their Goodness;
which sometimes is proper to the
Seeds, sometimes to the VVaters;
yea, more effectual in some wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that are not of the best; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in nitrous and lixivious water
Pulse, Roots, and Worts are soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
boil'd. Upon this account in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99636:110"/>
Rain-waters, as being full of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Particles, all kind of Grains
are sooner boil'd than in Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-water,
which is more pure
and defecated. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Horatius Augenius,</hi> preferring
Rain-water to others for making
of Ptisan, when he had taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that Barley did sooner boil in
this, than in Spring-water, of his
own accord confesses, That the
Rain-VVaters are not sincere;
which made him go into this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
as a Paradox, That the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
the water is, and less mixt,
the less 'tis fit for the use of Life.
But in our Fountain-waters, Pulse
of all sorts is easily enough boil'd,
and any other kind of Aliments,
which, as I dare not discommend
in them, so I think is no way to
be taken for a Mark of the best.</p>
            <p>But certainly that is a greater
<hi>Criterion</hi> for judging of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of plain VVaters, which, as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99636:111"/>
               <hi>Vitruvius</hi> says, is taken from the
Habit of Men's Bodies that live
about those waters; to wit, if
they be robust, clear Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
sound, and not blear-ey'd.
Now 'tis known enough, that both
Citizens, and such as live in the
Suburbs here, are of a good Habit
of Body, and subject to none of
these Distempers; and the good
Health which those of <hi>Modena</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
beyond other Towns on this
side the <hi>Po,</hi> is not so much to be
ascribed to the wholsomness of the
Air, as to the goodness of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
as in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where their long
Life, according to <hi>Alpinus,</hi> is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the water of the <hi>Nile.</hi>
Seeing therefore in the most strict
Censure, the waters of these Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are not only innocent, but
wholsom, truly this City has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in which it may envy any
other as to this point; yea, seeing
its waters are carried to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99636:111"/>
places in the Summer-time,
the <hi>Nucerian</hi> water is now
out of use, to the great benefit of
the sick. So in the Summer-time
they run to these Fountains in all
kinds of Fevers, (for the use of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that I may not say the abuse,
is grown so frequent, that it seems
the only Febrifuge) and chiefly
to the Fountain which is called
<hi>Abyssus,</hi> as to the VVell of <hi>Escu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi>
of which we spoke before.
VVherefore I need not fear to
make use of what <hi>Claudian</hi> says
of <hi>Aponus,</hi> That they are at least
amongst our Countrey-folks.
