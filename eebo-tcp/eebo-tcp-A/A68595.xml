         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

appeareth in the 2. Pſalme, Deutero. 17 chap. and Eſay 46. chap. where they be named the nurces of religion) and vnto all other degrées ſpyrituall or temporal. And vaine are all men which know not this truely. And S. Paule ſayde becauſe it ſéemed not good to them to haue the knowledge of Gods word, he gaue them vp into a lewd mind, &amp; to all vncleanes, For if God be the lyght, ſuche as knowe him not ſtumble in darknes. If he be the only way, the ignoraunt go ſtray. If he be the trueth, they that knowe him not be deceyued. If he be onely good, all good thinges muſt be borrowed and craued of him alone. If all knowledge &amp; learning be his, wée muſt be Gods ſcholars. If he be life, not to knowe him his eternall death. For it is written, this is eternall lyfe, to know Ieſus Chriſt whome thou haſt ſent to be very god. But this know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge muſte wée haue and learne in the ſcriptures, as S.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1886:60"/>
Or elles that whereas they beleued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nowe by theyr owne fault the gift is taken from them. Nowe wee muſte take heede to reſiſt thys temptatyon as moſt daungerous of all.</p>
                  <p>Concerning thoſe whiche feele theyr vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be long ere it come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet their aſſurance is neuertheleſſe groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and eſtabliſhed vppon ſome of theſe articles and effects aforeſaid.

And concerning the workes of regeneration, it is to be vnderſtande that the greteſt and moſt eccellent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes<note place="margin">Note vvel</note> whiche the holye ghoſte worketh in vs, is the hate of ſynne, the loue of God, the aſſuraunce of our ſaluation in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, and the inuocation of hys name. Wherefore, he that feeleth theſe mocions in hym ſelfe, although it bée not vntyll the houre of death, hathe a

                  <p>Firſt, for as much as the two opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and effectes aforeſayde, bee as the two Ankers to holde vs faſt, and when one fayleth, to ſticke the more ſurer to the other, vntyll wee haue gotton ſtrength on bothe ſydes againe.</p>
                  <p>As when Dauid and Sainct Peter fell ſo beaſtly, yet there is no doubt but they lamented and ſorrowed, vntyll they felt the workyng of theyr regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſanctification, But béeyng in theyr temptation, they ſtayed them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues vpon the Anker of the teſtymonye which the ſpirite of God broughte into their conſcyence, whyche cauſed them not to doubte (not withſtandynge theyr

fall) but that they were the children of God, and that theyr fault was forgeuen them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, although both theſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and effectes, bee verye féeble and weake, yet ther is no cauſe to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.

The reaſon is, for that oure ſaluation is not onely ſtayed vpon oure fayth (although without faythe none can be ſaued) but vpon hym whome we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende by fayth, that is to ſaye Ieſus Chriſt. And fayth is of ſuche vertue that accordinge to the promiſe of God, one lytle ſparke thereof, how lytle ſo euer it bee, doth apprehende Ieſus Chriſt fully and perfectlye.</p>
                  <p>Yet not withſtandyng the greater our

fayth is, the greater power it hath to ioyne vs nearer &amp; nearer, and to graffe vs déeper in Ieſus Chriſte. And wee ought to be diſpleaſed and to lament, when in ſteede of goinge forewarde we recoyle and ſlyde backwarde, and yet the Diuell hath not wonne his proceſſe. Although we ſlyde backe, ſo that our ſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bring vs to ſteppe vp againe and go the better forwarde.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdlie when we be ſo lamenting and troubled for the feelynge of our neclygence and ſynnes, let vs ſéeke to the lyke examples of the Saintes which were as deepe in as wée, or rather dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yet neuertheleſſe they ceaſed not to pray, with aſſurance to be hard becauſe they were the chyldren of God, howe great and beaſtly ſinnes ſoeuer they had commytted. Set before vs then their examples not to contynue in ſynne, for they contynued not therein when they were waked of the Lorde: but let vs folowe theyr repentaunce and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte whyche they had of theyr ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1886:62"/>
And conclude that Sathan is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar when he would make vs beleeue that our faith was neuer good, although for a time the workinge and effectes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were bidden, whiche is as muche as to ſaye there is no fire bicauſe there is no flame. Or that the trées be deade in winter, bicauſe there is no gréene leaues nor fruite, or appearaunce of life.</p>
                  <p>Fowrthlie, let vs haue recourſe vnto the ſurer and perfecter remedie, whiche is the certainetie of our Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eſtabliſhed vppon the immutable purpoſe of God. And to haue the certaine teſtimonie of this infallible and vnmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Election, although the motions and workinges of faith, ſéeme to bee quenched and periſhed in vs, call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce the dayes paſte of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Dauid, and wee ſhall finde moſt certaine teſtimonies of the fauour of God towardes vs, ſo that we ſhall not neede to doubte. Alſo we maye finde that ſometimes wee had the workinge of faith, and ſo of our Election and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb facs="tcp:1886:63"/>
whiche were ſo manyfeſt in vs, that the Deuyll him ſelfe can not denye but then we were in the fauour of God, and had true fayth. For without fayth no man can pleaſe God. But if Sathan replie to that, that then wée had faythe, but nowe wée haue loſt it, and that God hath taken his grace cleane from vs. Let vs aunſwere boldely that this is as falſe a doctrine as the aucthour thereof is a lyer. For thoſe two poyntes bée in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, firſt God neuer chaungeth his purpoſe and aduiſe. The other is, that which he hath once purpoſed muſt come to paſſe, whatſoeuer lettes and ſtoppes doe come. Alſo ioyne the thirde reaſon to this, which is, that fayth is a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler gift, and belongeth onely to the elect as I will proue. For he that beleueth is<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. d</note> vnited and knit to Ieſus Chriſte. And therefore can neuer dye.</p>
                  <p>Theſe foundations beyng layde, I affirme that whoſoeuer hath a certayne teſtimonie of his faith once in all hys life, may be aſſured that it is there ſtyll,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1886:63"/>
and ſhalbe vntyll the ende, although for a time they feele it not, nor perceyue it. For doeth it followe that a little chylde hath no reaſonable ſoule in him, bicauſe he hath not the vſe of it? Or that a dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken man hath not a reaſonable ſoule, becauſe that for a time he hath loſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe &amp; féeling thereof? Peter denyed his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with an oth. Was his faith therfore voyde and naught? or did the Lord geue him a newe fayth? No, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye, accordyng to the prayer that Chriſte made for hym, hys fayth neuer fayled him altogether. And as the vytal and liuely ſpirite and ſtrength is not cleane out of him that for a time ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bée rather dead then aliue, not onely by the iudgement of Phiſitions, but alſo by his owne féeling. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs kéepe ſtedfaſt this precyous teſtimonie of our faith, and kéepe theſe infallible argumentes agaynſt Sathan in this harde battayle, aſſuring our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, that if euer faith were in vs, it is there ſtyll and ſhall be. Wherefore, wée
<pb facs="tcp:1886:64"/>
conclude, that we be the children and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of God, &amp; wée ſhall neuer periſhe, but he heard and receyued of him to our amendement: thus calling vppon him<note place="margin">Note.</note> which neuer chaungeth nor altereth his purpoſe, neyther wyll condempne him to daye, that he was determined to ſaue yeſterdaye. Let vs knowe then that our ſaluation dependeth vppon the eternall prouidence and wyll of him that hath giuen vs to his ſonne, who ſayde piain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that he woulde not loſe one of thoſe<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> which his Father had giuen him, nor they ſhoulde neuer be reiected. For it is moſt neceſſary that our ſaluation ſhould remaine in ſurer handes then our own.

                  <p>THe eccleſiaſticall corrections hath to degrées, the firſte is admonition. Sometime eaſye and ſometime ſharpe, according as the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the caſe requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. The ſecond and laſt degrée is that we call excommunication, wherin muſt be noted the poynt folowing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt what is excommunication? We cal exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> a ſentence wherby
<pb facs="tcp:1886:140"/>
the eccleſiaſticall Seniors after lawfull knowledge of the cauſe, dooth declare in the name and authoritie of God and his holy word, that ſuch or ſuch, one or many be iuſtlye excluded and ſeperated from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> company or communion of the Saynts that is to ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of God, &amp; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent delyuered to ſathan, for aſmuch as without the Church there is no ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet not to continue for euer, but ſo long as they continue vnreformed, and vntil that they haue ſatiſfied for the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or offence geuen.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it muſt be vnderſtande that ſuch a power is not grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon man, for man hath no manner of power ouer the ſoule, but by the authoritye of God, who vſeth them in the Churche as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes and inſtrumentes by whome hee ſpeaketh, &amp; therefore it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but ſuch ſentences be ratified and confyrmed in heauen. For as muche as Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo ſayde and promiſed to all his church in the perſon of hys xii. Apoſtles, vnder the name of keies of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1886:140"/>
kingdome of heauen <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 18.</note> and to bynde and vnbinde, as alſo S. Paule practiſed the lyke with the Churche of Corinthe and others <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cori. 5. 1. Timo. 1</note>. Yet neuertheles, the Churche ought after lawful ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to receyue him again which hath bene caſt out, that is to ſaye, if afterward be ſhall ſatiſfy to the Church, &amp; make amends for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke offence, according to the ordinaunce of the Church &amp; ſufficient proofes had of true amendment, as farre foorth as man may iudge. And there is no doubte but ſuch abſolutary ſentence is ratifyed and confirmed in heauen <note n="d" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. Ciprian, 1. booke. 2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, and 1. booke. 14. Epiſtle &amp;. 16</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly it is to be noted diligently that ſuch authoritie neuer pertayneth to one man alone (except God worketh at any tyme extraordinarilye) but to the whole eccleſiaſticall ſenate <note n="e" place="margin">Math. 18. 1. Cori. 5.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this is not geuen to al thoſe whiche call them ſelues of the Churche, but to the true eccleſiaſtical ſenate law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye and cannonicallye elected, as wee haue ſayde for to gouerne the affayres of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1886:141"/>The fift poynt is, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the very true eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall ſenate, cannot, nor may not vſe it at their wyls, as we ſee al men be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to many infirmities. But this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is lymitted &amp; appointed by the worde of God. And for this cauſe Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles deſpiſed the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of the Scrybes &amp; Phariſees <note n="f" place="margin">Iohn. 16. and. 10</note>. And according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, Irene a moſt auncient Biſhop of Lyons, reproued ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye ſharplye the temerious excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which Victor Biſhoppe of Rome made, about the yeere of God, a hundred nynetie and eight, which declareth very well what was the primatiue or firſt be gynninge of the Byſhoppes of Rome, where as then they walked in vpryght conſcience. And there were other Byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vnderſtoode their office: and one of the cauſes that the prouincial and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall counſels were ordained and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for, was to heare and decide the cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe whiche complayned of theyr paſtors <note n="g" place="margin">Canon. 5. c firſt counſell of Nice.</note>. Alſo it appeareth ſufficiently thorowout the whole eccleſiaſticall hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorye,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1886:141"/>
howe the Byſhoppes in theſe caſes ought to helpe one another to edy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye without ambition. Beſide this the Metropolitans ought to be content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeues with their lymites, and ought to doo nothyng without the deuiſe of theyr brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their Iuriſdiction <note n="h" place="margin">Canon. 116. of the fyrſt Counſell of Nice, and. 9 Counſell of Antioche.</note>. But am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition hath ſo wrought, that of longe tyme the Biſhops of the principall tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, (and aboue all hée of Rome) hath drawn all to themſelues: witneſſeth the falſehood of Boniface whiche was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and reuealed at the Counſell of<note place="margin">This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, about the yeere. 422</note> Carthage, where as was S. Auguſtine, where it was ordayned that thoſe of the Clergie of Affrica, which appealed ouer the ſea to Rome, ſhould be depoſed from theyr office.</p>
                  <p>For the ſixt poynt it is to bee noted to what end excommunication was orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God. Firſt that the church of God ſhoulde he as pure as might be poſſyble, and that there myght be no occaſion to think, that it ſhould be a refuge or den of the wicked <note n="i" place="margin">1.

                  <p>Fyrſte concerning GOD, I ſaye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that where as they doo ſet foorth the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryts of any creature to pacifie his wrath, they ſpoyle and robbe him of his perfyte righteouſneſſe, the which by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes can not bée perfyte, if hee take for payment eyther all or part of that which maye procéede from a ſinner.

                  <p>Item, they robbe and ſpoyle hym in ſo dooynge of hys perfyte mercie. For conſider: if we can ſatiſfie to GOD in any part or péece, it followeth that he doeth not quitte, or forgeue vs all, but the reſt which remayned. Wherefore I
<pb facs="tcp:1886:147"/>
conclude, that in ſteade of the true God, who is perfitely ryghteous and perfitely mercifull in Ieſus Chriſte, onely as wée haue declared, they worſhippe a dreame and fantaſie of their own bead, to whom they haue geuen the name and tytle of God.</p>

alleadged notoriouſly falſe, and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vniuſtly to thriſe whom they lyſt. As hath heretofore bene ſayde, and partlie alſo made by them ſelues, after theyr owne appetyte, agaynſt God and all the auncient decrées, of whome they woulde ſeeme to be the defenders. Or ſhall it be for that about the yeare. 607.

Or ſhall it bee becauſe that Zacharie and Steuen the ſeconde (for the rewarde of theyr cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">This was done about the yeare. 752.</note> and infamous treaſons) receyued the ſeigniorie of Italye, whiche they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward dyd call the patrimony of ſaint Peter? This ſhall ſuffice them for this tyme: for if it be néedefull to enter into further matter, there is well wherewith to banket them of another ſort.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Cardinals, it were néede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that they ſhoulde fyrſt of all declare
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1886:180"/>
from whence they bee come, the whiche were verye diffycill for them. Certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (if we wyll beléeue the godly iuglyng of that Synode, which they haue attry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Sylueſter Pope) theyr natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dyd begin at Conſtanſtine. But there is yet worſſe, then in ſo long a tyme, and in ſo many Counſels, &amp; ſo many bookes of the auncient Doctours, there is made no more mencion of my Lord Cardinals tytles, then if they had neuer béene hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Wherefore if there were any then, it muſt appeare that their office &amp; charge was very ſmall. And in déede it is euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſene by that which they alledge of Sylueſter, that they were none other but Deacons, that is to ſay, dyſtrybuters of the goodes of the poore, euery one in hys quarter of the Towne of Rome, at that time being deuided in 7. quarters which they called Cardines. It is then no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle<note place="margin">7. quarters of Rome called Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines.</note> though they be not named by ſuch thynges as concerne the affayres of the true doctrine, or the gouernement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wherein they are not ſéene, neyther doo they vnderſtande what it meaneth.
<pb facs="tcp:1886:181"/>
But afterwarde when theyr Byſhoppe was exalted. the Prieſts of Rome would alſo bée a lofte: and by this meanes the name of Cardinall was geuen to them, and their authority encreaſed and grew vp: For it was more then reaſon, but that they ſhoulde haue part of the bootye. And for to hyde or diſſimule theyr origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, they haue agreed to be called. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, as if they were thoſe vpon whom the catholyke Churche were ſtayed, as a gate hangeth vpon his poſt: For Cardo ſignifieth a gate or doore poſte.</p>
                  <p>But they are not determyned to leaue their tytle, ſo long as they adde to them, as Saynt Croſſe, Saynt Sabine, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The which declare yet playne their oryginall and firſte offyce. Yet that not withſtandyng, by a long ſpace, it was thought a ſtraunge thing, that a Cardy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Rome ſhould hold a Biſhoprike, for he could not haue it at Rome, where hée muſt doo hys offyce of Elder, or of Deacon, and ſo féede his flocke. And for to bee a Byſhoppe, and not to preache, was a thyng no leſſe ſtraunge, then to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1886:181"/>
ſée a Shephearde dwell in a Citie, and be called Shephearde, and to receyue the wages, without kéeping or féeding any Sheepe.</p>
                  <p>Farre was it from theyr cuſtome, to bée abſent from theyr charge and offyce, or to haue a Vicar vnder them: and yet leſſe to kéepe them in the courts of kings and Princes, and to be charged with Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byes and Byſhoprikes. But after the horrible confuſion was come, then theyr charges and offyces were conuerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dignities, and my Lorde the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred no better, then by theſe traffykes and meanes to entertaine himſelfe with Kings and Princes, euen by the meanes of his Cardinalles, who of good ryght he calleth his Creatures.

that it is as poſſyble to accorde theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates with the true forme of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churche, as to accorde lyght and darknes, trueth and lyes.</p>
                  <p>I come nowe to the other, which haue more apparence, for as muche as they haue theyr foundation in the ſcrypture: yet notwithſtanding, becauſe they be no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing leſſe, then that whiche they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to what purpoſe doeth theſe names ſerue whiche they beare, but the more to condempne them of falſehoodde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceypt.</p>
                  <p>Wee haue here before declared and ſhewed that there is in all two degrées of Eccleſiaſticall offices, as well for the myniſtration of the woorde of God, as of publyke prayers and Sacramentes, to weete, the offyce of Paſtours and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. Suche was the manner and the cuſtome in all the primatyue Churche. And for as muche as the Paſtoures are deuyded into many degrées, to wéete, Archbyſhoppes, or Metropolytanes, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or Curates, this was not onely in reſpecte to the office of the worde, but in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1886:183"/>
conſyderation of the orderyng of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres which concerneth the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call iuriſdiction, of the whiche wee ſhall ſpeake in his place.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore there is in conſideration of the offyce, to myniſter the doctryne of the Goſpell, no dyfference before God, betwéene the Archbiſhop, the Byſhoppe, and the Curate, ſo that eache of them bée Paſtour of their owne flockes. And for this cauſe bee they all named with the common name of Biſhops. So hath Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles both exercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſpoken, and all their true Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours <note n="a" place="margin">Mark. 18.

As if they conſider al the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Counſels and decrees, concerning the election and the lyfe as wel domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call as publike, of thoſe whom we ſpeake of, they ſhall fynde there and perceyue thinges yet more ſtraight. Nowe then is it poſſyble that the ſtubborne impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of theſe horned beaſtes ſhoulde come ſo farre, to bee called Succeſſours of the Apoſtles, &amp; vaunt them ſelues of names which appertayneth leaſt to them of any men vnder heauen? For who ſet them
<pb facs="tcp:1886:184"/>
in this eſtate? By what doore be they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in? Where is the election &amp; exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all theyr lyfe, according to all right orders both diuine &amp; humaine? Is there one among a hundred of them, that is meete or diſpoſed to thinke only of his charge or offyce, or knoweth certaynly what office and charge he hath, or which onely enquyreth after his flocke? And if there be found one among a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, how doth he occupy himſelfe, but rather to do any other thing, then that which pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to his office? And if of a thouſand Biſhops or Curats in the papiſtry there he founde one which teacheth his people, what doctrine is it but ſuch as is directly againſt the trueth, as we haue declared? And what Sacramentes can hee myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, what orders maye he kéepe, where there is nought but all pollution and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying of the true ſacramentes, and all abhomynable confuſion, as here before hath bene declared? The prouincial cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelles, howe be they kept? Nowe many Archbiſhoppes be there? How many Archbiſhoppes be there? How many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes be there, meete to dyſcerne and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1886:184"/>
geue counſell? Concerning Sinodes of euery Dioceſſe, howe bée they practiſed? Wherefore be the Curates called, but to paye theyr tribute and procurations? What aſſemble, what doctrine, or what order is there?</p>
                  <p>But I wyll demaunde of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own ordinaunces, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one that is excommunicated, ought not to be reiected, and not to be taken as a member of the Churche? Howe much leſſe then ought he to be a Paſtour? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I demaunde of them, if he be not ſuffyciently excommunicated, which is notoriouſlye ſuche a one, as are thoſe whiche Ieſus Chriſte and his Apoſtles commaunde to eſchewe as one infected, or full of peſtilence, and whiche be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſelye entered and mayntayned in the Churche, againſt all the conſtitutions, and ordinaunces of Counſels, Decrées, and auncient Doctours, conformable to the ſcriptures.

For after theyr manner, what is it to bée a Prieſt? It is to haue authoritie to Sacrifice and to offer vp Ieſus Chriſte for the quycke and for the deade: that is to ſaye, in one worde, to turne the rootes vpwarde, as much as in them is, of all the grounde of our ſaluation, as in other places hath bene ſayde. And from thence is it ſprong that of Gouernours, they haue made hyreling Sacrificers for wages. And ſo there is become two ſortes of Prieſtes, that is to weete the Beneficed, and the poore hyrelinges, whiche lyue vnder the other, and bée more buſyed in offeringes aſwell in their dayly butchery for mony, as Iudas was, as alſo affyrming theyr office to ſaue and dampne for money, yea

If they be priuate perſons, let them vnderſtand that where ther is no vnderſtanding or godly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to render a reaſon of his fact, there can be no zeale of God, but a very wilful rygour, for the whiche they ſhall geue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptes.

            </head>
            <p>FOr aſmuch as God is perfectlye ryght<note place="margin">I</note> wyſe and iuſt, and all men wholy and altogether ſinners, then out of theſe two thynges muſt néedes be, that eyther God muſt renounce his ryghteouſnes and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which cannot be, or all men without exception be vtterly loſt and condemned, except they ſatiſfie fullye, and perfectlye the diuine iuſtice.</p>
            <p>But he ſatiſfyeth perfectly the diuine<note place="margin">II</note> iuſtyce, which payeth all that be oweth to God. Wherefore we muſt fyrſt ſeeke what it is that man oweth to God, &amp; then whether he be able to pay him, thyrdly if we cannot finde in our ſelues wherwith to paye him, we muſt ſee then where wée may borowe to paye, that we peryſh not by the iuſt iudgement of God.</p>
            <p>Wherfore to the ende we may knowe<note place="margin">III</note> what it is that man oweth to God, wée muſt conſider the forme and manner of
<pb facs="tcp:1886:198"/>
the oblygation wherein we be bounde in our creation, and what is wrytten in the two tables of the lawe, and then we ſhall fynde that we are bounde to loue God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all thynges, and with all our harte, and our neyghbour as our ſelues. So it is aparent that we owe to be payed perfecte loue to God and to our neyghbours.</p>
            <p>But howe can this be done, if fyrſt we<note place="margin">IIII</note> be not naturally apte and enclyned to doo thys? For experyence teacheth that our nature is cleane contrary to this. For all men of them ſelues or of theyr owne wyll be enclyned rather to hate God and theyr neyghbor, contrary to loue. Nowe if our owne nature draweth vs to hate, howe can we paye the loue which we doo owe?</p>
            <p>Of this we maye gather thrée concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">V</note> that is to ſaye, that all men of theyr owne nature be haters of God being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Then it foloweth that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not onely paye that they do owe, but alſo they bynde them ſelues daylye more and more, and endebte them ſelues by newe ſinnes to the iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, from
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1886:198"/>
whence it followeth neceſſarily, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all men without exception muſt bée condempned, or elſe fynde ſome one that wyll paye theyr debtes.</p>
            <p>Nowe where ſhall we fynde ſuche a<note place="margin">VI</note> pledge or ſuretye that is méete and able to doo it. Certaynlye in no place among the thynges that be created. For if wée ſearche among the Angels, the aunſwere is ready, the Angelles bée not bounde for the ſynne of man. For the ryghteouſnes of God cannot demaunde of the Angelles that which man oweth. And alſo there is ſturred vp the wrathe of God whiche muſt bée borne: and it is certayne that the Angelles them ſelues be not able to beare ſo great a burden.</p>
            <p>But if Angels be inſufficient and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able<note place="margin">VII</note> to beare ſo great a burden, what creature can bee founde that is able to do it? Wherefore we muſt neceſſarily haue refuge to ſome one that is more mightye then all creatures, and alſo that muſt bée very man. For if he be not more mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer then any creature, that is to ſay, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye God, he can not beare the burden of
<pb facs="tcp:1886:199"/>
the wrath and yre of God, but ſhould him ſelf be ouerwhelmed vnder it, then much leſſe could he ſatiſfye for others. And if he be not a man, how ſhould he delyuer man by his ſatiſfaction? It is neceſſarie then that a mediatour be founde which is God and man, and ſuch one is Ieſus Chriſt, as the Chriſtian religion teacheth vs.</p>
            <p>Now let vs ſée whether Ieſus Chriſt<note place="margin">VII</note> be ſuch one that we may fynde in him all that is requiſite to our ſaluation. Fyrſt Ieſus Chriſte is very God, from whence it foloweth that he can be a ſauionr.</p>
            <p>And alſo be is very man, from whence<note place="margin">VIII</note> it followeth that hée is of nature méete to ſuffer that whiche the Iuſtice of God requyreth to be reuenged for the ſinne of man. For if be onely were God he coulde ſuffer nothing, and if he were only man, he ſhould ſinke vnder the burden of Gods wrath. Becauſe he is God and man, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was able to dye, and vanquyſhe death in dying.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, for aſmuch as be is man<note place="margin">IX</note> moſt pure and moſt holy conceiued by the holy ghoſt, this purity being perfect, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1886:199"/>
God. Wherefore we haue in Ieſus Chriſte, a man agréeable &amp; pleaſing vnto God. Nowe out of this puritie ſpringeth two Ryuers, as out of the fountayne or ſpring, that is to ſaye, a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a whole and perfect abſtayning from ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For Ieſus Chriſt very man bath fulfilled all the wyll of God, for as much as hee neuer ſinned in any manner wyſe. Therefore be is moſt iuſt &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, aſwel becauſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall puritie, as of the fruites ſprynging out of the ſame purity and cleanes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we maye with good ryght<note place="margin">X</note> conclude, that we doo fynde onelye in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt perfect remedie againſt all the euyls that doth or mought feare our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or let vs from comming to the glory of God, or might cauſe vs iuſtly to be condempned to eternall death.</p>
            <p>But yet neuertheles we muſt ioygne a<note place="margin">XI</note> condition to this, that is to ſaye, if we doo take or ioyne to vs theſe remedies in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. For as it profiteth not a ſicke perſon to haue a good medicine except bee vſe it, nor a hungry man to be at a tables
<pb facs="tcp:1886:200"/>
end garniſhed with plenty of good meats except he eate of them: lykewiſe be there medies of Ieſus Chriſte againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God and eternal death ſet before vs in vain, except we vſe them. Now we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not vſe them, except firſt we knowe by what maner, &amp; after what ſort it may be done. Wherefore firſt we muſt ſee how Ieſus Chriſt is, &amp; may be applied to our profit &amp; aduantage. Then to declare how Ieſus<note place="margin">XII</note> Chriſt may be applied to our ſaluation &amp; eternall lyfe, we wyl vſe this preface. As it is not in our power to finde a medicine of ſaluation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we not find the maner how to vſe this medicine. For as in the ſicknes of the body, the ſick perſon is paſt al hope of health &amp; vtterly diſpaired, then it is needful for the Phiſition not onely to find and prepare the medicine, but alſo to diſpoſe the ſick perſon ſo as he wyl &amp; may vſe this medicin, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d howe to vſe it: ſo the ſicknes of the ſoule, which is moſt precious aboue althings, &amp; in the which mankind is not onely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but alſo enemies of their owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, then we muſt vnderſtande by the Phiſition of the ſoule what is the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1886:200"/>
then after what maner it muſt be vſed, yea &amp; in ſuch wiſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the ſame Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do prepare &amp; make vs apt and meete y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we both will and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe thoſe remedies which he prepareth and apoynteth to vs.</p>
            <p>God then is he which in the beginning<note place="margin">XIII</note> of the world ſpake by his Angels to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> firſt man, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is to ſay, Adam and others vntyll Moſes, declaring to them the only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſaluation, as before is declared, that is to wéete Ieſus Chriſt, in whom onely we find all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is needful and requiſit to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And after the reiecting of al other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; people made apoyntment w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the poſterity of Abraham, &amp; multiplied them exceedinglye &amp; expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to them his wyll moſt abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly, as it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed in the. x commaundementes of God. &amp; alſo ioyned therto certain ſacrifices and ceremonies, the which dyd not only deuyde the people of God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al other nations, but alſo were certain teſtimonies of Chriſtes coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; of all the things that he ſhould ſuffer, for to delyuer vs from the wrath of God: ſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they myght certaynly truſt and beléeue in hym whiche they hoped ſhoulde come.
<pb facs="tcp:1886:201"/>
Moreouer, becauſe God knewe that the diuel would moue &amp; ſtyrre vp falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which woulde ſpreade foorth theyr lies as the true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of God, he wylled Moyſes and the Prophetes to wryte all that God reuealed to them, to the ende that the falſe Prophetes ſhoulde not ſo eaſily deceyue the people.</p>
            <p>But in the end when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme was come<note place="margin">XIII</note> which he had eternally appoynted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his eternall &amp; infinite wiſedome, he ſent downe and preſented from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his promiſe, that is to ſay, his eternall ſonne, the which tooke vppon him a verye humaine body, by the vertue of the holye ghoſt, of the ſubſtance of the virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ſéede of Abraham and of Dauid, with the whiche body God conioygned a moſt pure and moſt holy ſoule, created by the ſame force of the holy ghoſt. He was made the very mediatour as is ſayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and hath truly fulfilled &amp; accomply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all that was neceſſary to be fulfilled for to reconcyle man vnto God.</p>
            <p>But in the ende when all theſe things<note place="margin">XIII</note> were fulfilled, Ieſus Chriſte aſcended vp
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1886:201"/>
into heauen, and wylled this doctrine not onelye to bee preached by mouth of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles &amp; Euangeliſts, but alſo that theyr handes ſhoulde wryte it in ſuche wyſe, as the Church ſhould haue to the ende of the worlde one certayne doctrine, vppon the which ſhe might ſtay &amp; reſt, and alſo by it might ſeparate moſte clearely the lyes of the falſe Prophets and Antichriſts from the only verity of God, which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded wholy and perfectly in the bookes of the olde and new teſtaments, ſo that it is not lawfull to chaunge any thing, eyther adde to it, or take from it.</p>
            <p>Moreouer this doctrine had bene writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in vayne, if it were not preached and declared faythfully. And man cannot endure nor ſuſtayne the face of God or of Angelles. And God hauing pittie of the ſeede of man, in this poynt hath ordained and conſtytuted Paſtours and Teachers in his Church, by whome he wylled that this doctryne ſhoulde be faythfully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and applyed to the neceſſyties of the Church publykely and partycularly, that man ſhoulde not alledge any ignoraunce
<pb facs="tcp:1886:202"/>
of the wyll of God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to the ende I may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende all theſe things in few wordes, we learne by the mouth of the faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſters of God, which declare his woorde to the church, al that we haue heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be neceſſarie to vnderſtande our myſerie and our ſaluation. And for as much as when the word of God is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto man, it is as if they ſpake vnto inſenſible ſtones, therfore we muſt know that as God worketh to the external ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by his woorde pronounced by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, euen ſo hee worketh inwardly by his infinite power, that is to ſaye, by hys holy ſpirit, whoſe office conſiſteth in theſe effectes here following.</p>
            <p>Fyrſt, that as this parte of Scripture (which is called the law) teſtifieth to our eares, that wée bée moſt myſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners deſeruing eternal death, euen ſo the holy ghoſt teacheth the ſame, and ſixeth it in our conſciences (whiche otherwyſe were dull and inſenſyble) and maketh that we bée touched with the true &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect féeling of our ſinnes, which is the firſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1886:202"/>
ſtep or degrée to ſaluation, as in the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the bodye, it is needefull aboue all thynges, for the recouering of health, to knowe that we be ſicke, and howe gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous our ſickneſſe is, and what maner of ſickneſſe it is.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde effect or worke of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt is vtterly contrary to this afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde. For it afflyeteth vs, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth to vs our damnation by the law, and how the hels be open to deuoure vs. But this agayne doth comfort vs, when the certayne and onelye remedy of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is applyed to our conſcience, which is declared vnto vs by the other parte of the ſcripture which is called the Goſpell, that is to ſaye, the happy and bleſſed meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ſaluation fréely in Ieſus Chriſte, as wee haue declared here before in order at large.</p>
            <p>Now this remedy is applyed by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect and working of the holy Ghoſt. For firſt the holy Ghoſt diſpoſeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellygence, to the vnderſtandyng of the doctrine of the Goſpell, which otherwyſe ſéemeth to the worlde verye foolyſhneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:1886:203"/>
and ſo incontinently after it maketh our ſpirite beléeue that this doctrine of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion freely in Ieſus Chriſte, is not onelye true (for the Diuels know alſo that this doctrine is moſt true, and yet therfore be not ſaued) but alſo that it appertayneth to vs: and thys is it that is called fayth, the which is ſo highly commended in the ſcripture, which is to be vnderſtand whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man doth perſwade himſelf certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſaluation &amp; eternall lyfe doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and partycularly appertaine to him ſelfe, becauſe Ieſus Chriſte is declared to vs in his word vnder thys condition, that we doo taſte of him, and apply him to our ſelues by fayth. It followeth then, that fayth is the only inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by the which as by ones hand ſaluation may be felt and taken in Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore S. Paule ſayd, that we be iuſtyfied by fayth onely, and alſo do lyue by it only: not that fayth is our righteouſnes and life, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by onely fayth we embrace Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and be certayne that he is our ryghteouſneſſe and lyfe. For when any man beléeueth that hee is appoynted and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1886:203"/>
ordained to ſaluation and eternal lyfe in Ieſus Chriſt, incontinent he is made par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taker of all the benefites of Ieſus Chriſt to eternall lyfe: for Ieſus Chryſt is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vs vpon this condition.</p>
            <p>The thyrd effect and worke of the holy ghoſt is fixed and ſet on our harts on this maner, that as he doth vnite and knyt vs into Ieſus Chriſt, as is ſayde before, and that Ieſus Chriſt can not be ydle within vs, it is neceſſary that the ſame holy goſt which engendreth fayth in vs (as is ſayd) do ſanctifie our hartes, that is to ſay, doo conſecrate vs to God. Now this ſancty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication hath two partes, that is to ſaye, the aboliſhing of this corrupt nature and qualytie, which before cauſed the lawe of God to dyſpleaſe vs, and the creation of the new nature or qualytie maketh vs to beginne to wyll and to do cheerefully and couragiouſlye thoſe thynges whiche wee know do pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Nowe this abolyſhing is firſt begun in the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, by the which the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is lightened in ſuch wiſe, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn to know and approue that which we
<pb facs="tcp:1886:204"/>
dyd thinke before was foolyſhneſſe. Then after in the wyll which is conſecrated to God in ſuch wyſe that it hateth ſinne, not for the payne, but for the loue of God, and loueth ryghteouſneſſe, not becauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, but becauſe that righteouſneſſe of it ſelfe pleaſeth God, ſo that if there were not yet death appointed and prepared for ſinners, or eternal life appointed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thoſe which ſtudy to do ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes: yet had hée rather for the loue of God to folow righteouſnes, that is to ſay, to ſerue God holyly, &amp; to loue his neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as his lawe commaundeth, and to endure and ſuffer all maner of paine for his names ſake, then to ſerue the Diuell and his couetouſnes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to the ende that I may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all ſumarily together, howe onely in Ieſus Chriſt we find all that is neceſſary to ſaluation, lykewyſe onely by the holy Ghoſt we aply Ieſus Chriſt to our ſelues by fayth. But becauſe this fayth in the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginning is very ſmall in vs, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that it be increaſed in vs dayly: where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore now we muſt declare by what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1886:204"/>
or meanes it is nooryſhed for to encreaſe more and more in vs. Fyrſt, as it is created in vs by the holy Ghoſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the meanes of the woorde of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is ſowen in our harts, and for that cauſe is compared to ſéede: So lykewyſe it is nooriſhed and encreaſed by the ſame word, when wée heare it dilligentlye and truly preached in the Church of God, and alſo when we reade it in our houſes, and thinke vpon it diligently, &amp; meditate in it day and nyght, forſaking all humane and worldly affections which mought turne vs from God, and holde vs in worldly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Therfore Dauid ſayd he was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, who? not the ritch, not Kings, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Marchauntes, or any other Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of this worlde, but he, that thynketh continually and meditateth diligently in the doctrine of God. Therefore they be called ſtraungers in this worlde, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and marching toward the celeſtiall countrey.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt knowe, that God aydeth and helpeth oure debylyte and weakeneſſe in ſuch ſorte, that not being
<pb facs="tcp:1886:205"/>
content to declare vnto vs by his woorde with what loue he loueth vs in his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, but would alſo ioyne to his word certain outward marks or ſygnes, to the which alſo he added certayne cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or maner of doings, repreſenting (by a certayne manner) to our eyes, and geuing into our handes his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt with all his goodnes and vertues, of the which we haue before ſpoken, to the ende that our faith being ayded &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by theſe helpes, ſhoulde bée more and more confyrmed in vs, to drawe vs nerer to Ieſus Chriſt. Now theſe marks be called in Gréeke myſteries, that is to ſaye, ſecreetes, becauſe that God doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and repreſent to vs by them thinges whiche be verye ſecreete in déede, becauſe man ſhoulde neuer doubt in them, that is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt with all his vertues and goodnes vnto eternall life. But in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine they be called Sacramentes, becauſe of an other manner of vſe of them, of the which we ſhall ſpeake hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now there is in the Church of Chriſte but only two ſacraments, that is to ſaye,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1886:205"/>
Baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper: becauſe that after the aboliſhinge of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the law, and that the ſonne of righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>touſnes is ſproong vp, God woulde not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine wrap vs in a multitude of figures and ſhadowes, but onelye hath ordayned two Sacramentes, and wylled that they ſhould be compoſed &amp; made of moſt ſimple things, that is of water, bread and wine, and that they ſhoulde be celebrated with moſt ſymple Ceremonies, that is with ſprinkling of water, in eating of bread, &amp; drinking of Wine, leaſt that man which of nature is ſore geuen to ſuperſtition, ſhoulde abuſe theſe thinges. For if they ſhould ſee any great preparation or ſome gorgeous or exquiſyte Ceremonies, they woulde ſtaye and be vtterly occupyed in theſe external pomps. And in ſtéede wher they ſhoulde by theſe markes aſcende vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into heauen by faith, and there em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the thinges which to vs are ſigny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by theſe markes and tokens, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe forgetting heauen, would ſtay altogether in theſe outward markes, and there woulde ſearch his ſaluation. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:1886:206"/>
thoſe dyd wholy &amp; altogether corrupt the vſe of the Sacraments, the which not content with the ſimple and bare inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ieſus Chriſte, haue burdened and charged the Churche with infinite Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſo that of a Chriſtianitye, they haue made not onely a Iewery, but alſo a Paganrye.</p>
            <p>The Sacraments be ordayned of God for the ſame and &amp; purpoſe that the woord lyuelye declared is, without Sacrament, that is to ſaye, to be meanes to vs to ſerue and ayde vs more and more to vnite and ioyne vs to Ieſus Chriſte by fayth, the which cannot be wythout the word. For the word declareth to vs, that which God doth repreſent and ratifie by them, for as much as they be diſible ſignes of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall coniunction whiche we haue with Ieſus Chriſte. Nowe there is 4. prynci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall poyntes to conſider in thys matter: the fyrſt what the ſignes bee, the ſeconde what is the thyng ſignifyed and ratifyed by them, the thyrde what is the coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſignes and the thing ſignified, the fowrth howe we may communycate
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1886:206"/>
with the ſignes and the thinges ſignified. The ſignes bée as well thinges néedefull to ſerue vs in the Sacramentes (whiche be water in Baptiſme, bread and wine in the Supper): as be the Ceremonies and manners of doings or ordinances by the woorde of God in the vſe of them, as we ſhall ſaye hereafter.</p>
            <p>The thing ſignified is Ieſus Chriſte with all his goodneſſe, by the which we be united together with him to haue eternal lyfe.</p>
            <p>The ſignes be not tranſported or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into the thing ſignified, but bee conioyned with the ſame, not by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation of certayne woordes, but by the ordynance of Ieſus Chriſte, author of the Sacramentes: and not by a corporall manner, or naturall, but onely ſo as God offereth alwayes ſpyritually, that which is ſignified by the corporall ſignes.</p>
            <p>The meanes to communicate with the ſignes is viſible &amp; naturall, but the thing ſignified, that is Ieſus Chriſte with all his goodneſſe, is receyued ſpyrituallye by fayth onelye, as is ſayde before. Then
<pb facs="tcp:1886:207"/>
it followeth, thoſe that be not in the faith receyue but the bare ſignes, but be neuer theleſſe culpable, as well for that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue but the bare ſigne vnworthely, as alſo for that they haue no reſpect nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to the thing which was offered to them, and ſignifyed, that is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſte with all hys goodneſſe, the whiche they haue reiected by their wyckedneſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſigne of Baptiſme is water, with the whiche wée bée wete according to the ordynance of God, in the name of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the ſonne, and of the holy Ghoſt. The water repreſenteth to vs the bloud of Ieſus Chriſte, which was ſhed for the remyſſion of ſynnes (as the viſible wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſhedde vpon our bodyes) the which ſanctifieth vs to lyue righteouſly, as was ſayde before.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as the Sacramentes ought to procéede after the word, becauſe that the thing for the which they wer or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſignify and zeale into our harts canot be receyued but by fayth, &amp; fayth is geuen to vs thorow the preachyng of the woorde: Yet neuertheles concernyng the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1886:207"/>
yong chyldren of the faythful, we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munycate and receyue them into Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, although as yet they be not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to heare the doctrine, or to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as they ought to doo, if they were come to age, yet neuertheſſe they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the couenant with their fathers, for the which by conſequent the marke or ſigne may not, nor ought not to be denied them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond vſe of Baptiſme is to ioyne vs together to lyue all with one accorde, without changing, putting too, or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the marke or badge we all heare.</p>
            <p>In the holy Supper of the Lorde, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated according to his holy ordinaunce, without changing, or putting too, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhing, the bread is a Sacrament to vs, that is to ſay, a ſeale and marke of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> very body of Ieſus Chriſte, which aſcended vp to the ryght hand of God his father, after his death &amp; reſurrection. The wyne lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe to vs is the Sacrament of the very blood of him which ſhedde it for vs. The breaking of the bread to vs, repreſenteth the precious body of Ieſus Chriſte to bée
<pb facs="tcp:1886:208"/>
broken with the ſorrowes and paynes of death: the powring forth of the wine, the ſhedding of his precious bloud: the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter geuing vs bread &amp; wyne, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Ieſus Chriſt geuing him ſelfe to vs. In that we take, eate, &amp; drinke the breade and wine, teſtifieth to vs, and ſealeth into our hartes, the vnity and knot of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes with Ieſus Chriſte, to poſſeſſe hym more &amp; more with all his goodnes to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lyfe. Not with téeth or mouth, but with true &amp; liuely fayth, which lyfteth vs vp into heauen, ſpyritually to embrace hym (and yet neuertheleſſe moſt truely) whiche is our noriſhment to euerlaſting blyſſe, as the bread and wyne corporallye and viſibly receyued, doth entertayn and nooryſh vs in this corporall lyfe. For we doubt not but God wyll accomplyſhe and fulfyll that whiche hee promyſeth by hys woorde, and offereth by his Sacramentes to all beléeuers.</p>
            <p>The ſecond vſe of the holy ſupper is to vnite vs together as members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, lyke as we do eate of one bread, made of many graines of wheate, and drynk of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1886:208"/>
one Wyne, made of many grapes, to bee partakers with Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And as wée muſt eate daylye to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and preſerue vs in this lyfe, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe it is requiſite to come to this ſpyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Table, as often as is poſſyble, the which cannot be in Baptiſme. For it is ſufficient to be once entred into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> church neuer to depart. Lykewiſe, foraſmuch as it is requyred that euery man proue and examine himſelfe, to wete, publikely and openly to auowe and declare the death of the Lord with thankeſgeuing, in the holy Communion. Alſo it appeareth that it appertayneth not to thoſe that bée not meete to receiue it, to wete litle children, whiche neuertheleſſe be ſaued, foraſmuch as they be compriſed in the couenaunt of ſaluation with theyr fathers: neyther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth it to thoſe whiche bée not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, or do not vnderſtande the law of God, or haue not ſo much profited as to make profeſſion of theyr fayth: nor lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe to thoſe which be declared exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, that is to ſay, throwen out of the communion and company of the faithful,
<pb facs="tcp:1886:209"/>
by the lawful iudgement of the Church.</p>
            <p>Beholde in ſumme what is the doctrine of our ſaluation thorow Ieſus Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the meanes of our faith. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer receyueth this doctrine (the which cannot be, but wher it is faithfully prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, &amp; the Sacraments truly miniſtred, according to the order eſtablyſhed by the worde of God) is a member of the church of Ieſus Chriſt, which is called catholik, that is to ſaye vniuerſall, and out of that Church is no ſaluation. Moreouer, all congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and aſſembles whatſoeuer they bee which hath not thoſe markes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they call them ſelues the Churche of Ieſus Chriſt a thouſande times, what ſoeuer place or ſucceſſion they alledge or ſhew forth, can be no other but the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge of Satan, wherin there is but dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And therfore it is good &amp; néedefull for all men to ſeparate them ſelues, and depart from them according as S. Peter ſayde, ſaue your ſelues from this peruers generation, ſpeaking of Aarons ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and of the Church of Ieruſalem.</p>
