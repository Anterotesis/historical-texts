            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Diet of the Londoners consists</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bread. <hi>P.</hi> 146.</note> 
                  <hi>chiefly of Bread and Meat,</hi> which they use instead of <hi>Herbs. Bread is there as in</hi> Paris, <hi>finer and courser,</hi> according as they take out the Bran. This I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, that whereas we have a great deal of Cabbage, and but a little bit of Meat, they will have Monstrous pieces of Beef; I think they call 'em Rumps, and Buttocks, with a few Carrets, that stand at a distance as if they were fright'd; nay I have seen a thing they call a Sir-Loin, without any Herbs at all, so immense, that a <hi>French Footman</hi> could scarce set it upon the Table.</p>
               <p>They use <hi>very white Salt,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <note place="margin">Salt. <hi>P.</hi> 147.</note> 
                  <hi>I told 'em,</hi> the <hi>Gray Salt of</hi> France <hi>is incomparably better, and more wholesome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Common people feed much upon</hi> Grey Pease, <hi>of which there are great</hi>

most for Supper; for every Night there goes by a Woman crying, <hi>Hot Grey Pease, and Bacon.</hi> Though I take Pease to be too windy for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meat, and am inclinable to believe, that Hot Ox Cheek, and Bak'd War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, cried at the same time may be wholesomer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their Roots differ much from ours,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Turneps. <hi>P.</hi> 149.</note> 
                  <hi>there are no long</hi> Turneps, <hi>but round ones,</hi> Hackney <hi>near</hi> London <hi>it famous for this most excellent Root, they are most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent with boil'd and stew'd Mutton, and sometimes with stew'd Beef.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I sound more <hi>Cabbage</hi> in <hi>London</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cabbage <hi>P.</hi> 150.</note> than I expected, and I saw a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reserves <hi>of old stalks in their publick Gardens.</hi> I ask'd the Reason. I was told the English were Fantastick, as to Herbs, and pulse; that one Trade, or Society of Men, fancied them and Cowcumbers, and that a whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were as much admirers of Beans and Bacon; and this they thought might be the reason of it.</p>

this kind of <hi>Plant,</hi> but I was absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">P. 154.</note> astonish'd to find, as that for <hi>Champignons,</hi> and <hi>Moriglio's,</hi> they were as great strangers to 'em as if they had been bred in <hi>Japan.</hi>

               <p>He promis'd to carry me to the Flesh Market, and there to make me <note place="margin">P. 153.</note> amends, but when I came there alas, there was a Thousand times too much of it, to be good, the sight of such a quantity was enough to surfeit one. I verily believe in my Conscience there were more Oxen, than Cabbages, and more Leggs of Mutton, than Heads of Garlick in the Market. What Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Soupes then must these poor people Eat! <hi>Their Veal,</hi> has not that beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">Soupes. <hi>P.</hi> 157.</note> Redness, which belongs to <hi>ours,</hi> and indeed their mutton seems more like it only it is Fatter, and their Beef is large and Fat, to that degree, that it is almost impossible to Roast it dry enough for to make it fit for any Christian (that has the least of our Country indisposition about him) to Eat it with any safety.</p>

There were several Mountains of <note place="margin">Chine of Beef.</note> this Beef, which they call'd Barons and Chines, which they told me were for one of the Sheriffs.
