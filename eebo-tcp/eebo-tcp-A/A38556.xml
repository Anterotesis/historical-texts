         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

though our houſes be deſtroyed by Fire on earth, our

            <p>In this Chapter we have Promiſes on the one, and
threatnings on the other hand; Promiſes of mercy in
caſe of obedience, and threatnings of miſery in caſe of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105318:6"/>
diſobedience. It's uſual with God to apply Lenitives

Potions. It muſt be a Sun-ſhiny day indeed that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Clouds; and it muſt be a cloudy day indeed,
that's without any ſhining of the Sun. God had done
more for them than he had done for others; he woo'd
them by Promiſes, and he endeavoured to awe them by
threatnings: and when by reaſon of their abominations
he might again and again have broken in upon them
with the fury of his indignation, he was pleaſed to work
for his Names ſake, beſtowing good things upon them,
and with-holding evil things from them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. 14, 22.
But alaſs, Promiſes did not work upon them, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
did not at all prevail with them, and Gods Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

and therefore what was in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Commiſſion is made
good upon us, as to our ſad, ruinated, conſumed and
deſtroyed condition. <hi>I will kindle a Fire in thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words of my Text are a Declaration of Gods
more than ordinary Judgment againſt <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
termed <hi>a Forreſt,</hi> by reaſon of its unfruitfulneſſe;
and <hi>The Forreſt of the South,</hi> as lying Southwards from
<hi>Chaldaea.</hi> You have here, ſad, doleful, and dreadful ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
as never ear heard before, lips expreſſed before,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105318:6"/>
eyes ſaw before, or, in ſome ſence, the hand of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
before. From the firſt to the laſt there is nothing
but woe and miſery, and deſtruction, and deſolation.
Hear O Heavens, and be aſtoniſhed O Earth, yea, be
amazed O you inhabitants of the South, for the Lord
hath ſpoken, yea the Lord ſpeaks, yea by Fire doth the
Lord God contend; <hi>I will kindle a Fire in thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I come more cloſe to the words, wherein we have
obſervable four particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What God will do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What this Fire will do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What they ſhall not be able to do towards
this Fire.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, What they ſhall find and feel by reaſon of
and in this Fire.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What God will do; <hi>I will kindle a Fire in thee.</hi>
Fire is taken in Scripture, amongſt other ſignifications,
either,</p>
            <p>Literally, for a material Fire, conſuming houſes, laying
waſt, and bringing level to the ground good and ſtately
Structures, <hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 10.</p>
            <p>Metaphorically or Typically, for great and ſore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whereby God will ruine and deſtroy us, even as
Fire conſumes and deſtroyes whatſoever it meets with,
<hi>Nah.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
            <p>I can ſee no reaſon but that both, and in particular the
former may be, and that right and appoſite enough, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
here, inasmuch as it was made good in a great
part of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> conflagration when it was taken by
<hi>Nebuchadrezzar,</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> and that
the Church and people of God acknowledge the truth
hereof, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 11. <hi>Lam.</hi> 4, 11. Now this and ſuch Fire
God threatens to kindle, and that in thee; not about
thee, but in thee; not in the skirts, but in the heart;
not in the Suburbs, but in the City; not within the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
Lines of Communication, but in the Center whence
thoſe Lines are drawn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105318:7"/>
Secondly, What this Fire ſhall do. Ah! what ſhould
this Fire do but undoe! and indeed this it doth: <hi>It
ſhall devour every green Tree in thee, and every dry Tree.</hi>
Whether by green Tree you underſtand the Saints, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
compared to Trees that flouriſh; or by dry Tree
you mean the ſinner, compared to Trees that don't flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh:
Or whether by green you take things that are
delightful, or by dry you take things that are needful;
the one being for ornament, the other being for exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
both one and the other ſhall be conſumed in thee,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What they ſhall not be able to do towards
this Fire; <hi>The flaming flame ſhall not be quenched.</hi> He
doth not ſay, they ſhall not endeavour to quench it. In a
common Calamity, who will not put to his helpng hand?
though in our ſad diſaſter I wiſh every one had conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciouſly
diſcharged their duty: But notwithſtanding
their endeavours it ſhall not be quenched. Such, ſuch
ſhall be the rage and violence of it, as that aching hearts
and helping hands, as that, to ſpeak in our dialect and
uſual practice, Buckets, Engines, Ladders, Hooks, the
opening of Pipes, and ſweeping of Channels, ſhall not
avail any thing at all: No, they would not withdraw
the fewel of their corruption, and God would not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the Fire of his indignation. If the ſinner do not
leave off finning before God comes, God will not ſoon
leave off puniſhing when he comes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, What they ſhall find and feel by reaſon of
and in this Fire; <hi>And all faces from the south to the North
ſhall be burnt therein.</hi> None ſhall have cauſe to rejoyce,
but all cauſe to complain and bewail. Do any live in the
Southern parts of the City, they ſhall be burnt? Do any
live in the Northern Parts, and ſo think it will not come
at them? they ſhall likewiſe be burnt, <hi>All faces from
the South to the North.</hi> Alaſs, poor ſinner, how doſt
thou toyl and moyl to build thy neſt! but there is too
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105318:7"/>
much of ſin within, and ſo ſuddenly it's burnt, and thou
it may be, with the Pelican art burnt therein. Thus you
ſee, Beloved, the Parts of a ſad Text.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What God will do; that ſpeaks his Judgment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What the Fire ſhall do; that evidences the
greatneſs, ſoreneſs, and extraordinarineſs of Gods
Judgments.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What they ſhall not be able to do towards
this Fire; that ſhews the irreſiſtibleneſs of thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, What they ſhall find and feel by and in this
Fire; that intimates the univerſalneſs of this ſore, ſad,
diſmal and unuſual Judgment.</p>
            <p>From theſe particulars I might, but muſt not, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
ſeveral Truths to you. I ſhall only preſent you
with one as ſuitable to the occaſion; and Oh my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
my bowels, that there is ſuch an occaſion to preſent
you with this Truth and Doctrinal Obſervation.</p>
            <p>God is ſomtimes more than ordinary in his ſore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon a Nation or City.</p>
            <p>God will not alwayes bear with a ſinful Nation and
City, but let them know what abuſed mercy, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
Grace, and provoked Juſtice, and an incenſed
God means. God ſomtimes whips a Nation with ſome
ſmall twigs, when at other times he ſcourges it with
Scorpions: God ſomtimes layes upon it his gentle hand
of correction, when at other times he pours forth the
Vials of his indignation. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.
10, 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 19. 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Ezek.</hi>
2. 9, 10. By all thoſe places you ſee, that the Sun of
proſperity doth not alwayes ſhine in a Nations Horizon;
I, and ſomtimes it's hid in ſuch a dark cloud, as that all
faces gather paleneſs, the hearts of <hi>Adams</hi> children rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to fail, and they are within a ſtep or two of being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105318:8"/>
utterly ruined and undone. Oh how many places have
found God more than ordinary in his Judgments, who
little thought that he would have been ſuch a God of
Judgment. Little did <hi>Sodom</hi> think of a fiery rainy day,
when they had ſuch a Sunſhiny morning. Ah how art
thou poor <hi>London</hi> a ſad inſtance and evidence of the
truth of this Doctrine, when in the midſt of thy ſecurity
thou art overtaken with unparallel'd miſery. But to
methodiſe a little, what as to this, though conſtrained,
muſt be ſpoke unto, I ſhall</p>
            <p>Firſt, Inſtance in ſome of thoſe ſore and great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherewith God puniſheth a Nation or City.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Diſcover unto you what thoſe times are,
wherein God is more than ordinary in his ſore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon a Nation and City.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Study to give you an account, as near as I
can, with the Spirit's and Scriptures aſſiſtance, why it is
that God is ſo eminent and extraordinary in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, See what improvement may be made of it
by way of Application; and in all have reference to
Gods late proceedings, eſpecially as to that ſore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Fire.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt, I ſhall name, amongſt others, four
ſore Judgments, which God inflicts upon a Nation and
City.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>Plague.</hi> Gods hand hath been, and that
ſo ſevere as to this Judgment, as that the greateſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt
cannot but acknowledg him a God of Judgment.
When God takes away here one, and there another,
it's not much; but when God leaves but here and there
one amongſt thoſe many thouſands that be taken away,
that is much indeed, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 14. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Jer.</hi>
42. 17. If an Atheiſt do not ſee the works of Gods hand,
let him but go to the places of Interment, and he may
ſee Gods handy work. I bleſs God for his goodneſs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105318:8"/>
towards me in the midſt of thoſe many thouſands
deſtroyed round about me. I have ſeen <hi>Londons</hi> health
exchanged into ſickneſs, fulneſs into emptineſs, &amp; where
one could not paſs for Inhabitants, no Inhabitants at
all to paſs by; and God forbid that any one ſhould not
ſay, God hath done more than he hath done before.
<hi>London</hi>'s Peſtilential Viſitation, cannot but be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Gods more than ordinary Judicial diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Certainly, God did ride his Circuit in Judgment,
when the Judgments of God did thus ride their Circuit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Sword.</hi> When God hath furbiſhed the
Sword in his hand, it can't but be an evidence of the
ſore diſpleaſure of his heart. I hope you will take the
Judgment of God to be truth as to this; and what is
the truth of his Judgment, but that it's the ſeverity of
his Judgment, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 5. Ch. 25. 15, 29. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 10.
And therefore conſult, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 35, 36.
Ah how do Chriſtians complain of the loſs of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
who having eſcaped the fury of the Peſtilence,
have not eſcaped the edg of the Sword. Certainly, It
cannot but be a ſeverity, though not parallel to our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
to be preſerved from the Plague, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerved
to the Sword. They who ſpiritually have not
known God, have looked upon the Sword as a ſore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Judgment from God. Oh how ſore and how ſoon muſt
that place needs be undone, in reference whereunto God
ſaith, <hi>The Sword, the Sword is drawn for the ſlaughter, it's
forbiſhed to conſume becauſe of the glittering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Famine When the figtree don't bloſſom; &amp; there
is no fruit in the Vine, when the labour of the Olive failes
and the fields yeeld no meat, when the flock is cut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> off
from the fold, and there is no heard in the ſtalls.</hi> Too too
many have turned their fulneſs into ſinfulneſs, and God,
hath turned their fulneſs into emptineſs. Thoſe that
commonly are wanton under mercies are not like to
have thoſe mercies continued long in Common. What
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105318:9"/>
was <hi>Judahs</hi> ſin but fulneſs of bread; and God ſoon
made even with her in giving her cleanneſs of teeth. In
<hi>England</hi> there was a Famine of three years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and the ſame ſo violent, that not only many died
daily for hunger, but great numbers joyning hand in
hand threw themſelves head-long into the Sea. In <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria
the famine was ſo great, as that an Aſſes head
was ſold</hi> for fourſcore pieces of ſilver, and the fourth
part of a cab of <hi>Doves</hi> dung for five pieces of ſilver.
And therefore what ſaith God? <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Ezek:</hi> 5. 16,
17. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 14. 16, 18. It's good, Chriſtians, to make
much of a little. It's great impiety to ſin much in much;
and ſo 'tis great &amp; righteous ſeverity not to have either
little or much. God is the great houſe-keeper of the
world, and for him to let his family ſtarve, his creatures
pine away, and thoſe that had their dependance upon
him to have no ſuſtinance and allowance at all from
him. Ah thoſe that have felt any thing as to this, have
found it ſad enough when God at any time brought
this Judgment upon them. If as yet <hi>London</hi> there be
not this calamity, the Lord grant that this calamity
may never be.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Fire.</hi> Fire and Water are proverbially ſaid to
be <hi>good ſervants, but bad maſters.</hi> Both are good enough,
whilſt within their limits, but bad enough God know's
when got beyond their bounds. It's uſual with God
in Scripture to ſet forth the greatneſs of his wrath by
Fire and fiery indignation. God when eminently
he would avenge himſelfe on <hi>Sodom</hi> for their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it was by raining Fire and brimſtone from
heaven. What can be more terrible to man than
Fire? and therefore how ſore and terrible muſt needs
thoſe Judgments be that are inflicted by Fire! <hi>Ezek:</hi>
20. 47. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17. 29. Ch. 15. 14. <hi>Lamen.</hi> 4. 11. God is
great in this Judgment; and oh how great muſt needs
this Judgment be, when <hi>London</hi> that lately was is no
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105318:9"/>
more, and ſhe that gloried in the ſtatelineſs of her ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
hath now none of thoſe ſtructures to glory in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I, thy houſes are burnt, thy Churches conſumed, thy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Judicature ruined, thy Halls and Pinacles brought
low, even to the ground, I, thoſe that ſee thee cannot
but bemoan thee; that paſs by thee, can't but pity thee;
they that know thee cannot but ſay (and alas poore
<hi>London</hi> for it) <hi>Is this the joyous City, whoſe antiquity
was of ancient dayes? Whoſe Merchants were Princes,
and whoſe traffiquers the honourable of the Earth! Iſa.</hi> 23.
7. 8. My beloved, our eyes have ſeen, our goods and
eſtates have found, and our perſons have experienced
the greatneſs of Gods Judgment, when he hath made a
<hi>City an heap, and a ruine of a defenced City, Iſa.</hi> 25. 2.
Thus much as to the firſt thing propoſed, which I ſhall
cloſe with recommending to your peruſall, as ſutable
enough to our condition, and whereby you may ſee
the ſence of God as to thoſe former ſevere judgements,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 17, 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing premiſed, is to ſhew what thoſe
times are wherein God is more than ordinary in his
judgements upon a Nation and City: And as to this
I ſhall in plainneſs, and I hope, faithfully inſtance in
theſe following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Times of more then ordinary iniquity.</hi> Times
of more then ordinary abomination are times of
more then ordinary deſolation. Though God may bear
with peccadilloes, and not preſently evidence his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
from heaven; yet when perſons ſin in heavens
face as to groſs enormities, he will ſtretch out hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
hand as to ſore calamities. Sin is a cloud in the
ayre; the more it's thickened with vapours from the
earth, the more the cloud empties it ſelfe into diſmall
ſhowers and ſtormes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5. 5, 6, 7, 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 5, 13,
14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 18, 19, 20. When the <hi>Amorites</hi> cup was
full as to iniquity, the <hi>Amorites</hi> cup did not remain
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105318:10"/>
long empty as to calamity: Oh <hi>London,</hi> hadſt not thou
been more then ordinary as to thy abomination, God
would not have been more then ordinary as to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and deſolation. It is a remarkable expreſſion,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 20, 21. And therefore ſee, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 6. If wee
goe on in <hi>Sodoms defilement,</hi> we ſhall not go without
<hi>Sodoms puniſhment;</hi> and if wee outgoe <hi>Sodom</hi> as to <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
wee ſhall outgoe <hi>Sodom</hi> as to <hi>Calamity.</hi> We
are fallen into ſad times as to ſufferings, I, and we were
fallen into ſad times as to ſinning; we commit thoſe
ſins againſt God, which wee committed not before,
and ſo wee have undergone thoſe puniſhments from
God, which were not undergone before: The ready
way for a Nation and City to be undone by calamity, is
to doe all manner of iniquity. That is the firſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Times of oppreſſion and cruelty.</hi> It's an
hard thing for us to be hard-hearted, and God to be
tender-hearted; when we put off the <hi>heart</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
God will put out the <hi>hand</hi> of ſeverity; when
we doe what we can to bring others under the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
God will bring thoſe hatches upon us. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I hear poor oppreſſed ſouls crying out in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of their Spirit, and there is none to help; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I hear poor ſouls crying out, <hi>Bread, Bread for the
Lords ſake.</hi> And therefore look to it <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe
remaines of <hi>London,</hi> for if no repentance as to this,
there is ſure to be vengeance as to this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 16, 17.
<hi>Micah.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4. And therefore thoſe expreſſions in
<hi>Amos</hi> cannot but muſt be obſerved, <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11,
12. The cryes of poor oppreſſed ſoules ſo pierce Gods
eares, as that they cannot but work upon Gods heart.
I could wiſh I had not ſeen ſo much of <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and I am
confident I ſhould not have ſeen ſo much of <hi>calamity:</hi>
What hath been thy ſin, <hi>London,</hi> as to this but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion?
and therefore how deſervedly puniſhed! Oh
if you that are preſerved goe on in your rigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105318:10"/>
in your unheard of Fines, and your high, ah
too high Rents. You that now Lett your houſes, ere long
may have no houſes at all to Lett: To make an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of your ſuffering brethren, will but be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
to your ſelves in your ſufferings. If we
drink out of <hi>Babylons</hi> cup as to cruelty, we ſhall drink
out of <hi>Babylons</hi> cup as to calamity. That's the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Times of Pride and Arrogancy.</hi> God will
ſoon bring thoſe low enough, that think they can never
be high enough. God will make thoſe remember they
are but duſt and aſhes, that forget themſelves to be duſt
and aſhes. When perſons deface the Image of God
which is <hi>Humility,</hi> God will maintaine his power and
authority in their <hi>Calamity. Herods</hi> heart was no ſooner
lift up againſt God, but Gods hand was as ſoon lifted
up againſt <hi>Herod, Iſa.</hi> 16. 6. 3. 10. 24. Humility is
one of the beſt jewels in a Nations Crown: Its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
a political body ſhould be in a good <hi>Craſis</hi> and
conſtitution, whileſt ſwelled with this Tympany of
pride. Oh God cannot bear with this ſin of pride in
perſons, or that perſons ſhould pride themſelves in this
ſin. If we don't lay our ſelves at Gods feet, in a way
of Humility, God will lay us at others in a way of
miſery; I, thou haſt prided thy ſelf in what thou hadſt,
and God hath ſent a ſore Judgement of fire to remove
what thou hadſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 31, 32. Remember oh you
daughters of <hi>London,</hi> remember your ſin in this, when
they that did feed delicately are deſolate in the ſtreets,
and they that were brought up in Scarlet, Alas, alas, now
embrace dunghills. If we ruffle it up and down the
ſtreets with thoſe garments, for which we are ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
in heavens debtbook, God will ſoon ſend ſome
ſore Judgement or other as a Serjeant to arreſt us. How
much better is it for us to be humbled that we may be
exalted, then to be exalted that we ſhould be humbled!
Arrogancy turned the Angels out of heaven into hell,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105318:11"/>
and Humility turnes perſons out of hell into heaven.
That's the third.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Times of carnall confidence and Reliancy.</hi>
When we look for help more from man then from God,
and aſſiſtance from the creature more then from the
Creator, and comfort from broken Cyſternes more then
from the fountaine of living waters. The ſin of carnall
Confidence is ſure to be attended with more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Vengeance. God will let us ſee the creatures
emptineſs in our ruine and miſery, if we look to the
creatures fullneſs for our ſafety and ſecurity. If we lay
Gods honour in the duſt, in giving that to man which
is Gods, God will lay our honour in the duſt in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to be diſhonoured by man, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 15, 16,
17. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8. laſt. I would willingly be reſolved in
this queſtion, Whether ever the Nation was leſs in
it's ſufferings from God, then when leaſt in it's depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon man? Thou truſteſt not a little in thy much
cuſtomed ſhop, well repleniſhed warehouſes, full and
crowded Congregations, and in thy great practiſe; &amp; ſo
God kindles a fire, and thy ſhop's deſtroyed, thy ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes
ruined, thy Churches conſumed, and thy patients
ſcattered and diſperſed. My beloved, God will be
ſought unto in all we doe; and if we are ſo far of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him as that it's ſomething elſe, alas what miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
have and will not break in upon us! Never needſt
thou have feared, <hi>London,</hi> I, and never wouldſt thou
have felt this calamity, if thou hadſt but come to this,
It's God and God alone, and not man that is my ſafety,
and ſecurity: They that won't make uſe of God as a
place of refuge in time of trouble, will finde trouble e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in their times, and the inlet to all their troubles
<hi>this,</hi> their not dependance on God. That's the
fourth.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Times of heedleſneſs and ſecurity.</hi> Times
full of ſecurity are commonly times full of calamity:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105318:11"/>
we are never nearer deſtruction, then when we are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
from it in our apprehenſion. God would have us
ſenſible of judgements threatned, as not knowing how
ſoon they may be inflicted; but if we put the evil day
far from us, the more ſore and ſudden it's ſure to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 13, 14. <hi>Micah.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. 6.</p>
            <p>Little did <hi>Dives</hi> think of his ſouls being required,
when he ſang ſuch a lullaby, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, thou
haſt goods laid up for many years. Agag</hi> cryes out in
the fondneſs of his Spirit, <hi>ſurely the bitterneſs of death
is paſt,</hi> when on a ſudden hewen in pieces. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
Chriſtians, ah you cannot but remember
Gods ſore judgement of the Plague; and were we not
ready to ſay, Oh now God hath done with us? I, we
ſoothed our ſelves in all being well, we cryed, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of death is paſt, we ranted it up and down the
Taverns, Oh a ſevere judgement cannot overtake us;
and behold, where the Plague left us, there the Fire
found us; and how, Alas, are we brought to the ground
that did dwell ſecurely! I, thou tookeſt many a ſweet
nap in thy downy bed of ſecurity, and on a ſudden
thou art awakened with this dreadfull Fire about thine
ears. Oh that we were awakened to our duty by this
calamity: I pray, Sirs, Let me tell you, that the onely
way to be ſafe is not to be ſecure. God will, and he hath
already diſappointed us in our delighted inſecurity,
in laying on us thoſe not delighted in fiery calamities.
That's the fifth.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Times of Sabboth unobſervancy.</hi> When per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
make light of Gods own inſtitution, God will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himſelf in our ruine and deſolation: God hath
ſet apart this day for his own uſe, but if we abuſe it,
God will be ſure to abaſe us for it. <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> would
not reſpite <hi>Haman</hi> at all, when, in his judgement, he
would offer violence to his Queen. The Sabboth is
the queen of days; and therefore when he ſees we offer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105318:12"/>
violence to her by our looſeneſs and prophaneneſs, by
our <hi>Moore-fields-walkes</hi> and <hi>Hide-park Recreations,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
ſhall be done upon us. How many places have
been eminent in their ſinnings as to this, who have
been eminent in their ſufferings as to this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 29.
I pray, when was the Sabboth more prophaned within
theſe late years then now? and therefore how ſeverely
and juſtly hath God puniſhed us on the Sabboth! If
thy Sabboths be continued to thee, I wiſh they may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be ſanctified by thee; If we doe the work of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
on Gods day, God will doe his ſtrange work of
ſeverity on his and our day. That's the ſixth.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Times of Popery and Idolatry.</hi> The great
quarrell God hath with his people is their being an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatiſing
people; and though God may bear with
them as to other backſlidings, yet when it comes to
this, <hi>Baal</hi> and not the God of <hi>Eliah;</hi> the language of
<hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and not the language of <hi>Canaan; Bethaven</hi> and
not <hi>Bethel,</hi> God will not bear with them. God is ſo far
of giving his power to graven Images, as that they are
ſure to be deſtroyed, I, and the ſupporters and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of them ſhall fall with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 8.
<hi>Hoſea</hi> 8. laſt. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 18, 19, 20. I could wiſh that what
of Popery and Idolatry there hath been and is, were
ſuppreſſed; it may be we ſhould then not have been
deſtroyed: How much better it is to ſtub up thoſe
bryers and thorns, which if let alone, may ſet on fire
the talleſt Cedars in our <hi>Lebanon.</hi> The Jews will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to this day, that in all thoſe judgements
that have befallen them, there is an ounce of the golden
Calfe made by their forefathers in the wilderneſs.
That's the ſeventh.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>Times of Remiſneſs in the Miniſtry.</hi> When
thoſe that ſhould tread out, tread down the Corn; that
ſhould be labourers, are loyterers; that ſhould tell <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
of her ſins, and <hi>London</hi> of her iniquities, cry peace,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105318:12"/>
peace, healing but ſlightly the wound of the Sons of
<hi>Sion,</hi> and the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem, Lament.</hi> 4. 11, 13.
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 25, 26, 31. That body cannot be long in a
good conſtitution, whoſe more noble and eſſentiall
parts are in a conſumption. God ſoon left the <hi>Jews</hi> houſe
deſolate unto them, and them unto it, when from the
Prophets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> prophaneſs went forth into all the
Land, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 15. One may well write, Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon a Nation, when thoſe that are Angels in their
Function and Profeſſion, are far of being Angels in their
Lives and Converſation. That's the eighth.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>Times of Incorrigibleneſs, notwithſtanding
former miſery.</hi> Incorrigible times are miſerable times.
Times of continued <hi>abomination</hi> are times of renewed
and encreaſed <hi>deſolation.</hi> What can be thought of that
Nation that hath been twenty years and upwards in
the furnace of <hi>affliction,</hi> and no removall at all of the
droſs of <hi>Corruption?</hi> The patient not recovered by
milder, muſt undergoe ſharper and more ſevere medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 27, 28. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11. The <hi>Sword,</hi>
my beloved, was ſheathed for ſeverall years in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
bowels, and we are not reformed; we have been
under <hi>turnings</hi> upon <hi>turnings,</hi> and under powrings
forth from one veſſell into another, and not reformed;
the <hi>Plague</hi> hath been in the midſt of us, and yet not
reclaimed, the <hi>Sword</hi> hath been and is ſtill furbiſhed in
in Gods hand, and no amendment; and therefore God
is come now with this dreadfull Judgement of
<hi>Fire,</hi> and hath made ſuch a deſolation in the midſt of
us. I dare appeal to any perſon concerning the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of Gods proceedings, though never ſo rigorous
on all thoſe, who through the abatement of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being returned to their poſſeſſions, eſtates, and
grandeur, both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> return again to
their corruption. If we continue acting ſuch <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
God will be ſure to act a ſeverer <hi>Tragedy</hi> upon us,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105318:13"/>
then ever yet hath been acted. Hadſt thou ere this but
turned ſin out of thy <hi>houſe by repentance,</hi> God would
not have turned thee out of thy <hi>houſe by this fiery Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</hi>
That's the ninth.</p>
            <p>The third thing propoſed, is to give an account of the
Doctrine, why God is more than ordinary in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon a Nation and City; and thoſe I humbly
conceive to be theſe following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That thereby he may evidence <hi>his Soveraignty.</hi>
If we don't acknowledg his dominion over us in a way
of <hi>Reformation,</hi> God will make us feel his dominion
over us in a way of <hi>deſolation.</hi> The Soveraignty of God
is the Scepter in his hand; if we don't fall down before
it in a ſubmiſſive and pious <hi>adoration,</hi> God will cauſe
it to fall upon us to our diſmal ruine and <hi>deſtruction.</hi>
Hath God taken away thouſands, and ten thouſands,
in the midſt of us? it's no more than what he may: Hath
God continued his Viſitation from City to County, and
from one County to another? it's no more than what
he may. Hath God forbiſhed the Sword in his hand,
and given it a Commiſſion to devour? It's no more
than what he may. Hath God deſtroyed our <hi>Houſes,</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iued
our <hi>Churches,</hi> turned us out of our <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> and
levelled our ſtately Monuments of antiquity and glory
even with the ground? It's no more than what he may.
And when he hath done all this, he may ſtill do more,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 58. two laſt verſes. Ch. 20. 48. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30. 8. Oh
the ſoreſt Judgments that a poor Place can poſſibly lye
under, are but the demonſtrations of his Prerogative,
the <hi>Noneſuch</hi> of the World. Alas, we take God every
way to be like unto us, but God will evidence himſelf to
be every way above us. God will not give his Glory to
another, but rather ſtain the beauty of the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<hi>(how much more of a particular City)</hi> than that
there ſhould be any flaw in the leaſt Jewel belonging to
the Crown of Heaven, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:105318:13"/>
Secondly, That thereby he may <hi>deſtroy the workers of
iniquity.</hi> He will not alwayes <hi>ſuffer</hi> the <hi>earth</hi> to bear
thoſe who could not bear with him on the <hi>earth.</hi> As to
theſe God will empty the earth in a way of <hi>deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
who would otherwiſe fill the earth with their <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
Who are the Caterpillars of a Nation, if not
the contemners of holineſs, and practitioners of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs?
And it's not every miſling rain, but ſtorms
and ſhowrs muſt be their ruine. It's not every potion
that preſently removes the bodies peccant-humours.
God as a wiſe Phyſitian ſo tempers his Providential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
in the cup of affliction, as that indeed they
ſhall do the work, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31. 2. Ch. 10. 16, 17,
18, 19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 24, 25. I hope, <hi>London,</hi> God will doe
thee good by this <hi>fiery Calamity,</hi> when thereby thoſe
may be removed, that ſpiritually are enemies to thy
<hi>proſperity.</hi> I know in a common calamity the good may
be removed, but it's the bad that indeed ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
I am apt to think that the work of God at
preſent in this and other Nations, is to ſuffer thoſe no
longer to live in the <hi>world,</hi> that care not at all for living
to the <hi>Creator of the World.</hi> Remember, Sirs, and I pray
don't forget it, God will here maintain his own glory, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the <hi>Sinners Converſion,</hi> or the <hi>Sinners Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That thereby he may <hi>procure to his people
ſafety.</hi> God works his peoples recovery out of ſore
troubles and miſeries; and is ſo far from <hi>undoing</hi> them,
as that others ſhall be undone, that they may not be
<hi>undone.</hi> The ſame Cloud of Providence that hath <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
on the one, hath <hi>brightneſs</hi> on the other ſide. The
ſhowres that deſtroy the <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> refreſh the <hi>dry and
parched Gardens.</hi> When <hi>Egypt</hi> was puniſhed, it was that
<hi>Iſrael</hi> might be delivered. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. two laſt verſes.
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 23, 24. <hi>Nah.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Gods people, though
they have lived in ſad times, yet have they found the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105318:14"/>
reſult of thoſe ſad times to be for their advantage; and
that God hath puniſhed the Inhabitants of the earth,
that they might not be ſo much haraſſed by them. God
will bring his peoples <hi>ſettlements</hi> out of the greateſt
<hi>diſſettlements,</hi> and will not think much to ſhake Heaven
and Earth, that the deſire of all fleſh may come. Lord,
had not I been undone by this <hi>temporal-Fire,</hi> I ſhould
have been undone by <hi>eternal fire.</hi> I hope <hi>London,</hi> thou
wilt eſteem thoſe that are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in ſincerity, ſeeing
ſuch ſore evils have befallen thee from the God of thoſe
<hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The Fire that conſumes the Droſs, makes
way for the Golds brightneſs. It was high time for the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> to let the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> go, when they were upon
the poynt of being utterly ruined and undone.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That there may be an <hi>acknowledgment of
his own Glory;</hi> the glory of his <hi>greatneſs</hi> in deſtroying ſo
much, and the glory of his <hi>goodneſs</hi> in deſtroying no
more; the glory of his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in dealing ſo ſeverely,
and the glory of his <hi>Mercy</hi> in dealing ſo favourably. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
don't obſerve God in his ordinary proceedings of
Judgment, and therefore he will be more than ordinary
in his judicial proceedings, that he may be obſerved.
The Seas uſual keeping its courſe don't engage perſons
admiration, as it's unexpected and unaccuſtomed Tydes.
It's not the Fire in the <hi>Chimney,</hi> as on the <hi>Houſe top,</hi>
that makes perſons to look about them. For two at a
Mill, the one to be <hi>taken,</hi> and the other <hi>left!</hi> for two
in the field, the one to be <hi>taken,</hi> and the other <hi>left!</hi> for
ſeveral to be in a Family, and ſo many <hi>removed,</hi> and thee
to be <hi>continued!</hi> for thouſands to be taken away in a
<hi>Fight,</hi> and thou to be <hi>ſpared!</hi> for ſo many thouſand
<hi>houſes</hi> to be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and thine eſcape the flames rage
and violence! God had power enough to deſtroy me
and my houſe; and for both to be preſerved! There
could not but be a more than ordinary obſervance of
God in dealing ſo <hi>favourably</hi> with <hi>Zoar,</hi> when he dealt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105318:14"/>
ſo ſeverely with <hi>Sodom.</hi> For any of you, and your hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to be as ſo many brands pluckt out of the burning.
when thouſands are not only ſcorched, but conſumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Who, oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who under more than ordinary experiences
of <hi>mercy,</hi> can otherwiſe than obſerve God under more
than ordinary proceedings of <hi>ſeverity?</hi> Hath God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
a third part and more of the <hi>City</hi> by Fire? why
that which <hi>remains,</hi> and all the <hi>Suburbs</hi> at the ſame time
might have been <hi>deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, That others may be warned by Gods <hi>ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
God would have his <hi>Judgments</hi> be <hi>advertiſements;</hi>
the Rod of <hi>Correction</hi> to be a Rod of <hi>Inſtruction;</hi> and
every <hi>luſh</hi> to be a <hi>leſſon.</hi> We don't care for coming into
that houſe, that ſtill hath the ſent of Fire. Puniſhments
inflicted for ſin, are often more diſſwaſive from ſin, than
Gods <hi>commands</hi> on the one hand, and his <hi>threatnings</hi>
on the other hand. It's uſual for others to be puniſhed,
that Princes children may thereby be warned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.
God makes ſome <hi>Monuments</hi> of his <hi>ſeverity,</hi>
that thereby others may not be <hi>Practitioners</hi> of <hi>iniquity.</hi>
What is it that God ſaith to others by <hi>Londons Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration?</hi>
Oh have a care of <hi>Londons abomination.</hi> If
you partake of <hi>London,</hi> as to its <hi>ſinning,</hi> you ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of <hi>London</hi> as to it's <hi>ſuffering.</hi> Remember'd <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.
6. God by this terrible ſound of the Trumpet alarums
others, that they may look about them. God hath no
ſmall intendments of <hi>mercy</hi> to ſome, in his intendments
of <hi>miſery</hi> on others. It's high time for me to remove
my combuſtible matter, when my neighbours houſe is
on Fire round about me. If God hath made the City a
<hi>Elaming Beacon,</hi> Oh ſee and fear, and do no more ſo
wickedly.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That ſo a Nation may be <hi>reformed,</hi> &amp; not meet
with utter <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>miſery.</hi> God is ſo far from delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Nations deſtruction, as that he comes again and
again in a way of <hi>Judgment,</hi> in hopes of a timely <hi>amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:105318:15"/>
God had rather ſee a Nation famous for <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
than that it ſhould be famous for <hi>deſolation.</hi> Gods
greateſt ſeverities as to this are not ſeverities, when they
are only preventive as to that ſeverity, which is utter
ruine and miſery, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 11. 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 29, 30. <hi>Ezek.</hi>
24. 6, 7. It's true, and alas, who will not acknowledge
that God hath dealt ſeverely with <hi>London?</hi> and yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he deals not <hi>ſeverely,</hi> in that he may not deal more <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely.</hi>
Who knows but that <hi>Londons deſtruction</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
may keep off <hi>Englands</hi> total <hi>deſolation?</hi> God
comes with the <hi>Plague,</hi> and that don't work; God comes
with the <hi>Sword,</hi> &amp; that don't work; at laſt he comes with
a <hi>Fiery Judgment,</hi> that ſo he may not come with this,
<hi>London adieu,</hi> and <hi>England Farewel,</hi> thy houſe is left
deſolate unto thee, and thou art left deſolate without
an houſe. Remember, that this <hi>Fiery Rod</hi> on thy <hi>back,</hi>
is only that the rope thereby may be kept from thy <hi>neck.</hi>
We complain of bad times; and why are the times ſo
bad, but that if poſſibly the times may not be worſe?
How many would have been undone to all <hi>Eternity,</hi> if
they had not been undone on this ſide <hi>Eternity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much as to this Doctrinal conſideration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hath been ſhewed what Gods Judgments are, what
commonly are the times of Gods Judgments, and what
the reaſons, why God is ſo much in thoſe Judgments.
We come now to the improvement of it by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p>Application.</p>
            <p>Is God more than ordinary ſomtimes in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon a Nation and City? then I obſerve for <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That God is not an <hi>approver of ſin</hi> in a Nation.
A Nation may be guilty of many <hi>abominations,</hi> but none
of all thoſe abominations have Gods <hi>approbation.</hi> I, there
may be, and is, wickedneſs, looſneſs, and profaneneſs;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105318:15"/>
there may be, and is, hypocriſie, formality, and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
and they that think God is <hi>taken</hi> with theſe, are
much <hi>miſtaken</hi> as to God. Thoſe Judgments inflicted
by God upon a Nation, are ſufficient evidences of his not
approving ſin in a Nation. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>And canſt not
look on iniquity. Jer.</hi> 5. 29. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 18, 19, 20. You
know the Father brings the child under the Rod, becauſe
he delights not in the childs wallowing in the mire.
Why is ſo much evil brought upon <hi>London,</hi> but that
God abhors the evil ſo much committed in <hi>London?</hi> It
would be hard meaſure for a poor place to lye under ſo
many miſeries, the <hi>Plague,</hi> the <hi>Sword, Deadneſs</hi> of <hi>Trade,
want</hi> of <hi>imployment,</hi> and laſtly, this <hi>dreadful Judgment of
Fire,</hi> if all this while God was delighted with its ſins.
I dare ſay the greateſt quarrel God hath with this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is becauſe of its abomination.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God then is of an <hi>unlimited Power</hi> in his
proceedings of Judgment. Judgments upon a Nation
are not ſo <hi>few,</hi> but they may be <hi>more;</hi> and they are not
ſo <hi>ſevere,</hi> but they may be more <hi>ſevere.</hi> God hath been
and is ſtill at work, as to eminent and remarkable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and if we think he is now at a loſs as to more
Judgments, we ſhall find that God will find more <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
for us. Time was that we thought all was well
with us, and Oh how ſore Judgments have overtaken
us! and if we think that God hath now done with us,
he hath power enough utterly to ruine and undoe us,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 27, 28. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15. 7. <hi>They ſhall go from one
Fire, and another fire ſhall devour them.</hi> Oh how eaſily
did God <hi>encreaſe</hi> Judgments upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh
encreaſed</hi> his ſin againſt God! Who would not fear
thee <hi>O thou King of Kings,</hi> who if thou wilt canſt ſoon
<hi>turn Judgments into mercy,</hi> and as ſoon canſt <hi>turn our
preſent ſore Judgments into greater.</hi> If <hi>London</hi> continue
its <hi>iniquity,</hi> I dread to think what will befall it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
what already hath overtaken it. You may,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105318:16"/>
and oh who knows how ſoon you may loſe your <hi>lives</hi>
by another, as you have loſt your <hi>houſes</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtates</hi> by
this Judgment?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Sin then is a <hi>Nations greateſt enemy.</hi> You
can't expreſs your ſelves ſins <hi>friend,</hi> but you will find it
your <hi>foe.</hi> It's impoſſible a Nations Intereſt ſhould be
eſtabliſhed, let its Superſtructure be what it will, as long
as there is ſin for it's Foundation. Though thou build
thy Wall as high as Heaven, ſaid the Oracle to <hi>Phocas,</hi>
yet ſin that lyes at the Foundation will one day overturn
them. Have we been Chriſtians? and are we ſtill under
the <hi>Sword</hi> without, and the <hi>Plague</hi> within? it's becauſe
of ſin. Do we live in ſad and miſerable <hi>times?</hi> it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of ſin. Is the <hi>City</hi> ruined? the <hi>Foundations</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
diſcovered? and the <hi>Streets</hi> deſolate, without Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
and houſes? it's becauſe of ſin, and therefore
oh how great an enemy! <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 12, 13, 14.
<hi>Iſa,</hi> 9. 18, 19. If we think to procure a Nations <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
by our <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> we take the ready way for a
Nations <hi>wretchedneſs.</hi> Oh <hi>London,</hi> thy greateſt Enemies
have been <hi>within,</hi> though too too many <hi>without</hi> favour
thy ruine.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Security</hi> then <hi>is no wayes becoming a Nation.</hi>
Security may be a Nations <hi>temper,</hi> but it's one of the
Nations greateſt <hi>diſtempers.</hi> Ah Chriſtians, is it for you
with the old worldlings to put off the evil day, when
you know not how ſoon you may be under a deluge of
miſery? Is it for you with <hi>Agag</hi> to ſay, <hi>The bitterneſs
of death is paſt,</hi> when on a ſudden you may be hew'n in
pieces, and <hi>Butchered?</hi> Is it for you with him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
to ſay, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up
for many years;</hi> when alas, the <hi>Fire</hi> already hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
thy <hi>houſe</hi> and <hi>goods,</hi> and thou knoweſt not
how ſoon a <hi>bloody knife</hi> may be put to thy <hi>throat?</hi> Oh
the remembrance of Gods more then ordinary proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Judgement is not to be attended with ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105318:16"/>
promiſings of what not to our ſelves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15. 7.
<hi>Neh.</hi> 3. 13, 15. Oh you ſuffering Chriſtians, I beſeech
you, ſtand to your <hi>watch,</hi> when too too many <hi>watch</hi>
that you may not ſtand. The Lord keep this poor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and us in it, from a ſpirit of ſecurity, as being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leſs <hi>ſecure</hi> then when moſt <hi>ſecure, Ezek.</hi> 39. 6.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>The vanity of all Creature confidences.</hi> Alas
we are apt to lay our ſelves at their feet, who when
God comes in a way of Judgment, can't be a place of
ſafety and refuge to us. I, thou wilt have the <hi>world,</hi>
come of it what it will; and when all comes to all, what
is it able to doe for thee? Thy <hi>houſe</hi> can't ſecure thee
againſt an <hi>Arreſt from heaven,</hi> thy <hi>riches</hi> can't privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thee againſt the <hi>priſon</hi> of affliction, and the worlds
beſt <hi>Cordials</hi> and <hi>preſcription</hi> can't keep thee from
a bed of languiſhing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 47. 13, 14. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Jer.</hi>
51, 58. How many in the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of all have found
troubles overtaking them, and none of all thoſe <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
could or have kept thoſe troubles from them.
Alas, Chriſtians, what are become of your <hi>Houſes, Shops,
Goods, Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Warehouſes,</hi> when you could not
keep them from being deſtroyed, and they could not
keep your <hi>houſes</hi> from being conſumed. <hi>Forbear O my
Soul, endeavouring after that which never ſuccoured thee
leſs, then when thou ſtood'ſt moſt in need of being ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured.</hi>
It's enough, O my God, that the world hath
been deſired <hi>ſo much,</hi> and <hi>thy ſelf ſo little,</hi> when it's not
the <hi>world,</hi> but thy <hi>ſelf</hi> that is moſt to be deſired.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Gracious Souls are perſons of <hi>more eſteem</hi>
then <hi>commonly eſteemed.</hi> There are none more trodden

               </hi> and there are none more
prevailing with God for the keeping off and removall of
Judgements then <hi>believers.</hi> Who diverted the fierce
anger of the Lord from breaking in upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but
<hi>Moſes?</hi> Who ſtayed the <hi>Plague</hi> from raging amongſt
the people, but <hi>Aaron?</hi> Who prevailed with God for

the clouds to empty themſelves into ſhowers in the
time of drought, but <hi>Elias?</hi> Who kept the <hi>Fire</hi> from
<hi>Jacob;</hi> that thereby he might not be deſtroyed when he

15. 1, 2. <hi>Job</hi> 42. 8. Godlineſs was never yet an <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance</hi>
to a Nation, though many have been the <hi>hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancers</hi>
of the Godly in a Nation. A few more perſons
of the ſame ſize with <hi>Lot</hi> as to Godlineſs would have
kept <hi>Sodom</hi> from being entombed in it's <hi>own aſhes.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that God was in no place more owned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
then in the late City; and therefore how
great muſt needs be it's provocation, when their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto, and all their intereſt with God could not
keep off it's <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>deſolation!</hi> The beſt counſel that
can be given to a Nation, is to countenance thoſe who
have the greateſt intereſt with God in his Judgements
upon a Nation. Oh <hi>England, England,</hi> wert thou not
more beholding to a <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>Sincere
Chriſtians</hi> then thy <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>debauched</hi> ſinners; thou
wouldeſt have been long ere this a <hi>Sodom,</hi> and like unto
<hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond improvement of this doctrine ſhall be by
way of <hi>conſolation,</hi> to thoſe who are ſufferers through
this ſore Judgement of Fire upon their houſes. And
indeed who ſtand moſt in need of <hi>comforts,</hi> if not thoſe
who are without their <hi>comforts?</hi> But, alaſ, ſuffering
Souls, how ſhall I ſpeak to you, or wherewithall ſhall
I comfort you for this ſore <hi>affliction</hi> that is laid upon
you? My hearts deſire for you all is and ſhall be, that
God would anſwer your deſire, and in his own time
make up all your <hi>loſs</hi> in the midſt of all your <hi>ſufferings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
This cannot but be the reſult of my bowels yerning
with <hi>Compaſſion</hi> towards you. But yet more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by way of Comfort, I would leave theſe things with
you, as ſo many <hi>Cordials</hi> to your <hi>ſwooning</hi> Spirits.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Hath God removed from you the <hi>worlds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts?</hi>

it may be, it's made up with <hi>heavens comforts</hi>
The <hi>meanneſs</hi> of the ground without is made up with
the <hi>richneſs</hi> of the Myne within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>meanneſs</hi> of a
Chriſtians outward condition is made up with the <hi>rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of a Chriſtians inward condition; <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 16. And
therefore ſee Ch. 1. of the ſaid Epiſtle, 5. v. It's not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall
with God to <hi>ſmile</hi> upon his with a piece of brown
bread, when he <hi>frowns</hi> upon others in enjoying their
choiſeſt dainties. Well then, thou art now none of the
worlds <hi>honoured</hi> ones, but thou art heavens <hi>beloved</hi> one;
there are <hi>croſſes</hi> without, but there are <hi>comforts</hi> within;
God denies thee the pleaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but he feeds
thee with milk and honey of <hi>Canaan.</hi> I hope it the ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the Lord grant that all of you may know experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,
how to reconcile that ſeeming contradiction
of <hi>outward poverty</hi> and <hi>inward plenty, outward ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi>
and <hi>inward ſolacing.</hi> A <hi>Silken Soul</hi> under
<hi>thredbare clothes</hi> is better then a <hi>thredbare Saul</hi> under
<hi>Silken garments.</hi> It's enough ſurely, Friend, that there
is <hi>comfort</hi> within, though there are not <hi>comforts</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hath God deſtroyed thy <hi>houſe,</hi> and taken
away thy <hi>comforts</hi> and <hi>enjoyments,</hi> why he hath left
ſtill ſome of thy <hi>enjoyments</hi> and <hi>comfort.</hi> The mother
won't alwayes give to her babe the breaſts to the <hi>full,</hi>
but yet to it's wants. I, thou art a childe, and what is
thy deſire? Lord, let ſuch a <hi>mercy</hi> continue to me; but
what faith God, a great deale leſs will ſerve thy <hi>turne,</hi>
and that thou ſhalt not be without. God it may be
don't proportion mercy to thy <hi>petition,</hi> but ſtill to thy
<hi>condition, Math.</hi> 6. 30. Well then, thou haſt had ſuch
and ſuch mercies, and they are gone, and what doſt
thou want? Is it <hi>daily bread?</hi> he gives it <hi>food</hi> and
<hi>rayment?</hi> he gives and continues it; in it what may ſerves
thy <hi>turne?</hi> Why ſtill he continues it. I, God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
thy <hi>ſuperfluities,</hi> but ſtill he continues thy <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:105318:18"/>
Thou haſt ſtill thy daily food and drink, though
thou art not ſerved on thy <hi>Silver plates,</hi> and with thy
<hi>Silver bowles.</hi> I ſuppoſe, Chriſtians, you may doe well
enough without thoſe <hi>beſpotted faces,</hi> perriwigg'd <hi>heads,</hi>
long trayling <hi>gowns,</hi> and thoſe ſilken <hi>garments;</hi> theſe
were but <hi>ſuperfluities,</hi> and God hath continued thy
<hi>neceſſaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hath God taken away your <hi>enjoyments</hi>
and <hi>houſes?</hi> why he gives you <hi>content</hi> in the want of
<hi>enjoyments.</hi> God takes care that you ſhall not be
without <hi>contentation</hi> in the removall of the worlds full
<hi>accommodation, Phil.</hi> 4. 11. The little bird ſings as
pleaſantly in gathering here and there a corn, as others
that are fed to the full. I dare ſay, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> bleſſes
God as heartily at the <hi>meaneſt board,</hi> and <hi>courſeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
as the greateſt <hi>Epicure</hi> at his <hi>full Cups, curions
diſhes,</hi> and <hi>downy beds.</hi> Doth God remove <hi>mercies</hi> from
me? I am content. Doth God lay <hi>miſeries</hi> on me? I am
content. Doth God feed me with the <hi>crumbs</hi> that fall
from others table? I am content, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21. I pray which
is better, to have a large <hi>Eſtate</hi> to an unſatisfied mind,
or a ſatisfied minde to a mean <hi>Eſtate?</hi> Oh it's a great
deal better to want <hi>enjoyments,</hi> and to have <hi>content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
then to want <hi>contentment</hi> in the greateſt <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hath God deſtroyed <hi>thy houſe,</hi> and taken
away thy <hi>enjoyments?</hi> for all that he will take the care
of thee. When is the mothers care drawn out towards
the child, but when it wants thoſe mercies which it
had before? God will find out ſome way or other
to <hi>relieve</hi> thee, though he don't ſee good bountifully
to <hi>ſupply</hi> thee. <hi>Piety</hi> hath had too too much of the
worlds <hi>enmity,</hi> yet ſtill God hath provided ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>relieve</hi> her in her greateſt <hi>Indigency.</hi> God hath
his daughter of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for his <hi>Moſes</hi> in the water, his
<hi>Ebadmilechs</hi> for his <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> in the dungeon, his <hi>Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheraſſes</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:105318:18"/>
for his <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; his diſtreſſed Saints and ſervants,
and his <hi>Zoars</hi> for his <hi>Lots</hi> in <hi>Sodom.</hi> See <hi>Davids</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 1. and let it be your comfort in the
loweſt condition. If this be not enough, why remember
the Apoſtles exhortation, ſuitable enough to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Caſting all your care upon him, for
he careth for you.</hi> Will you remember, Sirs? and what
would I have you remember but this: The <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>times</hi>
have not been without the <hi>beſt</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the
<hi>beſt</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have not been without ſome or other
to <hi>provide</hi> for them, when it went <hi>hardly</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Hath God deſtroyed thy <hi>houſe?</hi> he might the
ſame time have deſtroyed thy <hi>ſoul;</hi> hath he dealt ſo <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely</hi>
with thee on <hi>earth,</hi> he might have dealt more
<hi>ſeverely</hi> with thee as to <hi>Hell;</hi> thou mightſt have been in
hell, thy Soul might have been roaring in the place of
torments, thou mightſt have been reſerved in chains of
darkneſs unto the judgement of the great day. Oh had
it not been for infinite mercy, thy <hi>ſoul</hi> would have
flamed in <hi>hell,</hi> as well as thy <hi>houſe</hi> hath been all in a
<hi>flame.</hi> Oh don't complain, but rather comfort thy ſelf
in the greateſt <hi>ſeverity,</hi> that it is not <hi>ſeverity</hi> in hell.
The greateſt <hi>miſery</hi> on this ſide <hi>Hell,</hi> can't but be <hi>infinite
mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Hath God deſtroyed thy <hi>Houſe,</hi> and taken
away thy <hi>enjoyments?</hi> why he hath not, neither will
he take away <hi>himſelf.</hi> How great a <hi>loſer</hi> ſoever thou
art as to other things, thou art not a loſer as to <hi>God;</hi> and
how great a <hi>ſufferer</hi> ſoever thou art, thou art not a <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer</hi>
as to <hi>God,</hi> and this <hi>God</hi> as <hi>thine,</hi> and this <hi>God</hi> to be
<hi>thine,</hi> and that for <hi>ever.</hi> He that was thy God in <hi>Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
when thoſe mercies were, he will be thy God in
<hi>adverſity,</hi> now thoſe mercies are no more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 10.
and 89. 31, 32, 33. Reſt aſſured of it, thy <hi>God</hi> will not
<hi>leave</hi> thee, and thou haſt enough, whatſoever is not
<hi>left</hi> thee; that thy <hi>God</hi> is ſtill <hi>left,</hi> and that he will not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105318:19"/>
               <hi>leave</hi> thee. One <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>want</hi> of <hi>all</hi> is enough, and the
<hi>enjoyment</hi> of <hi>all</hi> in the <hi>want</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is and will be <hi>every
way ſad enough.</hi> What canſt thou have to <hi>comfort</hi> thee
when thou haſt not a God? what canſt thou have to
<hi>ſadden</hi> thee in the want of all, when thou haſt a God?
I have done with thee thou poor <hi>ſuffering Chriſtian.</hi> I
am ſo far of repreſenting thee under this Calamity a
<hi>frighted Citizen,</hi> as that the Lord knows I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
leave thee a <hi>comforted Chriſtian;</hi> The Lord of all
<hi>comfort</hi> in his own time <hi>comfort</hi> thee.</p>
            <p>The Third and laſt improvement of this Doctrine
ſhall be by way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and that in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Sanctifie</hi> God in all, and in <hi>this ſore Judgment
of Fire</hi> upon us. Its eaſie and uſual to <hi>ſpeak-well</hi> of God,
when he <hi>dealeth well</hi> with us, but rare and hard to <hi>extol</hi>
him when he <hi>debaſeth,</hi> and <hi>advance</hi> him when he <hi>vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
us. Acknowledg God as <hi>righteous</hi> in his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
when his proceedings are ne're ſo <hi>rigorous.</hi> Let
your apprehenſions of God be <hi>honourable,</hi> when your
condition from God is <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>miſerable.</hi> It is ſaid of
the <hi>Turks</hi> when cruelly laſhed, that they are compelled
to return to the Judg, to kiſs his hand, give him thanks;
and pay the Officer that whipt them, and ſo clear the
Judge and Officer of injuſtice. My Beloved, as to the
<hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> of our wayes, God expects that we
ſhould be <hi>humbled;</hi> and as to the <hi>rigorouſneſs</hi> of his
wayes, that he ſhould be <hi>acquitted,</hi> Iſa. 24. 15. L am. 1:
18. Dan. 9. 14. Doth the <hi>Angel</hi> deſtroy from one
County to another? God is righteous. Doth the <hi>Sword</hi>
devour from one year to another? God is righteous.
Am I under <hi>want</hi> of the <hi>choyceſt mercies,</hi> and a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of
the <hi>ſevereſt miſeries?</hi> God is righteous. Is the <hi>City</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
and undone, my <hi>houſe</hi> conſumed, my <hi>Goods</hi> burnt,
and my <hi>Eſtate</hi> loſt? Why God is righteous. It was an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105318:19"/>
holy expreſſion of the ſuffering Emperour <hi>Mauritius,</hi>
when his wife and children were ſlain before his face,
<hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, and in very faithfulneſs haſt
thou afflicted me.</hi> Oh remember, That his <hi>Will</hi> is the
Rule of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and ſo his <hi>actings</hi> cannot be charged
with any thing of <hi>injuſtice. Condemn</hi> thy ſelf, but <hi>acquit</hi>
thy God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Get your hearts <hi>affected</hi> with this <hi>ſore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of God upon us. Don't put off the <hi>Judgments</hi> of
God, or this place of ſore <hi>Judgments,</hi> with this <hi>Gallio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Spirit,</hi> Let look to it who will. Let your <hi>eyes</hi> be
open to ſee, wherein Gods <hi>Hand</hi> hath gone out, and
accordingly let there be the <hi>outgoings</hi> of your <hi>heart. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible</hi>
hearts are no wayes becoming <hi>miſerable</hi> times.
How ſad is it for others to <hi>feaſt</hi> while the City <hi>flames!</hi>
and to go abroad with their <hi>garments of joy,</hi> whilſt the
Nation hath on her <hi>mourning Apparel!</hi> Rom. 12. 15.
latter part, <hi>Weep with thoſe that weep.</hi> Zach. 11. 2.
Jer. 49. 2, 3. The times I am confident are not ſo <hi>hard,</hi>
but perſons hearts, alas, towards thoſe times are <hi>harder.</hi>
Ah Chriſtians, where are your <hi>hearts</hi> for Gods <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
in the midſt of Gods <hi>Judgments</hi> upon your <hi>Shops</hi>
and <hi>Houſes?</hi> Oh get <hi>broken hearts</hi> for <hi>broken times,</hi> and
<hi>ſorrowing hearts</hi> for <hi>ſuffering times,</hi> and a <hi>pitying heart</hi>
for a <hi>flaming City. Is it nothing unto you that paſs by?
Behold and ſee, whether there be any ſorrow like unto mine,
wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his
fierce anger,</hi> Lament. 1. 12. For my part, let him paſs
for an <hi>hard hearted wretch</hi> indeed, who in the day of
<hi>Londons Calamity</hi> can be without any <hi>yearnings of pity.</hi>
O <hi>London,</hi> what ſhall be done for <hi>thee,</hi> or how ſhall my
<hi>heart</hi> be drawn out with <hi>compaſſion</hi> towards <hi>thee?</hi> My
<hi>Bowels,</hi> my <hi>Bowels, Oh that my head were waters, and mine
eyes a Fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night
for the ruine and deſtruction of the daughter of my people,</hi>
Jer. 9. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:105318:20"/>
Thirdly, Be <hi>ſubmiſſive</hi> unto God under <hi>this fore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Thy <hi>mercies</hi> are not, and thy <hi>miſeries</hi> are; oh but
be content. God hath made <hi>ſore breacher</hi> again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
upon thee, but be quiet; thy <hi>houſe</hi> is burnt, thy
<hi>Shop</hi> deſtroyed, thy <hi>Trade</hi> decayed and loſt, I, it may
be with many, alas, thou art turned out of a <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of
all; but let there be a ſweet acquieſcence in the will of
God. It's not a murmuring and quarrelling, it's not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
and counteracting of God, No; it was <hi>Iſraels</hi>
ſin, the Lord grant it may not be <hi>ours,</hi> to quarrel with
God, and to be unſubmiſſive unto God. I am ſure the
Churches practice herein is every way commendable,
<hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord.</hi> And
therefore 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Ely</hi> hears ſuch news, as ſhould
make the <hi>ears</hi> of ſuch as heard it to <hi>tingle,</hi> &amp; their <hi>hearts</hi>
to <hi>tremble,</hi> and yet quietly and calmly he ſubmits unto
it. Remember Chriſtians, That Obedience is due to
Gods <hi>ſevereſt precepts,</hi> and patience is your duty under
the <hi>ſharpeſt Providence.</hi> I confeſs we never underwent
a <hi>ſorer Judgment</hi> than this of <hi>Fire;</hi> Oh but for all that
there muſt be a ſubmiſſiveneſs unto God. I, God hath
laid a <hi>Fiery rod</hi> on our <hi>backs;</hi> Oh but don't let us fly
in <hi>Heavens face,</hi> but rather lay our ſelves at <hi>Heavens feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Don't act any thing to <hi>encreaſe Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
Do what you can to <hi>quench,</hi> but not to <hi>kindle</hi>
the Fire; to <hi>allay,</hi> but not to <hi>raiſe</hi> the ſtorme; to <hi>reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
this place out of its rubbiſh, but not that it may be
<hi>ruined.</hi> In a common Calamity all ought to put to their
helping hand; what then ſhould be done with thoſe
that help forward the Calamity? Oh take away the
<hi>fewel,</hi> but don't add to the <hi>fewel.</hi> I don't ſee how in the
judgment of ſobriety, they really wiſh <hi>Englands</hi> and
<hi>Londons</hi> welfare, that encreaſe the <hi>Fewel</hi> to encreaſe the
<hi>Fire.</hi> Oh that God would do us <hi>good,</hi> that God would
take away his <hi>Plagues,</hi> that God would make us <hi>ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
that God would <hi>build</hi> again the <hi>deſolate ſtreets</hi> in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105318:20"/>
midſt of us. My Beloved, I ſay ſo likewiſe, and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that any ſhould not cry, <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> to ſuch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
and undertakers; and yet thoſe I, thoſe very
perſons will not leave their <hi>Ranting,</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> and
<hi>Healthing,</hi> and <hi>Damming,</hi> and <hi>Chambering,</hi> and <hi>Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing.</hi>
Oh Sirs, Sirs, the <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> of our <hi>lips</hi> muſt
be attended with the <hi>religiouſneſs</hi> of our <hi>lives,</hi> Amos 4.
12. Jer. 8. 6, 13. If we pray that God would do <hi>London,</hi>
we muſt live that God may do it good. Oh don't walk
in any wayes, wherein God will meet with us, and lay
more Calamity upon us. <hi>Piety</hi> is the only way for our
<hi>Proſperity,</hi> whereas <hi>iniquity</hi> will be the only way for our
<hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>calamity,</hi> Ezek. 36. 33. A little more <hi>looſneſs,</hi>
a little more <hi>remiſneſs,</hi> and a little more <hi>profaneneſs,</hi> will
make us cry out, when God will ſay, <hi>Why cryeſt thou for
thine afflictions? thy breaches, ſores, and wounds, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,
for the multitude of thine iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Be much with God for <hi>removing his ſore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
How canſt thou Chriſtian, ſee trouble upon trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and miſery upon miſery, and calamity upon calamity,
ſuch dreadful Judgments one after another, and not ſo
much as ſpeak a word to God in reference unto them?
Times of more than <hi>ordinary indignation</hi> and <hi>deſolation</hi>
ſhould be times of more than <hi>ordinary ſupplication.</hi> It's
not ſome few formal expreſſions or other that will ſerve
<hi>turn</hi> upon Gods <hi>turning</hi> upon us in eminent wayes of
Judgement. When ſhould we poure out a Spirit of <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi>
but when God poures out the Vials of his
<hi>Indignation?</hi> How ſad is it to hear perſons <hi>ranting</hi> in

            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Secure the intereſt of your Soul</hi> with and in
God; get God to be <hi>yours</hi> in the midſt of thoſe Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherein you can't ſay, that any thing is <hi>yours</hi>
Hath God by <hi>Fire</hi> deſtroyed thy <hi>houſe,</hi> and taken away
thy <hi>Eſtate?</hi> and haſt thou not yet God to be <hi>thine?</hi> what
wilt thou doe? Oh hath God poured out the Vials
of his <hi>Indignation,</hi> and haſt thou not got God to be
<hi>thine?</hi> what wilt thou doe? Is God riſen out of his
Sanctuary to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth? and
hath he <hi>ſeverely puniſhed us?</hi> and haſt thou not got God
to be <hi>thine?</hi> what wilt thou doe? For my part I muſt
ſay it, and I can't but ſay it again, I don't know what
thou wilt doe unleſs thou haſt got God to be <hi>thine,</hi> and
that thou art <hi>his, Iſa.</hi> 10. 3, 27, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 7. 1. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
oh labour and make it your work, that though
your <hi>houſes</hi> be deſtroyed by <hi>Fire on earth,</hi> yet that your
<hi>Souls</hi> be not deſtroyed by: <hi>Fire in hell.</hi> If God be none
of yours, I don't know what can be done; but if he be
yours, I don't know what can be done undone. This,
this is your maine work; and more to ſtir you up to
this, as the cloſe of all, give me leave to recommend
theſe following conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I don't know any thing that is more your <hi>duty</hi>
then this: you will tell me it's the <hi>world cap and knee;</hi>
I tell you no, <hi>It's God:</hi> you will tell me it's your <hi>ſhop,</hi> and
<hi>warehouſes</hi> and <hi>merchandiſing;</hi> I tell you, no, <hi>it's God:</hi>
you will tell me it's getting ſomething, or other theſe
hard times to keep <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> together; I tell you
no, <hi>it's God,</hi> and keeping <hi>God</hi> and your <hi>ſoul</hi> together.
<hi>Amos</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 36. The greateſt <hi>ſecurity</hi> in the
world without a God, as yours, will be found not to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105318:21"/>
be your <hi>ſecurity.</hi> So far as <hi>I</hi> know my own heart, I would
be faithful to your <hi>eternal intereſt;</hi> and if any thing
ought to be your work more then this, God forbid that
the ſame ſhould not be diſcovered to, and preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you. It's a fond thing for <hi>Miniſters</hi> to make ſo much
adoe in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> concerning a God in Covenant Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as yours, if not your duty, and the maine of your
duty. W<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>ſecure</hi> now adays what not to our ſelves; and
what doe we <hi>ſecure,</hi> but what cannot be <hi>ſecure?</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I hear poor wretches crying out, Oh that in
<hi>Londons Conflagration,</hi> when houſes loſt, and goods
loſt, and eſtate loſt, and all loſt, I had <hi>ſecured</hi> a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Relation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It's the <hi>Concernment of your Souls</hi> that you
are to ſecure. It's the <hi>jewel</hi> in the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> the <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
in the <hi>field,</hi> the <hi>child</hi> in the <hi>cradle,</hi> and the <hi>eternal
well-being</hi> of your precious Souls. God allowes us time
enough to live <hi>comfortably</hi> in this world, but no time
at all to live wretchedly in another world. God would
have the ſum and ſubſtance of a Chriſtians Spiritual
<hi>circumſpection</hi> to be his Souls <hi>ſalvation,</hi> not his Souls
<hi>deſtruction.</hi> Oh, that we ſhould be ſo <hi>ſerious</hi> as to <hi>trifles,</hi>
and <hi>trifle</hi> as to that which is ſo <hi>ſerious! Luke</hi> 12. 21.
<hi>Thou fool, this night,</hi> &amp;c. Shall I be ſo <hi>ſerious</hi> as to
<hi>houſes</hi> and riches which have been deſtroyed by <hi>Fire,</hi>
and not as to a <hi>ſoul</hi> which may be burnt with <hi>Fire</hi> in
hell? What folly would it have been for any in the
late fiery calamity to regard his <hi>Lumber,</hi> and not at all
his <hi>Jewels, Mat.</hi> 16 26. That perſon muſt needs come
home by <hi>weeping Croſs,</hi> that hath ſeemingly it may be
ſecured his <hi>Eſtate</hi> in <hi>houſes,</hi> but not his <hi>Eſtate</hi> in <hi>God;</hi>
the <hi>Soul</hi> of his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> but not the <hi>Eſtate</hi> of his <hi>Soul.</hi> I
pray let it not be ſaid of you, Chriſtians, that you ſhould
be <hi>Penny-wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Pound-fooliſh.</hi> Be wiſe unto <hi>ſobriety</hi>
is the Apoſtles expreſſion; and its the greateſt <hi>ſobriety,</hi>
yea policy, to be wiſe to our Souls <hi>ſafety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:105318:22"/>
Thirdly, God with the <hi>voyce</hi> of <hi>judgement</hi> calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you as to this. God is more then ordinary in his
judicial <hi>proceedings,</hi> and ſo the reſult of them ſhould
be your ſpiritual <hi>enſurings.</hi> God alarums perſons by this
<hi>Fire</hi> on earth, that ſo they may keep their Souls from
that <hi>Fire</hi> in hell. All will, and alas, they muſt ſay? we
live in <hi>miſerable</hi> times: but what ſaith God? Have a
care, you be not <hi>miſerable</hi> with and after thoſe times,
<hi>Luke</hi> 21. 35, 36. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. 1. <hi>In the ſhadow of thy wings
will I take my refuge.</hi> Are your <hi>houſes</hi> deſtroyed, ſee
your <hi>ſouls</hi> be not deſtroyed; are your <hi>riches</hi> loſt? See
you don't loſe your <hi>treaſure</hi> in heaven; are you <hi>turned</hi>
out of all? See you be not <hi>turned</hi> out by the God of all:
is there ſo much <hi>miſery</hi> here? See there be nothing of
<hi>miſery</hi> hereafter. Times of <hi>proſperity,</hi> Sirs, though too
too often they influence us with ſecurity, yet the voyce
of God in times of <hi>Calamity</hi> is, ſee that your work be
done, leaſt otherwiſe you be undone. Oh it's high time,
Chriſtians, to look to the <hi>childe</hi> in the <hi>cradle,</hi> and the
<hi>jewels</hi> in the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> when the <hi>houſe</hi> is on Fire. Oh make
<hi>ſure</hi> of your God, and never more then when his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have been, and are ſo <hi>ſore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, This is that which will <hi>ſecure</hi> you in the
<hi>midſt</hi> of <hi>judgements.</hi> It's not ſo much the money in your
<hi>bags,</hi> as grace in your <hi>hearts,</hi> that will indemnifie you in
the ſoreſt troubles. How often makes God a manifeſt
difference between thoſe that <hi>fear</hi> him, and thoſe that
<hi>fear</hi> him not; between <hi>ſinners</hi> in their <hi>rufflings of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs,</hi>
and the <hi>Saints</hi> in their <hi>Garbe of holineſs.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
both the one and the other, have and doe often
drink out of the ſame bitter cup; but then the Saint
<hi>kiſſes</hi> onely the cup in compariſon of the ſinner, who
muſt <hi>drink</hi> the <hi>very dregs, Zeph.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>It may be ye
ſhall be hid, Ezek.</hi> 9. 4, 5. <hi>Job</hi> 5. 19, 20. Gracious Souls
are marked by God for <hi>preſervation,</hi> when looſe and
debauched ſinners for <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>indignation.</hi> Oh how
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105318:22"/>
poor preſervatives are all things to this, a Covenant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to God! I don't know any thing that will or can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
you from an <hi>arreſt of Evil,</hi> but only as you have <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
protection.</hi> If ſafety is to be had any where on earth, I
may rather hope for it in the <hi>place</hi> of <hi>Gods worſhip,</hi> then
in an <hi>houſe</hi> of <hi>Goodfellowſhip.</hi> When there was nothing
but <hi>darkneſs</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> there was <hi>brightneſs</hi> in <hi>Goſhen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, This is that which will <hi>comfort</hi> you in the midſt
of <hi>judgments:</hi> You may drink out of the ſame <hi>bitter</hi> cup
with others, but this will <hi>ſweeten</hi> it to you. The clouds of
a <hi>ſad providence</hi> may empty themſelves into <hi>ſhowers,</hi> but
this will be a <hi>Soul comforting</hi> Sunſhine to you. The <hi>Fire</hi>
may and hath deſtroyed your <hi>houſes</hi> with others, but this
will be a <hi>ſupport</hi> to you, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. David <hi>encouraged
himſelf in the Lord his God. David</hi> with a God as his, could
not but <hi>encourage</hi> himſelf, whereas without a God he
could not but be <hi>diſcouraged.</hi> I have loſt my <hi>friends,</hi> but
I have God to be my <hi>friend;</hi> I have loſt my <hi>houſes,</hi> but I
have a God to be my <hi>houſe;</hi> I have loſt my <hi>riches</hi> and all
that ever I had, but I have God to be my <hi>riches,</hi> and all
that ever I can want, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 1. <hi>The Lord is
my ſhepheard, I ſhall not want.</hi> Oh how chearfull may the
Soul be in the <hi>loſs</hi> of all, that is not at a <hi>loſs</hi> as to God! Go
and be <hi>miſerable</hi> with a God if thou canſt, and let others
be <hi>comfortable</hi> without a God if they can. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chooſe a Saint in his <hi>meaneſt rags,</hi> then a ſinner in his
<hi>ſtatelieſt robes.</hi> If a God can't <hi>comfort</hi> thee, alas, what will
or can <hi>comfort</hi> thee! A God as thine cannot but be a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi>
to thee in all thy ſwoonings.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Your Souls ſhall be <hi>ſaved</hi> notwithſtanding the
<hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>ſoreſt judgements.</hi> When judgements break
the <hi>Cabinet</hi> of your bodies, they ſhall not be prejudicial
to the <hi>jewel,</hi> your Souls. Thoſe judgments that make
way for others to be <hi>damned,</hi> they make way for you to be
<hi>ſaved.</hi> Thoſe judgments that are ſo many <hi>Serjeants</hi> haling
others away to a priſon, are but ſo many <hi>ſervitours</hi> convay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you to a Pallace, <hi>Malach.</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>They ſhall be mine,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105318:23"/>
ſaith the Lord.</hi> What was a fiery Chariot to <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ah,</hi> when
therein he was had away for heaven, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. 24. When judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have <hi>done</hi> their work upon you, you ſhall not be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done</hi>
by thoſe Judgments. I, the <hi>Fire</hi> hath deſtroyed your
<hi>houſes,</hi> and a next may deſtroy your <hi>lives:</hi> God this time
hath put <hi>Fire</hi> to your <hi>houſes,</hi> and men through their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the next may put a <hi>bloody knife</hi> to your <hi>throats;</hi> but when
your houſes, goods, and lives themſelves are gone, your
ſouls for all that ſhall not be gone, but bound up in the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of life. A believer may ſay to Judgments, the <hi>Plague,</hi> the
<hi>Sword, Famine</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> do your work and ſpare not; my
<hi>body</hi> can but be reſolved into duſt, but my <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhall not be
ſentenced into <hi>hell.</hi> I believe that many good men may be
removed in a <hi>common calamity,</hi> but I dont believe that any
good man ſhall be ſentenced into <hi>eternal miſery.</hi> To draw
therefore to an end. It's <hi>ſalvation</hi> work, Chriſtians, and dear
Friends, that I have put you upon; and if any thing would
do it without ſecuring your ſouls with and in God, I would
not trouble you with one word of what hath been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
You don't know what evil there will be in the earth;
we have loſt our <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>houſes,</hi> and we may next loſe our
<hi>lives,</hi> and the <hi>lives</hi> of our <hi>poor babes.</hi> All that I am earneſt
for, is only, and I hope you wont blame me for it, that it may
not go <hi>ill</hi> with you <hi>hereafter,</hi> how <hi>ill</hi> ſoever it hath &amp; may
ſtill go with you <hi>here.</hi> Oh who would not be ſafe as to <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
when <hi>heaven</hi> alone it is that will be his ſafety.</p>
            <p>And now I have done the whole; and may the bleſſing
of God attend the whole that hath been done, in ſetting it
ſo upon our <hi>hearts,</hi> and our <hi>hearts</hi> upon it, as that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that have been, may be removed, this ſore <hi>fiery Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
ſanctified, and thoſe that may be, and are ſtill threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
through <hi>mercy,</hi> prevented, that ſo <hi>England</hi> may once
more be a <hi>quiet habitation,</hi> and <hi>Londons ruined Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
again laid, yea, the <hi>Topſtone</hi> thereof crying, <hi>Grace, Grace:</hi>
Even ſo <hi>Bleſſed Lord God,</hi> and let all thy people <hi>heartly</hi>
and <hi>reformedly</hi> ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
