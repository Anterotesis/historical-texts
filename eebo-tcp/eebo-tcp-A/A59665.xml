         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And Especially to the Inhabitants of
CAMBRIDGE
IN
NEW-ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat to make sure of Life Eternal, is the one
necessary Businesse, that we Sons of death
have to do in this world, and without
which, all our time here is worse than
lost, every enlightned mind will easily
acknowledge. This present life being by
the Rule of it, appointed but to this end,
to be preparation-time, spent in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
care to make ready, that we might
have a good meeting with him who shall
be seen in this Aire one day. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we look up to Heaven, or down to Hell; whether we reflect upon
our own immortal souls, or turn our eyes toward the Greatnesse and
Goodnesse of that God in Christ with whom we have to do; whether
we pace over the time between this and Judgment-day, or send our
thoughts to view the Eternity that is to follow after. All things put a
Necessity, a Solemnity, a Glory upon this work.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Difficilia quae Pulchra:</hi> It is one of the Oracles uttered by our
Lord with his own mouth, <hi>Strait is the Gate, and narrow is the way that
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</hi> It is not so easie a thing
to get to Heaven, nor so broad a way thither, as the slight and loose
Opinions of some, and Practises of more would make it, nor as the
carnal hearts of all would have it. Though th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>t (if it be examined)
is the common Scope of all Erroneous Conceits (and how restlesly
<pb facs="tcp:40159:3"/>
have the corrupt minds of men laboured therein in all ages, and do in
these our daies) to widen the way to Life, to break down the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
of this narrow Path, and make it broader than ever God made
it. Mans carnal heart finds it self pinioned and straitned in the way
(the good old way of effectual Faith and obedience) that God hath laid
out; hence it breaks out on this hand and on that, and will rather pluck
up the ancient Land-marks of Gods Truth, than not make it broader.
The Gospel will not afford men a way broad enough, unlesse the Law
be quite removed (not only as a Covenant, but as a commanding Rule
of Life too) and laid flat like an old Hedge, that they may go over it
at pleasure, and not attend it any further than their spirit listeth. Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Faith is too narrow a path, unlesse they may be justified
before and without Faith, it is not free enough; they complain of it
as if it laid them under a Covenant of works. Conditional Promises
are of too straight a size, they must be all absolute, and give us peace
without any qualification in us, or else they are not large enough. To
be solicitous about Sanctification and inherent Grace, is too trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som;
to seek God diligently in the use of all means, in a daily and
hearty performance of holy Duties, in a strict Sanctifying of Sabbaths,
in constant watchfulnesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this must be laid by, as a Legal Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And if the Spirit immediatly will act us and carry us in a Bed of
ease to Heaven, without troubling us to act and strive, well and good;
otherwise men will shake hands with the power of Godlinesse, and run
a drift before their own Corruptions. But when all Stones are turned,
the way to Heaven is and will be found to be a straight way: Truth hath
said, it is so, God hath laid it out so; and it is not all the Notions of
men that will make it otherwise. And hence those solemn Counsels
of the Scripture, <hi>Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, Give all
diligence to make all sure, Str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ve to enter in at the Straight Gate, So run
that you may obtain,</hi> &amp;c. though they be little attended by the loosenesse
of these times, yet they are of endlesse Moment and use, and had need
be awfully regarded by all that love their everlasting peace.</p>
            <p>He therefore that is in earnest about this great businesse, will be
glad of any good help to guide him in this way, this straight way to
Life. And though there be many choice helps herein already extant,
in the precious Labours of sundry of the Lords Faithful Servants, for
which this Age hath cause on bended Knees to blesse the Lord, and
which will be such a testimony against the wantonnesse thereof, as it
will never be able to answer: Yet of those that do clearly, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
livelily and searchingly discover and mark out this straight way,
with the several practical turns thereof, and shew where they that miss
of the end at last, do turn out of it, although they go far therein; of
those that Pilot us, when we come into the narrow Channel, unto the
very point of entrance into life, and shew us the Rocks and Shoals on
either hand distinctly; of these (I say) there is not too great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
For to speak any good and useful Truths, is good and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable;
<pb facs="tcp:40159:3"/>
but yet it is another and a further matter to hold the Candle to
the poor people of God (even to the meanest) to light them to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or to take the soul by the hand, and lead if from step to step
through all the difficulties, deceits and turnings at which the closest
Hypocrites do misse their way and lose themselves; and to do this so
convincingly, throughly and distinctly, as that the secrets of hearts
may be made manifest, the secure self-deceiver discovered and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and yet the humble upright Christian confirmed and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>In this Skill and Work, as the Author of the following Sermous,
was known to be among the first Three; so these Lectures of his, up
on <hi>the Parable of the Virgins,</hi> have been esteemed to excel in this kind;
having left such a relish upon the Hearers, as that they have not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>t of them to this day. It hath therefore been the instant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of many that heard them, and of some that have but heard of them,
that they might be imparted to the Publick. And surely both the
Subject and the manner of handling it is such, being wholly upon those
things wherein the heart and life of Religion lies, that we cannot disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of their Opinions, who have so earnestly desired it. All the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Books that speak to the heart of Religion are little enough
to feed that, and keep life there, especially in this languishing and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Age; wherein though there wants not common light and outward
Profession, yet losse of Love and inward deadnesse are as common. The
work being somwhat lengthy; and fitting Scribes not easily attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this Wildernesse, it hath occasioned this delay hitherto. But
we hope it will now be neither unacceptable nor unseasonable.</p>
            <p>These Sermons are now transcribed by industrious and intelligent
persons, and have been carefully reviewed and corrected. They are
written out of the Authors own Notes, which he prepared for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(only about a Sheet himself wrote out in his life-time, having
thoughts it seems of yielding to their desires who were earnest for their
publishing) by means whereof, though the Reader will often meet with
Curtnesse of expression, and though some lively passages that were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in preaching may be wanting, yet you will have this benefit to
have much in a little room. It may also easily be observed that nor cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
of words, but weight of things was here studied by, and flowed
from the heart and pen of the Author, which yet produceth the best
and truest, <hi>i. e.</hi> a real Rhetorick. In summe, although many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
incident to such post-humous Editions cannot be wanting, yet
we doubt not but the work will speak for it self, to the intelligent and
serious Reader.</p>
            <p>We are not ignorant that there be some who somwhat differ from
this our Author in the accommodation of this Parable, and Analysis of
some part of the Context, referring it to the times about the expected
calling of the <hi>Iews</hi> (and if so, the substance of the work may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to be in a more than ordinary manner proper and seasonable for
<pb facs="tcp:40159:4"/>
these times) But therein every man is left free to his own further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions. Neither is it for the sake of the bare exposition (much
lesse Chronical Accomodation) of the Text so much, that we publish
these things (in that kind the Labours of others do abound) but for
the spiritual, practical, lively, soul-searching truths and applications
thereof that are therein contained, the substance of which Truths the
impartial Reader will easily acknowledge to be clear both from this and
from other Scriptures.</p>
            <p>These Sermons preached by the Author, in a weekly Lecture, were
begun in <hi>Iune</hi> 1636. and ended in <hi>May</hi> 1640. In which time there was
a Leaven of <hi>Antinomian</hi> and <hi>Familistical</hi> opinions stirring in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as the world hath already in Print been informed: By occasion
whereof of the Reader will meet with sundry passages tending to reprove
and refute some of those conceits and to establish the contrary truth;
which we have not expunged, but let them passe mostly as we found
them; seeing it is no more then the world already knows that there
were such things then among us; and though that storm be (as to
it's open influence) comfortably blown over with us, yet the like
errours are (if not latent among some here) spread elsewhere by the
New Lights of these times, whence these helps against them are still
needful. And we doubt not but the substance of the Truth here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by our Author will stand and abide the Trial. Yea I suppose
I may freely take liberty to say, that among the many excellencies
wherewith the Lord endowed this precious instrument of his, this was
none of the least, that God taught him, and helped him to teach others
the ture middle way of the Gospel between the Legalist on the one
hand, and the Antinomian (or loose Gospeller) on the other, with
much and sweet clearnesse, as was evident in the whole course and way
of his preaching, and may in some measure appear both in his Books
formerly printed, and in the following Sermons. Other passages also
of special application to this Country and to those first times of it, we
willingly permit to passe the Presse, because they may be profitable to
others in like cases elsewhere, and of special benefit to the <hi>New-English</hi>
Reader, For why should we not desire and hope that the sutable solemn
counsels and warnings here given to these Churches by this <hi>Seer in Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
in reference to the main matters of life and godlinesse, may now be
of living, awakening and soul-instructing use to them (Oh that it may
be!) unto many Generations!</p>
            <p>Reader, if thou comest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thou bringest with thee a serious and humble heart, desirous to have

if thou desirest to walk with God in good earnest, and escaping all the

whom you never can forget; let it be a welcom Providence to have
these Truths thus revived to you, and put into your hands, that he
who is dead, may yet speak to you and yours. Get them into your
Houses to read, nay, into your Hearts to feed upon, as a choice and
precious Treasure. And let them still be a living and continual warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

business of providing for Eternity, 'tis very probable thou
maist be no stranger to the Name of this Reverend Author,
now with God, whose Name in both the <hi>Englands</hi> is as an
oyntment poured forth; and then thou wilt be eagerly desirous
to peruse these following Sermons, in tendency to the further increasing thy
stock of spiritual oyl, and when thou hast read them, and suckt forth the
sweetness and nourishment contained in them, and by the assistance of the
holy Spirit turned them into good and healthfull nutriment to thy soul, we

But perhaps thou hast never lighted on any of those Flowers which
this Holy man hath planted in Gods garden, and then we are confident thou
wilt meet with such savoury sweetness in this Discourse, as will make thee
wish Christs Church had longer enjoyed so choice and skilfull a Workman.
If thou beest one who hath hitherto little considered of God and thy soul, and
the concernments of Eternity, or only now and then had some morning dew
thoughts of that which deserves and requires the choicest and most vigorous
workings of thy soul, we wish thou wouldst so far comply with Gods goodness in
bringing this Book to thy hand, and gratific thy self, (we mean thy Soul, thy
better self,) as to read over this Treatise, in which thou wilt meet with those
serious and soul-piercing Truths, which by Gods blessing may be as poyson to
thy lusts, and awaken thee to a serious and hearty engaging in that work
which none ever yet repented of. For the occasion of publishing this Piece,
we refer thee to the larger Epistle of our Reverend Brother, and only adde,
that though a vein of serious, solid and hearty piety run through all this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
Works, yet he hath reserved the best wine till the last. The Lord help
thee and us so to reade and improve these and such like labours of Gods Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest

delusions, mixt with sore tribulations and oppressions, especially in the time
of Antichrist's raigne, as also great confusions, in all hearts and Churches, if
not throughout all the world after the tribulation of those daies; <hi>And then</hi> (saith
he) <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>shall appear the sign of the Son of man,</hi> and he shall be seen <hi>coming in
power and great Glory;</hi> but if you desire farther to know the day and hour when
this shall be, 'tis such a secret as my Father revealeth not to any, no, not to
the very Angels in Heaven, and therefore you need not know it, nor yet should
seek to know it; 'tis sufficient for you to know that before my coming there shall
be lamentable and sad times, and that when they are at their worst, that the Sun
and the Moon (through the horrours of mens hearts, and the universal confusions
in the world) shall seem to be darkned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that then it is time for me to come,
and set all in order again, then the time of my coming drawes nigh: Now this

                  <p n="2">2. Having thus spoken concerning his coming, he breaks off his speech in
describing his coming, and fals to discovering the state of the times toward, and
about the days of his coming, and this he doth from <hi>c.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 37. to <hi>c.</hi> 25. <hi>v.</hi> 31.
by the consideration of which he perswades to watchfulnesse against his coming.
1. Either (saith he) the times will be very sensuall and degenerate, as in the
daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> in some places of the world, <hi>c.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 38. which he illustrates
from two Parables, perswading therefore to watchfulnesse, to the end of the

persons (not given up to sensuality as in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> but) who are
the chast, Virgin, pure Churches of the world, not defiled with the whoredoms
in the world; and this our Saviour unfolds in this Parable. 3. Or if any be
awakened (as some shall) to look for Christ's coming, yet among these, some
through hard conceits of the Lord Jesus, shall be wilfully carelesse, and not
improve their Talents for the sake and use of the Lord Jesus, and this is
set down in the next Parable of the ten Talents, from <hi>v.</hi> 14. to <hi>v.</hi> 31. You see
therefore where this Parable stands, and to what purpose it is brought in. In

                  <p n="2">2. The scope of the Parable, <hi>v.</hi> 13. which is to perswade not simply to
watchfulnesse, but to continuance and perseverance in it from a prudent foresight
of the coming of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Parable it self is set down, agreeable to the custom of those times
wherein our Saviour lived, wherein their Marriages were usually celebrated in the
night time, she that was the Bride was attended with sundry Virgins to meet the
Bridegroom; these Virgins (it being night season) took therefore their Lamps
with them; those that were ready, and met the Bridegroom, were admitted to the
Marriage-Room and Supper; those that came after that time, if once the doors
were shut, weresurely kept out, though they knockt hard to come in. All this,
those who are acquainted with <hi>Iewish</hi> Histories and customs know to be true, which
we are to attend, because it gives not a little light to the true and genuine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of this Parable.</p>
                  <p>In which Parable note these two parts.</p>

                  <p>FIrst, I shall speak of the preparation made by the Church to meet with Christ
Jesus. Wherein also note these three things.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The persons that shall make this preparation, they shall not be corrupted
Members of degenerate Churches, where mens profession is grown foul through
length of wearing; but they are Professors of some eminent strain, some whereof
are truly sincere, others secretly unsound. And there is a double desription of
them. 1. From some things wherein they all agree. 2. From some other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
wherein they manifestly differ;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Those things wherein they all agree are three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are all Virgins; Virgin-Professors.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They were all awake and watchful for some time, ready to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
and hence it it is said, <hi>They took their Lamps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They all had so much Faith as to go out to meet the Bridegroom.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Those things wherein they did differ, are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Generally, <hi>five were wise,</hi> and <hi>five were foolish,</hi> v. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Specially, the foolish <hi>took Lamps</hi> but no Oyl, the wise did both, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>This is the rude draught of this first part of the Parable, the sum whereof is
this, That the state of the Members of some Churches about the time of Christ's
coming, shall be this, they shall not be openly prophane, corrupt and scandalous,
but Virgin-Professors, awakened (for some season) out of carnal security, stirring,
lively Christians, not preserving their Chastity and Purity meerly in a way of
works, but waiting for Christin a Covenant of Grace, only some of these, and a
good part of these, shall be indeed wise, stored with spiritual wisdom, fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the power of Grace; but others of them, and a great part of them too, shall be
found foolish at the coming of the Lord Jesus.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> VVHat are those things that may pull down this Kingdom?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Ignorance of those sins which may hurt and ruine it. There
are common infirmities which all the faithful have in common, for which the
Lord pities his, but there are some that are proper and personal to some particular
persons, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23. for which the Lord is angry even with his own; so there are
some sins which are common Church-infirmities, for which the Lord will not
cast off his people, but there are sometimes in several Churches proper Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins.
Now the Rule here is, if these be not seen and lamented and removed, if
the Lord be angry for these (as verily he will) and yet they do not so much as
know all this while what it is that hurts them, these sins will canker the roots,
and blast the most flourishing Churches. <hi>Ephesus, Rev.</hi> 1. 4. had her sin;
<hi>Sardis, Rev.</hi> 2. 1. had her sin. <hi>Laodicea</hi> had her sins, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. Now what if
they never know these, nor repent of these, you know then <hi>Ephesus</hi> Candlestick
must be removed, and <hi>Laodicea</hi> shall be spued out of Christs mouth. Oh this
hath been the bane of Churches, while they enjoyed their liberties, they could
not, nay (in truth) would not know their aile, in the day of Christs visitation of
them, and hence came their ruine, the cause of which they saw not; only it may
be the remnant that escaped, to whom the Lord shewed mercy, could read their
sins in their plagues. It is a lamentable spectacle to behold the ruines of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and that after such great slaughter and effusion of blood, they cannot tell
the thing that hath hurt, and doth still wast them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Self-seeking, a Spirit of self. Look as it is in a Kingdom, if there be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemy, and the body of the Army which should encounter with them, be
every man taken up, and taking thought how he may preserve his own Tent,
and do not joyn their forces together for common safety, it must perish, and the
Kingdom will be easily conquered: Or as it is with the body, if every member
seeks to preserve it self alone, and not that which preserves them all, (<hi>viz.</hi> the
Head) the body will drop down and die shortly. Christ Jesus is the Head of
this Body [his Church] Now 'tis certain if ye seek to preserve your own
name more than Christ's, to give more content to your own lusts, then to the
will and heart of Christ, if more careful of fetching feathers to your own nests,
and to shift for your selves, and not to attend (every man in his place) the
publick good of the Church, and Christ in it; 'tis certain God will forsake you,
and all will to ruine quickly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Church-members of publick spirits, are ever prosperous men. <hi>They shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
that love thee, Psal.</hi> 122. 6. That say in their hearts out of sense of Christ's
love, Lord, what shall I doe for thee? How may I be useful to thy people? But
if back and belly, mine and thine, be chief in request, this will ruine you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. League and Amity with the enemies of Christ's Kingdom, or peace with
our lusts; it is not sin, but a privy peace with sin, and a secret quietnesse in sin, which
overthrowes Christ's Kingdom: The Canaanites that were left alive, because
('tis said) they could not drive them out, how often did they vex, and prick,
and yoke the <hi>Israel</hi> of God? Those sins which you say, you cannot part with,
and hence yield unto them, and mourn not under them, those will ruine Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
Some sins you have forsaken, and could forsake, the danger lies not here.
Wrath goeth out against <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> because he loved him who hated the Lord,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the Church laies by her weapons. No Kingdom can be kept safe
in an ordinary way, where all their weapons are taken from them, or not used by
them, when their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and lay aside Faith (the shield whereby we defend our selves) and prayer
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40159:9"/>
(whereby we offend our enemies) what safety is to be expected now in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
Only be strong (saith the Lord to <hi>Ioshuah</hi> ) when he went out upon
that great service of the Lord, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 13. There is no more fearful
sign of ruine to a Church, than where the Spirit of prayer begins to fail; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
if any people under Heaven are ready to miscarry herein, we (that have our
fill of peace, and our yokes broken off from our shoulders) are in most danger;
but if it be so, look for such shakings of all hearts, and Churches also, as shall
make you find your tongues; and knees, and eares, and hearts again, if the Lord
means to dwell with you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Not bringing forth the fruits of the Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 43. Cut that
Church down that cumbers the ground, after many years pruning and wetting.
That Kingdom where there is Church-trading, but no considerable gain coming in,
will consume quickly, and die of it self. Fruit is the last end of the tree: All duties
you do, wherein you attain nor, or (at least) aim not at your last and utmost
end, but make your selves your own end, that is not fruit; Fruit refresheth
others that tast it; when a Christian walketh so as that another is not the better,
[not much refreshed] by him, but it may be hardned rather, by a saplesse exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
here is no fruit, and this cals for the axe to cut down the tree.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Divisions: This puls down Kingdoms without help of foreign enemies.
If a Kingdom thrusts swords into each others bellies, this will soon dispatch them.
It's the Jesuits plot to subdue by private divisions, whom they cannot conquer by
force of Armes: It was most pleasing to Satan to prevail with Christ to cast himself
down headlong from the Pinacle, rather than to fling him down himself. It is the
delight of Hell to set &amp; see Churches at variance among themselves, this is the first
thing he attempts in the best Churches, and it is commonly prosperous, if the
Lord leaves the watchmen to slumber, and not to be watchful, and fearful, and
sudddenly sensible of the least beginnings herein. It is a wonderful thing to
see what a small occasion of offence will do; a word, a gesture, a garment, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of indifferency, 'tis strange to see, how such small matters will gore, if Satans
head be in them, and his Horns be set upon them, especially in Churches where
men are set at liberty, and enjoy it, one must have liberty to speak one thing,
and another, another thing, I am of this mind saith one, I am not of that mind
(Brother) saith another: 'Tis wonderful to see what a fire, a secret smother,
and smoak of suspition will do. But oh take heed here, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 15. Love the

from the Ascension to the second coming of Christ, is called the last daies, <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 16, 17. Hence the Primitive Churches did (long since) and all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
at this day ought, to live in a daily expectation of his coming again, as these
Virgins here did. And hence some think, than all this time may be the daies
of the coming of Christ, wherein all the Churches either do, or should look out
for the coming of Christ. Now although I dare not exclude these daies (in a
large sense) from being the daies of Christ's coming, as being the last daies,
and it being the duty of all to wait for this coming of Christ, as well as those
who lived long before us, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 7. Yet I believe here is meant
more particularly the latter part of those last daies: For our Saviour having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
of many things which shall fall out before his second coming, yet he seems
to single out some particular time in these last daies; to which he doth annexe
this [<hi>then</hi> ] and that is evident to all that view well the Text, that they are the
daies of his coming, for though all the daies of the Gospel may be called the daies
of the Son of man, and some daies especially wherein there is some kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Son of man, as when he comes to hear prayers, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 8. yet to
speak properly, they are not the daies of the coming of the Son of
man. And look as the daies of <hi>Noah</hi> were not all the daies from the Creation to
the Deluge, but those particular years before the Flood, so 'tis here, some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

in that they are all Virgins; What are these? <hi>Ans.</hi> To omit the Popish

                  <p>I shall rather make use of Scripture to give light to interpret this place; for ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, know, the whole Church may be called the Spouse of Christ, and take
every member alone, a Virgin attending on this Spouse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. nay the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. calls the whole Church a <hi>Virgin,</hi> so that by Virgins are meant
whole particular Churches of Christ, together with the several Members thereof.
Now Virgins are such as are fit for marriage, and not defiled with any man, as
it's said of <hi>Rebecca:</hi> so by Virgins are meant those that are not polluted within,
or without with the evils of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. but more is to be understood
here, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. when once marriage is come, they cease to be Virgins, and are
Wives; yet when espoused to Christ, now they are spiritually Virgins; hence
these here are only like to Virgins: so that the meaning of Virgins is this; by
Virgins is meant such Churches, or members of Churches as are divorced from all
other Lovers, and matcht only to Jesus Christ: these only look for the coming of
Christ, and communion with him, these only are received into communion.</p>

I shall not need to press this here; but there are two other things which I shall
shew, for there are two things that every man doth before he is espoused to the
Lord Jesus; either first he departs and goes a whoring by unlawfully lusting after
the creature, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 27. <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 4. Or 2. He is lawfully married as he thinks
unto the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 3, 4. the Law is there compared to a Husband, from which
Christ indeed delivers his, yet some will stick to it: either the Soul takes content
in some creature more than in Christ, or in some righteousnesse more than in the
Lord Jesus; Now to be divorced from all other things, is for the heart to be taken
off from all worldly contentments. Secondly, from comforting it self in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of its own work and righteousness, and this must be found in all them that
look for communion with the Lord Jesus.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 THe heart must be divorced from Lusts after, and pleasures in any creature; for
proof, we must know this:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The soul of every man must have something to quiet and comfort it like the
stomack, it's death and hell to want it (as the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wildernesse:) hence
it must have it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is nothing that can comfort the thirsty heart, but 'tis either in
the spring, or cistern, fountain, or bottles, either in God, or in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence man having lost God, and all good there, seeks for it in the creature,
and because he finds not enough in one, digs for it in another, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. <hi>Who will
shew us any good?</hi> and hence the Soul because it never found that infinite sweetnesse
in God himself, hence lusts after, and delights in the creature for it self, loves
pleasure for pleasure, delights in creature for the creature, not for God, why should
he, seeing he never found content there? and here the soul of man cleaves night
and day, committing spiritual whoredom before the face of God; now if ever any
soul hath communion with Christ, it must be divorced from all creatures thus, for
Lust is a desire after, and content in the creature for the creatures sake.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Because while the heart is in league with any creature besides the Lord, 'tis at
deadly enmity with the Lord,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 4. If a man hath a rich commodity, and
one comes and offers half the worth of it, he takes it as a contempt; if it be not
worth this, it is worth nothing; so the Lord is worthy of all our love, our lives, our
souls though we had a thousand of them, and will a man not part with his lusts
for him? I tell you the Lord takes himself sleighted, contemned, and loathed; if
not worth all a mans love, he is worth nothing; now the creature is made a God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
made a mans last end, which is as proper to God, as to make him the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi>
of all. Here the greatest wrath is to give a man his fill of the creature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Because so long the soul cannot see,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> nor come by the eye and feer of Faith to
the Lord Jesus, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 44. and think Christ better than all; as Birds in a string
may fly high, but when they come to the end of the line, fall down there; and so
though the soul flies to Christ, yet when indeed it comes to the end of parting
withall, it falls down, and falls off from Christ. Whole men have no heart nor
desire after Physitians; when all limbs are whole and strong, no desire after Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
so while any thing easeth and contenteth the heart, there is no desire after
<hi>Christ, Hos.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Whoredom and wine have taken away the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Because so long the heart if it do come, cannot stay with Christ to do any thing
for Christ,<note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>You cannot serve God and riches, i. e.</hi> two Masters, who
have constant employment, and Christ hath set us such employment. Hence
men on sick-beds are tame as may be, promise any thing, because their joy in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40159:11"/>
the creature is gone: Hence on the other side many men after many springings
of heart are choaked by thorns of the world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the abundant love that the Lord Jesus shews to them that ever have,<note place="margin">Reason 4.</note> or
look for communion with him. Those to whom we shew much love, from those
we expect much again. As a man if taken or cast out to be servant, one looks
not for love from him; but when a man hath given himself, and made over all
his estate to another, now all love is too little. So 'tis with the Lord Jesus, <hi>Iohn</hi>

things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Lord doth not ever give a man content in his sins and lusts, but
wounds Conscience for the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That so long as the Lord wounds a mans Conscience for sin, no creature can
give a man comfort or content. <hi>A wounded spirit who can bear? Iudas</hi> casts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

                  <p n="3">3. Hereupon the Law fals upon a man, or a man meets with the Law; for as
all a mans sorrow is upon him because the Law is broken, all a mans care is how
he may keep it again. What shall I do? As a man cast in prison for debt, there
all is opened; an the Law like an earnest suitor, 1. Presleth hard for love and
obedience. 2. Promiseth a rich portion, eternal life, if he can keep it; If not
you must be damned; therefore now forsake your sins, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hence the soul not knowing a better Husband, consents and resolves to
cleave to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. <hi>Whatever the Lord will have us do, we will do it;</hi>
and here it stayes, and is comforted, here it rests; as in <hi>Asa</hi> his time all rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for the Oath, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. 1, 2. and if it find not perfect comfort
because of imperfect work, it then closeth with Christ for to make up and piece up
all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. And now I say 'tis comforted in what it hath, and doth, and here it
rests; now from hence it must be divorced: What need I prove it, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
hath so fully, <hi>Galat. per totum,</hi> and consider the young man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
I say, the soul must be from this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because he that doth thus, sets up another Christ, and makes himself his own
Saviour; can the Lord Jesus take such a soul into communion with him? Suppose
a Prince be pulled by his people from his Throne, and they set up another pious
vertuous Prince to Rule, will this serve the turn to say he is an honest Prince? so
though duties be never so good, yet not to advance Christ, is to pull down
Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because such persons do commonly most oppose the Lord Jesus in a way of
believing, though not in a way of doing; the Lord hath more ado if any of these
be brought home, to bring them in, they have somewhat to say for themselves,
they have stronger forts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Scribes and Pharisees rejected the counsel of
God against themselves, and hence no people lest to such deep desertions as these;
if the Lord intend mercy to them, for they have more need than others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because hereby a man doth but make a conspiracy against Gods greatest plot
that ever he had a foot, <hi>viz.</hi> to advance his free Grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4. you are fallen
from Grace, for nothing makes a man more fit to boast than works, and resting in
them; sin makes a man ashamed, and therefore if they come to Heaven, they
have laid a foundation to thank themselves for somewhat; hence no communion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40159:12"/>
with Jesus Christ in this frame; no the Lord will tear down this foundation, and
make the soul cry guilty, and make this Husband, the Law, to be judge, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and condemn, and now come and ask, what have you to plead for your life

all Marriage bonds there is a choice made, and if love be great, there is little
standing on terms: let me have him though I begg with him; so the soul sees such

in prison with him, though in the Garden in Agonies with him, though in the Cross
in desertions with him, he is enough; as <hi>Peter</hi> when he saw Christ on the Sea, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired

<hi>The Lord is my portion for ever, Psalm</hi> 73. 26. And before ever you can
look for communion with him, you must make this choice of him, and glad too
you may have him on any terms, nay put it to any soul the Lord hath done good
to, and ask it, will you have him? 'tis such a mercy I cannot conceive how one so
vile as I should have it: have him, the Lord of glory, the Prince of life and peace;
O yes; Hence <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>Master, what shall we have that have forsaken all, and followed
thee?</hi> you shall sit with me on Thrones; and look as Christ now chuseth the soul
above others, as well as in Heaven, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 16. so it now chuseth Christ, <hi>Whom
have I in Heaven or earth;</hi> many when they think of death, or are dying, then
chuse him, but not now: or chuse him for outward blessings, not spiritual favour
and life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The soul hence gives it self like one espoused to her Husband to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,

give wages for their work, but Husbands and Wives give themselves one unto

in the Church, they do for God in hope of wages, and the Lord blesseth them it
may be outwardly, but he that is espoused to Christ, gives himself, Lord I can do
nothing for thee, give nothing to thee, but I give my self to thee, that thou
wouldst work in me, and by me, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 13. So the Lord is a suitor to many a man
that never gives himself to him: he gives them some comforts, some winning,
drawing, melting me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and good words, a thousand wishes as <hi>Capernaum</hi> did, but not themselves; but
this must be, if ever you look for communion with him: hence <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I am
thine, save me;</hi> hence some made shipwrack of Faith, they were not the Lords;
hence the Lord saith, he knows who are his, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18, 19. his send their to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens

love, when he will not give, especially anothers own: thou art none of thine own,

of God is the greatest losse; for 'tis the utmost and last plague upon the
damned in Hell: My Comforts, my Friends, Means, Heaven is gone,
but if God were mine, I could be comforted; No, God is gone: Hence no
sorrow for any losse so much as for this. <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. 15. <hi>God is departed

seel no losse at all, or if they do, have not so much Grace as the damned in
Hell, to mourn bitterly for it, so as nothing can comfort them, or if they do, they
are soon eased and quiered before the Lord returns? Why surely here is the
great cause of it, they have some other thing to ease their hearts in the want and
losse of God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 13, 14. Men must have water to drink, why do men live
from the fountain, go not to it, nay not know it? Because they have broken
pits, and wels at their own doors: So here. And hence the damned that have
lived at ease here all their life time, assoon as ever dead, then they cry out of the
losse of God, when 'tis too late, because while they lived, they had somwhat to
ease themselves withall. And hence many that have lived long with convinced
Spirits and guilty Conscienes, when they come to die, then they are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
of mind, agonies of heart, insomuch as their sweat trickles like water
from them, and their doleful outcries for losse of time, strike to the hearts of all
that come near them. Oh! God is gone, because now all comforts which were their
Gods, and in stead of God before, have taken their final leave of them. Search
your hearts therefore all you that hear me this day. Wast never troubled yet?
Yes, I have lost my health, my child, my husband, my goods, and this hath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled
me: But tell me, Did'st never feel a losse of God blessed for ever? loss
of his light, his sweetnesse, his love, his fellowship, his presence, &amp;c. and this
hath been thy intollerable load? Or if thou hast felt it, hast thou sought and

a little, then 'tis certain and as clear as the Sun, there is some creature or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

which is instead of God to thee, and which therefore is thy God. It may be thy

much trouble under them all. If so, suspect it, beleeve it that there is some
league with a lust. For there is a double life of a Christian. 1. An outward life,
which others see: Men see he comes to Church, prayes in the Family, &amp;c.
2. There is a secret inward life; according to that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Thy Father
which sees in secret,</hi> which none knowes but himself, and the Lord; and this is an
ineffable communion with God, vision of God, delight in God, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.
<hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within.</hi> There is an open life of prayer, and
hearing, and fasting, and there is an inward, secret life in all these, wherein
the Lord acquaints himself with his people, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 3. <hi>To see thee as I have
seen thee.</hi> Now there be divers have this open life, yet wanting the secret life.
As we love not to live among Tombes, not to have communion with dead men; so
the Lord is a stranger to them. He may secretly sweeten an Ordinance to them,
and move them, and shake and trouble them, but himself is a stranger, spiritual
miseries not removed, spiritual mercies not conveyed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Why have
we fasted, and thou regardest not? You took pleasure saith the Lord, and break the
bonds of wickednesse,</hi> &amp;c. I know Saints may be thus denied, and it may be for
some space of time, yet they quarrel not with God for denying them, but are
more taken off from pleasures thereby. <hi>Thou hidst thy face, and I was troubled,</hi>
though the Mount stood still. But some there be whom neither good day
mends them, not bad day pairs them: Surely there is some content thy heart
is bewitched withal. That look as 'tis with a suitor to another, let him while he
comes to her, professe never so much love, and desire love, yet if when he goes
from her, commits lewdnesse with every one, she will lock him out. So 'tis
here; never did I know any lockt out from the power and sweetnesse of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
but because they went a whoring from God out of them. The Lord
knowes (though others do not) whether 'tis so with you. Look therefore upon
thy self, you enjoy great means every where in this place. Is it enough to have
Ordinances? the Ark? No, Do you find the Lord in them? Blessed be
God. But tell me truly, Do you find no want of God? Yes. Do you find
him? I find more knowledge, strength, &amp;c. But do you find no God usually?
No. Then either some creature contents thee, or if the Lord should refresh thee,
thou would'st be content without him. Man and wife will (if they love) meet
at Meals, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. But when no meeting, dead prayers, dry Sermons, sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Sacraments, worse then before. If thou beest the Lord's, he will by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fictions
purge, &amp;c. But if thou continuest so, look for no communion in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

                  <p>II. DIscoveries whether we are married to the Law or not. And here I shall
stay longer. Where I premise,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When I speak of not being married to the Law in stead of Christ, I do not
hereby exempt your selves from obedience to the Law, after you are in Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do not think I speak against all evidencing your estates from conformity to
the Law; though I do from some subjection and obedience performed to the
Law.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the Law was never dead in thee, thou art married to the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 2.
Now look as tis with a husband, if the wife be sick, and he be at home, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forsakes her, he will comfort her, and support and chear her; so that if he
chear her not, its a sign he is dead; if he doth, its a sign he is alive; for the
life of the Law, is the comfort and support that the Law doth give for a time.
So that if thou wert never brought to that sore straight, that thou hast not felt
any one duty to cheer or revive thee, and comfort thee, but hast found some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thing or other to do it, its certain you are yet married to the Law. <hi>Ex. gr.</hi>
It may be thou hast been troubled in mind for thy sins, What hath cheared thee?
I have forsaken them, and cast out <hi>Ionah,</hi> and there hath been a calm: Why
this forsaking thy sins (which hath not been all but some) is not Christ, but an
act of the Law. Oh but I have fallen again into sins, this hath troubled thee:
What hath cheared thee? I have repented and been sorry for them, and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to do so no more. This is the life of the Law still. Oh but you find sins
prevailing against you, and you cannot part with them; and hence dare not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
against them. Oh but my desire is good though, my will hath ever been
against them. Oh ignorance! This desire is but a work of the Law, 'tis not
Christ. Oh but I have found no desire sometime: What hath quiered you now?
I have trusted to Christ: You have done it. The Lord never made you feel a
need of the Lord, to draw you to trust; though to be assured of Christ's love.
Is this a legal Act? <hi>Ans.</hi> As obedience to the Law done by the power of Christ, is
an Evangelical work, so to perform any Evangelical work from a mans self, is a
Legal work; and you are under the life of the Law. So that thou hast not been
so oft troubled, but the Law hath supported thee; thou hast not been brought to
that passe as the Church, the Spouse was, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 5, 6. And as one of my best
friends, and best men that lives this day in the world, after many wrestlings to
find somwhat in himself to chear him, and could not; <hi>Now</hi> saith he, <hi>if the
Lord out of his good Nature,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>do not help me, I am undone for ever; for I
have a heart and a nature against him, and the more I do, the worse I am. And
therefore thither I look.</hi> Surely you are under the life of the Law, and are
fat enough off from Christ, if not sensible of this. Not that a man is alway thus,
for he that cannot feel afterward the Lord Jesus by the power of his Grace work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his heart, I would conclude, he never had any at all. But at first 'tis so.
For these two things man naturally seeks,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To have a righteousnesse in himself that will ease him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To have it from himself: Kitchin Physick is not far to fetch.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lords plot in saving his, is, 1. To make them seek it out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in another: <hi>Look unto me and be saved, all the ends of the earth.</hi> 2. To have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40159:14"/>
all from another, that so, <hi>no flesh night glory before him.</hi> And to doubt of this, is
to doubt whether God hath plotted the Glory of his Grace or no. Hence the
Lord empties the soul of both, that the soul saith, <hi>Ashur shall not save us, Hos.</hi> 14.
3, 4. None durst, none can comfort it. And now to the wonde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and everlasting joy of a poor cast-away, and the eternal honour of his free
Grace, now, and never till now, doth he begin to make the match between
the Lord Jesus and this poor soul: And as the Lord never comes to him till now,
so he never will come to the Lord, while he hath the least good; as it was with
the Prodigal, while any husks, or as it was with the woman with her bloody issue,
while any mony to spend on other Physitians, never will try what Christ can do.
And therefore those that never yet knew of the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>th of the Law, they are yet
married to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 17. I know many a soul grieve; for the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>th of this hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and now thinks 'tis undone, I cannot do this and that, though formerly
I could indeed; I say if there be any love of Christ, now is the time of it. Only
understand Gods scope here in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If a man complains more or chiefly for want of grace or righteousnesse,<note place="margin">Sign 2.</note> to
remove sin, and not so much for want of Jesus Christ: Then in this case 'tis as it
is with a woman, that man for whose absence she mourns most, that is her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
She saith the other is, no but he is not. So this is the estate of many a
soul, they have neither Christ not righteousnesse: Now they complain so much
that their hearts sink and dye away quite within them: And what is it for? I
cannot do this, nor I do not find nor feel such signs and affections within me.
Such a vile heart, I know not the like, such rising in my heart to sin and thoughts
of it; why if you had Christ, all this would be mended. <hi>I can do all through
Christ.</hi> But you complain not for want of Christ, nor need of him from these
two Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the feeling of your sins, does not make you feel a greater need of
Christ, as <hi>Iohn, I have need to be baptized,</hi> &amp;c. but drive you further from Christ,
and reason it out against him, And why? Because you would have a righteousness
without him which you stand in need of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because he that seels a need of the Lord Jesus, shall not when he is offered,
need intreating to take him; as you shall not need intreat hungry men to eat their
bread, you shall not need to intreat <hi>Zacheus</hi> to receive Christ joyfuly. But no
commands, no intreaties can prevail with you to take him when he is offered, you
have no heart to it. Like women that love their own husbands, grieve so for
their absence, that they have no heart to any other offer. Is it thus with thee?
Then 'tis with thee, as it was with that young man, that askt Christ what he
should do to inherit eternal life; he liked Christ well, but he did not feel a need
of Christ himself so much, as of some more knowledge of the Law, and ability to do
it. Its the great plot of Arminians, to make Christ a means only, to make every
man a first <hi>Adam;</hi> setting men to work for their living again; for they grant all
Grace is lost, all comes from Christ, Christ gives all, and to Christ we must look
for all; and then when we have it, use it well, thus you shall have life, else look
for death: So 'tis a misery many a soul is in. Men will trade in small wares, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than live on anothers Almes. Do you think the Lord takes it well to make
him a Merchant for your ends? Oh no, never look to have communion with him
in this way!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Those that close with, but rejoyce more in a little Grace they receive from
Christ,<note place="margin">Sign 3.</note> than in all the fulnesse in Christ, more in a little they do, than in all
the Lord Jesus hath done, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. That is a womans husband, in whom she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth
most. Do you rejoyce more in what you have, and do, than in what
the Lord Jesus hath, and hath done? more in what you receive from him (for
a hypocrite may receive from Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 2.) than in what there is in him?
It argues a whorish heart. I know a man may rejoyce in what Christ works in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40159:15"/>
him, but 1. not more in this than in Christ himself. 2. A child of God may
while he knows not whether Christ is his do so: but you think the Lord is yours;
well, when you feel affections and life, then you are glad, when that is lost then
sad; why is there no life when thou art dead, no glory when thou art base, no
wisdom, no communion with God when thou hast none? Yes, why dost thou not
rejoyce in this which is here most fully, which Saints presenting, please the Lord
more by, than by giving the glory of Angels infinite millions of years: Oh thy
heart is not in love with Christ, but somewhat else, for here is the joy of all
Saints, <hi>In thy seed shall all Nations account themselves blessed:</hi> all Nations, one and
another, <hi>Isai.</hi> 45. 24, 25. <hi>shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</hi>
Consider therefore this, thou art sometime joyed; why? O I find my heart thus
and thus, and is this all? yes, for when this is gone, all joy dies; and should I not
do thus? yes, else you never felt comfort of it: but not only rejoyce here, but
when the beam is gone, the Lord is not gone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> when the bottles are
spent, the spring is full.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that performs any duty ultimately to ease his conscience,<note place="margin">Sign 4.</note> he is married
yet unto the Law, for there are two sorts of duties to the Law.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some are directed to give Christ content to ease his heart, by seeing Gods
love in Christ, then love being shed, the heart sheds it on Christ again: and thus
saith the Apostle, <hi>I through the Law am dead to it, that I might live to God, Gal.</hi>
2. 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some are to give the soul ease, it sees sin, and fears it must dye and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
appears, and when it lies down, it fears it shall never awaken again; and when
it hears, thinks no mercy, but only threats belong to it: and hence having no
peace of conscience to think God will love it, it loves duties, doth duties, and
now takes these for good tokens and signs of love, and if it feels a need of Christ,
'tis only to ease it. Now a man is married to the Law, when he crouds for ease in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

then thy heart is careless again; 'tis certain you are yet married to the Law: as

if I durst I should; bless thy self thou maist: but remember that the Lord will

him go, never to see him more, when no tears shall ever prevail again; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if thou hast been found out this day, confess and give glory to God, and let
thine eyes be tears, that Christ would overcome and draw thy soul with love, and

get your affections, if entangled, to come off if ensnared to any other thing,
and set your hearts, bestow your love upon him. For 'tis not a dead Faith,
(but such a faith as is animated by love) that doth espouse you to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.
<hi>Faith which works by love.</hi> And therefore as the love of other things (not worth
looking after) hath got the soveraignty and royalty of thy heart, so this is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
love, when it bears rule in the heart; let Christ have this love. And as
you have loved creatures for themselves, now love the Lord Jesus for himself.
And as they have easily enticed you to set your hearts upon them, now be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to set your dearest affections on him. Its said of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, he was
the <hi>Bride-groom's Friend,</hi> to speak for him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 29. And truly 'tis the main
work of the Ministry, to wooe for Christ; and so to present chast Virgins to
Christ. This shall be my work now, which may be seasonable in this decaying
time. Therefore I shall chiefly bend my speech to three sorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To them that never yet loved the Lord Jesus, unlesse it be from the teeth
outward.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Those that have been striving for this, yet cannot to their own feeling come
to this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Those that have so, but their affections are dried up, and love is parched
away, <hi>iniquity abounds,</hi> &amp;c. And my Motives shall be these four,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider the Glory of the person, whom I shall be a spokes-man for this
day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40159:16"/>
2. Consider he makes love to thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider that all he seeks for is love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider what he will do for thee, how he will love thee, if thou wilt love
him.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnsider the Glory of the person, for whom I plead for love. What can
you love besides him? Where can you find any like unto him? I know
the Glory of the Lord is not revealed, because the grasse withers not, the flower
fades not, the creature appears not in his withering vanity, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. But if the
Lord would but open your eyes, to see him, this would win your hearts alone
to him.</p>
                  <p>Now I shall single out only these five things, to give you a glimpse of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Lift up thy heart, and say, <hi>Lord hide not now thy face from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is the Prince of the Kings of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. The glory of the
world is a Kingdom, the glorious Diamond of that Kingdom is a Prince in his
Glory; now for a poor Beggar to have an offer of love from the greatest Prince in
the world, would it not tempt her? Would she not forsake her lovers, and
set her heart on him? Why look what a distance there is between the poorest
Peasant and the highest Prince, so base, and a thousand times more are all the
Princes of the world to Christ, whose Dominion is from sea to sea, from Sun to
Sun, who sets up and puls down Kings like Counters, who rules their Courts,
their Kingdoms, their hearts, and they do not do, they cannot do, but what
he will. Other Kings are Princes, are Rulers of men, Christ Prince of Kings.
Now who would not be glad of his love? who having tasted death, is set down
on the right hand of God, on high, cloathed with endlesse Glory, who hath
Kings in his chaines, whose breath is not in his nostrils, whose favour is not for
a day, but he lives and reignes for ever. Now doth Christ reign? Is he a Lord,
and in Glory upon his Throne? Methinks I see Jesus at the right hand of God,
your foolish affections have undone you if you love him not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is appointed by the Father to be Judge of quick and dead, at the last
day, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 22, 23. as well as to rule all now. So that if you do maintain enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
against him, he may let you alone, you may live in health, and die in peace,
in the eye of man, and in thine own eyes too: Yet there is a day coming he will
break out of Heaven <hi>with a shout,</hi> and appear in the clouds in the amazing Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Father, <hi>with all his mighty Angels, and all the dead shall hear his voice,</hi> and
you shall appear before him with this body, when the Heavens shall burn
round about him, and the earth shall tremble under him, and all guilty eyes
mourning and wayling because of him. Then you shall know what 'tis to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
him, and wish, oh that I had loved him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7. You that say you love
him, yet by an im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>enitent heart pierce him, you shall wayl, even so, <hi>Amen.</hi>
Men do not see an end of these things, not the Glory of the Lord another day.
Hence creatures are loved, and the Lord of Glory is loathed. A great Prince
may not be so highly esteemed, untill he appears in his state. Prisoners would
give any mony, much more love, for the Judges Favour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He only is the procuter and author of all the good that ever thou didst suck
out here, though thou hast neither known him, not been thankful
to him. For look as it was with Angels, so it should have been with man; the
wrath of God should have been poured out upon him, and on all the world, and
creatures should have been tormentors of him, but that the Lord Jesus begged
and bought the world. And hence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. called <hi>Saviour of all, but chiefly
of the Elect.</hi> Micah 4. 4. <hi>In his daies men shall sit under Vines and Fig-trees:</hi> So
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40159:16"/>
that if ever any creature did thee good, it was Jesus that put that sweetnesse in it,
out of his fulnesse, and set it awork, sent it to thee, gave it thee to do thee good.

lived in blaspheming God, never hÃ ve heard of a Gospel but for Christ: And
will you not love him? Oh ungrateful world! unnatural generation of men!
Why dost love any creature? 'Tis for the paint of it and good in it. If there be so
much in it, what is there in Christ that gave it, that dropt it into it? Never
love him if there be any thing good that is not by him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 1. <hi>The Lord
hath heard my prayer, I will call on him as long as I live.</hi> Much more when the

                  <p n="4">4. He is the everlasting wonderment of Saints in Heaven; the Queen of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
heard of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which made her come to see him, but she before imagined
but that which now she saw with her own eyes, and that wrapt her out of her
self. Here we hear of the Lord Jesus, of his beauty and glory, and this draws
Saints to him, and when come, they see that which they never saw before,
especially when in Heaven: then fall down in everlasting admiration at this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
for the blessedness of Saints is to see Christ in his glory, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 24. Now
this lies in an infinite good, this cannot be seen in a finite time: hence Saints
shall be piercing their eyes deeper and deeper into this mystery, and shall ever see
more and more, but never see all, and this is their joy and glory in Heaven; Is it
so? what think you, is Christ worthy of your love or no? look upon all the glory
of the field of this world, you may see an end of all perfection, but never here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is the delights and bosome love of God himself, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30. Hence
<hi>Iohn</hi> when he came to set Christ out, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 35. <hi>The Father loveth the Son.</hi> Now
is it so, surely though you see not, taste not this good, yet there 'tis; now tell me
if this person do not challenge love! would you not be glad to have him? you will
say, can he look upon such a VVretch, embrace such a Leper as I? no surely he
will never do it.</p>

the Lord Jesus is a Suitor unto, that now you would be espoused to him:
<hi>He came unto his own, and they received him not.</hi> Whatever the secret purpose of
Christ is, I regard not: In this Evangelical dispensation of Grace, he makes
love to all, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. 'Tis clear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 2, 3. If there be a Gospel in the
world, there is this love of Christ yearning towards all; especially all that have
this Gospel of peace sent to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10. <hi>'Tis tidings of great joy to all people,</hi>
as Law is tidings of great sorrow to all people, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 14. Angels from Heaven
preacht this <hi>good will towards men.</hi> For if the challenge of love from men should
be founded on his actual love to some, having died for some, then the offer
would be particular. But 'tis grounded, 1. On his own worth and Glory, and
hence he challengeth love. 2. On this, for ought I know he hath loved me. So
that thou art not so vile, but the Lord Jesus his heart is toward thee, and his eye
is upon thee for love. But 'tis not all love, but only some that overcomes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now 'tis real love. 2. Fervent love, 3. Constant. 4. Pure love he

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40159:17"/>
for rejecting of this love, but the Lord is really angry for rejecting it, and wroth
with nothing so much as that, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 12. here he swears in his wrath, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.
11. when he opens his bosom for thee to rest in, and thou wilt not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Look but upon the dealings of God with thee: 1. Hast not oft thought some
in Hell better than thee? why the ruine of millions of men is to win love from
thee, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10. 2. Hath not the Lord sent many a mercy to thee, not one
but was to win thee, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 10, 11, 12. 3. Hath not the Lord with-held ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from thee, as here in this wildernesse, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 3, 4. 4. Hath not the Lord
sent many sorrows, terrors, fears, cares, wearisome businesses that thou hast wished
an end of life? this is love, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 6. 5. Hath not the Lord moved thy heart
many a time-toward him by perswasions, arguments which have a power to
move the heart, this is love, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>Cords of a man.</hi> 6. Hath not the Lord
oft melted thy heart for mercies, as <hi>David</hi> when he might have killed <hi>Saul;</hi> truly
you may feel his love which is much towards you; that which keeps off thy heart
from love, is, the Lord intends it not to me, he is not plain with me. But he sends
to thee his plain Gospel which thou art to attend unto; and he takes fittest seasons
to speak to thee now in the time of thy heath: and doth he not oft visit thy heart
when thou art alone?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis servent, vehement, earnest love: sometimes a Suitor is real, but he is
not earnest; now thus the Lord is: 1. The Lord longs for this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. 2. Pleads
for this, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>What iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Thinks long for this time, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. 27. <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem

<hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Broken with their whorish heart.</hi> 5. Content to give away any thing for
it, all the love of Christ is founded on this. 6. If thou comest not presently, he is
content to wait that he may be gracious.</p>

breath, as thou maist see and taste love, <hi>Isai.</hi> 27. 3. <hi>Isai.</hi> 65. 2. 1. After all thy
whorish departing from God, that if man should do so, no man would own, yet he
saith, <hi>Return to me:</hi> thou seest never a creature but thou hast loved more than Christ,
yet return. 2. When God threatens most terribly, and sets his fury on record, yet
then there he minds nothing but love, <hi>Ier.</hi> 36. 2, 3. 3. When none else will own and
pitty thee thou art so vile, yet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 2, 3. the Lord saith <hi>live, then is a time of

4. Nay when thou hast cast away thy self as a forlorn creature, yet <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 3.
<hi>In thee the Fatherless find mercy.</hi> 5. When he hath thee in his arms, ready to give
thee up, yet then, <hi>How shall I give thee up O Ephraim, Hos.</hi> 11. 8. I tell thee if one
sparkle of his eternal blasting displeasure should fall upon thee, it would be so intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
that it would sink thee; his love is as strong as death, no water can quench it;
oh 'tis not so with man, or great men, once repulsed is enough: why should the

that have time, not of them that want it; take heed this make thee not despise him.</p>

could have gone to others, he could have and can fetch his glory out of thy ruine:
he was blessed before all worlds; and by all thy sins thou dost but throw stones
against the wind, or snow-balls against the Sun: why doth he do it? O 'tis thy

do many spiritual duties, or good duties from themselves</hi> For as there is a bredth in
the wayes of Grace, that every Christian hath not the like measure of Grace, so
there is a bredth or latitude in the wayes of sin: every sinner breaks not forth
into the like measure of sin, but some are far better than others; as the three
grounds that were bad, yet one better than another. Now how comes this about?
why, the Lord gives that power to act (as all the knowledg of a God) by the light
of Nature (falsly so called) this is the work of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. Hence all terrors,
and comforts, and duties of Conscience are all from God: so the Historical Faith
of the Gospel which many have, and so to confesse and professe no salvation but
by Christ, together with a readinesse to dye in defence of this truth and Religion,
and joy from this, and reformation of life upon this, none of these are natural to
this soyl of a mans soul, but all are planted there by God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2, 3. and so
that man can act according to the Law, be strict in Sabbaths, frequent in Fastings
and Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis from God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. And why doth the Lord work this?
'tis else no living in the world among men, and because Christ is the <hi>politicum ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put,</hi>
and hath bought all men in the world to be his servants, hence gives them
gifts which he turns for the good of his people: but yet this is the nature of all
these abilities, that a man acts from the strength and power of them, not from
Christ, <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because every man is under the guidance either of the first or second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and power of either: now as the power of the second Covenant is to draw a
man out of himself to another, and so to make him act from another: so the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the First is to drive a man into himself by terrors, and fears, and hopes, and
rewards, and so to enable him to act from himself; hence 'tis impossible but they
must act ever from themselves.</p>
                  <p>And 2. Because though many good Gifts, and moral vertues may be said to be
supernatural, <hi>i. e.</hi> above the power of Nature to work, yet never above the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of nature: for let God work never so many good things in men, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
i e an ill stomack when diseased, is strongest, there Nature turns all into the

humor, and so a man dyes at last; so the power of sin in Nature being more
powerful than any Grace which by common work is given it. ever turns that
Grace into it self, and leads it into captivity, bondage, and service of it self; so
that there is never a Grace but 'tis made to serve some lust, as in <hi>Iehu,</hi> in <hi>Iudas,</hi>
&amp;c. and God complains, <hi>Isai.</hi> 43. 24. So this I say is the case of thousands unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,

do, they have it not from God; but 'tis not so with me, for I have and do many
good things, which I acknowledg come from God, and I thank God I am not as
other men. Now mark, 'tis true, nakedly considered no good could come from
unregenerate men, but yet the Lord gives power to many to do, so the Lord hath
done to thee, and thou hast been thankful for it. And this is common, many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
themselves great sinners, but yet they can believe: many say they can do
little, but their desire and will at worst is to do: tell them these are not right, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they come from the Lord, they will say the Lord doth all, and they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
it, and so I believe, and 'tis true, but 'tis not such a work of the Lord as is
peculiar to the Elect, because when the Lord hath wrought these, you act only
from them, and hence never feel a want of these, for the Lord never yet wrought
any Grace in his people, but after they have had it, and tasted of it, he hath
more or lesse deserted them, and so hath made them feel a want of it, and made
them fetch it again with sighs, and groans, and tears; now it hath never been so

you know a man is gently and necessarily carried: for no man out of Christ, but
his own ends draw him; now Christ crosseth a mans own ends, and to live on him
is to live on him that will confound them of their own ends, or else no life there:
Hence they live from themselves. As 'tis with a Crafts-man, or Artificer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the gain or credit they may get by being excellent in their Trade, may
by their own study and frequency of acts, grow dexterous, and very skilful at last,
and hence delight in it, so here, profession and practise of Religion may be a mans
trade which he may drive for his own ends and gain, and hence may desire to be
excellent, and by endeavour be excellent, and profit exceedingly in many excellent
endowments: hence he acts and works for himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because a man naturally knows not how to fetch it from Christ from Heaven,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. Hence 'tis with them as with a Child cast off by the Father, and put
to some hard Master, because they have no Father to maintain them, they most
live as they are, and do as well as they can. A man comes to pray, knows
not how to fetch strength from Christ, and he must pray, and hence prayes as well
as he can.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because it's so hard a thing to live upon another, it's easie and sweet to a
spiritual heart, but most difficult to any carnal heart, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. Christ tells them
they must eat his flesh, they say, <hi>who then can be saved,</hi> and many departed. Men
had rather make holes, and keep water in their own house, than have it far to

                     </gap>, and sees no
God nor Christ caring for or loving of him more than himself; Hence a man plots

either after Gods deserting them, or their forsaking God long, or after some
hardning sin; then 'tis clear the soul in this case is (though not in a way of
carelesseness) to depend upon the Lord Jesus, that he would quicken and help.
As <hi>David</hi> after his grosse fall, <hi>Lord create in me a clean heart.</hi> And <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 17.
<hi>Why hast thou hardned our hearts from thy fear? Oh return</hi> ! In this case the soul is
not to bring the soul to God, but God to the soul. As many a Christian cannot
prize not love the Lord not his waies, he is not to say, I will bring my soul and
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

again. As the Centurion of his Servant, <hi>Speak the word,</hi> &amp;c. Christ <hi>marveiled
at his Faith.</hi> Men think when they feel nothing, that they must and can work
it out; and hence comes one of these three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either the soul cannot love Christ when it sees such Lawes it cannot submit
to. And hence a Christian once said to me, If the least thing was left for me
to do of my self, I could not love Christ; but now that when brought low and
can do nothing, he brings all the help we need. This makes the Spouse go

2. If you can do any thing savingly good, the soul is bound now (by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Faith) to stir up it self to act, though not to trust to it alone, for somtimes
the soul hath the regenerate part uppermost, and the prevailing Spirit of God,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 21. 3. which comes to him, and gives it power to act before the soul come
to it. Now a man is bound to act, because 'tis from Christ now. Hence <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
was to <hi>stir up the gift,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 6. Hence complained of them <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 8.
<hi>None stir up himself to take hold on the Lord.</hi> A man must stir up himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
as well as other Graces, hence <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is taken with violence,</hi>
and though corruption is stronger than Grace, yet Grace assisted with the Spirit,
is stronger than it, which is never quite out of the soul, but 'tis in the soul, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi>
4. 4. <hi>Stronger is he that is in you.</hi> And 'tis said professedly, <hi>He purgeth himself, and
keepeth himself, the evil one toucheth him not,</hi> 1 John 5. 18. But mark, trust not
barely t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> this, but when you do this, withall remember, Lord I cannot hold out
in this unlesse thou dost help me: But know, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. <hi>The Lord is the rock of my
strength.</hi> And <hi>if you by the Spirit mortifie,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8. 13. Therefore ever hold up
sailes, but look for a wind. And if a man be not to do this, then when any sinful
temptation comes, if a man do not find the Spirit and strength ready at hand to
help, if he be not to stir up himself against it, he is to suffer himself to be carried
down by it. Hence a man may neglect all duties a long time, if he do not find the
Spirit assisting, if so be a man must not stir himself up, and so (will some say) a
man may. May? What shall I say to such sluggish soul, but sleep on? But know
it, the Lord will awaken thee, when you shall say, Oh that I had improved the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
I had! And if you do find Christ in such a condition, know it they be but the
last visits of Christ before he departs. You can do more than you do, and the Lord
will have you do it.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot do it for good ends without Christ.<note place="margin">Obj.</note>

not pay, because not for a good end, that excuse will not serve: So you owe the
Lord your lives, your spirits, your abilities; lay them out for the Lord, though
evil be in them, be humbled for that. Is this good requital to say you find your
hearts dead in prayer, and God must do all, and there leave it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You are to expect and look for power from the Lord Jesus in the use of
means, all known means: For Faith fetcheth all from Christ, hence we must go
thither where Christ is to be found, and he dwells in his House, in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances:
Therefore there you must depend upon him. As 'tis with a Merchant,
he wades not over the Sea for Pearls, but gets into his ship, and there he sits still,
so here, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like a Merchant man.</hi> Hence you
that know you can do nothing, being under a spirit of conviction, and hence do
nothing, under a spirit of sloth and neglect of means, by vertue of a spirit of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and say Christ must do all, I say you take not the right course for the
Lord to help you in. The Lord will never be a slave to thy sloth, but thou shalt
be like a shrub, never to see good when it comes, and shalt die in horrour with
this, Oh I might have done more! Hence you are worse than the other, that
think if a man fasts, prayes, watches against his distempers, mourns for want of
Christ and Grace, and followes God hard here, he is a Legal Christian: Why,
these are but his own works, and this is not living on Christ. I confesse
bare using them, or trusting to them is not, but he that lives not on Christ in use of
means (these and all other means) to find Christ, or enjoy more of Christ, shall
never have him. Neither do I know what turning Gods Grace into wantonnesse
is, if this be not; and under a conceit of liberty to be a servant of corruption. I
know not whether it be thus with any, but if I did, I would pity them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the soul cannot every moment live on Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> for every particular act,
have a distinct act of Faith, for this cannot be, yet every fit season that it can, it
ought to look up to the Lord for life and fresh strength. Pray as 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40159:21"/>
fit season. And as he brings forth fruit, so he goes for fruit in season, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 3.
And when the soul doth this, the Spirit of the Lord helps, when the act is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                  <p>Now the fit seasons are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. At beginning of any action, as prayer, hearing, reading: All the time a
man is in his journey, or in his work, he is carried on by the act of Faith at first
setting out: The reach of Faith is long, and continues all prayers, all the duty
throughout, the act of faith is short: Now the Lord looks to his people accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the first.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When our act beigns to die; as <hi>Moses lifted up his hands, and when they were
heavy, Aaron and Hur</hi> supported them again.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When a man feels himself strong, now apt to be self-confident; now Lord
for an humble heart! And thus you are to live on Christ, which if done, would
make a Christians life glorious, and give infinite content to the heart of Christ.
But here is the misery, either hearts are full, and need not, or slothful, and care
not for living so. That truly I do not wonder to hear and see so many withering
trees, as though blasted by wrath, because you fetch not all out of this stock;
and Christ is such a stranger, because you are so seldom with him to act and bring
forth fruit to him.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 COnsider of the means to act from Christ Jesus, and indeed herein lies the
skill and life of a Christian, and this is the complaint of many a Soul,
Christ is full, and he is not for himself, but for those that want, and I come to
him when I want it, and yet I find no help; and hence many are brought to
think either it's in vain to come to Christ, or else I have no Faith in Christ; I will
therefore premise these three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a false, double, treacherous, disloyal heart to Christ cannot expect to
receive any thing it comes for unto Christ. As 'tis with a Woman, that
though others do not, yet her Husband knows she is fallen in league with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, he will be strange to her, and will not do any thing for her. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <hi>ult.
He knew what was in man;</hi> as 'tis in grafts, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 7, 8. Let not a double-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
man think to receive any thing at the hands of the Lord, for that is the nature
of man under the power of any lust, it makes all serve it, even Christ himself,
which he will never do, <hi>I am weary of your new Moons,</hi> saith the Lord, and you
fast, and pray, and have no answer, for you fast for Debate: and therefore I take
a man considered as broken off from the power of his lusts, not one that feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
under the power of it, for such an one may be delivered from it, such a soul
as can say, much ado have I had to feel my sin, and to be willing to part with it,
but now I am; here is the Soul I speak of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Lord in the dispensation of Grace to his people, is wholly free to
give it when he will: for a man that works for his wages, must in justice have his
wages when his work is done: but he that begs for his living must be content to stay.
We live by Faith, and free gift, not by works and deserts, and hence must wait and
stay, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 7. Hence let not any man think sensibly to receive what he goes for
to the Lord Jesus presently, as many feel a want of Grace, and think the Lord
hath promised to help, and now how would it make for his honour to give, but
find it not, and hence grow sad or discouraged, and think it is in vain to seek? no,
no, Christs hour is not yet come, when you think it is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <hi>My hour is not yet come;</hi>
and hence many get nothing because they lie out of the way of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi>
to think, oh the Lord owes me nothing, and I deserve the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That no man is to look to receive all that which he comes to the Lord for,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40159:22"/>
but only so much as is fit for him: a man feels much straitnesse, and he would
have many enlargements; he finds much deadness, and he would have deep and
over-flowing affections, and he comes to the Lord for it, and the Lord gives some,
Doth he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ot? do you not find it? can you say you seek the Lord, and attend on
the Lord in vain with these Hypocrites, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 14. True, but yet methinks
more would be better. How do you know that? I think so, that it would be more
for his honour: you think so, then it seems you have one eye more than Christ, and
that he is very carelesse and foolish in raising his own honour: Oh abhor those
thoughts, he gives you such a coat as is fit for you, such a sail as fits your boat, such
shoes as fit your feet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 21. 5. <hi>Honour and Majesty hast thou fitted for him:</hi>
therefore do not look to receive any more than is fit for you, and know it, that is
best for you. The Physitian prescribes that which is fit, not that which is most
desired of the Patients; if they will not accept of this, he will not look after
them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Think not to get any thing from the Lord Jesus with ease, I mean to the
fleshly part: it hath been an old complaint, I go to Christ, and fish all night, and
can catch nothing: and why? here is the cause, they cannot get it easily, and
therefore they cannot get it at all, yea there 'tis. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. This is one of the
two main handles of Faith, <hi>he is a rewarder of all them that diligently seek him,</hi>
not negligently: and hence at their first conversion how doth Christs Fruits over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow,
and his <hi>Iordan</hi> rise above the banks: and what a deal doth a christian gain, yet
not afterward: so in time of great trouble, oh 'tis because you seek him diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Therefore in prescribing means, do not say this is hard, and so depart as those
did upon the very same ground, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 60.</p>

see, and taste, and sip of this love, but you feed not heartily, abundantly on it. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
didst thou think so little of this love; for though Christ will conveigh rich
Grace to his people, yet it shall be by love. Christians will come to Christ, and
when they receive and feel the good they come for, they will think of Christs love
and that he love; them, no first come unto the Lord Jesus, being once come, know
he will not cast thee away, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 37. then think of this love; stay here, first feed
here and you may act, and then the Lord will conveigh strength and power, and
inable you hereunto: For though when a man trusts to his love as <hi>Peter</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

lower, for they in Hell would come out, thou wouldst not. Never think to see

As children cannot tell how Parents love them, Will you do thus? 'Tis
with many Christians as 'tis with many Trees, the Tree is good, and the soil is
good, and rain, dews, sun, Husband-man good, yet it begins to dye, then now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is wanting, but only to be set a little deeper, that it may take more root
of the soyl. And so here, there is nothing wanting in many a Christian, but to
be set a little deeper, and to take more rooting in the Lords love. Faith roots it
self in Gods love, and now prospers by love. The eye is but little, yet can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
a mighty world quickly: mans mind is but little, yet can comprehend,
though not the infinitenesse, yet an infinite love. If there be this light of glory,
see by it all your poor sad hearts that conceive nothing but terror and holinesse in
God; if you see it not, know it here is your work now; for the first work is to
get Faith, then to get love, then to act from Faith by love. Now the Lord hath
wrought the first, and thou art busie a doing the third work, not remembring the
second.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Content not thy self with feeling a want of supply,<note place="margin">Means 2.</note> but labour to feel a need

else to ease and content him, he feels no need of supply, so as he cannot be

'tis in vain to seek, and truly so it is to seek so: for let thy condition be never so

work wonders, bring Heaven out of Hell, joy out of sorrow, and light out of the

prize it much, nor keep it long: my precious Grace must not be spilt. Many
know their wants and distempers, and know there is no help in themselves, and
see all fulnesse in Christ, and hence come to him, but find none, because they can be
content though the Lord deny: no nor never shall unlesse you feel the woe of
your wants, that your Spirit fails if the Lord send not in supply, <hi>Isai.</hi> 57. 16. <hi>I will
not contend, lest the Spirit fail.</hi> Hence there God promiseth to dwell, to send and
create peace and comfort: for what is the reason that Christians at first beginnings

past, and would be glad of the life of Christ, and Grace from Christ, but if not,
you have a little, your state is safe, and so can lie without putting your self to a

Lords sake then get it healed, and do as people in Christs time, those that were
well, and had not desperate Diseases, commonly came not to him, but when the
Disease was desperate, you know the Fame of Christ being spread abroad, then

Faith) is out of a mans self, the door of Faith which opens to all treasures is in a
mans self: This door is not any good in us, for then we should have somewhat to
boast of, nor sin in us, for that shuts out God from us; nor knowledg of want, for that
the Devils have, but sense of want, which when the Saints have, now the door is
opened for the Lord Jesus in all his fulnesse to come in. Now <hi>if you know these

inventions, not defiled with the company of evill men: pure Ordinances, pure
People, pure Churches, which is the cause of the scoffs and enmity of some, but of
the desire and joy of others. O if there, how happy I? and how blessed they?
Take heed you do not defile your selves again. Open whoredoom is too gross, too
shameful, to yeild to mans inventious, to open the door for all comers into the
Church: but take heed of secret whoredoms and departings from Christ, for
think of this speech when you see me dead, that of all Churches in the World, the
Lord Jesus carries a most jealous eye over these for whom he hath done such great
things; and I know it, he takes exceeding ill your secret wantonnesse and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of heart; the Lord hath kept you hitherto, look you maintain it, for you
may be soon defloured again, few Churches retain their purity long, aged, gray-haired
purity is seldom seen. I will tell you of the several Temptations (some at
least) that may prevail to the defilement of you.</p>
                  <p>First, Spiritual defilement is forsaking of the Husband, a total secret forsaking of
Christ; for here is the temptation to it, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods withdrawing himself in his
Ordinances from his Ordinances. For three sorts of Temptations make men fall
back.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Persecution, and there many fall (though some hold out) as in the stony
land.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By Peace, and here many fall like the thorny ground; like Saylors that in a
storm at Sea, every man is ready, and will be pulling his rope, but when a calm,
then go to their Cabbins, and there fall asleep, and here many fall in this place,
and others stand it out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the Lords withdrawing from them, as those, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. and here the
great ones fall. Many come to enjoy Ordinances, and persecution vext them
not, world it's base, it troubles them not, and they think to find much, but do not,
but the Lord withdraws, and they can get no good, hereupon their false hearts
discover themselves, they draw back from God, and lie still, whereas Saints cry
the more after him, and look the more into themselves, and find out the cause of
it, and then the Lord helps them, <hi>Isai.</hi> 63. 17. Oh take heed of this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Shall I forsake the Lord that hath done these great things for my Soul?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Shall I now do it after I am so near Heaven?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Shall I forsake him when he departs from me but for a time it may be, when
as he followed me when I departed long from him?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Is it not Hell to dye without him, and shall it not be Death to live without
him?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Doth he depart without a cause, he hath no cause to follow me, I have all
reason to follow him, the Lord grant you may do so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40159:24"/>
Secondly, Secret defilement is by neglect of private communion with him: this is
whorish in a Wife. Here is stronger Temptation to neglect private Prayer and
Meditation, partly by want of room, partly by multitudes of businesses, and work,
and cares hereabout, that being weary in the day, sleepy at night, busie in the
morning, Prayer, Meditation, daily examination are sent away as <hi>Paul</hi> from <hi>Faelix,</hi>
we will speak with these at some more convenient season; and hence straitnesse
of heart toward Christ, and no means do good. Oh Beloved, have you such a
Husband as Christ in Heaven that loves thy looks, thy company, thy sighs, thy
speeches, and will you neglect him thus? what no love? 2. Is he not broken
with this whorish heart? 3. Is that speech worth any thing with you, <hi>We shall
ever be with the Lord,</hi> doth it comfort you to think of being ever with him, and
now neglect him? where are your hearts?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Secret defilement is by bringing other lovers into the same bed, the same
heart with him: and here the Temptation to this is strong, for most men have
lost and sunk in their Estates, and it's hard to live lower than we did, and this is a
grief, and here 'tis possible to recover estate again, and here grief for losse hath a
vent by greedinesse and pursuit after more. In other places men had a very co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
estate, hence rejoyced in what they had, and did not greedily desire more;
but now want makes men hungry and greedy: and now when a man hath thought
and lookt about him, and seen what he may gain by his labours of many acres, by
his Goats and Cartel in so many year; now he casts himself into the world, and
also will not forsake Christ utterly, but bring both into the same heart, Christ shall
have some love, some desire, but the world as much, and so the heart is divided:
and hence some set high prizes on their corn, commodities, cattel, others look for
large wages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet Christ too. Hence men cry out of the world because it
hinders them from Christ, and yet bring it into, and hugg it in their hearts, because
they must have it in the bed with Christ. It was the speech of one, that he never
heard of any Saint in Scripture given to covetousness, some to one sin, some to
another, but none to that; I have read of <hi>Lot,</hi> but God fired him out of his estate at
last: and that is all I would say to this.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Secret defilement is by decaying in love to those whom Christ loves, and
those are his Saints, and Temptation is strong in this place to this: 1. Because
we have multitudes of them; Even Gold it self being so common as to pave our
streets, is despised. 2. Because there wants a common enemy to drive them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Take several men that never knew one another, yet in time of War
they will love abundantly, and then encourage one another, and can with joy lie
together: so 'tis here, hence arise your petty Duels and jars in Churches, surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
cens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the reason is this, there is little love to Saints, and for
want of this, men shall not know whether you be Christs Disciples or no. Be
thy Brethren Saints or not? bear they the Image of Christ or no? if they do not,
why dost not convince them, admonish them? and if they will not be better,
away with them: If they be, Oh bear, Oh love, Oh tender them, as thou lookest the
Lord Jesus should tender thee. And therefore let the Image of Christ appear, and
then see it, and then love, and then no more breaches will follow: if not, the
Lord can and will soon send Wolves to make Sheep run more together.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ting a new Generation of Harlots into Christs bosom, I mean, not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

brought forth to pull down the Temple of God. Oh therefore, 1. Be careful of
a pious education of them in Schools, in private, and take some course for that
end before others come over, this will draw them. 2. Oh make many Prayers
for them. 3. Set Faith awork in Gods promise; as he said, he would not abate the

                     </gap>l conceit of most of them is: that by Oyl is meant good
works, and by Lamps Faith; answerable to their own conceit, that not
Faith but good works chiefly save: Whereas if we consider the thing rather <hi>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
that by lighted Lamps are meant good works, or external shining profession,
according to that of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Let your light so shine before men, &amp;c.</hi> and
that by Oyl should be me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>nt Faith, because 'tis inward, and is the nourishment
of works and outward profession. And in this sense some of our Divines do take
this Scripture; and the <hi>Rhemists</hi> likewise, who understand by Lamps lighted, good
works; by Oyl a good intention: To which 'tis answered by <hi>Cartwright,</hi> (that
burning and shining light of our Times) that rather by Lamps lighted is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
<hi>watchful minds alway lifted up in attending for the coming of Christ,</hi>
according as 'tis <hi>ver.</hi> 13. And I doubt not but this is one thing aimed at, that
they <hi>took their Lamps, i. e.</hi> were watchful for Christs coming. But when I weigh
other circumstances, methinks there is somewhat else more plainly and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended, of which I scarce read any Divine, but he gives a hint of, <hi>viz.</hi> that
by lighted Lamps, and taking of them, is meant nothing else but the readinesse of
the Churches to meet and to have fellowship with the Lord Jesus. And my
Reasons are these:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the Lord Jesus to teach his people watchfulnesse, and to put them
to a narrow search of themselves, borrows a similitude from the custom of those
Times, wherein their Marriages were celebrated in the Night, and hence the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
(the only children of the Bride-chamber, and some think their number never
exceeded Ten) being to walk out in the Night, took their Lamps: and when
they had kindled their Lamps, (usually the last thing that is done) now they are
ready to go out, and this is that which Christ aims at.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 35. <hi>Let your loyns be girt, and lamps burning;</hi> it's evident
that thereby is meant nothing else but readinesse to meet the Lord when-ever he
comes; for when loyns are girt, then one is fit for travail, but seeing 'tis in the
Night, hence lamps must be burning too.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because 'tis said plainly, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. when their lamps were kindled again, <hi>they
that were ready went in;</hi> I know the Word is called a lamp for our feet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40159:25"/>
and so by lamps may be meant minds enlightened and kindled by the word. The
eminent profession and excellencies of the Church is like a lamp, <hi>Isai.</hi> 63. 1. and
more particularly may be here included and aimed at: but in this <hi>verse</hi> lamps are
spoken of in general, including light, Oyl, Vessels; and hence I give this general
Interpretation here, intending Particulars if need be afterward: So that now I
shall only raise this Point.</p>

readinesse to meet Christ, and to have immediate communion with
Christ.</p>
                  <p>A Woman may be Espoused to another, and yet she may be sometimes not
ready to meet him, her foul apparel is on. So here, therefore 'tis not enough to
be espoused unto Christ, but being espoused, now you ought to be in a continual
readinesse to claspe the Lord in your arms, and to lay your heads in his bosome in
Heaven: this is commanded by Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 44. This was the mighty
power of Gods Grace in <hi>Paul,</hi> when others were weeping to think of his Bonds,
<hi>Why do you break my heart, I am ready not only to be bound, but to dye for Christ,</hi> and
so doubtlesse to be with Christ; much more ready to meet Christ when ever he
shall come, ready to welcome Death, much more ready to welcome
Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. This also is the end of <hi>Iohns</hi> Ministry, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 17.
To make ready a people prepared for the Lord, to meet with Christ on earth;
now he is gone, our work is to prepare a people to meet the Lord in Heaven.
Hence this is put in as the difference between Vessels of wrath, and Vessels of
Glory: the one are fitted for destruction, the others are fitted, prepared,
or made ready for Glory, and the glory of a christian is chiefly to enjoy fellowship
immediatly with Jesus Christ. There is many a soul dear unto Christ, and espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to him, and hath his heart affected to think of the good time that is coming,
when we shall ever be with the Lord: but ask, are you ready <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, though it be through fires, waters, thorns, sorrows, death it self? who can

heart, and on the palms of his hands; <hi>but Israel saith, my God hath forsaken me,
my God hath forgotten me, Isai.</hi> 49. 14. Is it possible? is it credible? one that hath
been so ville, one that still hath such a heart, for him to set his heart on me? surely
no: hence the Soul is afraid to dye, and desires too much to live still: and the
more he thinks of that time, and blessednesse of following the Lamb where-ever
he goes; the more he sees and fears this may possibly never be my portion: there
may be some falseness in my heart towards him that I never yet saw, some secret

knot that was never yet unlosed: and hence not yet ready. Hence many a christian
saith, if I had a little more assurance, let him come when he will: Thus some think it
was with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who though he had walked before God with a <hi>perfect heart,</hi> yet
bitterly complained that he was cut off, <hi>Isai.</hi> 38. <hi>per totum.</hi> So therefore then the soul
is prepared &amp; ready for him, when he hath some comfortable assurance of the love
of Christ towards him, that it can say, if I live he loves me, though he kils me by
Death, yet I know that he loves me: nay, then he loves me mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

an end to my sins, and to my sorrows too? And therefore now saith as one ready to
ceive a Prince, now let him come to me, or send for me when he will: why so?
<hi>Who can separate me from the love of Christ? Rom.</hi> 8. 35. That look as 'tis with a
Souldier that is to go to war, where many bullets and arrows are like to fall about
him, and hit him while he hath no armour on; call him to the Captain, and he
will say he is not ready yet, but when he hath his armour on of proof, and such
armour that he knows let him receive never so many wounds, yet he shall escape
with his life, and triumph with his Captain afterward: Now give him but his
watch-word he is ready, though never so weak, yet I am sure I shall escape with
my life, nay not so much as hurt. So a christian wanting his assurance, wants his
armour; he is weak, and powers of darknesse will assault him, and he is slain by
them, now he is unready: but if assured, though weak and feeble, he is now at
Christs watch-word, I know I shall live, I may fall, but I shall rise again, this puts
courage and spirit into a christian, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 17, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. Others were

his people look death and dangers in the face, and triumph in sorrows, and not
faint-hearted, (which cannot be done without this) that the world may see that
there is more than men in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16, 17, 18. and 5. 1. who would be

slow of heart to believe all that is written,</hi> so many promises yet not assured, so
many experiences yet not established, and therefore not yet prepared and ready
for the coming of the Lord. A man that hath a fair estate and house befallen

you have love, is it not divided to other things, as Wife, Child, Friends, hopes of

suppose a man hath some inward love to Christ, yet neglects &amp; hath no heart to do
the work of Christ: he is as yet no more fit to meet Christ, than a Steward who

                     </gap> and winds blow
by, you have (if espoused to Christ) every man some work. Now how can you
stand before Christ if that be neglected. Oh thus 'tis with many christians;
hence those sad ala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

shall see Gods face in Heaven?</p>
                  <p>Now therefore then the soul is ready for the Lord, when 'tis daily at it, finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods work: hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 5. <hi>I have finished my work, now glorifie me:</hi> Christ
hath given us our lives, work, dayes-work, every hours work, for Christ hath ever
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ployment; now though a soul may livelong, and cannot finish its lives work,
yet if it finish its dayes work, or hours work, it may have comfort then if the
Lord should come. That look as 'tis with a Marriner when he hath his Fraight,
now let the wind come to drive him out of the Haven, he is ready to depart: so
here, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>If ye do these things, and abound, an open entrance
shall be ministred unto you, i. e.</hi> when a christian is ever acting for Christ, and
adding one Grace to another in his course, then he is so ready that an open en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
is made for him: Therefore look after this. 'Tis with most Professors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
as 'tis with a Woman that loves her Husband, and begins to dresse her
self, but so much businesse to do, that she doth it but by starts; hence call her
never so la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so 'tis here: Or as 'tis in a house where all things are in a lumber, and many
things wrapt up and put into holes, so long as all things be in a lumber, there is
no readinesse. So many a soul hath a heart fit to receive Christ, but all things are
in a lumber, in a confusion, out of place and order, and hence not yet ready to
entertain Christ, but when this work is done, then ready. Oh betimes do this
work, set things to rights in your souls.</p>

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:40159:26"/>
4. Then a man is unready, when having done his work he grows puft up with
it: for let all the three former be wrought in the soul, if now the soul be puft
up, thinks highly of it self, attributes any thing to it self: as he said in another
case, <hi>they are too many for the Lord;</hi> so he is too big for the Lord. And truly
this we shall find it's pretty easie to be mean in our own eyes, after we have been
indeed carelesse and vile before the Lord; but when the Lord hath mightily assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
enlarged, assured, enabled, comforted, quickened, now to be as nothing, this
is difficult. Hence <hi>Knox</hi> on his death-bed had this Temptation of Meriting.
When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was sick, he was cast down, but when well, and God gave him
great Treasures, his heart was lifted up; now he was unfit. Now therefore when
a christian is ready to give all to free Grace, and to adore that, now he is ready for
the Lord, <hi>Psalm</hi> 108. 1. <hi>My heart is prepared, I will sing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> give praise.</hi>
Gods last end is to bring the soul to the praise of the riches of his Grace, not only
to enjoy God as <hi>Adam.</hi> Now the great reason why Christ comes not to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
presently after they are espoused to him, 'tis to make them ready to attain
that end. Hence he leaves sins, temptations, sorrows, desertions, on purpose
that they may at conclusion look back, and see if ever saved, pardoned, it's Grace.
Now therefore when the soul is brought to do this, when he hath this rent in his
hand, now the Lord is ready to receive him, and it too, and he is prepared for
the Lord: he that hath not his Rent ready, himself is not as yet at all ready to
meet with, and see his Landlord. So that you think you boast not, Oh the Lord
sees you do, or have not hearts so enlarged towards Grace as you should, it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
you are yet unready then, but when empty, and poor, and cast down, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
an infinite matter of a small sin, and settest a high price on a little love much
more on infinite, now you are prepared: Hence <hi>David</hi> falls a praising when near to
death, and the Lord near to come to him.</p>

13. Hence a christian ought to be ever ready to receive him. Many of eminent
parts, when the Church had most need of them, then are cut down: Many at their
first conversion, before they or others almost could tell what to make of them, the
Lord hath cropt them in the bud. Men find their hearts unfit and unready, they
think hereupon that hereafter they shall get their hearts into better order and tune,
when these businesses are over, but yet will live at liberty a little while: why then
it's most likely is the Lords time of coming, even now when they think least of it,
<hi>Luke</hi> 12. 40.</p>

work; but she that is chosen to be next unto him, and only to behold and love
him, she is not to plead she hath so much businesse to do, and so many Friends to
speak with, that she cannot make her self ready: she is set apart for a better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

to the Lord again: Therefore now a christian after once espoused to Christ,
is better than all the world, being the Bride of the Lamb; and he hath a better
and greater good for to enjoy: therefore he should scorn and abhor to march
himself to, or to do any thing for any other creature; and therefore methinks
should sit as one upon a watch-tower, looking out, and telling the clock now day is

few living christians have any setled comfortable evidence of Gods eternal love
to them in his Son: and hence many sad events follow. How can any blesse the
Lord for that love which he knows not of? many times 'tis with a mans doubts
drooping from his mind, as 'tis with his continual dropping on his Lungs, there is
a daily consuming of what once was; that many a christian doubts away his life,
his heart, his strength, and when all is wasted, glad now to return to that where
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40159:28"/>
he should at first have begun. And hence in one word, he is made every day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
for Christ. Oh therefore quiet not your selves in that estate as I fear too
many do (at least for a time) it's one of the most dangerous estates that can be, to
be troubled with weak fears, and yet rest in uncertain hopes; but bring it to a
conclusion, Is the Lord Jesus mine or no? and if he be yours, and his love yours,
see it, that you may trample on the neck of death, and triumph over hell, and the
grave, and long to be with the Lord, and love the appearing of the Lord, and go
away with joy unspeakable and full of glory out of this world, as to your Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and if there be any hope of getting it, who would be without it? Some of
you it may be have a long time been carelesse in seeking for it, hence want it, some
of you have been traders with the Lord long, and yet doubt; some of you have not
clear evidence, but content your selves without being thankful to the Lord for
what he hath done for you, hence still doubt. Others have gray hairs on your
head, or at least are near your Graves, the battel is near, your armour is not on,
you are not yet ready, and so still doubt. I remember what Christ said of <hi>Maries</hi>
Box, <hi>she prepared that for his burial,</hi> it may be that these Truths may be prepared
for your approaching departure; and therefore light your Lamps at this fire, and
light of the Lords love to you, and see that indeed he loves thee.</p>
                  <p>But why do you perswade to this,<note place="margin">Object.</note> till the Spirit comes and speaks it? How can
I see it?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis true the Spirit only can do it,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> but yet the same Spirit that seals the Elect,
the same Spirit commands the Elect not to sit Idle, and dream of the Spirit, but
to use all diligence to make it sure; and you shall never have it (unlesse you lay

                  <p n="2">2. Though there is an immediate witnesse of the Spirit, of the love of Christ, yet
it doth most usually and firstly witnesse by means. And hence I shall give you
means looking only to the Spirit of Christ to set them on. Evangelical Precepts
have a power: For Gospel-ministration of the Spirit consists not only of stories
and promises, but commands, and the Elect feel them: Hence carnal men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

thy great Objection will be answered, and that deep valley will be filled. How
can the Lord love me that am thus vile before God, and fallen from God? why
if the Lord for his own sake hath loved thee, then as no good in thee moved him to
love thee, so no sin which he did know was and would be in thee can quench that
love; and if he hath manifested his love to be grounded on this, though but once,
that same Name when thou changest is not changed, but is still as dear to him,
and ever before him to move him to love thee still, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 2. The Apostle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers

people in the Church; 1. Servants. 2. Sons, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 35. Hence there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
love the Lord manifests to men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some he loves as servants, that as we hire some men to do our work, and give
them meat and wages, and then turn them out of doors, or let them go: so God
hath work to be done, for his Son and Saints, and for many reasons hires wicked
men to it, either by giving them reward in this life, or hopes of reward hereafter,
and when the work is done, and use made of their Gifts, Graces, Spirits, then
turns them out of doors.</p>

But 2. Some he loves as Sons, even the most foolish and weak in the world

Those very sins that God damns others for, he will make to humble thee, empty

against Christ, and do they not make thee loath thy self more? that thou thinkest
never any so beholding to Grace? do not thy falls into sin make thee more weary
of it, watchful against it, long to be rid of it? and so sin abounds, but Grace abounds:
Why should this be so? for his Names-sake, because he will love thee; hence 'tis
so great and unmatchable, that he will make thy poyson thy Food, thy Death thy
Life, thy Damnation Salvation, thy very greatest Enemies thy greater Friends.
And hence Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> said, he thanked God for his sins more than for his good
works. I have marvailed at Gods dealings with his people, they depart, and
stay long, and care not for returning again; in that time a mighty power teacheth,

will have his Name: now if thus, your assurance will be strong and constant, but
if you build thus, I have done this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have that, your assurance will not stand;<note place="margin">Means 2.</note>
therefore look and see if it be not thus with you.</p>
                  <p>Take heed you do not build your assurance from a mingled Covenant of Works
and Grace, for this is the frame of divers when they lye under the first Covenant
only of doing, they will not take this as any evidence, as they have no reason so to
do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31. Nor when a man lies under the Second Covenant of Believing
barely, and if it be a dead Faith, they have no evidence or reason so to do. Hence
they mingle the Covenants, and think thus. If I can believe in Christ, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
universal obedience to all the commands of God, I shall be safe; hence set
upon the observance of both, and finding they can never do them, especially the
latter, hence are ever troubled, and never have any setled peace. Hence those
<hi>Galatians Paul</hi> writes to, perverting and mingling the Covenants, were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 7. &amp; 5. 12. Not (beloved) but that whoever beleeves and performs
universal obedience Evangelically to the whole Law, he cannot but do well; and

                  <p>Do not fear the love of Christ is not toward you, because he hides his face, and
departs some times from you; Husbands remain so when they depart,<note place="margin">Means 3.</note> and leave
the house for many a day, and 'tis simple to say he is not my Husband now. So
here the Lord loves his people, yet departs, <hi>Isai.</hi> 54. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and truly 'tis
very hard when inward blows, and sad desertions, and outward miseries, and no
Christ found, though sought for. But how shall I then know and discern his
love? <hi>Answ.</hi> Many things might be said this way, only one thing observe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thy love remains still to him for himself; for it's rule that most commonly
a christians purest and dearest love appears in Christs absence from him. As 'tis
with Friends, while with us we love them, but when gone, we feel that love

<hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 13, 14. and if it be so, it's certain we love him because he loved
us, and we continue to love him, because he continues to love us; now look then
if thy love do not appear, 1. In mourning for his absence. 2. In longing for
his presence. 3. In blessing him for a little that is left of himself, as seeing such
want of him; and is not this for himself to have his company again, that though
God gives thee all other things, yet when thou comest to consider the Lord is gone,
this strikes near, as when Christ departed away, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 5, 6. But because love
may be benummed, and lye dead, therefore try it a time of parting, and put thy
heart thus to it; if he be none of thine, then take thy fill in thy sin, and forsake
him: no Beloved, here you shall see the heart will yeild and melt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 3, 4,
5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it will say, Lord let me never sin more against thee, though never sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by thee. And take it for a rule, do not think the Lord hath left off his love to
you when you depart from him, and he from you: but lying in your Departures,
Oh that is sad; but return again, it comforts the Lords heart, especially when
'tis for himself, not for peace and salvation, but though he never saves me, Oh yet I
will look after him.</p>

Look to the tender-heartednesse of the Lord Jesus,<note place="margin">Means 4.</note> for (Beloved) all the doubts
of Christians arise chiefly from this head, from a hard opinion of Christ, which
Satan suggests, as at first, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. that so they might take in his wares. Gods
people do not know the tender-heartednesse of the Lord Jesus; Satan presents him
only in wrath, when any threats are spoken, all these are mine saith the soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And now if any Woman lives with a man that is of a hoggish churlish disposition,
she will be ever doubting of his love. Men do not know it I say, and hence when

                  <p n="1">1. Never any came to him that he cast away, whatever their sorrows or sins
were, but healed them every one if they came to him with their miseries: for
in healing their miseries, he did but shew his readinesse to heal them of their sin;
hence <hi>Matthew</hi> applies that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>He bare our infirmities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When men came to him for by-ends, not for himself chiefly, he rebukes
them for it, and shews he was more ready to give himself, than bread to them, <hi>Iohn</hi>
6. 27.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Those that were lost, and sick, and miserable, and came not to him, he went
up and down to seek and save them, the <hi>lost Sheep, Luke</hi> 19. 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Those that would none of his love, he pittied and had compassion on their
misery and sin; as on them that were sheep without a shepheard; he mourned
for the hardnesse of their hearts: he wept over <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Now look upon Christ
the same still: thou comest to him in secret to take away all iniquity, to give
thee himself; tell me, dost think the Lord if here would reject thee ever. 2. But
I dare not receive him. <hi>Ans.</hi> Thou wilt take Bread from him daily, and he is
more willing to give himself. 3. Thou canst not come to him, nor find him, but
only sometimes, nor see him; well, but then he will seek thee out. 4. Oh but
I oft reject: yet he pitties thee still. O think of this compassion of Christ, and
make him as if present; 'tis a special means to establish the heart in Believing.</p>

for sometime it is the case of many a precious soul, that he hath clear evidence of
Gods love to him: and what is there against it? nothing but a fear, what if I
should be deceived when all is done? and hence the heart sinks exceedingly. As
some Women that have special love, if once they take a jealousie of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands

he; think of this, what 'tis you get by nursing up those fears, they hinder your

heart: nay though they drive you to Christ one way, if they drive you from Christ
another way by questioning his care; concluding against his Truth, never doubt
they are vile, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>Why did ye fear O ye of little Faith.</hi> So far therefore as
fear drives us to Christ, 'tis good, otherwise to be cut off.</p>

coming hast received healing Vertues of thy lusts and vile affections from the Lord
Jesus, fear not now, 'tis a sin to fear I shall not have help, as <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 33. the
Woman with the Bloody-issue, she was afraid she had presumed, hence came

him, never received any healing from him? that is hard. Surely 'tis so, that I

                  <p>If none of these prevail,<note place="margin">Means 6.</note> but the Lord follows thee with fears on fears, as wave

one to me, next to the Donation of Christ, no mercy like this, to deny assurance

and not confessed, not lamented, not opposed: Thus it was with <hi>David, Psalm</hi>
32. 1, 2, 3, 4. Hence when he confessed, the Lord forgave in his Conscience his
sin. Men will withdraw their love from their Wives if it make them wanton,
and deal sharply with them: so one that never restored, could never get peace;
some ever complaining, never setled, because they have their Truces with sin,
and would have peace with Christ, and it cannot be. And this is a rule I have
long held, in them that have clear light of the Gospel, long denial of assurance is
like fire to burn out some sin, and then the Lord will speak peace, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10. 16.

when any mercy, any misery, any Ordinance befalls thee, for all shall suck thy

Its usual for Christians at first conversion and espousing, the Lord loves them dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and tenders them, shews nothing but love to them, and then their love is
fresh; afterward come hard Frosts, and Winter-storms, and cold blasts of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
Christ departs from the Soul, withdraws himself, hides his face, and sends
sad afflictions; now the Soul apprehending anger, and nothing else, it grows dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
and so dies: when if it could stay and wait, it should see all from love,
and doing it the greatest good. Oh remember this: he doth afflict me, he doth
depart from me, he doth fear me with Hell, yet I'le love him never a whit the
lesse: Though the Lord buries all the Blessings he gives me, yet my love shall live,
and if it do fall it shall arise.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He loved thee when in thy low estate, <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. 23. even when as no eye

deepest depths of misery, and straightest captivity, after Friends had almost cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to counsel, Word and Spirit could do no good, after Conscience had warned
thee. Oh love him when he is in his lowest estate, when his enemies persecute
him, and his seeming Friends forsake him. Before you came to this Land, you
thought Christ and persecution, Christ and the meanest condition, nay Christ and
death would be sweet: the Lord it may be doth or will try your love; and here
you find Christ and losses in Estate, Christ and crosses in your Family, Christ and
many fears, and toils, and cares. Do you love him now as well as ever you did
for all this? Oh never was my heart worse! I doubt not but a discerning Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
may see how all the world is against Christ, nay many Traytors in his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
who love the bagg more than Christ. Many foolish Virgins who love their
sleep and sloth more than Christ; nay the hearts and Spirits of his own Friends
declining, that there is not that life of Christ, that presence, and savour, and
power of Christ in Hearts, in Prayers, in Lives, and no complaints of this: Now
is the fittest time of love, when no eye sees, when no heart loves him, or cares for
him, <hi>Psalm</hi> 119. 126, 127. <hi>Therefore I love thy commands,</hi> when he is shut

                  <p n="5">5. He doth love thee constantly every moment, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 1. 2. He hath thee

Sin, and Satan, and Hell, and wrath are every moment waiting to hurt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40159:32"/>

for thee, Isai.</hi> 27. 2, 3. Every moment he is blessing when thou art sinning.
Oh the unknown love of the Lord Jesus! Oh these fits of love are not fit for him.
Love him every moment, delight in him every moment. When a man hath a
fire every moment warming him, but still is cold, it's a sad sign that Death is
near: You can love him sometimes in a Sermon, but soon after cold again, or in
a Sacrament, and presently heart-dead again: or after answer to Prayers, and some
special deliverances, and then the heart is un-affected again, and so a little pang
of love must content Christ: if he ceaseth one moment to love thee, and to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
it to thee, then cease to love him; if he ceaseth not to love thee dearly, never
to leave thee, Oh then ever love him.</p>
                  <p>But we have such distractions and cares?</p>
                  <p>Men in love will follow their work,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and Women will do the Huswifry of the

thinks nothing he doth too much, nothing he gives too dear: hence when world
is slain, Satan cast out, when he is out sin must out; when some sins removed, the
rest must; when they are out, then death must; when Death, then Hell. And
when there is no life, no Grace, he works it; it decaies, he restores it; it cannot
act, he quickens it; it cannot, doth not grow, he waters it. He hath given thee
the earth, and the dayes of peace and patience; those are too little: he calls thee,
and when thou canst not come, draws thee, and gives thee pardon: that is too
little: he gives earth to thee, that is too little: (world is theirs) he gives Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to thee, that's too little (for they are made Co-heirs:) he gives promise to
thee, that is too little: he gives himself, and Spirit, and can he do more? Yes,
we cannot drink in all that goodnesse and love; hence he gives eternity to thee,
and he shall more and more enlighten thee: not only let thy Soul live to blesse
him, but thy poor body, and every dust of it to be raised up to Glory with him.
What the Lord promised to <hi>Abraham, In blessing I will blesse,</hi> that portion is thine.
Oh now love him without measure. <hi>Oh how I love thy law</hi>! how did <hi>David</hi> love
it? I cannot tell; but if he loved the word of Christ, then much more the person
of Christ, the presence of Christ, everlasting fellowship with Christ. Oh take
heed of giving Christ, and measuring out unto Christ his portion, his allowance,
that when the Lord comes to you for more love (as he doth daily) you give him
that answer which many do in their practice, you have let him have as much as
you can: so that you cannot spare any more from your selves, from a base world,
from Wife, and Child, and Creature, from a slothful course: you hope the
Lord will accept of that little he hath. I confesse a little water in a Spring is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Beloved, time was you lived without Christ, did nothing for him: now
you do; and what thou dost this year, did'st last year, and no more: what love
Christ had yesterday, the same he hath to day and no more: Will you thus stint
the Lord? Either do more, give more, or mourn you cannot: Oh one life, one
heart is too little for him. It hath put me to sad fears of many mens estates to
see this frame, a world of sin without measure every day: where is the Christian
that loves the Lord the more every day? how can any then say much is forgiven,
when they do not love much.</p>

I know you will fall from him in love, in delight, in care; but do not stay long
from him. Sometime the baits of the world will draw thee from him when thou

finds out the real sweetnesse of it; for make it as a rule, when a mans heart
cannot love Christ (unlesse it be when it is benummed) 'tis because he hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
else to joy his heart; now let the Creature yeild you no more joy, and Christ
hath your love: indeed you may and must joy in the real sweetnesse of it, and this
will encrease, and not diminish your love.</p>

thy life be death, thy Salvation from many dangers be Damnation, thy Friends
miserable comforters, thy joyes sorrows? what good would any thing do thee if
thou hadst these thoughts, all these I have, but wrath with them? What comfort
can a man take in his Feast, if news were then brought that after 'tis done, you
must go to the stake to be burnt? You that joy in your pastimes, one frown of
Christ would blast all. Oh see this, <hi>Psalm</hi> 63. <hi>Thy loving-kindnesse is better than

and Satan shews a Three-fold sweetness, before, in, and after the enjoying of it.</p>
                  <p>Now 1. Before, remember how they have drawn away and held thy heart

                  <p>II. Taste the allsufficiency of the love of Christ: a Woman that is not content with
her Husbands love, she will not love him as 'tis fit. So when other things make
love to us, and the Lords love is not enough, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>More than wine:</hi> hence
<hi>the upright love thee.</hi> Do but sit down and think what this is: If once he loves

                  <p>III. See the Lord Jesus now as he is, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>n truth this were enough to make any
prophane heart love him, much more a Saint espoused to him, but the Lord hath
hid himself from their eyes, shall he be so, is he so from yours? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>When
seeing not with bodily eyes, but with Faith, ye love him,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. <hi>We
shall see him as he is.</hi> VVhy suppose the day of doom was come, Christ in the
clouds, and all creatures before him, all Angels ministring to him, in all the Glory
of his Father; Oh then the love of Christ, Oh one smile, one word of Christ
would be precious. Lord that men should be in a Dream! See Christ a little
higher set in his Throne, a place more glorious, though lesse seen, in all the Glory
of his Father, all mighty Angels ministring to him, all the world put into his hand,
doing what he will, and all he will; why will you not love him now? Is the Gospel
a Fable? say so if it be, then love him not if you can. VVhen <hi>Simeon</hi> and the
VVise men saw him, though but in his abasement, they honoured him, much more
now if see him in glory. It's a question whether the beams of the Sun are fire:
Some demonstrate it thus, Take a Glasse and gather together the beams, it burns.
Therefore so if you would see so as to be affected, gather together the beams of
his glory and love; Thus you see the means to get fit love, and if it be lost, Oh
now get it again, lest the Lord strain for it, else you are not fit, and if it be not any
love that sufficeth, much lesse no love, as in many of you: but consider 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.
22. <hi>He that loves not Christ, let him be accursed:</hi> Oh that this might be won from
you, O little love goes out to Christ, who sees it not? Ordinances of Christ, men are
weary of them, the truths of Christ, despise them, the Servants of Christ, they
quarrel with them. Now recover your Love, the Lord help you so to do.</p>

in this life, they have some work to do for the Lord; some common, some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
work, and when that is done, now they are ready to return home again.
Hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 4, 5. <hi>I have finished the work,</hi> and now he stands at the door
and knocks, and is ready for entrance, <hi>Now glorifie me with thy self,</hi> and you

                  </p>
                  <p>I have answered this else-where at large,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> yet these two things I would say.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a mans chief work lies not in facile duties, for though Grace and
Christs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>pirit makes duties easie, his yoke easie; yet there is a contrary Spirit that
will make them hard and difficult at first.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Least I should leave you unsatisfied altogether, we shall find a christian life
is carried with a double motion: 1. In seeking of God in his Ordinances. 2. Or
in walking with God out of his Ordinances, these are joyned together, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 8,
9. <hi>Noah</hi> found Grace, hence sought it, though not in the eyes of the world: and
hence <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God. Hence we see Christ was sometime in the Mount
alone, Sometime abroad going up and down doing good. <hi>Moses</hi> in the Mount
and in the Camp too. Now look as before a man is justified, his chief work then
is to seek God in his Ordinances for a principle: so a soul now espoused to Christ
is to walk with Christ: now walking implies constant following of another, or a
continual work; so Christ hath work for you every moment. Hence in every
company, time, place, temptation, enquire thus, Am I not like to lose my time,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40159:34"/>
my heart, Christs honour? What work hath Christ for me to do? hold here, for
here lies your work. Look as an ambitious man asks, how serves this for my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Satan how he may dishonour Christ; so do you ask, how you may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. <hi>As you have given your selves instruments of iniquity,</hi> &amp;c.
And now because we live in times and places wherein men have so much work of
their own to do, that Christ is neglected, wherein very few walk with God. Hence
men taking mens examples for patterns and copies of their course, content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to do as others do: And this being a close act, mainly consisting in what is
unseen; and because men are apt to put off Christ with desires, and serve Satan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and because apt to resolve all Religion into some two or three duties or
Graces, and because mens hearts are catching at comforts and promises, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
tedious and burdensome; I shall presse this upon these Motives; only here
let me premise when I presse you to this, 'tis not to a Covenant of Works, as
though you could act your selves, but we look to Christs Blood and Spirit to set on
things; I speak to them under Grace, who have the Spirit without, and Faith
within to act and carry them here. But</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whose work will you do?<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>t. 1.</note> you cannot cease to do Christs work, but you
must do your own work, (I speak not for idlenesse) <hi>i. e.</hi> you must serve your lust;
now consider what good did thy self ever do thee, nay Satan never such an enemy
as thy own self: and will you fall down to such an Image? Shall thy lusts have
content more and rather than Christ?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider the Lord will take care and charge of thee, to do thy work, to
bring about thy ends for thee, do but thou do his. <hi>Martha</hi> was cumbred about
many things, hence forsook the better part: so men neglect, forget Christs work,
because of so many distractions of their own. What will become of my hundred
Talents? what will become of my Wife; Child? Now do you take care of the
Lords work, take that for your charge, and the Lord will take charge of you. The
best, readiest, and only way to have your own ends, is to seek the Lords, and forget
your own. As in <hi>Solomon,</hi> his great work and care was to rule a State well, and the
Lord gave all the rest. Set thy face to the Sun, and these shadows will follow you.
The Servant takes charge of his Masters work, and he need not trouble himself for
meat and drink, and <hi>Ã¨ contra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, there shall not any evill hurt thee, whereas else thy good things shall,
<hi>Isai.</hi> 27. 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All Creatures in Heaven and Earth shall serve that man that serves
his God, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 21, 23. whereas else they groan under thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Angels shall come out of Heaven to guard thee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Nay the Lord Jesus himself shall stand at the top of the ladder, that
when every thing else shall leave thee, he shall then bring the best wine at the last,
he will be a portion to thee, <hi>Psalm</hi> 16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider that the more difficult any duty is, the more sweetnesse shall you
receive if you break through it: Men plead difficulty, I plead gain. Hence he that
overcomes shall eat of the hidden Manna: Hence never any so comforted, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as Christ, because never any went through so hot a work for the Father as Christ,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. You plead the difficulty of a christian life, and taste not the sweetnesse of
that life: if you can do no more than what is easie, and pleaseth self, the Lord will
never let you taste the sweetnesse of pleasing him. Have you not sometimes found
your hearts dead to Prayer, yet you fell to it, and then would not but have took the
season for a world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider, let the duty be to Nature impossible, yet the Lord is at hand to
help, even when no strength, <hi>Isai.</hi> 40. 29. Nay <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 34. <hi>Out of weaknesse
were made strong.</hi> If you had no Christ, no Spirit, no Promises to assure you of
help, you might then cease acting, and say 'tis impossible I should ever overcome
such evils, attain to that measure: but when Promises to assure, and Christ and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40159:34"/>
Spirit at hand, now to plead impossibility, is to reproach the Lord; to think he
will set his people to make Brick, and give them no straw: nay to war against God
and to make the Lord war against you, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. You know how they cried out
of impossibilities, and now the Lords anger rose when they were ready to enter
<hi>Canaan:</hi> So when men are ready to enter upon possession of Christ, and Promises,
then impossibilities appear. Consider therefore what the Lord hath done for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Gideon, Samson,</hi> who went out in the name and Spirit of the Lord, and
were helped: If you were under the Law, you might plead this, but under Grace
'tis horrible to make this excuse.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Consider if the Lord do not help (as he will be free) yet he will accept thy
will, I know he will not accept the wishes of servants, yet he will accept the
will of Sons; neither will he accept the will of Sons in a work they might have
strength from him to do, and go not to him for it; but in that case he will; as
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>i. e.</hi> 'tis enough, I accept thee: and this is very sweet, that for his
own sake he should be pleased as well with the will as with the work, for this is that
which troubles, I would have help, the Lord gives none; why the Lord accepts
of it as if thou didst it, as in <hi>Davids</hi> building a Temple: For a Christians work is
done two wayes.</p>
                  <p>First, Sometimes by feeling, when we feel help.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Some times by Faith, by going to another for it: and this the Lord
accepts most mercifully, for this is his Victory over all sin, even his Faith. When
we see a duty hard, and do not go to the Lord for help, then we are overcome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly:
For out of the abundance of the heart the person acts for Christ.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Consider the Lord will honour thee (though the work doth not) <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.
26. <hi>Him will my Father honour,</hi> both in this life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29. and in that to come.
Now as 'tis in acting parts, 'tis no matter what Fellow-acters think, God is the
great Spectator, God will esteem of thee, and Conscience shall witnesse as much
when no eye sees, or when men see and judge amisse, yet the Lord approves,
and at the great Day before Men and Angels, and all the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Then
shall every man have praise of God:</hi> and hence <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Christs judgement is
made according to the works of his people: because then they shall not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with themselves and their sins, but with the wicked: and hence to set out
their glory, he reckons up all they have done. All men in all their acts seek to avoid
shame, and attain honour: now if you did know a way for all men in the world to
honour you, would you not attend it? what is their Dreams to Gods honour?
Hence not one act but is now chronicled, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. and afterward rewarded,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58. Oh then give content to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Consider the peace you shall have by this means, both while you live, and
when you dye: what's the cause of so many doleful clamours of Conscience, but
a loose carelesse heart, the Lord is neglected; that when one pleads Faith, it will
be replyed, the true Faith is the <hi>Faith of the Son of God.</hi> Now is the Faith of
God a carelesse Faith, a secure, worldly, impenitent, dead Faith? you may sit
down, and rise again, and say true, yet I'le believe, so you may, but it will be
with such a trembling spirit as you will find no peace: Neither do I know how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
can keep his peace otherwise, for there are children but Still-born; if born a
living Son, thou wilt live to God, necessarily I must do it: But by this means,
Oh there is unspeakable peace, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29, 30. Hence <hi>Paul, I have finished my
work, &amp;c. Iohn</hi> 14. 21. to 24. you live without God, and walk without God, and
Pray without God, but there is a day approaching that you shall appear before the
Lord Jesus, you shall wish then, Oh that I had lived so and so: Oh do that
now.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Consider the Lord will have it done, it must be done, hence <hi>Paul</hi> said,
<hi>Necessity lies upon me, and woe to me, &amp;c.</hi> the Lord should be forsworn if he
should not bring you to it, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 73, 74, 75. <hi>According to the Oath, &amp;c.</hi>

Beloved you think lasie desires will serve: no, it must be done: you say I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
it must be better with you. And hence look for a rod, and that the Lord
will bring you into great affliction till all is removed, and so purge you; and if one
affliction will not do it, then worse shall come, he loves you better than so. And
remember you have had warning this day: you came hither for the Lords work,
and now your own justles it out: look that God will take away the Kingdom from
you, or set oppressors over you, or send some stings among you: and then say,
Oh I may thank my walking unworthy of God and Gospel for this.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Consider else you shall make the Blood of Christ shed of no effect, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 14, 15. Now wicked men need not fear this, no Blood shed for them. Will
you do so? God forbid: The Jews have killed him, will you drag him up and
down the streets, trample on his Blood, and put him to open shame.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Consider your time is but short, and you have done but little work, and 'tis

and if thou dost not find seven times more peace therein than in all the world, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <p>I. <hi>Without Christ you can do nothing,</hi>

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 5. The Sun runs still because it's
light of it self; so when the Lord is in you, you will do so. Hence go not out
to any duty in your own strength, for then you will either not do it, or not hold
out in it: No man can hold out at his work that feeds not abundantly on his meat,
so here; and here note but these two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do not only in Ordinances do thus, but out of Ordinances then, as in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
times of tryal (for the Lord will not give you in an Ordinance as much Grace
as shall serve you out of it) lift up your hearts to Christ, and say as Christ, <hi>Father
the hour is come, now glorifie thy Name, Iohn</hi> 12. 28. So Lord, here is work to do,
but a dead heart is upon me, Lord glorifie thy Name. I have seldom seen but the
Lord either helped then, or at some other time when thou didst come, and then
the Lord puts thee in remembrance that 'tis out of respect to that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thus coming and feeding on the Lord Jesus, believe that he will help, and
that shall be so; some have never got strength against sin till then, but this hath
conquered difficulties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37, 38. <hi>In all these things we overcome, for I am
perswaded, &amp;c.</hi> So you coming helplesse to a Christ, all his strength is yours by
covenant. Be perswaded he cannot go from his word: but yet we must use o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means sanctified by Christ, for Christ worketh by meanes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                  <p>II. Find out where the cause of all your negligence and sloth lies in not doing
the Lords work, nay of your doing Satans work. It may be you will say you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
I know there is that in Saints in part, but this is not the main, therefore I
will tell you thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before conversion the main wound of men is their Will, <hi>Video meliora
probo<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> dexteriora sequor:</hi> Hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44. <hi>His lusts ye will do.</hi> Hence Mat. 23. 37.
<hi>You would not:</hi> they say hence we have a Will, I say no. And hence we answer
that great Objection for Possibilities to keep all Laws by universal Grace, which tis
unjust to punish for not doing that a man cannot do. We answer, There is a
double impotency, <hi>Ex infirmitate,</hi> or <hi>Ex malignitate,</hi> when men will not,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 11, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:40159:35"/>
2. Hence it follows after conversion, though the Will is changed, so that a
man would but cannot do many things, <hi>Ex infirmitate,</hi> yet the great cause why he
cannot do more is from the remnant of malignity not yet removed. A man will
sleep, he loves it, and secretly loaths the wayes of the Lord: Hence the Church,
<hi>Isai.</hi> 63. 17. complains of this. A man shall find his heart wills the end exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
but when he comes to will the means, there his heart is weary of them, and
loath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> them; a man will be carelesse, and this being not seen, is not fought
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. Sin is vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ified, and hence the enemy to all good remains still. It's an
old Rule, <hi>Tantum possumus, quantum volumus.</hi> Get Christ to help here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Make this your last end, to live unto Christ, and to do his work: Hence
<hi>Paul</hi> did not account his life dear; this is your last end, for the end of being born
by Faith, nay of being redeemed by Blood, 'tis to live unto Christ, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11.
When you cry for Faith, and Peace, and Assurance, that is not your end, for he
that doth so is a very Hypocrite, and hath a false heart, but 'tis to live to Christ:
Hence <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 12, 13. sought to be found in him, but further to
know him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Father is glorified in our bringing forth much Fruit. Hence
make it your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ast end, and then your happinesse will lie in acting thus, and that that
is a mans happinesse he is carried to with most infinite delight. For presse people to
do Christs work, their hearts are dead, tell them the Lord Jesus shall have a Name
by what they do for him, yet dead, because though they see it good, yet they
place not their happinesse there, because that is not their last end. But come to
this, now it will do; a man cannot bear a crosse, yet let him consider, the Lord
shall gain though I do not; so for Faith, so for any other duty. Men think it
good, but not their greatest good. Hence see Christ better than thy self, and his
honour better than thy glory for ever. Hence the Lord denies us help, because we
ask it for our Lusts, not for himself, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Keep those glorious apprehensions of the Lord and his wayes, which you
have sometimes in an Ordinance: You are sometimes near the Lord, and you then
see a beauty in Christ, in his wayes, and then thinkest shall I ever wrong him
more? then you come out and lose your light, and so you ever lose your strength
and life. Hence <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11. 'tis as with a man that eats, but he looseth and
spends his spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>its, he can do no more work, but faints away: see 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Steven</hi>
can be content to have stones about his ears, when he can say, <hi>I see Iesus.</hi> And
hence when those glorious apprehensions come into your minds, stamp them there,
for set up other Images of other things in your minds, and your hearts will bow
down every moment to them. Doth not Christs Spirit do all? yes, but by this
<hi>medium,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>As by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>

never should Grace have been seen, if sin and misery had not come in. Now if
this be our last end in Glory, then the heart is ready to have immediate fellowship
with Christ there, when 'tis ready to act for its last end. Hence it's frequent in
the <hi>Psalms,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> was in any strait, wanted any mercy, nay the presence
of the Lord here, this is the last end he pursues, the last word he speaks before the
Lord, <hi>My soul shall blesse thee,</hi> as <hi>Psalm</hi> 63. 3, 4. and hence when all his enemies

                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14. It's writ of Christ, he was <hi>full of Grace and Truth;</hi> Do
you ever think to meet with him, that get not your hearts full of the sense of
it?</p>
                  <p>Before I come therefore to presse this, I shall premise these two things.</p>
                  <p>First; That the Lord in all his dealings with his people, seeks lastly to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the glory of his Grace: he regards nothing men do, if at last they deny him
this; He respects not what sins and evils men have, if at last he gets this, for this
is his last end: hence all he doth to his people, for his people, by his people, 'tis
for this. And hence</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He leaves them a long time in their Graves and Sins, that they live like other
men, which is strange that he that hath loved them so long, should leave them so
long to be as bad as any, yet this he doth, because it makes for the praise of his
Grace, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 4, 7, 8. <hi>Dead in sin, that in ages to come,</hi> &amp;c. And this doth so
confound Gods people, that they wish not only Heaven, but Earth, and Ages to
come may record this love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence out of men fallen, he picks out usually the poorest and vilest, the
younger Brother lesse loved out of a Family, leaves elder, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. and <hi>the
foolish, and weak things, and things that are not, that no flesh might glory, but in the
Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26, 31. and this is strange that the Lord should chuse thus, but
this he doth to blur the glory of all the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence the Lord saves by Faith, and justifies by Faith, and seals by Faith,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. and sanctifies by Faith, and glorifies by Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. So that all
a Christians life is a Beggars life, and 'tis strange the Lord should chuse the basest,
poorest Grace to save by; and the end is the glory of his Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. 'Tis
of Faith that it might be of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord leaves many wants in his people, under which they sit sighing,
and that sometime very long, refuseth to hear their Prayers, that they may repair to
the Throne of Grace, and so in conclusion blesse Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hence the Lord takes away sometimes those feelings, those enlargements
they had, and baits them with most vexing sins, and pricking distempers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 7, 9. and it is to advance Grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Hence the Lord is sometimes angry with his people, and hides his face
from them, that if ever he returns in love, his Grace may be the sweeter, and last
the longer, <hi>Isai.</hi> 54. 7. Nay hence sometimes strips them so of all that they have
had, or can do, that if you ask what have you now to say for your selves? nothing
but Grace, their mouths are stopt. Hence <hi>Psalm</hi> 6. <hi>Lord save me for thy mercies
sake, Psalm</hi> 51. 11. <hi>According to the multitude of thy mercies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Hence the Lord speaks peace to his people, that they may say, I was so vile,
and yet loved; Oh Grace! Oh love! <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 63. When they see nothing but
shame, and shame covers them, and afraid to appear before God, it is for this
end. I'le name no more. Do you not observe it? Sometime you shall find the
Lord so strangely carrying matters, as if he did not love nor care for his people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the hair and grain of their desires, and when all comes to winding up, 'tis
to advance Grace. All a mans good dayes, and bad dayes, all Gods frowns and
smiles, all the Lords Food and Physick, all God cares for, works, plots for, 'tis to do
his people no more hurt than this, to advance his Grace in them, and by them. All
his hewings and hammerings of you, nay his knocking you a pieces, and new melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and new casting of you, 'tis that you may be Vessels of his glorious Grace, that
you may be able to live in the air of Gods Grace, to suck in, and breath out Grace,
and let all the power of Hell seek to blur it, yet Grace shall conquer. VVho
would not be under Grace? Oh poor creature, Satan is tempting, sin vexing, yet
Grace must reign.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This I say, that Gods own people do by strange wayes and courses
deny the Lord, and deprive the Lord of the Glory of his rich Grace, for that being
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40159:36"/>
the Diamond in Gods Crown, and the beloved Attribute which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to advance; all the policy of Hell is against this; this is the reason why
Satans enmity is so bitter against Faith, as in <hi>Peter;</hi> and observe, however there
be many Temptations, his end is to crush Faith: the reason is, as 'tis with an
enemy, if the Besieged hath water brought to the City by Pipes, he cuts off them
and stops them, so Faith fetching all from Grace, and returning all to Grace, hence
Faith is opposed most; and hence the unregenerate part will take Satans part, and
doth strangely rob the Lord of the glory of this, though I confesse the Lord will
have it for all that they seek to scatter it, <hi>Isai.</hi> 43. 21, 22. It's strange to see how
few plot for the praise of Grace; hence how many are straitned, nay do cross Christ
in this. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the Lord give them not what Grace they would, then they sleight what
little he bestows; and if he gives them much, then they solace themselves in it,
and grow puft up and proud. It's the temper of Gods own people to set up such a
measure of Gods Grace and Spirit which they would have, and therein they do
well: <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. 11. lookt to the Resurrection of the dead; but if the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
them that, (as he will make his people live from hand to mouth) they sleight
what they have, either as if all were but hypocrisie, or because it is but little, not so
much as they would have, and herein they do ill, for here the Lord loseth the
glory of some Grace, for it's Grace that you have the least desires after it; nay that
you do but know what it is, and see the want of it, and yet ever complaining, and
never rejoycing, for every degree of Grace in Saints, is vertually saving, though
formally common. But suppose the Lord fills the bottle full, and gives as much
peace, affections, enlargements of heart, as it hath almost required, (for there are
Spring-tides, and over-flowing times of Gods Spirit, now they are ready to swell,
and be puft up above measure, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Lest I should be exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
measure,</hi> for there is self-love in Saints. Hence they desire an excellency in
themselves: hence when they find none of their own, they are apt to deck and
set out themselves with what the Lord hath done, and so to joy in this, and now to
think themselves better than others of Gods Saints, whereas they should be more
vile, and advance Grace the more, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>To me the least of Saints.</hi> And hence
the Lord after greatest deliverances and mercies sends great sorrows, as to them in
the Wildernesse. Hence the Lord takes away affections, and they dye, that
Grace might be the more advanced.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the sins of their hearts are common, and cannot be removed, and so seem
little, then they passe them by, and never take notice of them, God will pardon
them, and hence the Lord hath sad times of reckoning (with a rod in his hand)
with his own people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 9. That those loose times are heavy times, this is
for my neglect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but hereby Grace loseth Glory; for how can they see how
deeply they are indebted to the Lord, if they see not their Debt? on the other
side, if their sins be very violent, and their distempers so strong, that they think
none like me, now their hearts sink, and dye away, and grow discouraged, and all
the use they make is this, I think it will never be better with me, and can there
be life for me so dead, deliverance, redemption for me in such bondage, love for
one that cannot but loath my self, and if others did know me, they would do so
too. Can the Lord love me now? Yes Beloved, that he can and will, <hi>Isai.</hi> 63. 16.
<hi>Though Abraham know us not, yet, &amp;c.</hi> But here is your sin, when you should
make this use of all, to feel the more need of Grace to pitty, and say, the more
precious shall Grace be to me for ever: your hearts now sink. The Lord brings
his people into very low condition to humble them, and to shew them more of
his Grace, <hi>Psalm</hi> 78. 19. <hi>Can God prepare a Table?</hi> they spake therein against
God: so 'tis here; for herein the Lords Grace is seen, to love them when Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Grace that hath been shewen, for times past they forget it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. And
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40159:37"/>
what is this but destroying Gods Grace? for why is Grace so precious at first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
that Heaven and Earth are too little to hold praises enough for it? And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
the Lord hath little love; Oh you forget what once you were, and what the
Lord hath done, hence 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14. I was so and so, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now have received
abundant Grace. You have had many meetings with God, many answers from
God, many consolations and times of refreshing and reviving, and these forgotten
and buried, the life of them after a year or two expired. And what is this but
eclipsing Gods Grace? On the other side, as for Grace for time to come, they
fear it, especially when worms and no men in their own eyes. Hence saith God,
<hi>Fear not worm Iacob, Isai.</hi> 41. 14. There is a certain Divining Spirit (as one once
told me) that untill that was pulled out, no honour can the Lord get. Before
you come to Word or Prayer, thou wilt fear thou shalt never get any good; and
when the Lord gives any, thou wilt fear thou shalt never hold out; and what
Promise soever is made, thou wilt fear thou shalt never find it. And what doth
this but eclipse Grace? we should go with boldness to the Throne of Grace; nay
hence let the Lord send never so much Mercy for the Present, a Fear will cut off
all, that all this will rise up in Judgement against me.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When they are most fit to honour Gods Grace by Faith, now they will not
believe, not then above any other time: for then a man is most fit to honour
Grace, when he feels most need of it: and when hath he most need, but when he
feels most emptinesse? why now above any other time a man will not come in,
but will have somewhat in himself first, and then he will, when his heart is so and
so sweetly setled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence <hi>Luke</hi> 14. Poor, and blind, and lame, and halt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to come in: one would think there needed not that; but now when fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
now they will not: for let any man observe what would endear his heart so
much to Grace as this: to think if it be the Lords mind to save a poor dead dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
creature, then happy I? This is wonderful, this hath quickened dead love,
and dead Faith, and a dead heart. And on the other side, if the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
if it comes not at their own time, then they distrust it; Grace! alas I feel my
self never a whit better: For there be two things in Faith,</p>
                  <p>First, A coming to Christ, which is our work, <hi>i. e.</hi> Gods work in us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Receiving what I come for from Christ, which is the Lords work;
Now the first gives evidence he shall have it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 35, 37. Hence the Lord
will have them rejoyce in what Christ hath, as <hi>my Grace is sufficient;</hi> but if it comes
not presently, then they cast off Faith, and so cast away Grace, I feel no good:
hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 48. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know there is a seeming coming to Christ, to have the
Grace of Christ and sin too, and this you may well cast off: and a coming for his
Grace and Spirit only, and you despise Grace, and distrust the Lord if you cast off
this, or you seek to put the Lord out of his working by a covenant of Grace, (where
he takes his times as he pleases) and give a flat lie to all promises of Grace, and
refuse to be contented with Christs Grace, that thou mightest have the more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to thy self, and the Lord the lesse.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Either they think not of the exceeding greatnesse of the Lords love and free
Grace to them, and hence <hi>Paul</hi> bowes to Heaven for this, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16, 17. And
hence it comes to passe, that look as 'tis with sweet things, swallow them down
in the lump, you never taste the sweetnesse to purpose, nor never commend them;
so 'tis when men swallow down Gods love, and chew not upon it, whereas if they
did but think of it, Oh how sweet would it be! <hi>Psalm</hi> 63. 5, 6. Lord, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dayes and weeks are spent thus? It's apparent you have the profession of a
Christian life; but do you taste the sweetness of a Christian course? No: why if
you did think, you would; But you are weary at Night, sleepy in the morning, busie
in the day, dead on the Sabbath: hence think not, hence give not God the glory
of Grace: or if they do think of it, and the greatness of it, then they cannot think
so great things should be given unto them, or done for them: that God should love

me as his Son, make me an Heir of all he hath with him, redeem me that have
despised his Blood: 'tis too good News to be true. Hence the Disciples belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not for joy, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 41. Hence when delivered out of <hi>Babel,</hi> we were in a
Dream; this robs the Lord of Grace, for the greater the love is, and the more you
take, the more love shall the Lord have, it cannot be otherwise, if you come to say
this is mine.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Either they will pore only on their sins, and distempers, and miseries, and
never look unto Christ the brazen Serpent, and search for a righteousness of their
own, and cannot find it, and hence pore still. As when men have wounds, they
only think on them, that when awakened out of sleep, they complain in their beds
like the <hi>Israelites, Exod.</hi> 6. 9. that would not hear <hi>Moses</hi> because of anguish. As
the impotent man answered Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Wilt' be made whole?</hi> he turns
his eyes upon his misery, <hi>I have none else to help me at the time;</hi> here is but this
means, and when I come my self, others step in before me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now so do
men, and never look beyond means, the Lord can, the Lord will, and so eye not
him: or on the other side, if they get healing of their wounds, then they eye Christ
only, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6. They were exalted in Heavenly places, yet remember, as <hi>vers.</hi> 11,
12. For let any Christian see that he is poor and miserable, but he is not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with it, nor afflicted with it, and so eye Christ, and trust to Christ, and
ease himself here, &amp; say we must look only to Christ, either you will hear of his fall
(yea and himself shall find a decay) or he will grow very proud, unfit to give all to
Christ. Is there Grace here?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Either if the Lord gives him any thing, himself and mercy, he will now add
something of his own to Christ, and pull the vail of the Law over the face of the
glory of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. or else do nothing at all for him, unless it be when the
good fit takes him, under a pretence Christ must do all; as here the five wise Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
that fell asleep: and thus you see how Grace is opposed by the children of
Grace. Now therefore my Exhortation is, to take heed of this, and be ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to attribute all to the Lord, as they cryed when the Second Temple was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from beginning to the end, <hi>Zec.</hi> 4. 6, 7. so that thou wast spared so long,
that called by means that the Lord should by Faith accept, that he should speak
peace, this is Grace, that though vile, yet he will save me: 'tis Grace, that though
I can do nothing, yet he will help me, and afterwards Crown me: Oh this is
wonderful Grace! And</p>
                  <p>First, Do not only give the Lord the glory of Grace to redeem you from mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for this you may do, and be full ready to give it, yet perish at last, as the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
that sang Gods praises did, but that he will save thee from greater, <hi>i. e.</hi> from
sin. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Not only when you feel nothing, but when you feel most, Oh to
honour Grace! And</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Not to do it coldly, but with a heart enflamed with sense of it, that I
live, I have, I do, I am what I am: Oh 'tis Grace. So that now if the Lord shall
come and ask you, what will you say if I'le deliver you from all misery, subdue all
sins, passe by all wrong, hear all Prayers, do all good to thee, do much good by
thee, love thee every moment, give a Kingdom when thy work is done to thee, and
my self better than all? say, Lord I can never recompence this, I shall be I hope
the more vile in my own eyes for ever, and give all to Grace. Oh sing that Song,
or get that Song by heart now, for <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 10. there is a Song, <hi>Salvation to the
Lamb,</hi> which none else could sing. This is our work, and a great work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                  <p>How shall I do this?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Get a new light from the Lord to shew you clearly the infinite, endless,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
evil of the least sin; <hi>Paul</hi> was a proud Pharisee until he saw sin, and <hi>Ier.</hi>
3. 24, 25. for if sin be seen, one smile, one day, nay a moments breathing-time in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40159:38"/>
this world will be matter of amazement to thee after all thou hast, and hast done:
much more when thou seest so many sins, and that in every thing: Intreat the
Lord to do this. We walk up and down the world, and say we sin and grieve the
Lord; but Oh 'tis not known, happy art thou if the Lord hath discovered it;
then thou wilt say, why doth the Lord do any thing for me? could not he pick
out stones, nay Toads that never sinned against him, rather than me to enjoy him,
especially is sin vile in thee, so near God, and so near Heaven too. Angels were
hurled down for one sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Set a high price upon a little Grace; a man will be exceeding humbly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the giving a little of that which he highly esteems, much more for giving much
of what we value. The poor Woman of <hi>Canaan, Mat.</hi> 15. was glad of crumbs.
How thankful do you think she was for loaves? that made her ready to receive all;
<hi>Be it as thou wilt;</hi> so it shall be with you, for if you prize a little, Oh when all
shall be given, this will swallow you up into Grace. And it's certain, there is
never a mercy but 'tis great, if you consider him that gives it, who receives it, him
that bought it. But the most of Gods Grace in us appears to be but small; hence
we prize it not, and hence never ready to give all to the Lord again.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Learn to put a difference between your double being: for every Christian
hath a double being: 1. In himself. 2. He hath a subsistence in Christ. Now
look upon your selves as in your selves, you will ever complain there, ever dead,
and never have your hearts ready to bless the Lord. If you only look on your selves
in Christ, you will be proud, and never give the Lord honour. I say therefore, put
a difference between these two, for men appropriating to themselves what is
Christs, they rob Christ of his glory. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> so humble, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10, 11.
For if you look upon your self, I am dead, guilty, damned, weak, here will be
shame: if any life, or Grace, this is Christs. As a man on a Mount is the same
man, no taller, only the Mountain makes him so: so think of thy self. Or as a
mud wall, the sun shines on it, but in it self it is a mud-wall still; all the warmth
and lustre is from the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Learn to love Grace; what we love we will seek the good of more than our
own, and commend it.</p>
                  <p>First, It's the only first mover of all our good: thou shouldst never have had a
dram of peace or mercy. Why hast it? the Lord will have it so, Grace pleads it
may be so; this is the only Petitioner at Court against the cry of sin, against the
cry of Justice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis the only support under the heaviest evills; sometime God
frowns, and Hell smokes, and Satan tempts, and sin rageth, and it may be no
feeling of Grace, no reason to shew there shall ever be any; now what have you
done, what will you do? Fly for refuge to the Promise of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. It
is such a Friend as holds up the head when sinking, when dying holds that, when
all fails, and against which the gates of Hell cannot prevail. To him that laies
hold on Grace, this is wonderful; <hi>Paul</hi> was a man taken with Grace: hence he eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where commends it, <hi>I was received to mercy, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. See how the Lord loves that thou shouldest honour it, for the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
Grace hath is by Faith; hence they are put for one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. and the
great cause why Faith stirs not, is because he sees not how the Lord shall have by
it the praise of his rich Grace, nor how the Lord loves it should do so. For if a
man did see how by Faith he shall honour Grace, and how the Lord is pleased
with it, it would draw the heart to be assured, and to bless Grace; for when
the Soul feels it self at worst, why doth it not believe? I shall presume: True, if
you have this only in your eye to save your self; but if the Spirit presents the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Grace, and this draws your will that you will glorifie Grace, then you will
say 'tis no presumption so to do, and so to believe, for the Lord loves his Grace,
and all means for the glory of Grace. Hence he will use Faith for that end, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40159:38"/>
Grace. Oh therefore see how the Lord loves to have thee honour it. This
gives Gods heart full rest; this is that which he desires most, because 'tis his end:
This is that which all the business of the world is for: Oh see how he loves it!
and then you will love to act thus. Now set upon this last work: look over all
your life, and like Bees gather honey from every flower, and then come loaden
home; so do you, and look over all the Lords love, turn over all the leaves of it:
The Lord hath now called me; why? it's because Christ hath redeemed; and
why that? because the Father hath chosen; and why me? to glorifie his Grace:
And why me rather than another? No reason, but he would. This I doubt not
will be the work of Heaven, I am glorified because called, because redeemed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
elected, for none other reason why, and here astonished. You have not
christian hearts in you, that will now have no care to do this work there before
you are turned off the stage: you poor doubting Spirits, that see so much vileness,
and cannot be perswaded; be not discouraged. Wait for the Lord, and say, if
he shall save, I shall for ever love him the more. Now hold here, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The conclusion of this Parable is the Explication of
this, <hi>viz.</hi> the Son of Man, the Lord Jesus Christ, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the several conditions, or dispositions the Church is
in, appears to his Church under several relations and titles. The Church is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by her enemies, he appears now to her as her Prince and King: the Church
wants wisdom, light, and life, he appears now unto her as an head. The Church
hath been seeking of his love, and yielding her self to the obedience of him as her
Lord: at last he appears more fully to her as an Husband, or as a Bride-groom
with whom she is to have her nearest and everlasting fellowship and communion,
and so here. And when Christ comes to shew most special love, and to have most
special fellowship with his people, he thus stiles himself, <hi>Isal.</hi> 54. 5, 6. So <hi>Iohn</hi>
3. 29. And when the Church hath tasted that love, she calls him so.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>What it is to meet the Bride-groom?</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There are but three wayes of going forth to meet with Christ in
Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When Soul and Body at the last Day meet the Lord in the clouds of the

                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:40159:39"/>
2. When the Soul only goeth out of the Body by the ministry of Angels to
meet the Lord in Heaven, as <hi>Paul</hi> that knew not whether in or out of the body,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>We know it here shall go out of the body:</hi> as Christ is said when he
went to Heaven, <hi>I go to my Father, and your Father;</hi> so it goes forth then to
Christ, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. and neither of these can be meant here, for</p>
                  <p>First, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

                     </gap> of the Jewish Church long before Christs coming, at
least among many of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because the shutting out, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. is by and at Death: hence let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in is so too. Now this was before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the Soul goes out or it self by Faith: hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 35. 'tis called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Christ; and this not any Physical natural departing of the Soul out of the
body, but Ethical, supernatural, by the operations of the Soul out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> self. And
look as the whole Soul by unbelief departs from God in Christ, so the whole Soul
by Faith comes again unto God by Christ. The mind sees, affections make af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, will fastens on him, and there depends. This is the first work of Faith,
or the first Faith, the coming (as in all motions there are two extreams) of
the Soul from a nothingness, emptiness in it self, to an allness and fulness in
Christ: And as 'tis in other motions, if there was a <hi>vacuum,</hi> there would be
<hi>motus in instanti;</hi> so if there was an emptiness seen in the world, and all the works
of it, and in all fears that all mountains were cast down, Faith then would sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
come by the Spirit to the Lord Jesus, and this coming to Christ is not
meant here: For</p>
                  <p>First, These Virgins were espoused to Christ by Faith already.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, At the first coming to Christ it goes to the Lord for life in him, and
from him; but here having life already, they go forth to live with him: there the
Soul goes out to meet him in the Gospel, in the Promise; here the Virgins go
forth to meet him in Glory. There the Soul goes to be justified by him, here the
Virgins go to be glorified with him: and therefore 'tis meant of a second going out
of the Soul by some special acts of Faith, after that it doth believe, and after 'tis
ready for him. And for Explication.</p>
                  <p>From whence doth the Soul go?<note place="margin">Quest. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's chiefly going out of this world by trampling this Moon under her feet,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> by
forgetting this her Fathers house, by a holy contempt of it, and a holy dying to
it, and all the glory of it. For 'tis a thousand to one if Satan doth not intangle
here, if <hi>Lot</hi> be not taken with <hi>Sodom</hi> though burnt out there; and if this going out
is to enjoy the Lord in another world chiefly, then going out is from the opposite
terme, from this world. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> singles out this mercy, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. Christ
gave himself to deliver us from this present evil world. Oh say men, 'tis a good
world, and good being here. 'Tis an evil world: 'tis so when Death comes, but
for present 'tis best. No, 'tis a <hi>present evil world.</hi>

that good, go forth to meet it, and those are Hope and Desire; like the
blind man and the lame, both together can make a shift to go. Hope like the eye
goes out and looks, Desire like the feet runs out and longs. The going forth
therefore to meet Christ, is: 1. By a real expectation of him. 2. By a longing
desire to be with him. Hope gets on the top of the world, and cries, Oh I see
him, Desire stands by and longs for him, Oh come Lord. A careless blind
world look not for him, nor after him, the Saints do. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. An earthly-minded
world longs not for him, the Bride doth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17, 20. <hi>Oh come Lord
Iesus, come quickly;</hi> by love and joy we imbrace and entertain the Bride-groom,

they have bread, but not the staff of bread, they have Ordinances, but not the

until God is satisfied for all wrongs. Now the Lord Jesus hath satisfied, nay

10. 14. Now the soul never comes to have setled peace in his own conscience
(though peace was purchased before) but by offering up of the Lord Jesus by
Faith, even Christ himself: the Soul wants him, the Father shews a Ram in the
bush, gives Christ; and that the Soul gives him for satisfaction, and offers him
to God again. As the Priests in the Old law, when the Sacrifice was slain, then
it was offered. God offers the Soul a crucified Son, Faith takes him and offers
him, <hi>Lord behold thy Son, Rom.</hi> 3. 25. And hence comes Propitiation and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40159:40"/>
peace, peace to see that God is satisfied. Now if by Faith we come to have
the peace of the Fathers satisfaction with us, then it must needs pitch upon the
person of the Son first. Hence many never have peace, because 'tis not a Son
himself they look for, but somewhat from him: they are blind, and dead, and

                  <p>Because the Soul can neither actually receive,<note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> nor expect to receive any thing
from Christ, unless it hath first pitcht upon the person of Christ. A man may
hope he shall, and presume and think he shall, and it may be receive somewhat
out of the common courtesie Christ shews to them that look towards him, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

thing to his people, <hi>Isai.</hi> 7. 14. he ever brings in the Lord Jesus, that if he shall
be given, then all things also.</p>
                  <p>Because true Faith ever closeth with Christ by love to Christ,<note place="margin">Reason 4.</note> as false Faith
closeth with him out of self-love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>The Virgins love thee:</hi> that's love

in a swinish faith that contemns the Son: no, 'tis a precious Faith that loves the
Lord. Hence it carries the soul to the Beloved.</p>

of Gods people seek for, and find not, if the Lord intends good to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They desire the comforts, and conveniencies, and peace of this World, Oh
rest is sweet! and the Lord will give them none of these, or keep them at short
commons with these: and why? that they might lay up their peace, and find all
in himself, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1, 2. <hi>Abraham</hi> after the slaughter of the Kings was in fear

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They seek for some good to themselves, in themselves, from themselves; I
would fain believe and cannot; I would fain do (sayes a man) but alass he grows
worse and worse; the commandment comes, you will do, there is your task, do it,
yet they languish and dye, and why so? <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 23. that they might look for help

and many times very impatiently, and so sinfully too, and the Lord
denies them; it hath been better with them than now, therefore they wonder
the Lord should be so full, and they so empty, and think sometimes to seek no

'tis sometimes some lust and stumbling-block the Lord Jesus sees, Oh but against
that they seek, and truly here is the cause, that having no good from him, they
might place all their happiness and felicity in him. Look as it was with <hi>Iacob,</hi> a

in the Lord Jesus: the most flourishing Trees in Gods House shall have
their winter season, and cast their coat, that they might preserve themselves in
their root. This is the great wound of many a believing soul for a time, to rest

own hand, and this the Lord will not suffer his people to lye in long, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 4.
and the best and surest course that can be taken, is to cut them short of all; for
Faith is an unconquerable Grace, that whatever it loseth out of its own hand, it
will find it and enjoy it in another. And therefore see Gods end, and meet the
Lord in this end of his. See all in the Lord, and seeing your blessedness there in
all your wants, lay it up there, that if you will boast, here you may do it all the

glory of the Lord might be revealed. I must here give you a taste, for it doth me
good to think, and it will do you more good to enjoy the sweetnesse of this
Truth. There are four Things you desire all, which are chiefly laid up in Christ,
to that end that you might in all wants quiet your hearts with unspeakable peace
there.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The free Grace and love of the Father, this is that I hope which you prize
most, pray for most, fear the loss of most, would rejoyce in the having of most,
without which thy life is death, and blessings curses, and death the beginning of
Hell. Would you see this love better than life to thee? Oh I cannot see it, or
but very little of it. 'Tis true, look upon your selves you can see but little, many
fears, many tears, many heart-sorrows, many temptations, many desertions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vexing sins, many denyals to your Prayers; but Oh look up to that Ointment
which is poured upon this blessed head, that love that is shed abundantly upon
the Son from before all worlds, and look what love, what Grace the Father shews
to him, that love is thine; that love in him is shewn to thee, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10.
Here stand amazed all ye people of the Lord, you have heard the Lord loves you,
and sometime believe it, but being under water, cannot conceive of it, nor see
how he loves you, how dearly, how abundantly; Oh look now upon the love
of God the Father in the Son, as he loves him, so he loves thee a worm, a Devill,
notwithstanding all thy want, all thy sins, all thy miseries, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 23, 26.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Life: Oh Death is terrible, and a dead heart is woful, 'tis the great plague
that lies upon men without Christ, that are strangers to the life of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18.
Is thy heart ever so joyed as when it's most enlarged for God, and hath most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and liberty in the wayes of God: alas thy life is but a lingering sickness, a

when your hearts are affected, and warmed, and quickened in Prayer by word, or
by Divine thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh if it might be ever so, how happy! Oh but it dyes

Men, than Kings, than Angels. And I doubt not but the Lord suffers Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

that when you have none, yet here it is: blessed be God, he will keep our
lives as the life of <hi>Iacob</hi> was knit up, and bound up in the life of the child; nay
that life is ours.</p>

Hell, and the Grave, and Satan, with all the strength of darkness and delusion, and

but want in thee; Do not shift so much for a little from the Lord, but see
Gods end and rach it. Oh rejoyce, glory in, and bless the Lord. This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s
life, and the life of the Churches first planted. Oh bless the Lord for all spiritual
blessings in Christ; this will be joy in sorrow, life in death, this is golden Faith,
this will answer all fears; when Satan saith thou hast not this or that, nor canst
not do this nor that, and to Hell therefore thou must go: Reply again, 'tis true, I
have little, I am dead, but Christ lives for ever; I am under miseries, Christ is
triumphing in Heaven for ever: I may fall in my self, I never can fall in him; that

will you do this, if you did thus know it? It may be some of
you have not done so, unless by force sometimes, and you will find it one of the
toughest works of Faith that is: What is a poor man better for anothers wealth?
and a sick man for anothers health, and a naked man when others are cloathed?
Yet Beloved, by vertue of the power of Faith, and our union to the Lord Jesus,
a man is the better. A Woman that is matcht to a Prince may have never a penny
in her purse, and yet she rejoyceth in that her Husband hath it. It's the secret
nature of Faith to make a man all one with Christ, in Christ, in that manner that
I cannot find such an union in the world; and hence his health, his cloaths, his
Grace, his life may be matter of as much joy as if a man had all this in himself.
And because many a soul hath Christ, but feeling such emptiness in himself, as
that he cannot think so, and it may be would do so if he saw whether he might do
so or no: I shall therefore express my thoughts to them thus in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all that fulness that is in the Lord Jesus, 'tis not for himself, but for
them that want it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 19. he might have been blessed in his Fathers bosom
without thee; why should he therefore live, and do, and suffer, and rise, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
his blessed Nature, but for them that wanted this. He is filled with wisdom,
life, strength, because men are blind, dead, weak.</p>

2. But you will say, all the world want it, and yet few in the world shall
ever have any share there, therefore all them in the world that hunger after all
that good that is in him, they may now in the absence of it content themselves
with it, that there 'tis in him for them, for the Lord fills the hungry, and so hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
as 'tis not something or other that they pick out, but all Christ, and all of that
is in Christ: now is the season to eat, if bread and hunger meet, now satisfie
your self. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed, and the Lord denyed, yet now the Lord bid
him feed on his Grace: so that when thy heart asks what hast thou to do with
him when so vile? answer, Yet the Lord hath all, and I want him, and hunger after
him. Take heed of despising his Grace; if thou hast no hunger, the Lord be
merciful to thee!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you have so contented your selves with him, as now you place all your fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity

no more would I patronize the sloth of the wicked. Many a man it may be may
say, I have nothing in my self, and all is in Christ, and comfort himself there, and
so fall asleep; hands off and touch not this Ark, lest the Lord slay thee: a christ of
clouts would serve your turn as well. Run not to this Temple to make it a Denn
of your thievish heart; no, do you so content, or will you so content your selves
with him, as to account your selves happy here, that all the world is Dung in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

Christ and all too. 2. Lest the Lord ever keep you short in a complaining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

must precede this act of the understanding to see Christ, before a man can close

in order of nature it does precede, and absolutely necessary it is: hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 40.

it is one thing to read of the Sun in a Book, or to know it by relation, another
thing to know it by sight. This is therefore the saving-knowledg of Christ, to see
the Lord in his Glory as he is: not perfectly, for that is in Heaven; hence we
shall there see him, and be like unto him, but imperfectly, and in part, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
18. <hi>Changed</hi> here <hi>into the same Image.</hi> And this appears from these four
Grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Knowledg the Saints have of Christ, 'tis not by bare word only, but
also b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the Spirit. The word relates Christ, but the Spirit is the interpreter of
the Word: the Interpreter of Heaven must interpret the language of Heaven.
Now the Spirit ever shews us things as they are, even though they be deep things,
and mysteries, it makes them plain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. <hi>As the Sun when it ariseth
it scatters all darknesse, so when this day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without the Word: for 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. lest the light of the
Gospel should shine: 'tis by the Word that the Spirit doth enlighten.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the sight of the Knowledg of Christ, 'tis as the knowledg of a thing
in a glass, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. Now though you see not the man face to face, yet if
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40159:43"/>
you see him in a glasse, there you see him as he is: <hi>Quod videtur in speculo, non est
imago,</hi> as some think. A man may know another by relation, or by some picture,
but in a glass that is more full. The Jews they saw Christ, but it was under Vails
and Types, and Pictures of him, this was obscure: under the Gospel the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>il is
pulled off, aud <hi>with open face we see as in a glasse the glory of the Lord.</hi> In Heaven
the glasse is taken away, and then we see as we are seen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because that estate the Saints are translated into is a state of Glory. Hence
when justified, then glorified. Hence as that sanctification that is in the will is
the beginning of the life of Glory, so that light God puts into their mind, is the
beginning of the light of Glory. Hence as in Heaven the soul sees Christ by the
full light of Glory perfectly, face to face, so in this life the soul sees Christ really
as he is, yet as in a glasse imperfectly. Hence we are said to <hi>see in
part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. In regard of that abundant goodnesse and love of Christ to his people. Love
cannot lock up secrets, <hi>Ioseph</hi> hid himself from his Brethren for a time, but his
bowels melt, he must tell them that he is <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Christ may do so, but his
love even constrains him afterward, to let them see whom he is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 21. I
confesse its admirable love to reveal Christ in the Word and letter of the Gospel,
to hear of him is happinesse, and if the Lord saves you, you will think so too:
But this is common to wicked men; there is a manifestation of himself as he is unto
his people. And now he is in Glory, hence reveals himself in his inconceiveable,
Glory, that now a mans eye sees the Lord, and such things he never thought of
before, which eye never saw, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>How doth the soul see him as he is?</p>
                  <p>I in this case,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> rather desire to learn than teach, even from the meanest;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> yet
what is obvious I shall suggest, in this weighty businesse.</p>
                  <p>This seeing of him appears in three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. True saving knowledge and sight of Christ consists in the sight of the glory
of his person, especially now <hi>caught up to Heaven, and sitting at the right hand of
God, in all the Glory of the Father.</hi> Look as at the Judgment-day the Lord shall
break out of Heaven in such Glory as shall amaze all the world, and all eyes shall
see him, that he shall not only be admired in himself, but in all his Saints, by
all that are round about him: just so doth the soul see him now (though nor by
the eye of sense, yet by the eye of Faith) though not come to judge the world, yet
now ruling of the world; though not in the clouds, yet in Heaven; though his
Humanity only in Heaven, yet his God-heads beams filling Heaven and Earth;
though not yet coming in the Fathers Glory, yet sitting clothed with the Fathers
Glory: for if a man looks on Creatures, he sees Gods foot-steps of power; if on
Angels and Saints, Gods Image of Holinesse; if in Christ, there God himself,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6, 7. 'Tis true then Christs Glory shall be seen by the Wicked, but
that's by sense, not by Faith, that is only in their minds, but there is no shining
into the heart, to the kindling of an infinite esteem of him: and this the god of
this World hides from people; Christ the Lord of another world in spight of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
reveals to his people. Before a man sees Christ, there is nothing more base
than Christ, even to the Elect, and then the wayes and work of Christ, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Have any Heathen changed their gods? these change their glory for that which
doth not profit:</hi> now the Lord will be, must be esteemed of his people; hence will
and doth reveal this Glory of his to his Saints, whereas here others are
blind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the beholding of the Lord as he come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and appears in the Glory of his
Covenant, for when the Lord reveals himself so as to cause the soul to believe,
and thereby to make it one of his people, he never makes any a people, but by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into Covenant with them. Hence he ever appears in his Covenant first,

requiring this and that, and they endeavour to do it; and hence if they cannot,
they comfort themselves with this, the Lord accepts my endeavours, not seeing

                  <p>First, I have broke the first Covenant of the Law, Christ appears not as one
that exacts the Debt, but as one that comes to enrich him when poor.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I cannot walk after it as a Rule, Christ appears in this Covenant,
and promiseth to cause him to do it; and hence after all departings from the
Lord, he will not depart further by unbel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is Christ, that in him he may perform the Covenant, and by him be strengthned
to walk with him as after a Rule: For the Covenant of Grace is not, Christ will
be rigthteousnesse to thee if thou wilt walk after the Law as a Rule, but Christ
will do both: and this the soul sees in it's Glory, else it's no sight. Hence 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
3. Gospel is called <hi>The ministration of Glory,</hi> which no carnal heart can see, for

and what fits the fancy, that's beauty: there is a sutablenesse every way. So Christ

that the saving-knowledg of Christ is dependant upon the sensible knowledg of a

of them without repentance, he may talk of Christ, but no beauty will
appear in Christ: So 'tis at first, first the Soul feels sin, and that God is holy, and
will hate him: then the Lord shews Christ; come to call such. Yea but I have
no good, and cannot help my self; Christ appears fit to seek out such. Oh but
I cannot see, nor believe, nor be affected; Christ appears one fit to do all, full of
wisdom to perform the Second Covenant. Oh but I want all things; Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
all-sufficient. Oh but I shall fall; Christ appears constant in his love. Oh
but he is far to seek; Christ appears present. Oh but I shall sin; Christ appears
merciful to bear with, and heal infirmities. Oh but I shall believe too soon; he
is fit to prepare and dispose. Oh but all the world will be against me; Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
appears fit to rule all for me. Oh but Death and Grave may hurt me; Christ
appears fit who hath conquered all: and this is ever in the Saints. Now least

that think they believe when yet they have not the Son.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those that do not close with himself, but only come to him for some righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
out of himself (for I shall not speak of them that forsake all, and follow
Christ for the bagg and for the loaves) for 'tis with all men living naturally, as 'tis
with men that have been rich shop-keepers, but now they are broke, and cast into
great want; steal they will not, digg they cannot, begg they know not how; turn
Prentice to another they must not, they have not been used to that life; hence
they resolve to set up their Trade again, though they sell but Pins, and Points, and
small Wares; and because they cannot set up for themselves, they go unto Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to help them, and run into their Books on trust, and desire day and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and they will pay them all again: now 'tis not the man that they respect,
but to make up their markets out of him; but alass they cannot pay their Debts,
and hence to Prison they go: so 'tis here, God set up <hi>Adam</hi> with a stock in his
own hand, now he is broken and cast into great want, and fears the arrest of Gods
displeasure, now sin men dare not, digg and help themselves they cannot, and
to begg and live upon the Lord and his Alms they know not how, indeed they
will not, they are not used to this life; hence seek to set up their Trade again,
though in never so small duties; and because they cannot help themselves, hence
they go to Christ, not as to an Husband for himself, but as to a Merchant to set
them up again: and truly Christ for many ends, and to shew his freenesse to his
own, gives many Talents to such, which they receiving hope to please the Lord
by; when I can get the Lord to give me some more knowledg, brokennesse, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
enlargements, abilities to do, then I hope I shall please him: but either
they spend all and fall away to nothing before they dye, or else Death come; and
carries them captive to the judgement-seat of God, and there they see they are
run but the deeper in Debt, and not able to pay. Thus it is with Papists who
profess that none of their own Works save, but his works in us, and his Blood me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting,
that thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> shall save. Hence they trust not to what they do, but to what
the Lord does, against which very Faith the Apostle disputes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. Thus it
was with the Jews, divers despised Christ, and sought a righteousness of their
own; others cryed <hi>Lord, Lord:</hi> Lord there be these sins that wring my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ease me of them, here be these duties I must do, else never saved, and my
heart is dead, Oh affect me, and help me to do them: there be such works I am
to perform, and have no strength to Pray, to Prophesie, Lord assist me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21,
22. <hi>Depart, I know you not,</hi> never accepted of you, you thought these things
would please me, you closed not with me, Oh now depart from me, from my
fellowship, my bosom, my presence: for this is ever their frame, they think to
pacifie God by what they do, and though they think his justice cannot, yet they
hope there is such indulgence in his mercy that he will accept. Thus it was, <hi>Isai.</hi>
58. 2. for this is their temper, they are not wounded with the want of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but with some jarrings against the Law, for which they fear they must dye.
Hence not seeing into the spiritual nature of the Law, they are wounded, not slain
by the Law: they hope they shall live if they can leave such sins, perform such du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
feel such abilities. Now having made tryal at home, they go to Christ, and
seek him with delight for to work this or that, and then they are well: now if they
do not receive at present, then they hope by seeking to find in time, if he doth
not help them, then they shall be well. Hence they ever live in some sin, and
know it not, as these did, and as the young man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. And thus 'tis, as 'tis
with two Princes, one is in trouble by inroders, he sends for aid to another, but
doth not cast down his Crown, and put himself in subjection to the other. So men
will be Kings, and hence send for aid against the inrodes of some sin that stings
Conscience, but put not themselves under the Lord Jesus. Bring those mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
hither, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. In one word; as the Wound is, so is my closing with

Christ, if one be in outward trouble, now to Christ he goes to deliver; if pressed
with inward trouble for some sins, now to Christ to remove them, and so to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
conscience; if with want of Christ himself, now he goes for himself.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Those that close with Promises without Christ himself, and divide between
them two, that strip Christ of these his Swadling-clouts, make their gain of these,
and let himself go. I confesse all a Christians wealth is laid up in Promises, not
in words and syllables, for they are dead things, but Christ in them, and Gods
faithfulnesse in them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 4, 5. This is all my salvation, for all fulness
is in Christ, he is rich, but what am I the better? nay the more miserable, for
all emptinesse is in me; therefore in the promise lies my peace. And this is a
Christians support in all troubles, and hence he casts anchor here; but here is his
frame, he layes not hold on them without Christ, but by them goes to Christ,
and there rests, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 45. <hi>He that hath heard of the Father cometh unto me.</hi>
Give children milk in the dish, they cry still, they must have it from the Mother,
and there suck: so 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2, 3. Now there are others that finding some work
in themselves without Christ, and thinking that it's saving, and so a good signe;
hence are mistaken, and close with it without Christ, and now they think it's well.
I doubt not but the Jews that be devout comforted themselves with that promise,
<hi>He that confesseth, &amp;c. Prov.</hi> 28. 13. not understanding of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>Say
not within your selves we have Abraham to our Father,</hi> that promise kept them

a Wedding Garment. 'Tis with these men as 'tis with men that come to buy
Wines, they taste them, and content themselves with a taste, another buyes the

the field, another he gleans somewhat, and contents himself with that. There is
in one word a double error,</p>

from any qualification you feel in your self.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When men shall snatch and nibble at Promises, and misapply them,
not closing with Christ in them and by them; I have confessed my sin, and repented,
and run away with this without Christ. Oh time will come the Lord will say,

mouth? to arm thy self against Christ by Promises to make a spoyl of Christs grants,
and let him be crucified. When <hi>Saul</hi> rent off <hi>Samuels</hi> garment, he said, <hi>The
Lord shall rend, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 27, 28. The letter kills, all Promises without
Christ slay, because they keep the famishing Soul from Bread it self.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Those that close not with Promises only, but with Christ himself, but it's
only with the Image and fancy of him, which they think is himself. In true Faith
the Father reveals the Son as he is, or the Son reveals himself as he is, and Faith
hence closeth with him as he is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 40. But some there be that hear of him,
hence think what he is. Hence a carnal mind imagines of him as it imagines of
a King in a far Country, and falls down to his Image, and trusts to it, and depends
on it, and joyes in it, untill a man comes to be converted, or to dye: and then
he sees the deceit. Or if he did see him, yet he can see no beauty in him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him. There is many a man in this case that trusts to, and joyes in Christ,
whom if he did know he would loath. <hi>Iohn</hi> came preaching the Gospel to shew
them Christ, they all came to him, and rejoyced in his light, but it was but for a
season: for when he came to shew them <hi>there he is, Iohn</hi> 1. 29. not one man
stirs when he shews them Christ, and <hi>vers.</hi> 35. <hi>only two:</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 32. No man
received his testimony. This is (Beloved) the great sin and cause of all the rest, if
they had known they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory. Christ is not
seen, hence not thought of, hence not esteemed; hence men boast not in him:

word, they receive Christ, that he may give contentment to them, and not that

make them happy, not to make them holy; But they thus closing with him,
think they have him, and hence rejoyce exceedingly, and hence have a love to
him, and hence some kind of communion with him, and hence think they are
espoused to him, and more familiar with him than others, and hence veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

horror, and useth all means, at last he sees only Christ can do it, and hence
seeks for and prizeth his love (for his one ease) for as horror may be his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
evil, so love to ease him, may be his greatest good: At last he is fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded.
How? By any work or word? No, but God hath perswaded, and
its now sealed, hence joy. But now there is matter of more trouble, holinesse,
and close walking with Christ, this is troublesome, he cares not for Christ, to
help him here; but deviseth how to keep Christ and joy without holinesse. Hence
let a world of sin lie upon them, they be not troubled with that, they look up to
Christ; or if they see and be troubled at it, they take it as a burden, not as the
greatest burden. Hence (say men) you must not judge of your estate by any
thing or qualification you feel in your self, for these may fail your eye-sight in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
times (But we must follow it then, and not rest till we see and find it, for
<hi>without holinesse no man shall see God</hi>) Hence also let there be never so many falls,
yet say they, never call your state into question, hence they professe, we cannot
move till we be moved, and if I do not, it is not my fault. Hence if Ministers
do preach any things which are not about the person of Christ, or the excellency
of a Christian in Christ, or the emptinesse of the creature to prepare for Christ,
(which are indeed of great use) and presse to any work or service of Christ, they
are Legal Preachers, and bring people under a Covenant of works. Whereas if
we preach duties, and leave them as signs, before being in Christ, they are so,

1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 3, 4. It seems, they said <hi>they had no sin,</hi> as now some say,
God sees no sin in justified people, God looks to the new creature only,
'tis not I but sin: if the Spirit help not, 'tis not my fault. Not many dayes
since it did lye upon the spirit of one, who seeing Christ hath undertaken all, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with him, rejoyced in him, not for this end, not from the beauty they saw in
holiness, nor bitterness of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

blessed if he save them in their sin, and conceiting he would, have loved him; thus

these. In a word, the soul of man desires rest and peace, seeks for it in Creatures,
seeks to satisfie it self there, there it cannot; hence seeks for it (as many dying
men do) in Christ, not in the Grace, but in the joy of Christ; not in Christs holy
presence, but in his comforting presence; seeking the utmost perfection of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in the seale of the Spirit, not in the mighty actings of the Spirit for God.
Hence he is delude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, and fancies he hath Christ, and hence joy. Sin is the great
evill, hence the end of Christs coming is to take it away. Hence if a man close

but of his holy presence, for some people there be that never felt a

and though he kill them, yet they will trust to him: others are in misery, and

comforts of Christ, and hence close with Christ for that, and if they find it they
depart from Christ by looseness of life, if not by despair of heart, as <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
28. <hi>God answers me not by Urim, &amp;c.</hi> Others feel a want of some righteousness
from Christ, the having of which supports and sustains them without Christ,
till with the Prodigal, when all is spent, then they think of Bread at home, and
the want of which makes them to have lesse esteem of, and desire after Christ, but
they are full of Objections against the thoughts of closing with him, but hence
they close with Christ for that. Others there are that feel a want of the Lord
himself, and hence close with him for himself; so that let a man have all blessings
in the world, the purity of Ordinances, never so many illapses, and droppings of
divine light, and life, and comfort in these Ordinances, that he wonders the Lord
should be so good to him, yet he shall find (if right) his soul secretly unquiet and
unsatisfied till he hath the Lord himself. As the savour of meat makes a man
that wants it, cry the more after it, long the more for it; so the savour and
sweet of all creatures, all Ordinances, all Duties, do not stay, but stir up the
soul to seek Christ, when he is himself, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 4. <hi>They shall seek the Lord weeping.</hi>
Hence first they felt a want of him. <hi>The full soul loaths the honey-comb.</hi> Let the
Lord be never so sweet, let him do them never so much good, the more good he
doth them, the lesse they regard him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>They said not where is the Lord?</hi>
Therefore that soul that truly closeth with the Lord, must first feel a want of the
Lord, and say these Ordinances are not bread, these creatures are not bread, all
these parts, gifts, duties are not bread, bran, not bread. All this savour, this
sweetnesse 'tis not bread. Hence I perish for want of bread, I have creatures,
Ordinances, Affections, comforts, Duties, but Oh no Christ. Like the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,
<hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17. Oh therefore do not only see, but feel the want of the Lord
Jesus, you that never had him yet; nay you that have him, you cannot have
more of him, but by feeling more the want of him. Oh it was a marvellous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of <hi>Moses,</hi> when the Lord began to grow weary of their company, <hi>Exod.</hi>
33. 15. <hi>If thou goest not with us, carry us not up hence, i. e.</hi> Let us rather die than
live without thee. <hi>Mary</hi> when Christ was crucified, the carcase of the Lord
was gone, she sate there weeping: Oh much more for the Lord himself. Its
observed by some for the saddest spectacle, to see a desert Town: Oh what is
it to see a desert heart, where no Christ inhabits? Or a city, and no Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.
And hence its <hi>Romes</hi> curse, to be made <hi>an habitation of devils;</hi> so here.
What is Hell, but this, to see not <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to see Christ afar off? and thy self
shut out. It may be 'tis no sorrow now, but it will be. Its a sad thing to see a
man <hi>rise up early, go to bed late, eat the bread of carefulnesse,</hi> and yet gain nothing,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. This is very sad. Christ is our gain, all the creatures you have,
means you use, duties you do, comforts you receive, they are not gain, nay, the
more God doth for thee, the more thou losest, if no Christ, because now thou
art full by this means. Oh therefore get a heart sensible of the want of the Lord.
Think there is a Christ, whose Glory is the amazement of Heaven, but Oh I see
him not. Happy for ever are they that have him, but Oh I have him not. Your
hungry bellies cannot want bread, if they do, they are never quiet till they have
it. Is the Lord no better? Lord grant this contempt be not revenged with
spirituall plagues! Some of you know not your want, others feel it not, you can
live without him; worse than <hi>Saul,</hi> he went to Urim, and lamented in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
<hi>He answers me not!</hi> Oh you feel no distresse, because of this, I have him
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40159:48"/>
not! Nay worse than <hi>Dives,</hi> that begg'd, Oh a drop of <hi>water to cool my tongue!</hi>
Why cry not you, Oh the Lord Christ to comfort my heart! Why is not all
this fulnesse longed for? Oh therefore let nothing else comfort, and let nothing
discourage, but make this use of all, Oh I want him!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the right closing with his person, this is also required, to tast the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sin, as the greatest evil: Else a man will never close with Christ, for
his holinesse in him, and from him as the greatest good. For we told you that
that's the right closing with Christ for himself, when it is for his holinesse. For
ask a whorish heart what beauty he sees in the person of Christ, he will after he
hath looked over his Kingdom, his Righteousnesse, all his works, see a be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uty
in them, because they do serve his turn to comfort him only. Ask a Virgin, he
will see his happinesse in all; but that which makes the Lord ami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ble, is his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
which is in him, to make him holy too; as in marriage, it is personal
beauty draws the heart. And hence I have thought it re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>son that he that love;
Brethren for a little Grace, will love Christ much more. Hence if a man feels
not the want of Christ, the bitternesse of sin, as his greatest evil, he will never
see nor admire Christs beauty, much lesse close with it. Hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
the world of sin, because they believe not in me, i. e.</hi> of that chiefly. Oh
these wrongs done against the Lord! Why not of wrath and Hell? Oh
sin is the evil, and then it appears exceeding evil, when not against God simply,
but against a Son. <hi>Paul why persecutest thou me? Acts</hi> 9. Why? Did he not
live in lusts and self-confidence? Yes, but in all these he saw he persecuted
Christ. And after saddest search, I have feared the want of this, is the great
cause of all a mans closing amisse with Christ. I would but ask where was <hi>Iudas</hi>
wound? Was it resting in a Pharisaical righteousness without Christ? Without Christ,
no, for he forsook all and followed Christ. Was it want of profession of him,
preaching for him? No. Was it for want of communion with him? No: one
sin he lived in, he had his bagg. And hence when many went from him,
he stuck to him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. <hi>Iudas</hi> still cleaves to him: yet even then Christ calls him
a Devil, which if ever he had tasted the bitternesse of, he would not have lived in,
not dyed desparately, some think impardonably without Christ, and so sin more
against him. Let any man living shew me how he can close with Christ, and yet
love one sin: I'le be his bond-man, that can say, I close with Christ as
my Husband, and yet I love my Whore too. Let any man living close with
Christ, and keep his sin, or hide his sin, or let it be hid, his closing with
Christ shall harden him in his sin, and so he shall dye without Christ in his
sins, as it is writ, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 14. As it was with <hi>Ioab,</hi> who fled to the Horns of
the Altar, so 'tis with many men, they sin, and confess and sin under all Laws:
why? they fly to Christ, and this imboldens them, hardens them, why? because
they never tasted the bitterness of sin. I know a mans sin may be crucified before
'tis mortified, as it may be buried after 'tis dead. Oh therefore I beseech you
look to this, you fail not here. Many of you are troubled, Oh take heed of
being comforted until you get the Lord to do this for you, or unlesse you depend
upon the Lord for this in his time. Some apply comfort when they see no good:
I dare not to my self or others: Oh therefore imagine thou didst hear the Lord
speaking, Why dost thou persecute me? why is a man so grieved at any thing that
crosseth himself? because a man loves himself, because he thinks his good lies there
most: Oh see thy good more in Christ than in thy self, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4. Oh me, me in
whom all good is, oh to persecute him! Two men hear, and one is in horror, and
the other not; oh 'tis because God sets it on: so here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Make the Lord Jesus present with you, and set him really before you, and see
him willing to give himself unto you, even to thee in particular. Those that give

have a notion and report of him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They dare not close with him, because they fear he is not willing to
close with them, with others, not with me; so that all the Scriptures they read, all
the Promises they hear are very sweet, but they look on them as spoken to others.
Hence <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. <hi>For the Promise is made to you, and to them afar off;</hi> be

of Christ revealed according to a Promise, not by it, and love spoken in mercies,
but the Word interprets them and clears them to be no delusions; I mean the
Spirit there: This is judged to be a good answer to Papists, who shall be judge of
controversies? We answer that which shall be judge at the last Day, must be judge
now: but so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 48. So whether doth Gods Spirit seal, or the
Devil delude? It's a great controversie if you have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

love by, but think you have a way to see it without, this Word shall judge you. Oh
look therefore for the Lord by a word to do it, and say <hi>Speak Lord;</hi> and if by
word, look not for it without a work on your own heart. Some Christians have
rested with a work without Christ, which is abominable; but after a man is in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40159:49"/>
Christ not to judge by the work, is first not to judge from a word. For though
there is a word which may give a man de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

work, nay when he feels none, as absolute promises, yet no word giving assurance,
but that which is made to some work, <hi>He that believeth, or is poor in spirit, &amp;c.</hi>
till that work is seen, hath no assurance from that Promise. Tell him God hath
promised to pour <hi>clean water, Ezek.</hi> 36. Yes for some, not for me. Secondly, 'tis
not to judge by the Spirit, for the Apostle makes the earnest of the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Seal; now earnest is part of the money bargained for, the beginning of Heaven,
of the light and life of it: He that sees not the Lord is his by that, see; no God his

Wise Virgins did here verily look for him; the Five Foolish seemingly did so too:

home, and enemies to put under his feet, and then they know he will come,
and this day they look for. As Christ expects it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 13. By the same Spirit
they look for it.</p>
                  <p>This is that which Christ so oft presseth on his Disciples, foreseeing the slumbers of
the world, to be ever watching for his second coming; and hence these alone
are accounted blessed, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 37, 38. That let Christ come at any watch, Oh
blessed. The duration of the world from the first to the second coming, is but
as it were a night divided into several watches; the Saints are the watchmen of
the world, who you know look for day-light, though it be long, 'tis but a night;
it will be morning: All the rest are like birds at their chaffe. And hence he
tells them the reason of the uncertainty of his coming, makes this the end of it.

and love the smoak of their own chimneys, never look out to other coasts and
countreys, or to a strange Land, but Sea-men that are bound for a Voyage, and
have a Pilot with them that hath seen the coast, that's it they look for; so men
that live in this world, and are well here, look not after Christ not his coming,
but they that have a Pilot, a Spirit to shew them, this day, this coast, and are
bound for another world, they look out for this; they see it two waies</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the eye of Faith in the promise, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. And this makes the soul
see it, when all things seem to be against it, and hence expects it; for that is the
difference between Faith and hope: Faith closeth with Christ, and all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Christ, in the promises as present, hope hence steps forth and laies hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the performance it self as absent. Faith entertains the promise as a faithful
messenger, and sees that his message is true. Hope runs out of doors and leaves
it with Faith, and looks for the Lord himself, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Light of Glory in the thing it self; for Saints do not only see things
in Letters and Syllables, and words, but see things as they are in themselves.
The wicked see the word, sin, and Christ, and Heaven (and in seeing see not)
but not the things themselves. Now the Glorious coming of Christ being a thing
to come, yet to be done, how do they see it but by report? Yes, they have the
Spirit of Glory, which Spirit <hi>shews them things to come,</hi> John 16. 13. <hi>Which eye
hath not seen.</hi> That look as their Head Christ sees this day as it shall be, and his
apprehensions are not false, but as he conceives of this day, so shall it be: so
the Saints by the same Spirit see it before it comes, and are not mistaken about it,
though it be very darkly, yet sometimes when the Spirit of God is not overclouded,
they see it more evidently. For this is the great plague of the wicked, they see
nothing as 'tis, and in Hell they see how they have been deceived. So this is the
happinesse of Saints, that though they see things darkly, yet they see things tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Spirit creating glorious impressions on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ind of things as they are. They
know things that the eye sees not, as they are. That look as <hi>Abraham</hi> John 8. 56. <hi>saw
Christs day, and was glad,</hi> though afar off; so the Saints by the same Spirit. Now
why did <hi>Noah</hi> make his Ark, and look for a Flood? Because he saw it really.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40159:50"/>
Did not others? No, 'tis said, <hi>They knew not,</hi> Mat. 24. 38, 39. Never knew
<hi>till the Floud came:</hi> The Lord made it not known. <hi>Noah</hi> did, the other did not.
Hence the Saints cannot but look for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because they see nothing else in this world worth looking after,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> no, not for
the present. For if a man sees the day of the Lord, yet hath some prey in his
eye, in this world, and his game before him, he will follow his hunting to
catch his venison, though he comes too late for the blessing. But the Lord
makes his people to see nothing in the world worth the hawking or catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They see the Glory of another day, another world, and this puts out the
Glory of this, and hence makes them look for that; and hence when Christ
would comfort his Disciples, he promiseth nothing here, but tels them, <hi>In my
Fathers House are many Mansions. I go to prepare a place, and Il<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Iohn</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3. And hence they seeing this to be enough, look for
this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They see an end of all these things, of all the Glory of them, and that
these summer swallows will take their wings, and fly away in greatest extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Hence they look to eternal things, the Lord, and his coming, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18.
<hi>We look not at temporal things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They find the Lord crossing them of what they look for in this world, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

strangers here, and hence they look for somthing else. The things God hath
promised to his people are very great, but not accomplished. Why? Because
full accomplishment is left till the last day, that hope may wait, and that we
may live by Faith. God hath promised to <hi>take away all tears,</hi> Oh welcome that

                  <p n="3">3. Because they see and are sensible of their deliverance from wrath to come:<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note>
There hath been much wrath in the world seen, but yet the great wrath is to
come, what that is they see. What their escape from it is they see. Hence
they look for Christ, when he shall appear like the rising Sun, and like a Bride-groom
from his chamber to comfort them, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. For the Devils look for
this day, and natural men, but seeing wrath, wish themselves under rocks and
mountains, and seek to smother it: But Saints seeing themselves delivered,
hence calmly look for it. The sense of this love makes them say, Oh when will
he come, that I may <hi>see him with these eyes!</hi> They fear not (for why should they)
the terrour of this day.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because the Lord hath given unto them the first-fruits of Glory,<note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> and of that

at his coming. They are somtime full of fears, what if shut out at last? But
when they feel the first-fruits of Glory at that day, now they verily look for his
coming. Christ dies we know, but it was not possible for him to be held long,
and hence rose again, and then looked for Glory, and then was taken up to Glory: So
here, the Saints lie dead in the grave of sins and fears, but its not possible for
them ever to be held here; hence when <hi>risen with Christ,</hi> they look upon <hi>things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi>
and are waiting for Glory, and at last are taken to Glory with himself. That
look as <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 49. 18. said, <hi>My soul waiteth for thy salvation,</hi> when the

him from the excellency of this world; though he minds other things, yet he

14, &amp; 17. Men think it easie to believe a resurrection, and a second coming of
Christ for that end; but an hoverly sleight work is quickly done, and an hoverly
Faith is quickly wrought. But when a man comes to look considerately, Is there
such a day indeed? Is there one now in the third Heavens that will fire this whole
world, and gather his Saints to his Glory? Now its very hard. Its usual with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to pierce with extremities, that when they do begin indeed to close with
Christ, and receive comfort from him, to smite them with thoughts: Is there a
Christ, and is there such a time of coming? Now of all the Arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
and perswade, me-thinks none like this, <hi>viz.</hi> That there be a Generation of
men in the world, that verily look for this day and see it, and have the first-fruits
and beginnings of it already in their souls. A number of people that once
never minded it, heard of it, but looked not for it, now to see it; flesh and blood
could not, Satan would not reveal it, hence God that cannot lie, hath shewn it
unto them, so as they are in a manner eye-witnesses of it. Men will believe eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of any thing, especially if many. Such are the espoused of the Lord in all ages.

                  <p>True, but Divine revelation of any Truth that cannot deceive, for that is no
fancy of the head, nor delusion of Satan. Now this is a secret the Spirit makes
known.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that it fils the mind and feeds the heart with it, that it carries unto God
with wonderment of blessing him that ever he saw this. Fancies cannot feed,
especially in greatest agonies: Now they chuse misery on this ground, rather than
present peace here, Heb. 11. 35. <hi>Not accepting deliverance.</hi>
                  </p>

<hi>Noah</hi> foresaw a Flood nigh, but he might be deceived. No, 'tis said <hi>he feared,</hi>
kept close to God and it came, so here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Light whereby they see, it is not only sweet and Glorious, and cross
to heart and lusts, but its sudden, that as with <hi>Paul,</hi> when going to persecute,
<hi>suddenly there fell a great Light,</hi> and so he saw Christ. So when a man goes on in
his sin, and suddenly the Lord reveals this and that by a word (else 'tis a deceit)
which all Angels could not do before, so as to see it, and that none can reveal it
as he sees it, especially to bring this light out of darknesse, this must be miraculous
power, and no dream. But what do I speak of seeing? they feel the beginnings
of it in the first-fruits of it.</p>

you scramble for your selves, to enrich, and honour, and comfort your selves,

are sweet! Can it be otherwise? Now you say you hope and look for this
day. Where is your comfort of it? Where is your glory in it? <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 11, 12.
Compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 52. So thou wilt be in the Temple, nay in the fields
rejoycing and blessing the Lord, that ever he should intend to set thee at his
right hand, at that great day of his coming. No man but hath something to joy
his heart. Is it <hi>Corn, and wine and Oyl,</hi> and not <hi>the Light of Gods countenance</hi> at
this day? Its a sign they never look for it. Do the world rejoyce in their hopes,
and not Saints?</p>
                  <p>III. They that content themselves with any measure of holinesse and Grace;
they look not for Christs coming and company. For Saints that do look for him,<note place="margin">Sign 3.</note>
though they have not that Holinesse and Grace they would have, yet they rest not
satisfied with any measure, 1 John 3. 3. <hi>He that hath this hope purifieth himself as
he is pure.</hi> Christ finds us not lovely, but makes us lovely, by putting on his
own garments, imprinting his own Image. Hence Saints content not themselves
with any dressings, till made glorious, and so fit for fellowship with that Spouse.
And when the Soul sees this Love to be a Son, and then to be proclaimed Heir, Oh
this makes them set Christ himself as the pattern to walk by. Now therefore,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When men shall think this way is bad, &amp; another way of some Saints is good,
and so take a Copy of his course from them, and now is well, this only is to be
pure as man is pure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When a man leaves not till he gets such a measure of Faith and Grace,
and now when he hath got this, contents himself with this as a good sign
he shall be saved, he looks not for Christ. Or</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When men are heavily loaden with sin, then close with Christ, and then
are comforted, sealed, and have joy that fils them, and now the work is done,
and they are past Grace, and past Repentance, and daily cleansing, now they
study not what to do for Christ, that neither Family no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. When men shall not content themselves with any measure, but wish they
had more, if Grace would grow, while they tell Clocks, and sit idle, and so God
must do all, but do not purge themselves, and make work of it (Indeed Saints
purge not themselves of themselves, for dirty hands will never wash a foul face)
but by a daily dependance on, and importunity of Faith sigh after the Lord
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40159:53"/>
to do it; verily if not thus, you look not for Christ, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11, 12, 14. For if
you did, you would say and think, if to be like him be my Glory, Oh then that
I might then have it now. Sons that are born to their hopes in the Court, will
go in the Court-fashion: Beggars that are born and brought up under hedges,
content themselves with their rags, so here: Lord where is this Spirit? especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
even among us. There is scarce any but either would be honest, and then hopes
God accepts of his will, or will be so, &amp; then 'tis only so much as will credit or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him. Lord where is the man that mourns for this, how far short he falls of
Christ, of Christs thoughts, Christs prayers, Christs speeches, Christs meekness,
but only patches up his comforts with some ends of Gold and Silver, and shreds
of Honesty: He hath heard others teach and preach, and gets some shreds of
knowledge, thence he sees what others are, and do, and gets somewhat to be
like them. Have we not cryed out, men are too good to be better in our own
Land? And unlesse a few under Affliction or Temptation, who is? I pray
God such a race come not over hither, where God looks you should get a higher
pitch; put off your wildernesse-shoes, get those sins removed that provoked God
there; or else besides the misery of a heart-brand upon thee, thou dost not look
for Christ, and therefore art either not espoused, or asleep; and shalt if not by
the Word, by the terrour of God be dreadfully awakened. Oh <hi>New-England,
New-England,</hi> that art now making a conquest of the world, and seekest for the
spoyl of it to enrich thy self, to recover thy losses, and therefore makest a truce
with thy distempers for a time, and dost not purge thy self as Christ is pure, I dare
not yet tell thee what Christ Jesus hath to say unto thee! Therefore think of this,
if not thus, you have no hope, 'tis but talk and notion in thy head. And you
that do not, he shall come in a time when thou lookest not for him: And hast
not so much Grace as the five foolish Virgins had? This is the frame of men
and Professors, what are they? They were troubled, humiliation is past, they
have looked for salvation by Christ, that is past; they have been comforted,
that is past; What Holinesse? They will pray in Families, keep company with
Saints, get into Christ, receive Sacraments, that is past. What lack they yet?
Many wants, but God accepts their desires for what they want, and that is their
Circle of Honesty now, and there rest. Is it not thus? Is this to purge like
Christ? If any have more, Oh wonder at the Lord for it. But if not, Oh thy
doom!</p>

                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:40159:53"/>
2. In case Gods promises are not made good to thee. For at that instant a
man beleeves he gives Christ and all things, all Grace, all consolation, all Glory,
but 'tis in the promise, because he would have them live by Faith a while here,
as by sence in Heaven; and being wrapt up in the promise, they feel it not, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
plead with God: Hast not said Lord, thou wilt subdue iniquities, purge me as
Gold is tried? Why then do I go childlesse, gracelesse? No more Grace, no
more Spirit, no better heart for thee! Oh now the heart calls in question Gods
promise or sinks! Oh now remember this day, for the perfect restitution of all
things, perfect accomplishment of all promises is reserved for this time, <hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 9.
Thou prayest for many things, but they come not; Christ reserves the payment
till this day. What a comfort is this? What a sweet speech was it of <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
Josh. 23. 14. <hi>One thing hath not failed,</hi> when he had conquered the Land. So then
when the conquest is made, to see all the promises made good to thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In case of Gods absence or withdrawing, or when thou feelest but little of
his presence here in his Providences or in his Ordinances, private, publick, and
that in <hi>New-England</hi> too. Thou hast found one half hours time with the Lord,
alone, sweeter and better than a thousand worlds. Oh but this holds not! Thou
maist it may be wait on the Lord in his Ordinances, and go away with a sad heart,
Oh I cannot see him, and canst not find out the cause why so heavy, and vile, and so

in all,</hi> then thou shalt have thy fill of love, and fill of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In case of sorrow for the uproar of the world against God and Christ, and
the wrongs done to Christ and his people; to see Christ crucified, and crying
spare my life, and saying, <hi>If you seek me, let these little ones depart,</hi> yet they are
abused, and every one against Christ, as this day the world is coming to the last

                     <p n="2">2. This will help you to ride all storms, bear all knocks chearfully. Our Hope
is our Helmet. Our Hope is our Anchor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 17. You will meet
with them here it may be before you die.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Lord hath called you out of this world, he might have left you in it,
and given you your hope, your portion here, and then wo to thee, but he hath
called thee to this hope, that if Princes of the world knew, they would lay down,
nay cast away their Crowns at thy feet for it, and say, Oh that I were in that mans
case! Eph. 1. 18. <hi>Hope of his calling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Hope and expectation of all other things shall fail, if God loves thee, he
will make you know what 'tis to forsake your portion. If not, they shall fail you
when you die, this shall not; it <hi>makes not ashamed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Me-thinks this is the Glory of a Christian, that he turns his back upon the
world, and lives and waits for the coming of the Lord.</p>

                        <hi>He will make thee sit down to eat, and serve thee.</hi> The Lord Jesus himself shall only
then poure out to thee and give thee whatever thou callest for, honour thee as it
were above himself. When thou art at rest in Heaven, he will be at work for
thee.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If not, he may <hi>come in an hour thou lookest not for him.</hi> Christ may say to
thee, from henceforth sleep on.</p>
                     <p>What Means are there to make me look for him?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Get some promise that thou maist beleeve the Lord is thine,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> else
thou wilt never look for him; or if you do, you will be deceived, for <hi>hope is of
things not seen.</hi> Nay, commonly when the Lord brings any man to his hopes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him a promise, and Faith to beleive it, the Lord in the mid-way
seems to cross his promise. When the Lord promiseth life, glory, peace, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
joy, fulness, Heaven, they shall then and never so much before feel dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
death, shame, trouble, sorrow, Hell. For the Lord tries them by this,
and <hi>tribulation breeds experience, and experience hope.</hi> Hence you must first get a
promise of Christ and Glory, before you can hope for it, or expect Glory, and
then you may, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. For the promise will support hope, when heart, and
strength and all shall fail: Nay it will expect contraries out of contraries, <hi>Gen.</hi>
22. 5. <hi>I'le come again to you.</hi> Compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 18, 19. So that soul
that hath a promise, may say when he considers Gods power, and what Glory he
gives to God by beleeving it, God hath said he will comfort me, he will cleanse
me, he will give me Glory, I will have all these out of my sorrow, my sin, my
Hell.</p>
                     <p>Take heed therefore of two extreams.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Of hoping without a promise, for that is but Faith scared out of its
wits, when it comes to be examined; I hope so, and I have had joy and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of not expecting when God gives a promise. Can you live one day
without it? It may be you have no feeling yet! But <hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 8, 9, 10. Dost wait
for the Lord? <hi>i. e.</hi> From a sense of emptinesse, for all fulnesse thou shalt find it
in part here, and fully then, and say, <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him!</hi>
When a mans anchor is strong, and in good ground, he will look for safety, when
at anchor in the Harbour. Oh thou afflicted, tossed with tempests, the Lord hath
brought thee at last to Christ, after many drivings to and fro, and it clasps about
him according to a promise; if God changeth then thy comfort may not be. If
revelations come, I know they may deceive, but a promise cannot.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Fear the terrour of the Lord at this day, fear parting from him: I speak
not of doubting, but the holy fear of Saints, for that is the nature of fear, it makes
a man eye the thing feared: As <hi>Iacob</hi> when <hi>Esau</hi> was meeting of him. <hi>Noah</hi>
he fears and looks to safety in and by an Arke, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. <hi>Lots</hi> children took
not his counsel, they feared not, but <hi>he seemed as one that mocked to them. Paul</hi>
2 Cor. 5. 10, 11. <hi>knew the terrour of the Lord,</hi> hence looked for him, sought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
himself unto him. Men that fear not parting with Christ, will never look
nor care for him. And let it be a strong fear, else it will never carry you above
your cares and surfettings of the world.</p>
                     <p>How shall I fear thus?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Unlesse the Lord put it into your heart,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> none can; for the security of the
world is not sleepy, but deadly: Men are bound up as strong as with chains of
death; that till they feel the misery, they cannot fear it strongly. Oh look up
to the Lord to unchain those chains of death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Know the happinesse of them that shall ever be with Christ, what is the
sweetnesse of Christs love, and worth of it. Imagine the last day come, and all
the dead raised, Christ with flaming fire, all the wicked on the left hand, and
then sent away with <hi>depart ye cursed;</hi> all the Saints on the right hand, and then
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40159:54"/>
Oh come! and when all is dispatched, then to go up to Heaven, and
when gone, there to be for ever rejoycing, triumphing in the presence of God
Almighty; and now what it will be to be far off from Christ, weeping, never to be
pitied more. Oh he that was so full of pity, no heart then to pity, no hand to help!
I can but only paint this fire. Oh that the Lord would help you here, that so
you might look out for him. Saylors sleep in calms, and so it may be have many
here in this place of rest. Others of you take heed, Ile tell you your bar, It may
be most estates are brought low and sunk; when you see that, now you either
look back, or look for <hi>Lots</hi> accomodations, and such an estate as is lost, it may be
you will spy some hope of it, and then follow the game, and never look out till you
die. The Lord keep you from it! You then will not look up for Christs coming
at the last day, or in his Ordinances; here: If thou dost so, had it not been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thou hadst been buried in the Sea, or left in sorrow on the Shore? Oh take
heed therefore, look for the coming and company of Christ, and let this be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and because you cannot look for him in the the clouds now, Oh look and
wait for him in his Ordinances; and consider if espoused ones look for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then, and for perfect knowledge of him, and communion with him, then
think, Lord what a heart have I that look not for him here! But Lord <hi>who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
our report?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus they went out by hope and expectation of his coming<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Now the Second
thing follows, they went forth with longing desires after his coming.</p>

                     <hi>THat all those that are espoused to Christ,<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> and beloved of Christ, they ought
not only to look, but to long for the coming of, and their everlasting communion
with the Lord Christ Iesus.</hi> For the consummation of their marriage
with him, that though he be gone, our hearts may be with him, before
our souls be, or before our souls and bodies be; that though we may die, and lie
down in the dust, our desires may live and lie in Heaven, and cry <hi>come Lord.</hi> Now
do not think this point true, and so far good if we could reach it, but this is a
high pitch, for you must long for it. God forbid a Christian espoused to Christ,
should plead that work too much, which Hypocrites, <hi>the five foolish Virgins</hi> in
their kind attained to. See Presidents for this in all ages: <hi>Abraham,</hi> and those
in his time, who was <hi>Father of the Faithful,</hi> Heb. 11. 15, 16. <hi>A better Countrey,</hi>
where they might have fellowship with the Lord, and <hi>hence God is not ashamed,</hi> &amp;c.
As if the Lord were ashamed of all them to be his people, that professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so, but desire not this. In Christ's time, <hi>Simeon,</hi> Luke 2. 29. with 25.
Where <hi>he waited for the consolation of Israel,</hi> &amp;c. to enjoy more of him. In the
Apostles time, 'tis also that which they all felt, 2 Cor. 5. 2. <hi>In this we groan ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,</hi>
&amp;c. But you will say, It may be this was because of miseries, and want
of Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore see in the last age of the Church, when the new
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> was built, and when peace, and when Christ's face was seen in his
House, yet then <hi>the Spirit and the Bride say come, Rev.</hi> 22. 17. They are the last

                  <p n="1">1 BEcause they are bound to love Christ and his appearing:<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> to love his looks
when he shall appear to the world, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. The <hi>Crown of Glory</hi> comes
as it were by succession, not only to me, but to <hi>all them that love his appearing.</hi> Now
can there be any love of him and his appearing; and not so much as any desire after
him and after it? Certainly there is no love, or if there be any, it lies languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
For answerable to our love to any thing, is our desire, what we love only,
we desire only; what we love not at all, or but little, we desire not at all, or
but little; so here. Now therefore to question, May a Christian desire it? is to
question whether a Christian ought to love the Lord Jesus or no. We are bound
not to love earth, hence bound to love Christ and his fellowship in Heaven. <hi>Let
him be Anathema</hi> that doth not so.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the Lord Jesus longs for them,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note>

should desire them, but because he freely loves them, and dearly loves them, as
being given him of the Father, and as having cost him dear; and hence if he
loves them, he longs for them: Now if he longs for them, ought not they much
more to long for him? Psal. 27. 8. <hi>Thou saidst seek my face, thy face Lord will I
seek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He longs for thee now in Glory, when one would think his thoughts and
heart should be swallowed up with it, and shall not we long for him here in the
valley of Myrtle trees, in misery, on the dunghill?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He longs for thee when thou hast nothing to make him desire thee, he hath
all that thy heart can desire, being the very bosom-delight of God himself, <hi>Rev.</hi>
22. <hi>penult.</hi> He did but say he would come, and <hi>Iohn</hi> desires, Oh come. But
doth he long for thee? Now not to long for him. If this love be not worth long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p n="3">3. Because this is our last and ultimate end that we are made for,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> chosen for,
bought for, called for, sealed for, that at last we might be with the Lord, and
be made perfect in one, 2 Cor. 5. 5. <hi>He that hath made us for this is God,</hi> &amp;c.
For the whole Trinity enjoying infinite sweet fellowship with himself, hence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it might be communicated, in Christ 'tis so, and now the last end is attained.
Now if this be our last end, ought we not to desire it? Then we ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be blessed, nor to desire the Lord may be glorified. Nay you know that
whatever we make our last end, it will swallow up all our desires after any other
thing. This is the Center and rest and journies end of our tired weary spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
And the truth is, when we make it our last end, we cannot but desire
it.</p>

                  <p>BUT ought not a man to desire to live here in this world as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
did.<note place="margin">Object.</note> May not one sin in this desire?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis true, <hi>precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> not only in
regard that they are as precious to him when they come to die, as while they live,
as Gold when 'tis melting is as precious to the Goldsmith, as when whole, and
it may be more too, because 'tis then made better; but also because he will not
lightly cast away their lives. He that bottles their tears, and will not let them be
lost, will not easily let go their lives, and if God will not, they ought not upon
every slight occasion to desire their death, and losse of their lives to be with the
Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two cases Gods own people may not desire to remove hence,
where though there be some fire I confesse, yet there is more smoak than fire, more
sin than Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In case they meet with much unkindnesse from, and many sorrows in the
world, and behold the sins of it. Thus it was with <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 4. Who
when <hi>Iezabel</hi> threatned his life, fled, and would needs set sail presently and be
gone; so 'tis with Gods people, when they see enemies without, the universal
rot of Profession, that they think they are almost left alone; when God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to do good by them, as by <hi>Elijah,</hi> but they think their best daies are past, there
is all they shall do, and God himself it may be meeting them with some crosses
in this world; now presently they grow weary of their lives, and desire to die,
which is nothing else but a pang of discontent, truly God will not suffer it, nor
you ought not to desire it, to die away in such a snuffe: No, the Lord hath work
for them to do, and a journey to go. This desire is naught, and 'tis but a weed,
and to be pulled up, that growes out of such a root as a discontented heart for
crosses. I confesse God useth sorrows as means to smoak us out of our Hive, and
we may use them for that end, but not only or chiefly them, nor from a pang or
moody fit of discontent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In case they desire death, and not life, before they be ripe for death. Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
desire their Corn in, but 'tis folly to desire it before it be ripe, and
then they may. I confesse 'tis the commendation of some trees, if not only good,
but if ripe betimes, and 'tis the honour of a Christian, to be ripe for death betimes;
yet still before he is ripe he is not to desire it.</p>
                  <p>Now when is this?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. While the Lord hides his face and denies full assurance of his love,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> in this
case as a Christian cannot, so he ought not (if it were the Lords will) desire to be
gone as yet, and this is one reason why <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> desired life, not
death as yet, God had broken their bones, and his arrowes were yet in their
hearts; now a man is to desire he may stay a little while longer, that he may
<hi>sing the Song of the Lamb,</hi> and tell the world <hi>what the Lord hath done for him,</hi> and
that he may not set in a cloud and die in horrour. Mariners long to be on shore,
but before they come there, they would not venture in a mist, but see
Land first, so should we desire to see the Lord in the Land of the living. Nay
though the Lord gives his people a promise, which staies their hearts and is a twig to
keep them from sinking, nay when he gives them some joy, yet still God hath
promised to reveal more of himself and his Christ in the promise, seeing him but
darkly now: Now they ought not to desire but wait, as in <hi>Simeons</hi> case, <hi>now let
thy Servant depart in peace,</hi> having long <hi>waited for the consolation of Israel.</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that will be up before 'tis day must be whipt, a rod is most fit for them, stay
till 'tis day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. While their work remains unfinished, and the Lord hath got little or no
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40159:56"/>
Glory from them, though they may have clear evidence of the Lords love:
Christ himself desired it not till now, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 5. If thou couldest scale Heaven
before thy work was done, the Lord would send thee down from thence again, as
he did the soul of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>zarus,</hi> and truly to do the work of Christ one moment here,
is better than to have a thousand years felicity in Heaven, nakedly considered in
it self, in as much as the Honour of Christ is a thousand times better than our
own good. It may be there is much work within doors, many odd distempers
to be cashierd, spirituall decaies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may be there is work without, Christ
hath many enemies in the world, many prayers are yet to be spent against them,
much good to do for his Church, many tears to be shed for them, for praying
trade is past in Heaven. It may be some friends yet to be converted, thou hast
been a scandal to them, it may be as yet few have been, or can say they be the
warmer or better for thee; that work is yet to be done: It may be God hath
some secrets to reveal by thee before thou diest, stay therefore a while, while your
work is done; 'Tis true, thou hast but one Talent, but little thou hast or canst
do; yet God looks you should improve it whilst he is gone. A man that will
needs to bed at noon-day, before night comes, what deserves he but a cudgel?
So he that will die before his night comes, and while 'tis light to see and work by.
When therefore you apprehend your work even done, then as not only Christ,
but <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>l,</hi> not only <hi>Paul,</hi> but Gods watchful servants have secret warnings of
death. And as Mariners when they can see no Land, yet by their soundings can tell
they are near Land or Sands, then you may desire it, for then you are ripe, but its sin
to do it otherwise. And verily happy is that man that accounts not his life dear,
but only the finishing of his course with joy. To conclude all, we are to desire
our fellowship with Christ, as a man desires his last end, which desire doth not
exclude but include desire after all the means and the means first, before the end.
Now many things are to be done by God upon us, and by us for the Lord again,
before we appear before Christ, which we may desire firstly for this our last
end.</p>

when his desires are lavisht and let out to other things, How can he lay out any

they are running in another channel, and spent on other things: What a heavy
curse is this? Some never think of death once in a Moon, much lesse long for
Christ; desire not his fellowship here, much lesse there. And why? Because
of their lusts that eat out all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppose they do not thus, but your heart is divided, so that you long for
these things now, and preserve your longing for him against you come to die; yet
these will make you lose his sweet fellows<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

things, and 'tis pity any else should have them, they are all little enough for
Christ, and Christ is worth desiring and longing for, and he stands upon it, and
will make them know that have him, that all is too little for him, and they shall
give him all before he give himself to their comfort. Hence deny him these, and
never think to have himself, and his fellowship, Psal. 73. 25, 26. <hi>Its good for me
to draw nigh,</hi> How? By desiring, not Earth nor Heaven, but him. Hence he
saith, <hi>Thou destroyest all them that go a whoring from thee,</hi> v. 27.</p>

<hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 10, 11. Dost not find a strangenesse between Christ and thy soul? Doth
he not hide his face? Doth he not soon depart from thee, though he appears
somtimes to thee? Doth he not let thee lie like a Broom behind the door? And
doth little by thee either within or without. And is not this a sad and heavy
thing? Why saist thou, doth the Lord deal thus with me? Oh thy heart is yet
after thy Fathers house, if thou didst forget it, then he would <hi>take pleasure in

desire a creature, or any pleasure in it; but to desire it for it self, and forplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
sake. For now a man makes a god of it. Thus it was with the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
Exod. 17. <hi>Give us water that we may drink;</hi> so give me sleep that I may rest, give
me cloaths that I may be warm, give me estate that I may be rich, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now
when a heart desires them, but his desires end not there, but run through them
to Christ, that he flings down all comforts, and saith what is this to fellowship
with Christ: Thus far a man may desire and rejoyce in them, and 'tis a sin to
do otherwise. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 35. A man may be content to have a Spring run
through his ground to the Sea, to be swallowed up there, but to swell, and rise,
and overslow his ground and house, that's not safe, he may be drowned so: So
men come to be drowned in their lusts, that let them swell within doors.</p>
                  <p>II. A man may desire the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, if he doth not spend more desire upon them than
they be worth. A man may desire them for a good end as he thinks, but then he
laies out too much upon them. A man may spend too much in his Inne, when
he takes it up only as a way to his home.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are perishing things, therefore let them have perishing desires. <hi>The
world passeth away.</hi> They are passengers by us, that stay to rest with us for a time,
let them have passengers welcome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are not necessary things, let them have therefore indifferent desires:
I must have Christ, and his Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not these things: They are to be
sought not in the first, but in the second place. Therefore say first Christ, now
let me have Christ: Men say now these things, then Christ. I say now the
Lord Jesus, whether ever you have them or no.</p>
                  <p>III. Now all superfluity of evil desires are to be crucified, Gal. 5. 24. <hi>They that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40159:57"/>
are in Christ, have crucified,</hi> &amp;c. Christ was not a dead, but first a crucified
Christ before: So no Saint living, but he hath some superfluous desires, but though
they live, they do crucifie them, so ought you. There is two things in crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is extream pain upon the Cross.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A looking for death: So then lusts are crucified,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When you tast the bitternesse of your lusts, by putting them on Christs
Crosse. Oh the wrongs they have done the Son of God! And do this with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
say, you shall to the Crosse, he that looks to Christ with a frolick heart to
kill his lusts, shall never find him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now looking and longing for their death, by holding them there. Unless
the Blood of Christ slay these, I will never have any death for them. For all the
reason in the world will never kill a lust, no more than all the reason will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the Stomach not to hunger. The Belly hath no ears.</p>
                  <p>Thus you are to moderate your desires after these things: Which I speak
of,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Because 'tis a wilderness-sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 14, 15. Which it may be you
feel brings leannesse on your soul. And</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because 'tis the sin of prosperity and peace which God hath given us,
which will grow up and choak the Word, that all Ordinances and Truths will in
time be saplesse, savourlesse things unto us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because I have had strong fears lately of some unexpected trials among
us, and I should be glad if it might not be, if the freedom from them might make
us better, else I say let them come. But</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because 'tis a rare thing among us to see such burning Lamps as look
and long for Christs coming, which when I consider, though there be other causes,
yet one great one is this, Oh the heart is gone away by violent lusts after these
things here! Oh therefore take heed of them! And therefore consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You shall have Christ and his fellowship, if indeed you long for him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.
10. That's his love, you are not so desirous, but he is a thousand times more
Thou maist desire these things, and if God loves thee misse of them. God will
make thee poor when thou wouldst be rich, base when thou wilt be honoured, and
when you would have honey, he will give you stings; and cause you have to thank
the Lord too, that he will not give you your portion here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>u hast them, and dost desire them, and God gives them, and thou
lettest Christ go, thou hadst better a thousand times be without them, Psal, 78. 30,
31. <hi>The meat was in their mouths, and the wrath of God came upon them.</hi> If the
Lord gives thee Christ, happy for ever; if these things when thou dost so desire
them, oh wo for ever!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Fellowship of the Lord Jesus thou shalt never lose. Death shall not
part thee from that, nothing shall rob thee of that; but look after and long for
these things, they will perish and die away. <hi>All flesh is grasse, the Word of the
Lord,</hi> and the Lord himself much more <hi>endureth for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Why dost desire these things? For some sweet in them. Why is not all
that in the presence of the Lord Jesus, and enjoying him? <hi>It pleaseth the Father
that in him should all fulnesse dwell,</hi> so that thou shalt drink as out of a pure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all that is there. If there be any sweetnesse here, he gave it, 'tis much
more eminently in himself, Exod. 24. 11. <hi>They saw the God of Israel, and
eat and drank.</hi> Had they meat up with them? Oh no. But the sight of him was
meat and drink and all unto them. As therefore you desire Christs fellowship,
Oh long no more after these things here!</p>
                  <p>Hence see death is not to be feared,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> but desired of all Saints. It was an odd
speech of a Heathen, <hi>'Tis ill to desire death, and worse to fear it;</hi> he meant not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of any good in it, but because we must die: But death brings us into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40159:57"/>
Fellowship with the Lord Jesus. It doth Saints more good than all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
all afflictions, (wherein we complain we can get no good) than all
means. It brings us into his Fellowship, 1. Quickly, as Christ was caught up,
so the Soul by Christ to himself. 2. Immediatly, for the next thing we shall
see is Christ himself, our Husband himself, and then see the Kingdom, and then
wonder at the Lord. 3. Everlastingly, never to part more. Oh fear it not
therefore, Christ hath sweetned it to you.</p>

in his Ordinances you may meet with him now. And truly those whom we love
and long for, if we cannot go to their house, or find them at home, we are glad
to meet with them abroad. As with those who stand before Princes, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

the Countrey, Nay on the Dunghil. Oh the Spirit of <hi>David!</hi> Psal. 27. 4.

<hi>David?</hi> Is it to wear the Crown in <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> Is it to have all thine enemies

through all the Kingdomes of the world? No, but <hi>that I may dwell in the Courts

presently, and so go to see his Glory in Heaven, therefore that I may see his
Beauty here, enjoy him here, and that not for some years, but all the daies of
my life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ought you not to long to tast and passe through the sorrows of death, that
you may be with him? And are Christs Ordinances more bitter than death,
that you are loath to break through the difficulty of them, that in them you may
enjoy him? The truth is so 'tis with many a man, that such is the strength of his
hidden contempt of Christ, and his love to his sloath, that he had rather die than
pray, and be damned eternally than to follow the Lord in an Ordinance till he
hath found him graciously. How come Gods own people to lament this, if there
were not this?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I remember a sweet speech of one with God, <hi>That a Christian ought to prepare
for a Sacrament as he would prepare to die, for,</hi> saith he, <hi>there is but this difference, when

we die we go to him. Now ought you to long when you are absent from him to
be with him, and will you not care for him, nor long to see him and enjoy him
when he comes to you? And so be worse than poor naked <hi>Indians,</hi> Christ comes
not to them, no dews fall down on their <hi>Gilboahs,</hi> no Manna at their Tent doors, and

Ordinances now. <hi>You have followed me in the regeneration,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.
28. therefore <hi>you shall sit with me upon Thrones.</hi> If Christs presence here, a little
of himself be burdensom, What will it be in Heaven then? <hi>Depart from me,</hi> saith

water, with a little of himself here, and you care not for him, long not after him,
and hence let all leak out again, How shall the Lord trust you with wine? with
full fruition of himself in Heaven?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Oh Beloved have you ever found him in his Ordinances? If not, Oh the
heavy wrath of the Lord Jesus upon thee: If you have, if ever he hath comforted
thee when sad and sorrowful, if ever quickned thee when death and darknesse did
lie upon thee, if ever he did deliver thee when distressed, Oh then take heed of
despising him in his Ordinances now, but long for him again, <hi>That I may see
thee as I have seen thee, Psal.</hi>63. 2. Let them that never found him, deal so with
him. <hi>Peter</hi> when he saw Christs Glory on the Mount, <hi>Lord</hi> saith he, '<hi>tis good for
us to be here.</hi> Hath the Lord ever transfigured himself before thee, so as he hath
appeared in another manner to thee in his Ordinances than ever thou sawest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Then say, seeing Lord I cannot come to Heaven to thee, 'tis good being
in the Mount, in thy Ordinances with thee, its good being here, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4.
I know Brethren you have many employments in the world, and are called away
to them, and cannot ever be with the Lord, yet let your longings be there, nay
though cast out of Gods sight, yet look to the Temple; this will give you
peace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This if I may have leave to speak plainly, is the great sin, one of them, of
<hi>New-England.</hi> Men come over hither for Ordinances, and when they have them
neglect them; or if it be too horrible to live in a grosse neglect of them, yet
who maintains his Fellowship with Christ? or longing after the Fellowship of
Christ in them? And therefore I shall stay a while on this point. Men that
are sick of consumptions have somtimes a mighty stomach after meat, and when
'tis brought them, they are weary of the very smell of it, and then say, truly I
had thought I could have eaten so much; so men loath Ordinances, nay the
Cooks that dresse, and the Dish that brings, and the Ministry of Christ Jesus
that provides the meat, because consuming and pining away in their iniquities.
I know many use Ordinances, but are they not indifferent whether they find him
therein or no? Now,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When men had enough by them to live comfortably upon, then God and
his Ordinances were desired by them, but here mens removing begetting want,
want of the creature joyned with fear and distrust of Gods Providence to provide
for them and theirs, either sink their hearts, that Ordinances are not sweet, no
more than <hi>Moses</hi> message to a people in anguish, or meat to a wounded man; or
else makes them hungry after the creature, and hence lavishing out their desires,
that they have none after the Lord himself.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When men are persecuted by enemies, driven into corners, or to Townes
six miles off to find a Sacrament, or hear a Sermon, then the Gospel of peace,
and them that brought the glad tidings of peace, their feet were beautiful, and
then men thought if one Sabbath here so sweet where Ordinances are much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
if some of them be so comfortable in the midst of enemies, Oh how sweet
to enjoy them all among Saints, among Friends? And so I know they be
to some, and I hope to more than I know; but <hi>New-Englands</hi> peace and plenty of
means breeds strange security; and hence prayer is neglected here: There are
no enemies to hunt you to Heaven, nor no chains to make you cry; hence the
Gospel and Christ in it is sleighted. Why? Here are no soure herbs to make
the Lamb sweet. And if I get no good this Sabbath, this Sermon, this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
this Prayer, I hope I shall some other time, when my heart is better, and my
businesse is over: Not considering that the daies of trouble may be near, or Gods
final farewel may be quickly taken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was a sad speech of a Brother lately, which hath oft affected me, <hi>that a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40159:58"/>
man may pray out, hear out all the Grace of his heart:</hi> Meaning this, when God
begins to work upon a mans heart at first, then prayer and Word is sweet, stay a
while they hear out their hearing, and pray out their praying, so as in praying,
they pray not; and in hearing, they hear not! Would to God there were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a generation of those men among us, that having been so oft Sermon-trod and
Prayer-beaten, that now their hearts are hardned, and being used to Ordinances,
and being so long ridden under them, I wish they were not tired, and jaded under
them before they come half way home, that they had rather lie &amp; die in the high
way, than get up and with mighty groans and invincible wrastlings of heart seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so find the Lord in them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is no place in all the world, where there is such expectation to find
the Lord, as here, and hence men blesse the Lord for our rising Sun, when 'tis set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
every where else: Here therefore they come and find it not, hence not
considering the great and last temptation of this place, whereby God tries his
friends before he will trust them with more of himself, <hi>viz.</hi> deep and frequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions,
they give in, and therefore care not for, nor desire after those

them not. 'Tis strange to see what a Faith some men have that can close
with Christ as their end, and comfort themselves there; 'tis not means (say
they) but Christ, not duties but Christ, and by this Faith can comfort and quiet
themselves in the neglect and contempt of Christ in means, as infallible a brand
of Gods eternal reprobation of such a soul as any I know. So that this is <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
sin. Is not Prayer neglected, wanting place and heart? if not in family,
is it not in secret? so that you have none, nor poor servants have none. If any
Prayer in secret, yet doth it not die? Didst ever find thy Spirit so straitned?
Where are the mighty groans? What is become of meditation? Dost not let

in an Ordinance, when by all the light and life and comfort there, he comes to
see him, and sees them all in him, and seeing a transcendent Glory in him, sees
and beholds a hidden Glory in them. This Command is a secret of Jesus, this
Promise the sweet voice of Jesus, these Consolations the comforts of Jesus, these
Messengers the Ministers of Jesus, these Ordinances the Kingdom of Jesus. And
therefore look throughout all the Scriptures, you shall see our Fellowship with
Christ both in Heaven and here, 'tis exprest by <hi>seeing of the Lord, Iohn</hi> 17. 24.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 2. &amp; 27. 4. I have oft said to my friends, the great sin of Christians is
to see Scriptures, Ordinances, Truths, Commands, Blowes, Kindnesses, as
not flowing from and abiding in the Lord Jesus, to see them separate from
Christ, and not Christ and them together. And hence Promises comfort not,
because you receive them not as spoken by Jesus: Commands awe not, because
not as the voice of Jesus: Every Truth is not dear, because you see it not as the
Bridegrooms voice. Parents that have had rude children, have turned them out
of doors, they themselves have sent them money and cloaths in pity, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have not been seen, that they might seek for a Fathers face at last: So
when God is angry with some of his people, he doth send to them in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
and Ordinances, because he pities them, but himself is not seen. Why?
That at last they might come home, and seek to see his face again, and say, What
good does all this do me, if I see no God? I confesse he that receives gifts from
another, ought to be thankful; but a heart that loves and longs after the Lord,
will say, here is Blessing, Means, Truth, Warmth, but Lord when wilt thou
come thy self? Oh labour for this!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When a man feels the power of the Lord Jesus in his Ordinances; this is
the second part of <hi>Davids</hi> desire, Psal. 63. 2, 3. <hi>That I may see</hi> not only thy Glory,
but <hi>thy power,</hi> for there is never a child of God but feels a strong party within him
against Christ, so that he cannot seek Christ, cleave to Christ, live to Christ,
now you will find in some Ordinances your hearts shaken and troubled for sin, and
some desires and consolations stirred up, and hopes never to be as you have been:
But Beloved all dies and falls down again: Now I confesse there is somwhat of
Christ in all this; but yet content not your selves with this, because you want
a power, or until you find a might power of Christ by little and little subduing
sin, for when Christ comes into the heart indeed, he comes with his power,
Psal. 24. 7, 8. <hi>The Lord of Hosts mighty in Battel. His flesh is meat indeed, Col.</hi> 1.
29. Christs power works in a man mightily. If you enjoy never such comfort,
but find not a power pulling down thy lusts, there is no Christ. If a man be sick,
and he eats his meat, and great care be had to tend him, but the disease is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the strength of nature and food; ask him, Do you eat? Yes, but it doth
me no good; So here: Such comfort, such a Christ doth you no good, unlesse
you feel a power. Oh long to meet Christ, and enjoy Christ thus!</p>
                  <p>How shall I do this?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Mourn bitterly for the Lords absence as for one of the greatest evils that can
befall thee.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> For Christs presence will never be sweet to him that can live without
him, and can you look for him then? John 16. 22. <hi>You have now sorrow, which</hi>

therefore its noted, the first that had comfort was <hi>Mary,</hi> when she sate at the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher
weeping, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 11, &amp;c. And therefore do but observe your own
hearts, when your hearts have been soaked in grief, for want of or for the absence
of Christ, Oh I have lived without him, and prayed without him, and heard
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40159:59"/>

shall not Heaven be sweet to you without him, and shall earth be sweeter than
Heaven, that you can live here without him? Beloved, whatever you account of
it now, in Hell the sting of all sorrowes shall be this, Oh Christ hides his face?
One frown shall be more bitter than death, than a thousand deaths, and shall it
be so in Hell, and shall not many frowns, many daies be more bitter than death?
Shall it be so to Devils, and not to Saints? Shall the hiding of Christs face from
enemies be heavy, and shall not his friends take it to heart? If you do not, then
think not to meet him, but that Word and Prayer shall be dead drink to thee;
but if you do, I tell thee if he manifests himself to any, he will reveal himself to
thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prize and love his presence, his face, the lifting up of the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
Princes will not come, or if they do, not stay, if they perceive their
company is a burden, and is not esteemed; no more will the Lord Jesus. They
that are fallen in love together will find out each other though it be at midnight;
prize Christs company, and you will not complain for want of time, and say you
cannot, but you will find him out in Word, in prayers, though others be fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep,

do not come to it that you may be comforted in your sin, so that though there be

                  <p n="5">5. Oh be thankful, and cleave the closer to Christ for a little: For that's the
infinite mercy and love of Christ to his people, he lets them see their end, the
height of Grace and Glory the Lord will bring them to, but makes them feel the
want of it, and tast but a little, but the first-fruits. Now there is Satans policy to
make them sleight what they have, because they have not what they would have.
Hence Christ estrangeth himself greatly; Do you thus despise my love; Oh
therefore cleave close to him for that little, and then see, John 1. 50. <hi>Thou
shalt see greater things than these, the Son of God, and Angels ascending and descending
on him.</hi> Think that I feel or have the sense of any want of Grace, and peace,

God will never cease pouring out on thee, that art pouring out praises on him;
for else mans kindnesse should exceed the Lords.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see the Means, now use them, and long for the Lord Jesus in them,
and so long as that you may meet him; and do it presently, else you may seek and
not find him, and <hi>die in your sins, Iohn</hi> 8. 21. A sad and heavy speech. Hath
God singled you out of all people in the world to enjoy him, and will you now
forsake him, and be eaten up with your Lots, and buried in the bellies of your

                  <p>FRom this Second verse to the Fifth there is set down the difference appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between the Virgins, wherein the Lord the searcher of hearts, makes an
open discovery of the particular estates of these Virgins, for all the best
Churches especially to take notice of, to the second coming of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.
This difference is set down,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Generally, in this second verse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Particularly, in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verses.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That some of them were sincere and wise-hearted to the number of five.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others of them were foolish and false-hearted to the number of five more.
So that the summe is this, one half of them were indeed Virgins, another half
were in appearance Virgins; the one part were Virgins in the sight of God, who
saith they are wise; the other were so in the judgment of man, and hence called
foolish ones. In this general description therefore of them, we may note,</p>

but <hi>five were wise</hi> and <hi>five were foolish:</hi> Why the Virgins are described by the
number of ten, Ispake before, either because it was a perfect number, and so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the estate of all Virgin-Churches; or because it was the custom not to
exceed the number of Ten, to honour them at their Marriage. Now why five
of them were wise, and five foolish, as though the one half of them only were
sincere, the other false, this seems to carry the face of Truth; but I am fearful
to rack &amp; torment Parables, wherein I chiefly look unto the scope, and that is this,
that not one or two but a great part of them were sincere, and a great part of them
false. And hence the Observations out of these words are these, omitting all the

                  <p>This I might manifest out of several Scriptures, from several times. Look but

the wise-hearted could not discern and keep out, but opened the door for the five
foolish. Look as 'tis said, Job 1. 6. <hi>There was a day the Sons of God presented

that is beyond his reach; hence he seeks to make Heaven on earth unclean; hence
he will get into Paradise, and if he cannot come in the shape of a man, yet in that
of a Serpent to beguile and pollute innocency there: He will follow Christ into
the wildernesse, and tempt him there, and hence will seek to get into
Churches, to pollute them. And if he cannot pollute the Church by unclean

If there be a Devil in the Church, he will sow his ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Look as 'tis Jesuits policy at this day, the end of their Order is to raise up the
collapsed ruines of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to bring all Christendom (and if it be possible all
the world) to the Hellish bondage and blind obedience of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
Hence some Kingdomes, because they cannot conquer them by power, they seek to
do it by craft; hence they seek to lay their Leaven and make their party within,
from whom they may have intelligence, and hence they shall do well enough with
them: So Satan seeking the ruine of the Church, seeks to make his party within
the Church, for one of these three ends chiefly.</p>

1. Either that he may divide the Church, that when any Errour shall be
hatched, he may have his party to maintain it, and his faction to plead for it. Or</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he may corrupt it, if he cannot divide it, that the Tares may suck out the
heart and life and power of Godlinesse in the hearts of the Elect; for you know
'tis not the Briar but the Iv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

prophane pricking persecutors, but seeming friends to the Church, that suck out
the heart and life of it. It was not <hi>Ieroboams</hi> greatnesse, but the old Prophets
gravity and seeming Piety that suckt out the Spirit and Sap of the young Prophet,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. That so by this little Leaven he may defile the whole lump, and so
provoke wrath against them all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If he cannot do either, yet that he may blur and stain the Glory of the
Church: For the greatest Glory in the world is to see a Temple built, not of sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

of Gold or Pearl, but of living precious Saints, holy to the Lord only and his
Son, and the sight of which in Heaven shall be one part of the Glory in Heaven.
Hence Satan will do what he can to blur it; that though the greatest Glory God
hath, shines in his Church, yet that he may blur it: And hence <hi>Iude</hi> saith, <hi>Some that

                  <p>Secondly, Because some are very serviceable to his Church, and so to Christ, as
<hi>Caput politicum,</hi> both in regard of outward means of subsistance, and also with edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
gifts: hence into his Family he will let them come, being servants, and like

Gospellers that cry down all their own righteousnesse, and cry up Christ, and see
nothing in themselves, as there is good cause so to think, and look for all from
Christ, and yet these when the Lord comes to search are found false; and these
are the worms that grow in this wood, in this building, in these Churches. Thus
it was in Christs time, the Church of the Jews had left their grosse idolatries, yet
this was their stumbling-stone, they sought to establish their own righteousnesse,
and hence he came to his own, and his own received him not, and hence were cut
off for this their unbelief, but others (divers sorts of them) did receive him, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 23. Many took hold on Christ, and he took no hold on them,
wondred at him, and entertained him when others did reject him, as <hi>Capernaum</hi>
did, yet under his woe. And these are the spots of Evangelical purity, wenns in
the best bodies of the best constituted Churches. Look but upon Christs own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
<hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 69, 70. The Disciples professed when others departed, <hi>Lord, to
whom should we go? thou hast words of life;</hi> yet saith he, <hi>I have chosen you indeed to
be for me, but one is a devil,</hi> viz. <hi>Iudas</hi> the Deacon stood not on his own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but was for Christ, and followed him, and yet in this Evangelical Angel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
is a Devil within, because he still harboured his lusts within. This the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> fore-saw, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29, 30. Some Wolves without should come, and also some
cankers within should fret, that should draw many Disciples after them (in a Church
bought by Christs own blood) <hi>speaking perverse things,</hi> pretending to draw Disciples
after Christ, but 'tis indeed after themselves; and <hi>Paul</hi> laments this, <hi>Many walk,</hi> i. e.
professe Christ and his Crosse, <hi>yet enemies to it, Phil.</hi> 3. 19. This Christ fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
<hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25, 26. Many seek, many knock, and at last cry <hi>Lord, Lord open,</hi> and
in their life-time they pleaded communion with Christ, yet <hi>Depart ye workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.

that is the very form of an Evangelical hypocrite, in denying his own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to establish his sin, 'tis advancing Christ to advance his Lust. The Epistles
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40159:66"/>
of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are antidotes against this kind of poyson, and I look on them as

to that end, and it coming with power and light, it would be too grosse for Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
to maintain life by Works: hence Christs is that which they look unto; for
Christ when he preached, not only many <hi>believed because of his Miracles,</hi> but
<hi>when they heard his Word, Iohn</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. In the Parable of the Sower, the
Word came with much power, that they received it with joy, and did believe, but
fell by their Lusts. And look as 'tis with the Sun, there comes light and heat with

                     </gap>nesse of the Gospel to the heart, that men hearing
and seeing Salvation wrapt up there, Oh that is sweet and good! and hence their
affections and hearts are in some measure conquered by the power of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dazeling
truth, and hence Hypocrites being thus conquered, partly being of this
opinion, partly tasting some good of it, desire it out of self-love, expect it out of
self-delusion, and professe themselves Virgins out of these Principles.</p>
                  <p>In regard of power of Evangelical examples in the five wise Virgins:<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> for
look as 'tis with living men when the Sun shines upon their heads, they cast their
shadows that follow them; so when the Lord Jesus shines upon the souls of his
own people, almost every honest sincere-hearted man will cast his shadow that
will be like him; hence Hypocrites in those Churches which are commonly rather
led by example than by rule, will be very like them, and imitate them: if they
should not, what communion could they have with them, or what love could they
receive from them? for there is a mighty power in eminent examples to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
Hypocrites, that if they will turn themselves into any form, they must into
theirs, as in <hi>Ioash:</hi> for there are two things in the carriage of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a condemning power in it; hence men fear to live unlike
them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a winning vertue in it, an attractive vertue; hence men endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be and live like them, to be of the same mind, the same heart with them:
and hence others take them, and they take themselves to be sincere, and hence
they are Evangelical Gospel Hypocrites that lye hid in these Churches: Hence
<hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>Many shall take hold of a Iews skirt</hi> (I doubt not but some false
ones,) <hi>we have heard God is with you.</hi> And as Christ when lifted up and risen, so
Saints draw Hypocrites to them.</p>
                  <p>Because the Gospel brings the greatest and sweetest consolations with it.<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> Hence
a man under the terrour of the Law, and sence of curse for his sin, will make his
last refuge hither, and hide himself under the wing of the Gospel, not so much out
of love to Christ, or Gospel, but because they serve his turn, and give him ease.

Therefore here you shall find them disclaim all Works, and cry up Grace only;
where the purest Churches are, there are usually great awakenings, there God is
very near men, and made most manifest to mens consciences, and there are most
soul-plagues, contempt of the Spirit of Grace, and hence most dreadful torments
of conscience, and fearful lookings for of Judgement. Now hence it comes to
passe when Christ is offered, and general notice given to mens minds, that yet there
is hope and mercy for great sinners, this fills them with joy and peace, as <hi>Iohns</hi>

all, say they, and hence if Christ do drop upon their hearts, well and good, if
not, 'tis Christs fault, he is a hard Master that gathers where he did not sow, and
hence wrap it up. A mans false heart is weary of the yoke of Christ, and hence
would fain be eased of it. Now the Gospel promiseth libe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but because they are free from the power of it. Its an old deceit, yet subtil, to
rejoyce, and love, and blesse Christ, because he will pardon sin, though I lie and
live in them. Or if they do not free themselves from it, the Gospel shews the
Law within closing with the Law without, to be an evidence the Lord will not
impute it, and that 'tis not therefore they, but sin in them. Hence a sloathful
heart will continue in his sloath, and to ease himself of trouble for sin and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

imagine and set before our eyes the amazing condition of such a man! whose
plagues shall be made wonderfull, that hath been troubled with sin a long time,
at last looks to Christ, and there rests, and so hears all Sermons, and there still
sleeps, and considers often that his waies are evil, but never suspects his Faith to

dies, and Sun sets, and darknesse approacheth, and then suddenly slips into Hell,
where he sees Christ and Saints afar off: And what hath deceived them? Oh their
Faith hath deceived them, to see Christ shaking them off as dust: Oh they wish,
Oh that I had known or feared this before! and will you not fear now? as for
you prophane ones that can scoff, and drink, and break Sabbaths, and live idly, your

dispute no more. Satan comes to <hi>Eve,</hi> and bids her eat, no, God forbid, yet eat

Take the truth from what the Word saith, and depart not from it.</p>
                  <p>III. Here see the dreadful estate of all them that be found false-hearted in the
purest Churches,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and that in these three respects.</p>
                  <p>First, That they should so horribly forsake and blaspheme the Name of God, to
make the glorious Gospel of God, and all the sweet Doctrines of Grace a cover for
their hypocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

found out in their sins, but now they are beyond the discovery of all men, or
means.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That they should be so lamentably forsaken of God, as to be left,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To the most subtil and spiritual Hypocrisie in the world, which being most
crosse to God, shall receive most fierce and searching wrath. For as Divines say
of Christ, he was forsaken in Soul, because man had sinned with his Soul: so Gods
wrath will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>earch deep in their hearts, whose hearts have guilefully departed from
the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he should lead them so far, and yet in the main forsake them; Oh this
is heavy wrath, for a man to be lead in the day-light of the Gospel, almost to the
end of his journey, and at last the Sun sets, and he left to wilder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:40159:68"/>
Thirdly, In regard of the cries of the very Gospel it self against them. Oh that the
precious Gospel of God coming with so much Peace, Love, Grace, mercy, should
win them to be Hypocrites, but never to be Friends. Beloved as there is vengeance
of the Law, and of the Temple, so there is vengeance of the Gospel when the soul
shall be drawn before the Tribunal of Christ, and shall stand there quaking, all
sins set in order before you, and your mouth shall be stopt. What say you then
for your life? Oh Grace and mercy Lord, Oh now shall the Gospel come forth and
say, all this I did, I spake, I strove, I comforted, I terrified, and yet he hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the Lord, and me, he hath made a cover for all these evils, and therefore
Lord let him never be comforted more, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 19. Oh Christ hath heavy things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
these Times, that take light of the Gospel to see to commit their sin by!
And therefore lament your present estates you that know your selves naught, never
yet drawn to Christ, never yet humbled at the feet of Christ, and look up to the
Lord what-ever misery he inflicts, not to suffer thee to be deceived here; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have such a Faith as may catch hold on Christ, but he on thee, and come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the light to manifest the hidden enmity there. Never was yet man deceived,
but he that was willing to be deceived, that would not use the means, and search.</p>

that he must die, and that he is a most grievous sinner, and that when he hath
done all he is unprofitable, but yet he trusts to Christ, and Gods mercy, and so
believes, he finds no great difficulty in this, nor no great need of the Almighty
power of the Lord to work this, and all men living shall never make him think but
that he doth heartily and truly beleeve: but ask him, have you no doubt of your
estate? and of Christs not taking hold of you when you take hold of him? Yes, but
seeing he hath been troubled about his estate, and repented of his sin (in his fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
and reformed himself and Family, and loves the best things, he believes
without question, and so misapplies promises to himself, never feeling a need of
the revelation and donation of Jesus to him by the Father; and thus the Lord finds
this man a Christ, and this man finds the Lord a Faith, and the Lord Jesus redeems
this man by price, and this man redeems himself by power, and so the Father shall
have some Glory for providing a Saviour, Christ shall have some Glory for paying a
price, and the Spirit of Christ which only can draw to Christ, shall lose his Glory,
and so this man may take it to himself. And is this good think you? <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12.

sweet speech of Christ, <hi>Thy Faith hath saved thee.</hi> Oh heavy when it shall be

the way of death; truly so it will if you do not fetch it out of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>II. Those that do believe,<note place="margin">Sign 2.</note> but they fail in the object, <hi>i. e.</hi> they close with Christ,
but they know not who he is: that as the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> that had some look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> she did worship whom she knew not: so men beleeve in one
whom they know not, only have heard the fame of. For there are two things in
the Gospel. 1. The outward words and letters. 2. The things contained in
those words: Hence there is a double knowledg of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A fantacy knowledg, as a man that hears of any thing absent, presently fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
the thing in his head.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is an intuitive know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> hereby the soul doth not only see words and
fancies, but beholds the things themselves: Hence it comes to passe that many a
man hearing the Fame, and receiving the fancy of Christ, beleeves in him, but not
seeing him indeed as he is, therein he beleeves in one whom he knows not: and
hence the Lord Jesus may be a hid thing to many a man, and the Gospel a sealed
Book, though he lives and remains in the very light of the Sun, and that all his
daies: Hence Christ laments <hi>Ierusalem, Oh that thou hadst known, but now hid, hid;</hi>

the Father:</hi> Many hear, but never learn of the Father; hence never come truly
unto Christ; 'tis in this case as 'tis with a Traytor, he comes to the King for
his life, and prayes for his Sons sake; the King sends for him, and saith, here is
one that beggs for your sake, do you know him? For my sake! I wonder on what
acquaintance, he is a stranger to me, and therefore I regard him not. So
here.</p>
                  <p>III. Those that have some kind of sight of the Object,<note place="margin">Sign 3.</note> and see Christ, but
there is a wound in the subject, because their Faith ariseth and springs out of an
ill soyl, it's in such a party that never was yet throughly rent from his sin, and
here is the great wound of the most cunning Hypocrites living: for there are two
things in him,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A carnal heart, which cannot be satisfied with a spiritual good with Christ;
hence he must have his Lust.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A convinced conscience, which cannot be quieted without Christ and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;

of the world, that you may do, but a swinish nature lasts, that they never

of this, let a man be cast down as low as Hell by sorrow, and lye under your
chains, quaking in apprehension of terrour to come, let a man then be raised up
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40159:69"/>

yet if not rent from Lust, that either you did never see it, or if so, you have
not followed the Lord to remove it, but proud, dogged, wordly, sluggish still,
false in your dealings, cunning in your tradings, Devils in your Families, Images
in your Churches: you are objects of pitty now, and shall be of terror at the great
day, for where sin remains in power, it will bring Faith, and Christ, and joy into
bondage and service of it self.</p>
                  <p>IV. Those that beleeve,<note place="margin">Sign 4.</note> yet fail of saving Faith in regard of the very act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
and closing with Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> they close with Christ, but 'tis without a high
esteem of him, or love to him, they have some, but right Grace consists in a kind
of summity, or excellency, else 'tis not right, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. To you that beleeve he

Birth-right, and never make any thing of it; because the Bond is not strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

                  <p n="3">3. Hence comes all a mans uneven carriage.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hence comes sometimes the unpardonable sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. Many a man
laies claim to Christ and his Blood, and righteousnesse, that never knew the worth
of it; and this is Christs complaint me thinks in Heaven, (and of Saints on earth)
<hi>He comes unto his own, and his own esteem him not,</hi> his own love him not, his
own receive him not: him that is the glory of Heaven, the beauty of the Father,
the delight of Saints, the wonderment of Angels, he I say is not esteemed by
many a man, that in his judgement esteems him, and in his heart doth despise
him. There are two parts of this esteem. 1. To esteem him only, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 44.
2. Him ever and alway, <hi>Psalm</hi> 73. 26. <hi>Thou art my portion for ever,</hi> Many
say they esteem Christ, but to be ever loving him, ever looking on him, this is not
their frame. Oh think of this, fail here of your valuing of him, and you fail every

their end is naught; so that men here may ask and never have, because of their
Lusts: As a man that lies on his death-bed, or in a Sea-storm in fear of Hell, he
may now prize and take hold on Christ to save him. A man lies upon the Bed of
horror of heart, he may prize Christ to comfort him, and getting a conceit of it,
be wrapt up almost in an extacy of joy, that a man would think he was sealed with
the Spirit of Christ, and yet his end being naught, Christ only to comfort him,
misseth of Christ in conclusion; for when a man beleeves indeed, he receives
Christ for the end the Father sent him, <hi>viz.</hi> to be King and Soveraign of the whole
man as well as Saviour. <hi>Psalm</hi> 24. 7. <hi>Open your gates that the King of Glory, &amp;c.</hi>

only the Law, but also the glorious Gospel of the Lord Jesus works in him all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of unrighteousnesse; and 'tis too common for men at the first work of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
oh then to cry for Grace, and Christ, and afterward grow licentious, live
and lye in the breach of the Law, and take their warrant for their course from the
Gospel; I shall not name all the wayes that men do so, but I will only speak that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40159:69"/>
which conscience and compassion moves me to; not to begin, but if possible to
still division, and what I shall speak shall be by way of prevention.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take heed of making Graces in a christian the weaknesses of a christian, for
this is to make darknesse light, and Grace wantonnesse indeed: Is it not? Take
heed then of thinking or saying counterfeit or false Sanctification consists in feeling
something in a mans self, as love to, delight in the Lord and his wayes: True San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
in seeing nothing, no love, no delight: why the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>

nothing: Yes Beloved, know you not Christ is in you (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.) as well as

Indeed to be puft <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>p with Grace, or rest in it is a sin, yet that Grace is not
that sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>d of making weaknesses Graces or Duties: as</p>
                  <p>First, To make poverty of spirit, the sight of nothing in a mans self; why, he
that is poor hath Heaven for his, and so Christ and Promises his, and hath Faith
his, at least some seeds. Now to see nothing now, is to see an untruth, and to
tell a flat lie to God, and Men, and Scripture too. Indeed a man that is poor
doth usually see nothing, but that is his weaknesse, not any Grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To say there is no difference between Graces of Hypocrites and Saints.
Why so? Because I cannot see any. Is this your weaknesse or your wisdom? you
can see no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e, and will you make your weaknesse your Religion?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That a man must not evidence his Justification by his Sanctification, I
speak of that which accompanies Salvation. Why so? Because then there will be
comfort to day, and sorrow to morrow, grant it, but then consider, 1. That is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a mans weaknesse and ignorance that he doth not see it, or 2. his wickednesse
and carelesnesse that hath stained that work: And will you make this a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hed basenesse of heart the foundation of this conceit?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That a man must see no saving work, nor take comfort from any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
until he is sealed: No, why so? Because many tall christians have deceived
themselves so, and deluded themselves there, and been kept off from Christ, and
truly I believe it in part. But what of that? Shall mens weaknesse be my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or work? No Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>oved, for a man beleeves before he is sealed, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 15.
And hence Christ is his, and now for him to deny Christ to be his own, 'tis to
make Christ a lyar, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 10, 12, 13. not that I would have christians content
themselves here (it's a sign you never knew what Christ meant if so you do) till he
shall send a more full gale of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you do account them weaknesses, yet take heed your closing with Christ
do not cause you to make a light matter of sin, either not to take notice of sins at
all, only look to Christ, ('tis not I but sin, as being the act of the outward man: one
calls this to unknow a mans self) or not to be deeply sensible of them, and so use
Christ as your shoe-clout to wipe them off, Oh this is dangerous; the Spirit of
joy never quencheth the Spirit of Sorrow. <hi>Capernaum</hi> entertained Christ, and yet
perished, Oh she repented not! What must we repent after we be in Christ?
Yes, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30. 19. <hi>After I was turned I repented:</hi> It argues a bold conscience,
when men as they look to no good in themselves, so to no sin in themselves, but
wholly to Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Take heed of those Doctrines which in shew lift up Grace, but indeed pull
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> any part of it, as</p>
                  <p>First, to think that the letter of the whole Scripture holds out no more than a
Covenant of Works, a most prodigious Speech, though coloured with advancing a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40159:70"/>
Spiritual Covenant of Grace, and no Word but Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Under a shew of advancing Gods Grace in doing all, to say the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
are not means, but only occasions of conversion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, under a shew of giving all to Grace, to abolish that plain truth, as to
say we are not justified by Faith, which though it be true, not really, <hi>i. e.</hi> not
simply, by Faith in it self considered as a work, yet to say [not relatively, as the
Lord is apprehended by it] it is false. If we cast off the power of the truth, yet
let us not cast off the form of it: keep the form of wholsome words as well as
truths.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Take heed of maintaining that a man until sealed is not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to beleeve, under a shew of letting the Spirit of Grace do all. And Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
doth not the Spirit of Grace accompany the word of Grace; are not Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
commands part of that Word? is there not a power going along with them?
what is this but to take from Gods Book, and he that so doth, God will blot him
out of the Book of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 19.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That a Christian is to gather no assurance from particular conditional
Promises under colour of receiving all from Christ and Grace. True, them that
have nothing to do with them, ought not; but for those that have to do with them
as their Inheritance, not to apply and make use of them for their comfort, 'tis to
trample under-foot Christs blood that purchased them for that end, and 'tis
to rase out in our practise the greatest part almost of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That the Law ought not to be our rule of life under a shew of being freed
from it by Christ, as though Christ came to set Hell-gates open for men to do
what they please. Shall I say any more? I am weary with speaking, I desire ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to go aside and mourn, and to think there is somewhat amisse why the Lord
lets these out. You that are sincere, search and keep close with Christ, and fetch
more life from him, and though accounted under a covenant of Works with men,
yet rejoyce, you know it is better with you in his sight. And you that are weak,
beware and take heed, and do not consider what I, but the Holy Ghost hath clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this day: and as for all them that do turn Grace into Lasciviousnesse, not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
but practically, not in all things, but some things: consider this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Iud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> 4. Men <hi>ordained to this condemnation;</hi> they thrive and have no hurt, and

Gifts and Graces, then dye and turn Grace into wantonnesse, for whom is reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

and folly are different qualities, and though these keep their residence chiefly in
the mind, yet the Lord never did infuse any true wisdom into the mind, but there
was a great change of the heart, nor never was any man left unto his own folly,
but it did not only argue an evil heart, but did ever arise from thence, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.
18. so that Christ nor only sees, but discovers to the Churches a vast difference for
them to take notice of: I confesse the difference was only in regard of open
prophanenesse, or common conversation in living like men of the world, yet a
difference here there is. For the opening of this Point, I shall open these Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Lord doth make this inward difference.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That 'tis so great that the faithful do see it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That 'tis so great that others cannot receive it when 'tis offered.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That 'tis so great that they cannot understand it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The reasons why the Lord makes this internal difference.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Lord doth make it: only some Scriptures now, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>You were
darknesse, now are light.</hi> Ephes. 2. 1. <hi>You were dead, now are alive.</hi> It's true there
is a life Hypocrites have, which puts much difference between them and others, but
if that doth, what doth the life of Christ in a man, arising from the death of every
sin? <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. The Lord turns not only from <hi>darknesse to light,</hi> but <hi>from the
power of Satan to God,</hi> together with which ariseth remission of sins. What is
this then but a greater change than from Hell to Heaven? Is it not worse than
Hell to be under his, not only Temptations, but power? and is it not better to be
with God, than be in Heaven?</p>
                  <p>II. 'Tis so great that the faithful do see it. I confesse at first work it's like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Chaos, they know not what to make of it, but afterwards they can and do,
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 18, 19. We know we are <hi>born of God,</hi> free <hi>from the dominion of sin,</hi> of
which he speaks, and that the whole world lies in wickednesse. Before a man is
born again, he sees no difference between him and other men, but now he doth;
and hence 'tis frequent in Scripture for Saints to expresse their experience of their
double estate, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 2, 3. and they are commanded to try themselves, and may
not only see Christ out of them, but Christ in them, except they be Reprobates,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. and hence commanded to give thanks for this, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12, 13. which
commands being Evangelical, have a power to all the Elect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:40159:71"/>
III. 'Tis so great that others cannot receive it when 'tis offered, they are so far
from having it in them, or counterfeiting, or making this inward work, that they
cannot receive it, no not when the Spirit it self comes to work it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 17.
<hi>The Spirit of truth which the world cannot receive,</hi> it doth receive Propherical
Gifts, and common Graces; but there is a higher and more Divine work which
they cannot receive, <hi>Rom. 8. 7. 'Tis not subject, nor can be subject to the Law of
God,</hi> where the holinesse of God appears.</p>
                  <p>IV. 'Tis so great that they cannot understand it what it is spiritually, only in
fancy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>neither can he know them,</hi> and hence men lie groping all their
life for Grace, and ask and have not, because they know not the thing they would
have, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 10. <hi>If thou knewest thou wouldst ask, and he would give.</hi> A Beast
cannot conceive what a life a man leads.</p>
                  <p>V. Now follow the Reasons why the Lord doth make this internal difference,
or shewing that there is this difference.</p>

above the most glorious Hypocrite that ever lived. It's an everlasting
love, and it's like that love he bears towards his own Son, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 26. Now if
the Lords love be not common to both, neither is the work, or fruits of his love
common in both, but a great difference there must be; for as 'tis with men, so
'tis with the Lord. There are three expressions of love. 1. Their looks. 2. Their
Promises of Love. 3. Their works of love: so the Lord doth,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Create in his people glorious apprehensions of his blessed face appearing in
the glasse of the Gospel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 4.</p>

                     </gap>ines not his love to looks and words, though it's wonderful to
have the least of them, but you may read his love in his works of love. Now those
works peculiar to them, are first and chiefly the donation of Christ, <hi>for</hi> a man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<hi>to</hi> a man in vocation: and then the peculiar fruits of this love exprest
in peculiar operations upon the Soul, and in the Soul, which Gods truth in the New
Covenant promiseth, and Gods faithfulnesse executeth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33. &amp; 32. 40. to
take away the <hi>stony heart,</hi> to write <hi>Laws in the heart,</hi> to <hi>put fear into the heart;</hi> these
are the peculiar effects of this New Covenant, and they are operations in a man,
which only the Elect feel and wonder at Grace for, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>According to
his great love hath he quickened us together with him:</hi> there is a kind of Resurrection
of a mans soul when 'tis brought home to Christ. And look as the bodies of the
Saints shall be different at last day, so when God raiseth their souls from the Dead
here, there is a difference now.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In regard of the Death and Blood of the Lord Jesus,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> which was shed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he might be a <hi>God</hi> unto them, but that they might be a <hi>peculiar people</hi> unto
him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>He gave himself for his people,</hi> not only to justifie his people,
but also to cleanse his Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 26, 27. for this hath been Gods great
plot: first to perfect his people in their Head; and then lest there should be a
golden head, and feet and hands of iron and clay, and because the Church is not
found lovely, therefore the Lord makes it lovely by little &amp; little here, until it <hi>appear
without spot or wrinkle</hi> at the last day. Do you think Brethren that Christs Blood
was shed to work no more in his people than in Hypocrites? was it only shed to
take away guilt of sin from Gods sight, and then to let a man wallow in the sins of
his own heart? 'Tis true there is a work of Sanctification which Hypocrites have,
which Christs Blood purchaseth, for I beleeve all common mercy and patience
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40159:71"/>
comes by Christs Blood, and so all common Gifts and Graces; but yet Beloved
there is a vast difference, their wills were never changed though their minds were
much enlightened; hence they sinn'd wilfully. The Lord never was dear to them,
hence secret despight grew up, that at last they committed the impardonable sin,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 26, 29.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because those Graces or Qualifications,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> together with the Operations of them
which are in the faithful, are the same with Christs, the same in kind and nature, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
1. 16. <hi>From his fulnesse we have received Grace for Grace;</hi> hence we are said to <hi>bear his
Image,</hi> and because it's but little at first, hence <hi>from Glory to Glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Now
the Lord Jesus had not only the Spirit which he had without measure, but also he
had many Divine qualities, habits, or Graces, which it is blasphemy to think that
they were hypocritical or common, which the faithful receive from his fulnesse, and
wherein they are made in their measure like unto him: so the Saints have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Spirit, but also those peculiar operations of it wrought in them by the Spirit,
whereby they come to be made like unto the Lord Jesus: Hence as there was an
infinite distance between the Lord Jesus, and the best Hypocrite, so the likenesse
that they have of the Lord Jesus, makes a difference now. And look as there is a
difference between a Plant and a Beast, a Beast and a Man, so there is a glorious
life which Saints have begun here in this life, which none have but themselves,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. They have the <hi>First Fruits, &amp;c.</hi> the which is meat and drink which
no man knows of that lies in his hypocrisie and sins.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If there should be no difference,<note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> then these evils would follow: 1. This laies a
foundation of contempt of Grace, and of the Beauty of Holinesse in the hearts and
lives of Gods people: for look as 'tis in the work of the Son in Redemption, if
Christ should have dyed as much for <hi>Iudas</hi> as for <hi>Peter,</hi> and suspended the act of
Faith to apply this on the Free will of either, then <hi>Iudas</hi> had as much cause to
thank Christ for his kindnesse as <hi>Peter:</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had no more cause of blessing
Christ for his love in redeeming him, than <hi>Iudas,</hi> and what cold praises will he
then give him: So if the Spirit of Christ should sanctifie or call a Saint no more
than an Hypocrite, then the one hath no more cause to be thankful for the work
of the Spirit than the other: and when a man comes to look upon the work of the
Spirit, and the Graces of it, there is cold water cast upon those; this is no more
than what a Hypocrite hath. Christ hath not only redeemed by price, but also
by power, from the power of Satan, Sin, Darknesse, Delusion, and not to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for this, is not to be thankful for the Redemption of Christ: Thou shalt never
have it then that dost despise the Spirit of Grace, whereby thou art but commonly
sanctified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because this abolisheth the use of all conditional Promises made in
the word: for you know they are made to some qualification or work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in a man, some to Mourning, Poverty, Faith, Hunger, Lostnesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now if
there should be no difference between seeming works in Hypocrites and these, then
1. the truth of the Promises is destroyed, for the Lord saith, <hi>They that hunger shall
be satisfied.</hi> I'le answer, Hypocrites may hunger, and yet not be satisfied. 2. The
use of these Promises should be lost, for why should a man then cast his Soul upon
Gods faithfulnesse in the Promise, when 'tis but common love to him and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:
If it be replyed the one hath Christ, the other nor. I answer, 'tis very true,
but then I ask, Who is he a Christ to? it must needs be to a particular People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the Word by their peculiar qualities, flowing from their forms and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
by which they are known; and now consider <hi>Rev. 22. 19. Is God a God of the
dead? and not of the living only?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because this makes the most holy men that ever lived deceivers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others; only look upon <hi>Iohn</hi> Christs beloved Disciple, and bosome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companion,
he had received the anointing to know him that is true, <hi>and he knew
he knew him,</hi> 1 John 2. 3. But how did he know that? he might be deceived (as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40159:72"/>
'tis strange to see what a melancholly fancy will do, and the effects of it; as honest
men are reputed to have weak brains, and never saw the depths of the secrets of
God.) What's his last proof? <hi>because we keep his Commandments, i. e.</hi> we
have them writ in our hearts, and keep them, though we cannot fulfil them, it
makes us every way more holy: Christ doth not keep them only, but we through
his Grace keep them; thus he proves it by a work in him. Now thus I reply, if
all works in the souls of Saints be common to Hypocrites, then <hi>Iohn</hi> went upon
false grounds, deceived himself, and all that heard him, and all the Churches that
ever were to this day.</p>

and Promise, especially until a man come to die. Divines have many strong
arguments against them, and shew however there may be decaies, and relapses, and

                  <p>The main ground of this their conceit hath been double.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. False observation, in beholding many fall off that were not Stars, but Snuffs,
glorious Professors for a time; and lest they should be mad without reason herein,
they search the Scriptures, and in four thousand years find but four or five that fell

                  <p n="2">2. A great mistake of the work of Grace, together with their own experience,
for they conceiving Grace to be but a mean thing, and not understanding it, because
they never felt it in themselves; hence make no difference between one man
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40159:72"/>
and another, and hence maintain apostacy from Grace. I hope I need not stir
you up to abhor this conceit, considering what hath been said. I grant indeed a
man may fall away from Grace, considering Grace without Christ to keep it.
But yet 'tis in it self such a living Fountain, as in it self doth not perish, though
it may; and in respect of Christ, it cannot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Did not <hi>Adam</hi> fall from all his Grace?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, because he had neither the Covenant of Grace, nor the Spirit of
Grace, nor power of Grace to support and keep him; but its Gods covenant now
to write his Law, to ut his fear in the heart, never to depart, and to give the
Spirit of Christ, who is now risen from the dead. <hi>Because I live, you shall live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
Iohn</hi> 14. 19. And <hi>power to keep us, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 5. So that though 'tis Christ
that keeps a man from falling, yet the truth is, he that doth fall from Grace, as
though it was a common fading thing, or doth fall from Christ, he never had
Christ at all, John 4. 14. <hi>The water that I shall give, shall be a Spring of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
not of dead Graces, yet quickned by the Spirit, and helped continually. And
its kept till life of Glory comes, where 'tis swallowed up in the Ocean of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Hence we see the difference between the Graces of Hypocrites and Saints<note place="margin">Use 3.</note>
doth not only lie in the efficient cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of Christ barely considered
in it self, for then there should be no difference at all, for there are not two Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and the same Spirit that works in the Faithful, the same Spirit is in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful,
to work many strange works in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3, 4. Neither doth su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
power of the Spirit distinguish (I mean that which is above the
strength of nature, not that which is above the use of nature, for nature crooks
all Gods works to it self) for the gifts of Prophecy and common joy are above
the strength of meer nature, but the difference lies in the work it self. As 'tis
in creation, the least speer of grasse hath the same power to make it, that made
Heaven and Angels, Is there no difference then? Yes, it lies in the very
work or effect of that power. And as 'tis in a Cedar and a Fly, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

excellency in the former in some respects, but the latter hath another life, which
the other hath not: So the meanest Believer is better than the most glorious
Hypocrite. And look as it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was anointed King, there
was a new Spirit came upon him, the Spirit of a King, which common Subjects
had not; so when God makes us Kings and Priests unto Christ, there comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Spirit upon us, which common men have not. I know there is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
it self in the Saints, as 'tis not in other men; But how is it there? I know
'tis there by Faith, but not only by this, but by certain peculiar effects which
are not in other men. As 'tis with the soul, 'tis in the body, hence works a
life which is not in any bruit creature, so 'tis here. And hence 'tis said, <hi>The

manifestations of a husband to her. She hath known he hath forsaken great offers,
and come to her: Her heart that was most opposite, was at last overcome to forsake
all, then they entred into a peculiar bond of covenant, so that they cannot part,
and though they do depart, yet they stay not long. So here: If you should
have asked the <hi>Israelites,</hi> how they did know they should be saved from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
Angel? Why the Lord hath promised to save us. You that do what?
That <hi>sprinkle the door-posts with the Blood.</hi> So the destroying Angel of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
shall destroy millions of people, and that in the night-time, when they
least suspect it. Notwithstanding all deliverances; miracles, plagues and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
Shall you be preserved? Yes, the Lord hath promised it, and reveal'd
it. To whom? To them that have their door-posts sprinkled with Christ's
Blood, apprehended by the work of Faith, <hi>Rom</hi> 3. 24, 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. If one
should have asked the Lord Jesus himself, whom he loveth? he would <hi>Iohn</hi> to
answer, <hi>his sheep,</hi> for <hi>for them he layes down his life;</hi> be they feeble or strong. If
one should ask further, who are his sheep? he would describe them by several pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
as he hath done, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. Such as <hi>know me,</hi> as <hi>hear me</hi> only, as <hi>follow
me.</hi> So if you ask a believer that question, How do you know you are loved? Is it
good to answer with Christ, I am his sleep, for whom he hath laid down his life,
when I was lost an went astray. But how do you know that? Is he now to
answ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> like Christ, by these properties wrought in me, or no? If you say, No,
because all these an hypocrite may have, then the Lord Jesus hath done
very weakly in describing his own sheep, by such properties to be his, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
them no more than so: Its true an hypocrite hath somthing like all these,
but not these indeed. If you say, yes, then a man may know his blessed estate
by these. The promise is, Prov. 8. 17. <hi>I love them that love me.</hi> But how do
you know you love the Lord? There is the question, If Satan and blind carnal
reason ask this question, you will be filled with accusations, and never satisfie
them; for he that accused <hi>Iob</hi> to Gods face, will much more to their own faces,
accuse Saints of hypocrisie. If uncharitable men that never had the love of
Christ abiding in their hearts, you will never satisfie them; but if the Lord ask
the question in his Word, hold there, and the work is so clear, that though there
hath been much decay, yet after recovery, the soul dares eye the Sun, and say,
<hi>Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee, Iohn</hi> 21. 17. Hence by
this work you may come to know your safe estate.</p>

How so? Immediatly? Some Divines think Angels see it not so, and that
its peculiar to God so to do: But mediatly, for our word came in power and in
much assurance to make you enlarged for God, to turn you from Idols unto God,
and to wait for Christ in Heaven, seeing him here, but as in a Glasse. And by
the same Spirit <hi>Paul</hi> saw it, by the same Spirit they might much more see it, and

                     </gap>eral word and spirit, I intend not to dispute, because
it makes nothing against the truth in hand: Only this I say, its very dangerous
to <hi>limit the Holy One of Israel,</hi> especially in his freedom of working, to breath
light, and life, and divine consolation, when and by what means and promise,
and in what measure he will. Christ when he was here on earth, would say som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<hi>thy sins are forgiven, Mat.</hi> 9. 2. Somtimes <hi>be it unto as thou believest,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40159:74"/>
Mat.</hi> 9. 28, 29. Nay, <hi>be it unto thee as thou wilt, Mat.</hi> 15. 28. If in these inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
things, much more in greater. Christ is now gone, and we have no imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
speech with him, but in his Word, and he is free to speak to his people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he pleaseth, and when they need. And therefore let me entreat Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to be wary in their speeches in dashing all promises in pieces. What Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
heart can see Gods Truth mangled, without being angry and mourning for
the hardnesse of mens hearts? The Lord hath spoken peace to some mens
hearts thus, he that is lost shall be found, <hi>He that believes in me shall never hunger,</hi>
and <hi>he that comes to me shall never thirst;</hi> and seeing this, they conclude, the
Lords Spirit helping them (for somtime they cannot do it) peace. For the
<hi>Major</hi> is the Word, the <hi>Minor</hi> Experience, and the Conclusion the Lords Spirits
work quickning your spirits to it. Now say some, how do you know this? Thus
you may be mistaken, for many have been deceived thus. Grant that, And shall
a child not take bread when 'tis given him though dogs snatch at it? What
should one do then? Bring their work to the light, to the triall of the Word,
which you know doth but two things.</p>
                  <p>Shews that God is. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What man is, and so discovers and describes all hypocrise of men, and all
grace of men, now if it will not bear the trial of the Word, convince them they
have gone on in a covenant of works indeed: But if it will, hold there, take heed
then of false witnesse against the Truth of God; so that do not condemn the
work of Christ in any man, where 'tis of the right stamp, and hath Christs Image
upon it, and so pluck men from their claim to Christs love revealed in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
But learn to difference it once, and then I am perswaded the sad differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
that begin to appear, would soon be ended among all them that <hi>love the
Truth in Christ Iesus,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given to us</hi> that have precious Faith,
<hi>exceeding great and precious promises,</hi> The Lord gives little to his people, Oh but
he gives them rich promises! Bonds, and Bills, and writings to shew for rich
Grace, and riches of Glory, and riches of peace. Oh but these promises Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
may have! they may be lost, and hunger and thirst, and believe. What
as those do that have their interest in these promises? Why are they called <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Promises? Precious promises</hi> are not common things. <hi>Precious promises</hi> are
not the portion of a base world. Precious things God never gives to dogs, and
believe me, you may come to know the price of them in the times of your hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
on death-bed, that account them common now. Oh but many rest on
promises without Christ! That's all one, the faithful by them come to partake
of the Divine Nature, of Christ, of his Spirit, of Divine Consolations, Peace,
Grace, and this is not building on a work, or resting on a bare promise, when
it carries you to Christ and the everlasting embracings of him. Its no matter
what promise gives peace, so long as it lands us in Christ. And therefore a man
may know his blessed estate by a work, only let me put in three Cautions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take heed you do not in your judgment or in your practise go about to move
the Lord to love you by your work, though it be of his making. For all works
are fruits, no causes of the Lords love, for this is Popery indeed, and 'tis Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crise,
Isa. 58. 3, 4. <hi>Why have we fasted, and prayed, and delighted to draw near unto
God?</hi> &amp;c. but look upon the work and promise, and be the more vile in thine
own eyes, that the Lord should promise, or do any thing for thee. So that when
you feel any saving work, go not to God with expectation of any good in the
name of that work, but in the name of that free Grace and Faithfulnesse of God,
which hath moved him to make such precious promises to such as those are that
have it. <hi>Hast not said Solomon shall reign? 1 Kings</hi> 1. 13. So here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed you do not sit down contented with the work, and quiet your
selves with that, never looking to behold his face that gave it, that wrought it.
The <hi>poor blind man, Iohn</hi> 9. had a mighty cure upon him, and some seed of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40159:74"/>
Faith; the Lord wrought the work, but hid himself: He wondred at the great
change, was affected with his love, at last the Lord Jesus comes himself, <hi>Dost
thou believe?</hi> saith he, <hi>Lord who is he? I am he; then he worshipped him, v.</hi> 36, 37,
38. So 'tis with the Lord in his way of working Grace: Oh therefore long to
see him here in his glasse, and in Glory, in his face fully! Truly there is no
work of Christ that's right, but it carries the soul to long for more of it, and to be
with him that hath done it. Many Christians when they have the work, run away
with it as a good sign, and look to the promise, Oh but long not, look not to
behold the Lord! <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, Oh ye foolish people and unwise?</hi>
Were it not enough that your sins make? but will you make works &amp; promises also a
partition wall between the Lord and your souls. I professe the Lord will fire such
work about your eares, and drie up all your pits, that you may long for to drink
out of the Well of life it self. And 'tis a black mark of Unbelief that shall keep
thee from rest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 3, 10, 11. Oh but when you long to see him, <hi>Oh when shall
I appear before God! Psal.</hi> 63. 2, 3, 4. Then the Lord will fill thee. As Leaden
Rings with a Pearle, so Promises and Christ put together (not divided) are
exceeding precious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do not look to see the work or promise yours, nor receive any consolation
from either, unlesse the Lord appear in both, John 10. 16. <hi>They shall hear my
voice;</hi> for so most men bring home Humane, not Divine consolation from a work.
But Oh fetch it you from Heaven! as in <hi>Peters</hi> redemption, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. You rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and others tell you, and yet you are full of fears and doubts; and thou cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
Lord perswade me, Lord perswade me, yea, hold you here, now you are
where you ought for to be. Do you think Christ is filled with Grace and Life for
you, and not with Consolation for you too? Only use means, and so look up to
him.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. V.</head>
                  <p>OH therefore content not your selves with any hopes your estate is right, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
you find this difference, for the Lord speaks peace only to his people,<note place="margin">Use 6</note>
and his people are differenced from all others. Hence how can you say peace is
yours, till this be cleared up unto you?</p>
                  <p>I shall speak to two sorts of people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those that content themselves with any thing that may stop and quiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
any slight work, any poor desires, any hedge-Faith, any moral perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
any groundlesse conjectures will serve their turn. And being full,
they can hear all Sermons, no wind will shake them, no searching, threatning
Truths concern them; they are so good, that they think the Lord means not them.
Well, I say no more to you but this, know it that the time is coming that the
Lord Jesus wil try you, and examine you to the very Bran; and will descry all thy
paint, and open all thy lusts and thoughts, and thy nakednesse, and shame, and
confusion shall be seen of all the world.</p>
                  <p>II. Those that content themselves with the revelation of the Lords love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the sight of any work, or not looking to it. I desire the Lord to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
abundantly more and more, to all that have the Lord savingly revealed unto
them. For this is the misery, Christ is a hidden thing, and so is his love: Yet
consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God reveals not his love to any Hypocrite, but to his people, that have a
work far beyond them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the testimony of the Spirit doth not make a man a Christian, but only
evidenceth it. As 'tis the nature of a witnesse, not to make a thing to be true,
but to clear and evidence it. And therefore whether the Spirit in the first or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40159:75"/>
place clears Gods love, I dispute no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, because 'tis doubtful; ye be sure you
find out the difference, <hi>viz.</hi> some work in you, that no Hypocrite under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hath: Else what peace can you have?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hereby you come to prevent the strongest delusion that Satan hath to keep
men in bondage to himself, <hi>viz.</hi> to give men great peace, and somtimes great
ravishment, while they are in their sins, that so he may harden them there still,
<hi>Luke</hi> 11. 21. Now by taking this course, and going to Christ to untie the knots
of Satan, you do now undermine the main plot of Satan, you break his head, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
recourse to Christ to do this. His policy is, Let you heart alone, let Christ
alone with that. But now you may be sure all your consolation is of the right
make.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Otherwise you quench the Spirit, and resist the testimony of the Spirit, at
least one great part of it. For the Spirit when it doth come to witnesse Gods love,
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> answers all the doubts and objections of the soul that it had before. Now the
great doubt of Gods people is not only, Am I elected, am I justified and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
But am I called, am I sanctified, are not my desires, my Faith, my love
counterfeit? which I may have, and yet go to Hell? Now the Spirit when it
comes, clears up all doubts, not fully, but gradually, for 'tis the most clearing
witnesse, and therefore, John 14. 18, 19, 20. <hi>At that day you shall know that I
am in you, and you in me, and I in the Father.</hi> The Spirit doth not only say Christ
is out of you, in Heaven, preparing and interceding, but in you, sanctifying, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
thee for Glory, that art a vessel of Glory; <hi>and you in me</hi> by Faith, by Love,
desire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now when a man shall say, I look to no work, but only for the Spirit
to reveal the Lords Love; in seeming to desire the Spirit, he doth resist the Spirit
of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Otherwise you shall be deprived of all that abundant consolation which the
Word holds out before you. For suppose you say, I look not to the work of God
in me, to receive any consolation from that, or any promise made to that. I
look only to the revelation of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. There is never a promise but the Comforter is in it, and they are given
for that end, to give strong consolation, now if you look to no work, nor no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
promise, nor to find the condition in you (which yet Christ must and
doth work) Lord! what abundance of sweet peace do you lose? <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 17. The
Lamb leads them to the <hi>living Fountain of waters, and God wipes away all tears:</hi> And
for ought I know you shall die for thirst that refuse to do it. <hi>Oh slow of heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all that the Scriptures have writ!</hi> all that God hath spoken! Ought you not
thus to be comforted?</p>
                  <p>But 2. If you look to a Spirit without a work, whilest you do seek consolation
from the Spirit, you cannot avoid the condemnation of the Word. You say the
Spirit hath spoken peace to you. But do you love Christ? I look not to that, but
to the Spirit. Why the Word saith, <hi>He that loves not him, let him be Anathema.</hi>
So, Is the League between your sins and your souls broken? <hi>Ans.</hi> I look not to
that. Why <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>He that committeth sin is of the Devil,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 8, 9. Are
you new creatures? I look not to that. Why the Word faith, <hi>Unlesse you be born
again, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> And the Lord knows, but on your
death-beds, thus Satan may assault you, and then will the Lord say, nay, look to
your self. The Word shall be <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. Look to it, else you shall be deprived of further manifestation and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Lord Jesus. The Lord reveals not all of himself at once, the day
dawns before the Sun riseth, and there is a further manifestation of the Lord in
this life to his people, not for, but when they indeed maintain such works before
him. John 14. 21. <hi>I will manifest myself unto him.</hi> How? Oh saith Christ, <hi>Ile
come and sup with him.</hi> Never think the Lord will dishonour himself so far as to
come into a filthy heart. Sin doth and will grieve Gods Spirit, that he will only
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40159:75"/>
accuse, not speak peace to you, till all is mended.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Else you may fall everlastingly away, as those, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. They had <hi>received
the knowledge of the Truth, and were sanctified,</hi> but their wills and hearts never
changed. Oh take heed there be not left <hi>only a fearful looking for of vengeance!</hi> You
stand on the brim of destruction every moment, that do it not. For 'tis plain hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
not to bring works to the light; 'tis not ceasing to go on in a covenant
of works, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 20. And if the Lord do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h love you, and you will not take the
counsel of the Word, the fire of the Lord shall try you. And when that comes,
and Conscience shall ask, wherefore comes all this great evil upon me? when your
miseries shall be great, Oh it shall be said, this was because I loved not the Lord, I
forsook the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh therefore look to the Lord now to cleanse you! <hi>Zac.</hi> 13. 9.</p>

for them to know their own hearts, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 9, 10. And although it be an easie
thing for hypocrites, that never knew what Grace meant, to be mistaken, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Lord hath made it known to the elect, 'tis no easie matter to deceive them.
As 'tis with Apothecaries, that know when they meet with counterfeit drugs; or
Jewellers, that know the difference between Bristow-Stones and Pearls. As
the blind man saith, whereas I was blind, now I see, so I was dead, now behold
I live. <hi>Old things are passed away, all things are become new.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. They
are <hi>called out of darknesse into marvellous light.</hi> If they could not know a difference,
why would the Lord command them to add one Grace to another, and <hi>grow in
Grace?</hi> May they not well reply? Alas Lord I know not Trash from Treasure!
I know nothing thou hast commanded me to do, but hypocrites may have and do.
I say therefore the work may be seen in it self, and that by a three fold light.</p>
                  <p>I. The light of the Word, which is a Divine Revelation of or concerning
God and man, and of man, not only as fallen in <hi>Adam</hi> (which discovers all his
sins, their nature, their end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but as risen again and recovered in Christ,
the birth, being, breeding of the new creature. It discovers all hypocrisie of the
heart, so that they shall be forced to say the Lord hath found me out, and Saints
shall say the Lord hath done me good. As if the question be, Whom doth the
Lord Jesus love? You need not go to Heaven for it, <hi>the Word is nigh thee.</hi> Those
that love Christ: Who are those? <hi>Those that keep his Commandements,</hi> &amp;c. So
that the Word is a light to discover Truth from falshood, the work of Grace from
the work of hypocrisie; and by this light Saints may and do know what the work
is. And it argues dreadful unbelief and Hypocrisie not to do thus,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 19, 20, 21. And this all the Saints are commanded to do, 2 Pet. 1. 19.
<hi>We (sealed with the Spirit) have a sure word of prophesie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which is a light in a
dark place;</hi> both to reveal Gods heart and our hearts unto us; hence <hi>it makes us
wise to salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. The Light of the Spirit going with the Word, reveals the work; without
which the work cannot be seen, no more than a Book written in the fairest hand
or print, can be seen without light to see it by: And hence Gods people cannot
presently read what the Lord hath written, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Iohn</hi> 3. 24. That look as 'tis
with Scriptures, Papists say they are obscure, and how do we know them? We
answer, there are Divine Characters of Majesty and Glory stampt upon them,
whereby we by the same Spirit that writ them, see them, and are perswaded of
them; so here. Or as tis in the work of Creation: How can any see God in
it? We say, in the very workmanship appears his Power and Eternity, Wisdom,
Goodnesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now although Atheists cannot see these, yet others do and can,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40159:76"/>
So in the workmanship of the Elect, 'tis so. Its the Glasse of Gods peculiar
mercy and love; now they that never had it, know it no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, but the Saints do, by
the Spirit especially. Thus far we grant the Spirits Testimony, that it must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
it.</p>
                  <p>III. The Light of experience and sense: For Saints have an experimentall
knowledge of the work of Grace, by vertue of which they come to know it as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
(as we dispute against the Papists) as by feeling heat, we know fire is hot,
by tasting honey, we know 'tis sweet. Now this is diversly apparent to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By meditation of the work, in comparing it with the Rule, for no dead
creature can perform one spiritual living act of life, no not a good thought, though
they may think of good things. Now the Lord hath given to his people a most
exact Rule of life, hence by meditation they may see how far it agrees or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with the Rule, and judge of a living act by it; and so of the God and Lord
of life to be there. Hence <hi>try your selves, know you not Christ is in you, &amp;c.</hi> And
hence I never knew yet a thinking Christian deceived, and hence I fear all that
make not this their trade, will be to seek, and so to begin again: Oh the Lord
teacheth his people hidden mysteries by this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the operation and working of it, for Grace may be in the heart, and yet
lying asleep, and raked up under the ashes, not seen, not felt, but in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, it may, which is peculiar as the form is. For how do we know we love
or delight in any creature? By the operation of love and delight. How did
Christ manifest to the Pharisees that they were <hi>of their Father the Devil?</hi> Why <hi>his
lusts they would do.</hi> So how can any tell he knows the Lord, or loves the Lord, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
in the Lord! The operation discovers it, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 22. And hence, Gal. 5. 6. <hi>Faith
which works by Love.</hi> And though hypocrites act like them, yet there is a peculiar
vertue in the one that is not in the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By their temptations and trials, Deut. 8. 2. <hi>The Lord hath led thee forty years
to prove thee and shew thee what was in thy heart.</hi> Rom. 5. 4, 5. <hi>Tribulation breeds
experience, and that hope</hi> or expectation of that which shall never make us ashamed.
Ile name no more. But look as we said to them that cried out against Prayer
without a Book, we answer, Hath a man dwelt in his own heart so many years,
and not known his wants, to make him pray? nor the Lords work of mercy, to
make him blesse, so here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But if a man looks to his work,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> this will interrupt and break his peace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may and doth break and interrupt a false peace;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> as many say, yet they
trust in the Lords mercy, Oh 'tis a presumptuous peace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neglect of this yields most unpeaceablenesse, even in them that are sincere.
You have peace, and then break out into pride and passion again; then question
all. The Spirit will sigh, not sing in that bosom, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16. 20.
Neither can you avoid the condemnation of the Word, though you maintain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
from the Spirit, nor suspition of hypocrisie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is the way to peace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29, 30. Christs <hi>yoke is
easie</hi> and yields peace, in life and after life too, Rev. 14. 13. <hi>Their works follow
them.</hi> So that hereby comes double peace and rest.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From horrour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From sin, which is wonderful great.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But I look to Christ,<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> I look to no work. If I have him, I have all.</p>
                  <p>True, First look to have him,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> to be comprehended by him, that so you may
comprehend him. But because you look for all in him, will you look for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from him? Will you have Christ fit in Heaven, and not look that he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
your lusts by the work of his Grace, and so sway in your hearts? You despise
his Kingdom then. Do you seek for pardon in the Blood of Christ, and never look
for the vertue and end of that Blood to wash you, &amp; make you without spot, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> You
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40159:76"/>
despise his Priesthood and Blood then. Do you look for Christ to do work for you,
and you not to do Christs work, and bring forth fruit to him? You despise his
Honour then, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 8. If I were to discover a Hypocrite, or a false heart, this
I would say, It is the that shall set up Christ, but loath his work. To have Christ,
is sweet, as <hi>Capernaum,</hi> to follow Christ, is heavy, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 21, 23.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But if I have the witnesse of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> what need I have any other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The witnesse of the Spirit makes not the first difference.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> For first a man
is a Believer and in Christ, and justified, called, sanctified, before the Spirit
doth witnesse it; else the Spirit should witnesse to an untruth and a lie. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers
are under wrath.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Spirit doth not witnesse this peculiar work to be in you, and clear
it to you, tell me how you can escape the anguish of Conscience and the terrours
of Hell in your hearts, unlesse Conscience be seared and blinded? When the
Lord shall set Conscience to ask and say, I chuse none but whom I call, I call
none but whom I justifie, I justifie none but whom I sanctifie, and that not with
a common, but a peculiar work; Is it so with you? If it be dark or doubtful,
can you but think all your joyes have been dreams, and your witnesse delusions?
Therefore look unto this.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But if I should do this,<note place="margin">Object. 5.</note> I should look to find some cleannesse in
my self, whereas I am to see nothing but ungodlinesse: Goats are clean crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When you stand before Christs judgment-seat to receive pardon,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> you are
here to look upon all as unclean, and your selves ungodly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When you come to look upon your Sanctification, you are to see it as 'tis,
mixt with sin and corruption, and so cause of being abased as low as Hell for
what is done; yet that cleannesse and truth there is, you must see too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.
He felt <hi>a Law warring against the Law of his mind,</hi> yet he felt another Law too
which he made an evidence of his being in Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. Giving all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it to Christ. <hi>Not I but Christ.</hi> And yet <hi>Paul</hi> was no Goat, Its one
thing to see Grace in my self, another thing to look upon it as mine, to clear me
withall. You are to see the Lords work and not appropriate it to your self. And
this let me say, if there be no more than ungodlinesse in thee, and thou seest no
more, thou shalt never see God in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Nor didst never see him
yet, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 6, 8. Oh therefore look to a work!</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you do not, you have no peace. For the Lords sake do it before fire try
you, or you stand scorching before the Tribunal of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The sweet of it will be great, as there is nothing more bitter than Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
with his holy presence; so nothing so sweet as Christs cleaving to thee in
his holy presence. And truly sin was never bitter to that soul to which the work of
the Lord Jesus was not sweet, though its accounted by some almost Popery to
speak so. To this all promises are made, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Godlinesse hath them.</hi> 'Tis
true, they are made to Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> to Christ mystical, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. Yet to the
head as the foundation and conveyer of all to the elect, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 23. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4.
If you despise work, you despise Promises, and so despise Christ, and the Lord
knowes what use you may have of them before you die.</p>

                  <p>TO the people of God,<note place="margin">Use 7.</note> in whom the Lord hath made this great change, and
made a difference between you and all the world.<note place="margin">Of Exhort.</note> Take heed of denying
your work, and this real apparent expression of the Lords love. How many doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drooping Spirits are there, that though others may see, and though themselves
have felt the sensible expression of the Lords love, yet oft come to this conclusion,
or fear that the Lord did never yet good unto me? And dispute against it, and
think that this an hypocrite may have, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 14. There are two waies whereby
Grace is despised.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By making common Grace special.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By making special Grace common. The Elect are apt to do so before they
are called, as <hi>Paul</hi> thought his innocent Godlinesse gain; they are apt to do the
latter when once in Christ. All this we may have, and yet to Hell. Oh take heed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
this kindnesse which the Lord Jesus hath not shewn to the greatest Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of the world.</p>
                  <p>Yea,<note place="margin">Object.</note> if I did but know it; but I am put to such fears and doubts about it, that
I know not what to make on't.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do not think that thou art under the power of thy sin,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> when thou art at war
with thy sin and it with thee. For the Lord many times clears up his love to the
soul, and 'tis better than life to him, but then winds arise, and storms come, and
sin and Satan assaults, and now he cries out, he perisheth, and that he was never
redeemed by Christ, nor never saw Christs love. Should his soul be thus ensnared,
thus assaulted, and no strength against it, and therefore being under the power of
it, hence he never had pardon; they cannot overcome their corruptions, though
they strive against them, hence think they are under the power of them, and then
say, where is Christs Spirit? <hi>&amp;c. Answ.</hi> When <hi>Rebekah</hi> had Twins, so that she
was troubled, she went to the Lord, who told her, <hi>the elder shall serve the younger:</hi>
So there is Flesh and Spirit in Saints, <hi>and these two are contrary, so that you cannot do
the things you would;</hi> and somtimes cannot will, yet somthing opposeth this.
Well, know it, that the elder and stronger shall serve the younger, it shall be
Lord. A man that is at war with another, hath received power against him, but
victory is not gotten presently, so 'tis here: <hi>Iudgment shall come to victory.</hi> Though
thou art bruised and canst not raise up thy self; now there is no fear of breaking,
if God will not do that, none shall do it, and therefore thou shalt get victory.
Only know for the present thou hast power. Thou goest to all Ordinances, and
when no help there, raisest the power of Heaven. Oh Lord awake! <hi>Awake Oh
Arm of the Lord! Isa.</hi> 51. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do not think that the being of Grace is lost, when 'tis hid, by the cessation
of it for a time from act. For 'tis hard to know whether Grace be there, when
acts are not seen or felt; now somtimes 'tis so. The heart growes carelesse and
negligent, ceaseth from acting, quencheth the flame of the Spirit. Hence come
fears, was there ever Grace here? The Sluggards Garden grows full of Nettles,
and he saith, was the ever good seed sown here? <hi>Answ.</hi> Consider 'tis in this
case, as 'tis in sin. Though the act of sin ceaseth, yet there is a bent of heart still
toward it; and a carnal heart will return to his old Byas and bent again: So though
the act of Grace ceaseth, yet there is an inner man, a gracious bent and frame
put upon the will, that though for a time it ceaseth acting, yet it will return to
its old bent again, to its own nature, which is called the <hi>seed of God, 1 Iohn</hi> 3. 9.
From which a man can never fall. For in sleep there is cessation from acts, yet
the frame remains still. In the old Law, if any unclean thing fell on a Pitcher, it
was accounted unclean, but if in a Spring, not, because it would work it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
so here: There is a Spring of Grace, which may be muddied and stopt up,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40159:77"/>
yet it will work it le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> clear again. And this Gods people shall find, there is
somthing in them that springs up to everlasting life all their daies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do not judge only of the truth and measure of Grace by what thou hast in
thy hand of feeling; but by what thou hast in thy hand of Faith in the promise.
God hath ever delighted to keep his people short of what they would have, and
to give them but little, insomuch that they often question the truth of Grace, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so little measure of it. Yet they look to the riches of Gods Grace, to the
freenesse and riches of the Lords promise, and hang there, and plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and thy Faith h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ngs on the promise for it: Why, tis thine by Faith then. The
nature of Faith is to carry the soul empty to a promise and the Lords Grace, and
Christ there, so that it knows not whither else to go but for bread here. Now
Faith doing thus, it makes the promise and all of it thine, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1, 4. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had his child first in the promise, when he felt a dry body, and saw a barren
womb. And know it, its insinite mercy to be kept up in the promise, and thou
givest the Lord infinite Glory by embracing of it now, and thou maist
triumph here. <hi>Hast not said, Lord, that Solomon shall reign,</hi> and sin shall not?
It shall not. Oh rejoyce oh Heavens and Earth at this, for the Lord hath visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me! God took from <hi>Paul</hi> his revelations, and sent distempers, that Grace
might be manifested in the promise.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Do not think that the Lords heart is not towards thee, while he hides his
face from thee. For there may be frowns in a Fathers face, and yet love in his
heart: The Lord purposely hides himself from his people somtimes, especially
when they begin to grow weary of him, or proud, but yet his heart is towards
them still. Now they think not so, when in utter darknesse, then they think
there is no love. the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> besought Christ oft, yet he heard not,
yet his heart was towards her. How did that appear? Her heart and Faith was
still toward him, she would not leave him though she should have but crumbs.
<hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 15. &amp; 8. 17. And the Lord doth purposely hide his face in love, that his
peoples hearts may be towards him, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 15. &amp; 6. 1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Do not judge of the Lords love and heart toward you in these sad times by
present feelings, but by the issue of them. For such is the Lords cariage towards
his people somtimes, that God seems wholly to crosse them, and appears in all
their waies with a drawn sword against them. He doth not only leave them to
their enemies, as he did <hi>Samson,</hi> but to their sins, and to Satan to buffet them,
that there is nothing but clouds of wrath and no Star appearing. Now look to the
issue, and <hi>mark the upright man, his end is peace;</hi> and consider this, Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is hid, and he brings contraries out of contraries, he makes darknesse light,
Hell Heaven, guilt pardon, weaknesse strength, and calls things that are not, as
though they were. Then think within thy self, Ile conclude nothing against my
self, but stay and wait what the issue will be, which is ever glorious, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 2,
3, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. Consider hath not the Lord done thee much good already?
Oh consider what is then behind!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Never enter into dispute with Satan, or thine own self, about thy estate,
but by taking and making Scripture and Word tobe the Judge of the controversie.
Fears come in, you shall never have mercy, never have power; Who told you
so? Doth the Word say that? The Lord never gave himself to me, I fear it!
Doth the Word say so? Never was any as I; Doth the Word say so? Or doth
not the Word say, God delights to pick out the vilest, to send the Physitian to
them that be sick. I cannot see nor conceive any mercy; Doth the Word say so?
Are not the Lords thoughts above thine? I have not that peace that others have,
therefore the Lord intends none toward me; Doth the Word say so? Oh but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

saith, <hi>Doublesse then thou art our Father, Isa.</hi> 63. 16. And bring before this
Judge both sides, not only what sin can say, or may do against thee, but what
the Word of the Lord Jesus can say for thee, Jer. 31. 18, 20. <hi>Ephraim</hi> cries out of

the Law of Christ in him also, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In times of greatest and smallest fears, remember to be humble and vile in
thine own eyes, worthy never to be beloved. And let the Lord have his Will of
thee, and this will give you peace. God denies mercy to that man that will be
Lord of it: To be sure, evidence mercy then he will not; and when he doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
it, 'tis then when poorest and vilest, and the heart is meek and humble,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. Oh the Lord opens his heart and love, when once his
Will is dear. The Lord casts by his rod and frowns now, and creates peace.
Thus you may come to see the work, or the Lords Grace in you.</p>

                  <p>THE Spring or one great cause and original of Evangelical Truth and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
is the mind of man.</p>
                  <p>For here there was an apparent difference between the Virgins in
their practise and in their wills, as hath been shewn; yet the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
it in general thus, that some of them were <hi>wise</hi> (which is one part of the
perfection of the understanding) and some of them were <hi>foolish</hi> (which is the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40159:78"/>
great defect of light in the mind or understanding) because the truth of the one
and the falshood of the other, manifested what their hearts were, in their heads
and minds; and the Truth in the one, and Hypocrisie in the other did arise and
was maintained by wisdom in some of their minds, and by folly in the mind of
some others. Folly or want of Divine Light made the one unready for Christ,
wisdom or having of Divine Light, made the other prepared for him: Not that
it doth exclude the evil or change of the will and affections, but because they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
themselves, and are maintained in the mind. Hence I say, one great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Original of both lies in the mind, Mat. 6. 22, 23. <hi>If thy eye be single, thy
whole body is light,</hi> &amp;c. The eye or mind of a man sits like the Coachman, and
guides the headstrong Affections; if now this be blind, there will be falls and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations
into crooked waies, John 3. 19, 20. <hi>Light is come.</hi> Now what is the
<hi>condemnation? Men love darknesse, i. e.</hi> will be blind, and having sore minds and
hearts, will not look up to the Sun. They see not, nor receive not the Truth in
love, and hence condemned, and <hi>Ã¨ contra.</hi> Hence <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Moses</hi> sets
down the causes of all their evils: <hi>The Lord hath not given you eyes to see to this day.</hi>
They did see and hear by natural and acquired knowledge, but not by a Divine,
created, infused knowledge, all that God had wrought and done for them. He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ce
when the Lord intends to seal down the <hi>Iews</hi> under unbelief, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 10. The
Lord then said, <hi>shut their eyes lest they see and so be converted.</hi> The heart
makes the eyes blind, and the mind makes the heart fat. A man that is at
enmity with God, the Lord sets him against himself. Hence men are left of God
to their own lusts, Luke 19. 42, 44. <hi>Oh that thou hadst known!</hi> and <hi>they knew not
the day of visitation.</hi> Hence Deut. 32. 29. <hi>Oh that this people had been wise to consider
their latter end!</hi> You know 'tis in the <hi>Proverbs of Solomon</hi> the frequent title of those
that are sincere and falshearted, the one is called <hi>wise,</hi> and the other <hi>foolish:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that some Divines have made a necessity of a change and turning about of
the will, when there is fulnesse and clearnesse of light in the mind. Else they
say a man might be <hi>sapiens</hi> and yet <hi>impius</hi> too, which cannot be. But I dispute
not a bout that; there be many bruit creatures that imitate the knowledge of man,
yet there is no mind of man or reasonable soul in them; so hypocrites may have
excellent abilities of reason, and yet fall short of that new mind, the eye and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
of the whole man, that Saints have. Its ever dark night with them
the Sun of Glory never did yet rise upon them.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. BEcause all Divine Light of Glory is ever powerful through Christ to change the
heart.<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> Hence if hypocrites had it, their hearts would be sincere, which is not
so, and hence they ever want it, whatever light else they have<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and hence those
that have it must be sincere, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 32. <hi>You shall know the truth and it shall make
you free, i. e.</hi> from your bondage of fears and sins, hence <hi>David</hi> prayes for light,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 33, 34. And then he shall be set at liberty. As Iron is drawn to the
Loadstone by a secret hidden vertue, so there is a secret vertue of Divine Light
that drawes the most Iron heart, nay changeth it, John 17. 17. <hi>Sanctifie them
through thy Truth,</hi> &amp;c. For this is the difference between mans and Gods teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And hence when the Gospel comes in power, it comes in demonstration;
whereby the heart is mightily overpowred, that it cannot but fall down before
God, whose voice and truth it hearts. And hence the young man saw some worth
in Christ, but not enough, and hence he forsook Christ. Truth is not stones,
but bread to them that see it indeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the mind is the first inlet of all sin and all Grace, and hence all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
springs from thence.<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> Hence when Satan laid his Train to blow up all the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40159:79"/>
world by sin, he first enters into dispute and parly with <hi>Eve,</hi> and as the Apostle
speaks, deceived her, 1 Tim. 2. 14. <hi>The woman was first deceived.</hi> And hence when
Satan came with his last and strongest temptation, to draw away the heart of
Christ to him, he attempted it by a sudden presenting to his mind the Glory of
all the world, hoping hereby to get in. Nay in the unpardonable sin there is
<hi>summa caecitas,</hi> to call evil good, and good evil. And hence the Pharisees that did
commit it, were called blind; and when sin is entred, it strengthens it self by the
mind, Heb. 3. 13. <hi>Least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

'tis with Cities, they might be easily taken, but for the Forts that are built about
them, and the Souldiers that are in them: So men set up their hearts and minds
above, and against the Lord Jesus. The power of sin lies in the power of darkness,
as the power of a weak State in the wisdom of its Council. And hence when the
Spirit comes, all the work of it is expressed by conviction <hi>of sin, righteousnesse and
judgment,</hi> because convince one effectually, and you convert him. And hence
when the Lord comes with life, he comes in by light, Eph. 5. 14. <hi>Christ shall
give thee light.</hi> And hence when the Gospel comes to take away all darknesse and
sin, 'tis said Satans chief policy lies in this, to blind mens eyes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by obscuring the Light, or by kindling a false Light in their minds, that
they shall think they see, when their darknesse remains; not but that there is
filth enough in the will, but Satan knows that Christ shines into the heart by the
mind; and hence he blinds men, and then he knows he shall damn men. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
if men had the Spirit, it would <hi>lead them into all Truth, now this the world
cannot receive,</hi> because John 14. 17. <hi>It knowes him not.</hi> This is that which opens
and shuts to all life and sin; not that bare light can change the will, but the Lord
doth it by the power of his Truth and Light: And as tis with water coming
through some Mines, there is a healing vertue in it, so Light coming from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
love, it heals men of their evils.</p>

mention onely one, that is used by a false heart. A man is troubled in mind
concerning his estate, fears death and Hell, and so few shall be saved, how can I
be one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How comes he to fear? The Lord hath by his Spirit in the Word
discovered and found out his sin, the thief is taken and apprehended, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
he hears still, but yet can find no peace, Why? Because he lives in
those sins that he is convinced of. Hence the Word raiseth damps and heart-qualms,
that he hath no peace, but is ever pulled from his own bottom and hypocrisie,
and the Word discovers more sins, and hence hath no peace: The Word will
not give nor offer Christ and a base lust together, nor will not suffer any to have
them both in peace. Hereupon the soul finding no rest nor peace (which the
false heart seeks for chiefly) flies from the Light, especially if it hath found out a
shorter cut to its peace, by any device or golden delusions of men. And now
they will hear there no more, and now the Publishers of Gods Truth are tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
tormenters of the Consciences of them that be weak, false Prophets, that
lead them out of the way of peace. And because of this, they think they were
led out of the way of truth, because out of the way of peace. Or if they do come,
they can sit with disdain and contempt of men (alas they speak according to their
light) and of all the truths of God, which shall one day be preacht over again in
flames of fire to their eternal horrour, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 2. Its said, Christ <hi>rides on a white
Horse, conquering and to conquer.</hi> Men have unruly hearts and strong hearts, and
they will not die, nor yield presently. And hence when one sin is cast away,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40159:79"/>
another steps into the room of it; and when that is gone, another supplies the
place of it, and commonly the strongest sin and temptation is the last. Now
hence Christ goes on, rides on in the Chariot of the Word, conquering and to
conquer still. Those that do yeild, he saves, those that will not, he slaies. Now

yet let it slip; either not minding it then, or not pondering it afterward; that
before they come, thirst not for more light, look not up for it, nor are mourning

men, so good they need be no better, so wise that they need know no more;
some insufficient indeed to know, and hence <hi>ever learning,</hi> hearing, <hi>but never

mightst die in thy hypocrisie and sin. Oh poor Captives, mourn under this, and

                  <p>Hence see the reason why many that have had mighty strong Affections at first

die away, and now their hypocrisie is manifest, if not to all the world by open
prophanenesse, yet to the discerning eye of living Christians, by a formal, barren,
unsavoury, unfruitful heart and course, because they never had light nor convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enough as yet. You shall have some ignorant creatures awakened by some

never convinced of sin. Land-floods of sorrow without a Spring of light, are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, and make the heart more fruitful in sin afterward. Many go under fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
of wrath, and never get peace, because never convinced of wrath. Many are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with Christ, and with joy of the Gospel, as the stony ground, but they
wanting depth of earth, of conviction, die away again; and hence all the world
can never stop a Christian in his shining Profession, no more than they can the Sun
in his course, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. <hi>We knowing the terrour of the Lord perswade men.</hi>
And hence <hi>Moses, Heb.</hi> 11. 27. feared nofrowns of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> cared for no honours
from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he saw the God that was invisible, and hence Christ praies for his
Disciples, to be kept from evil. <hi>The world hath not known me, but these have known
me, Iohn</hi> 17. When men are condemned to die, they take on because now they
see death; but here in time of health they see it not. If men wrong a child, their
heart smites them and grieves, but the Lord is abased dishonoured, and men are
not affected, because they want light, and see it not: If men be to match with a
Prince, or stand before him, 'tis counted blessednesse; but before Christ, 'tis a
burden, because men know it not. 'Tis strange to see some people carried with
mighty affection against sin and Hell, and after Christ. And what is Hell you
fear? A dreadful place. What is Christ? They searce know so much as Devils do,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40159:80"/>
but that is all: Oh trust them not! Many have, and these will fall away, to
some Lust, or Opinion, or Pride, or World; and the reason is, they never had
light enough, John 5. 35. <hi>Iohn was a burning and shining light, and they did joy in
him for a season,</hi> yet as glorious as it was, they saw not Christ by it, especially not
with Divine Light. Its rare to see Christians full both of light and affection.
And therefore consider of this, many a man hath been well brought up, and is of
a sweet, loving Nature, mild, and gentle, and harmlesse, likes and loves the
best things, and his meaning, and mind and heart is good, and hath more in
heart than in shew, and so hopes all shall go well with him. I say, there may lie
greatest hypocrisie under greatest affections; especially if they want light. You
shall be hardned in your hypocrisie by them. I never liked violent affections and
pangs, but only such as were dropt in by light; because those come from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Principle, and last not, but these do. Men are not affrighted by the light
of the Sun, though clearer than the Lightning.</p>
                  <p>Hence take heed of contenting your selves with every kind of knowledge:<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> Do
not worship every Image in your own Heads; especially you that fall short of
Truth or the knowledge of it; for when you have some, there may be yet that
wanting which may make you sincere. There are many men of great knowledge,
able to reach themselves and others too, and yet their hearts are unsound. How
comes this to passe? Is it because they have so much light? No, but because
they want much; and therefore content not your selves with every knowledge.
There is some knowledge which men have by the light of nature (which leaves
them without excuse) from the Book of Creation, some by power of education,
some by the light of the Law, whereby men may know their sin and evils, some
by the Letter of the Gospel, and so men may know much, and speak well, and so
<hi>in seeing see not;</hi> some by the Spirit, and may see much, so as to prophesie in
Christs Name, and yet be bid <hi>depart, Mat.</hi> 7. Now there is a Light of Glory,
whereby the Elect see things in another manner; to tell you how, they cannot,
its the beginning of light in Heaven, and the same Spirit that fils Christ, filling
their minds, that they know by this anointing all things; which if ever you have,
you must become Babes and Fools in your own eyes. God will never write his
Law in your minds, till all the Scriblings of it are blotted our. Account all your
knowledge losse for the gaining of this. 'Tis sad to see many a man pleasing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his own dreaming delusions, yet the poor creature in seeing sees not, which
is Gods heavy curse upon men under greatest means, and which laies all wast and
desolate, Isa. 6. <hi>How long? Until all be wast,</hi> V. II.</p>
                  <p>Hence see the right way of living a life of Truth,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> of being <hi>an Israelite in whom
is no guile.</hi> Keep light in your minds, and you will keep Truth alive in your
hearts and lives. Many a sincere heart may have Hypocrisie and much unsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in him, though he be no Hypocrite. But how comes it so to be? and
whence so little Truth? and hence so many fears and doubts about their estates
continually? Oh! men lose that Glorious Light that somtime they have. For
when you have it in an Ordinance, Oh how sweet is the Lord and all his waies to
you! Afterward you have lost your hearts, truly 'tis because you have lost your
light.</p>
                  <p>Two waies Hypocrisie vents it self, which Gods people oppose.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In secret withdrawing of the heart to sin. Oh now get light! for sin ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
draws away, but by appearance of some good at least, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc. Iam.</hi> 1.
14. Now put off the covering, keep the mind from being deceived, you will
keep the heart from being hardned, deaded and withdrawn from God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In performing duties, but not for Christ as their utmost end; now the
heart is bent this way, yet it failes, because light is gone, to see and behold
the Glory and blessednesse of this. Men that have honour or gain in their eye,
are carried violently after it. Men that are bound for a voyage will go through,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40159:80"/>
their eye leads them. <hi>Stephen</hi> speaks till the stones were about his ears, <hi>I see Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
saith he, <hi>at the right hand of God.</hi> 2 Cor. 15. 58. <hi>Be abundant in the Lords work,

this and that, and then he will do it. Oh therefore keep it in your minds as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
Prov. 2. 10. <hi>If knowledge be pleasant,</hi> &amp;c. And pray to God to keep it for
you. Light is in the Sun, and not ceased to this day: so if the Lord would

revealed to be the infinite wisdom of the Father, and love to poor lost men, where
God opens all his heart; if men will despise these, 'tis pity but they should be
blinded. Do not scoffe at those that know the Lord here, they are Scripture-learned
men, if not, never Spirit-learned. Take this for your Counseller, in all
your doubts and fears it will teach you. A man gets an opinion, or falls in love
with a sinful corruption, both deceive him. Why so? Is there no word
against it? Oh yes, but they will not hear it, but make God and Scripture bow
down to them, they will not be led by it. Oh intreat the Lord to keep thee

means that did it for thee, that mightst have perished in thy own delusions and

dreams. Time was when thou wast deceived, now the Lord hath made thy eyes
brighter than the Sun, to see such things as are hid from great ones in the world.
Oh though it be but a little, yet if real and saving light, blesse him. A man that
hath been in midst of Sands, and without a Pilot, afterwards looks back, and saith,
there I might have split. Oh this is wonderful to him! Oh Christ did thus! <hi>1I

them to thee, a babe, a weak one, a poor ignorant one, Mat. 16. 17. <hi>Flesh and
blood hath not revealed it,</hi> so as to build here on this righteousnesse, to fetch all
light and life from Christ, and cleave alone to him. Oh remember you are called

Secondly, The difference between the wise and foolish Virgins
is set down more particularly, v. 3, 4.</head>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>THIS particular difference is declared by the different practise of the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and wise Virgins each from other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Foolish though they had so much wisdom (like the
wise) as to <hi>take Lamps,</hi> yet so much folly was bound up in their hearts, as
that <hi>they took no Oyl in their Vessels for their Lamps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the wise did not only light their Lamps, but they did also fill their Vessels
with Oyl, that either their Lamp might never go out, or if it did, it might be
soon kindled again. More plainly, The Foolish contented themselves with the name
and blaze of outward Profession, kindled from some inward, yet lighter and more
superficiall strokes of Gods Spirit, neglecting the great work within: But the
wise did not only carry their Lamps of outward Profession, but they filled their
Vessels, and got an inward Principle of the Spirit of the Lord Jesus to maintain
their profession before man, and their uprightnesse before the Lord. So that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
here is a double difference, the first is implied, the second plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which is implied is this, that the Foolish made choice of a good end,
<hi>viz.</hi> to meet Christ, but it was with an ineffectual use of means to that end;
their Lamps were to light and lead them to Christ. These Lights might blaze for
a time, but they would consume without Oyl. They neglect that, the wise were
better instructed than so.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Foolish glory in an outward Profession, as also in some superficial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
without an inward Principle of the gracious presence of the eternal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
and Spirit in them; but the wise have it, and are carried to Glory by it.
And more at this time of the Lamps and Vessels I shall not speak.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> That the closest Hypocrites of Virgin-Churches discover themselves (at least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord) in an ineffectual use of those means that do conduce towards their desired
and expected end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:40159:81"/>
The Bridegroom is here looked for, the presence of Christ Jesus is longed for,
he comes in the night, they must meet him in the night. Now means they use,
Lamps they take, and so much Oyl as kindles their Lamps; but Oyl they take
not in their Vessels, the only means to preserve their Lamps from going out, that
so they may meet the Lord and not be shut out from the Lord, as at last these
carelesse Virgins were. Search the Churches for the present, search the Records
of Ages past, many have desired the Lord and looked for the Lord, and yet have
lost the Lord their end: Why so? They never had hearts effectually to use and
improve the means to that end, either outward or inward. Look upon men out of
the Church, they perish because they have no remedy, they have no Lamps to
light, they have no Bread to eat, no Means to help. But why do those within the
Church perish? Is it because there is no remedy? No, but because they do not
use the remedy. Is it because they want Means? No, but because they do not
effectually improve means. Here they fall short, herein they discover themselves.
Look but upon this next Parable of the Talents, <hi>v.</hi>25. One of them was cast off,
and cast out. Why? Because he had no Talents? No, But because he had no
mind nor list to use his Talent, he did not make his gain out of it to attain his end.
All Ordinances of God, and all that time we have under them are Talents. Now
wherein do Hypocrites fail? There is a secret gain of Ordinances which Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
regard not, and hence the best hypocrite lives in debt, and die<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Prov. 16. 17. <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool, but no heart to use it</hi>?
Precious Liberties, Ordinances, that many have desired to see, and have not seen
them. Why doth the Lord betrust him with such that useth them not? Oh he
hath them, but here is his wound, he hath no heart to use them! Look through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Word, Why have many set a great price on Christ, and yet have lost
him? Because like higling Chapmen, they have had a desire to the Commodity,
but they have been loath to be at the cost to use the means for it. The Gospel
brings Christ and Immortality to light, and this Serpent is lifted up, this Lamb
slain before mens eyes, and this Bread put to mens lips and mouths. Why are
not all possessed of him, blessed in him? The Lord saith, come, and <hi>the Spirit
saith, come, and the Bride saith, come;</hi> Why the reason is, men will not use the
means for him, <hi>Isa.</hi>55. 2, 3, 4. Men will lay out their money, though it be for
<hi>that which is not Bread.</hi> Jer. 2, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>I brought them through Pits into a pleasant
Land, to eat the goodnesse thereof.</hi> And doubtlesse he brought not a herd of swine
into <hi>Canaan,</hi> only to enjoy the outward blessings and swill of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the good of his Temple, Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But where was their wound? <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Priests nor People said, where is the Lord? i. e.</hi> Where is the Lord in these
waies, that we may come at last to the full enjoyment of him by these? This
they neglected. Methinks 'tis with the best hypocrites as 'tis with divers old Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
they prize and desire the gain of Merchandise, but to be at the trouble to
prepare the Ship, to put themselves upon the hazards and dangers of the Ship,
to go and fetch the Treasure that they prize, this they will never do. So many
prize and desire earnestly the Treasures of Heaven, here is their end, but to be at
the trouble of a Heaven-Voyage to fetch this Treasure, to <hi>passe through the Valley
of Baca,</hi> Tears, Temptations, the Powers of Darknesse, the Breaches, Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Contradictions of a sinful, unbelieving heart, good and evil report, to
passe from one depth and wave to another, this the best hypocrite failes in, and
hence loseth all at last. And this I conceive to be one of the great differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the strong desires and esteems of Hypocrites and Saints.</p>

                  <p>I. IN regard of God,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> because this neglect is one of the great means by which he
doth execute his eternal rejection of men, and hence here they ever do
fail.</p>
                  <p>For 1. The Lord hath chosen some to life, the end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He chuseth certain means to lead to this end.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He purposeth to carry all his Elect by these means to that end; themselves
cannot, hence the Lord doth. And hence ariseth the great peace and support of
the Saints, when they look upon the everlasting mountains of hindrances and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities
in their way, the Lord hath undertaken to carry them through them,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 15. That when heart and strength failes, he will be heart and strength,
and guide by his counsel, and bring to his Glory. And hence as all the Elect
are to be certainly carried through all means to their end, and this is proper to
them, so hence the best Hypocrite being never appointed certainly to come to
this end, ever failes in the use of means; there he is and shall be forsaken of
God, and forsake God. Hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. When many used the means, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Christ for a time, that they might have life, at last they forsook Christ and
means to have him. Why? <hi>v.</hi> 65. Because <hi>none can come to me, except it
were given him of the Father.</hi> Hence, look as certainly as the Decree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
shall stand, he having not appointed them to the end; so he
never carries them through all means to that end, and therefore here they do ever
fail. As 'tis in a Family, those that the Lord of the Family intends to give his
estate unto, he keeps a strict eye upon them, keeps them under the Government
of the Family; as for others, let them go where they will, and do what they
will; so here, all that shall enjoy God, are put under the Kingdom of the Son.
Hence he is said to give it up: To others he will say, you love Liberty, take it
then.</p>
                  <p>II.<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> Because the Lord and Fellowship with him, is never indeed their last &amp; utmost
end, or their only end, but they have some o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> her end of their own; &amp; hence they are
never carried strongly through all means to that end. For this is the nature of a mans
last and utmost end, it carries a man without any stop toward it, and that with
delight. As a man that hath ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>our and preferment, and great hopes in his eye,
that is reaching to the top of his aspiring thoughts, he will ride, and run, and
flatter, and sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A man that hath riches in his eye, he will <hi>rise early, and
go to bed late, eat the bread of carefulnesse,</hi> and he never hath enough. A man that
is sick, and hath health in his eye, takes his Physick, observes his seasons, wasts
his estate, for this is his end. Hence a Hypocrite never making Christ his last
end, but being ever <hi>a double-minded man, Iames</hi> 1. And having his own ends,
and lusts, and self to attend upon, hence the Byas draws him from following
Christ effectually, but he must follow his own ends, and hence ever neglects the
means that lead him thereunto, <hi>Mat.</hi>6. 24. Look as 'tis with men that have two
Trdes, or two Shops, one is as much as ever they can follow or tend, they are
forced at last to put off one, and they must neglect the one: So here.</p>

all their senses, that they cannot use effectually all means to accomplish their ends.
And hence a man desires the end, but hath it not, <hi>Prov.</hi>13. 4. The Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the most Glorious end to his people, but its through many difficulties that
we must come to it. Now there being the Spirit of sloath within, and these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
without, a Hypocrite sits down and rests under the shadow of this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
spreading sin; and saith 'tis hard, and because he cannot do so, he hopes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40159:82"/>
'tis but an infirmity, and God will accept of his desires, and here perisheth, Mat.
7. 14. <hi>For straight is the gate that leads unto life,</hi> hence <hi>few there be that find it.</hi> Look
as it was with the <hi>Israelites, Canaan</hi> they were bound for, they came at last to it,
but when their Spies had told them of the difficulties, they sank, only <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
of that mighty Host that had upright hearts here. Heavy things must descend,
though cast up; for their place is downward. Light things, cast them down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
yet they must up again, for their place is upward; So 'tis here: A sluggish
heart may be lift up by means, but they cannot hold it, their place is downward,
here is their rest; so Saints, <hi>Ã¨ contra,</hi> like fire will consume all difficulties, their
rest is upward.</p>

never possessing the Lord. And hence have minds full of fears, and mouths full
of complaints, and hence finding no sweet in their course, could be content but
for shame, to throw by their Profession. Why? Where is the cause of this? Is
Heaven so barren and beggarly, that there are no Jewels to be had there? Are

though they come tired thither; as Psal. 84. 7, 8. <hi>They passe from strength to strength
till they come to see God in Sion.</hi> They rest not in their complaints, but get on;
and the star before them, the Means that lead them to that end, make them (as
Mat. 2. 10.) <hi>rejoyce with exceeding great joy.</hi> I confesse they may for a time give
way to their sloath, and sit in their vallies, and turn day into night, and sleep

that you prize, pray for, long for the end, and if ever the Lord saves
and pardons you,<note place="margin">Use 4. Of Trial.</note> you shall have cause to blesse him. You may do as hath been
said, but never find a heart given you by the invincible wrestlings of a God to use
and improve all means to that end; and thus your practise in the habitual neglect
of means is a clear and manifest witnesse, like the day against you, that you do not
desire sincerely the end (as you think) in having so little respect to the means
that conduce thereunto. Did you ever see that man that did indeed desire life,
but he would use all means, wits, and friends, nay cut off his Limbs to preserve
it? But however, put that name upon it, say you do desire and prize the end,
yet if the Lord leaves you, or you forsake the Lord in a neglect of means, that
lead thereto, and that effectually; what you may be, and what the Lord may do,
I know not, but to this day your estate is no better than a painted salvation and
pictured hypocrisie before the Lord. That stone at which the closest hypocrites
have stumbled, that rock on which the best hypocrite hath been broken, thou art
fallen upon, that enemy of sloath, which hath carried Kings (men that have
worn the Crown of Profession in the world) miserable Captives, (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their lamentable cries, Lord save us!) to hell, the same enemy hath already
bound thee up in Chaines, and what will become of thee, 'tis only known in his
Breast, that by the voice of his Trump can awaken the dead, and break the bonds
of sloath and death it self. But you will say, there are no Virgins among us that
neglect to take their oyle, that so far forget themselves as to neglect the
means, that are come so many thousand miles for means; there is not a day but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40159:84"/>
some line is drawn, not a Sermon, Sabbath but some good got, or else they
think themselves half undone, not a prayer but one step nearer to glory: The
day is not long enough, and therefore the nights are spent in wrastlings with the
Angel; nay, in prevailing with God for themselves and Churches, and blessing
on both; Sabbaths are the day breaks of heaven, the fellowship of Saints be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then to stand before Kings, the fellowship of Christ in heaven so sweet,
that in seeking of him men forget themselves, nay to eat their bread; that if
the Lord should have let out the vineyard of Ordinances to any Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the world, who could or would have taken more pains to dig it, to
dress it, then we doe. Beloved, those enlargements that are in any after the
Lord, the Lord cherish and increase them, but I fear we may go five times
about the tree before we see such loaden boughs. I am much mistaken if the
best may not be discovered here, the fairest flowers in the field must wither,
they cannot last, and the best affections that are but temporary, that have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men mightily for a time in the use of means, must perish in the neglect
of means at last. I shall not therefore meddle with profane or carnal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spellers,
so much as with close deceivers of their own souls; and look as 'tis
in all sores, you may know where the sore is by the lappings, so you may know
a sluggard that neglects means by his shifts: For if you observe, no sin hath
so many shifts and colours for it as this; <hi>Saul</hi> when he had not gone through
stich with the Lords work in slaying the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> what adoe had <hi>Samuel</hi>
to convince him? He tells a lye, lays the blame on the people, propounds the
good end and affection he had; So here: Thus it is with many, as <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those that live in a secret neglect of means, and yet hope to come to
their end, because of their desires; we shall finde the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ipture gives us two
sorts of desires. 1. Of the righteous. 2. Of the sluggard, 1. <hi>The desires of the
righteous,</hi> Prov. 10. 24. <hi>shall be granted,</hi> being breathings of Gods eternal
Spirit, not a sigh or groan unanswered. 2. Of the sluggard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 15. <hi>The
desire of the slothful kills him, for his hands refuse to labour;</hi> the desires of the
righteous are ever spurs to quicken them up in the use of means mightily, the
desires of the sluggard bridle him up, they binde his hands, and fetter his feet
that he cannot but neglect means: Some desires there be that arise from the
need of a good, and here will not only be desires, but all means used, as in
point of famine; some only from want of a good, and here a man usually
contents himself with bare desires, never hath a heart to use the means migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
for that end. Many a one is convinced his state is miserable, and fears
it, and <hi>Balaam</hi>-like, sees the blessedness of the people of God, and knows
he wants pardon, and life, and peace, and promises, and Christ, and desires it;
oh that I might die their death, oh that I might live and drink that water, that
I might thirst no more, oh that my sins were pardoned, oh that my heart was
humbled. But what if the Lord grant them no peace nor pardon? Do they
make earnest enquiry after the Lord Christ<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with restless pursuits and groans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they need it, is it worth that? Oh no, but yet they hope God will be so
merciful as to accept their desires, and so they rest, and live and die in that
rest, oh poor creatures your desires kill you; as a man is undone with sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
servants that cannot earn their own, much less get their masters bread.
And many in Hell, say I had thought my desires would have carried me to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but now I see they have been slothful, and here I must perish and famish
for ever; had I known of this, I would rather have wept out my eyes, and
filled the world with my sorrowful complaints, my meditations of the Lord
should have been at midnight; I would have deceived my eyes of sleep at
night, and deprived my self of bread at day, and lost my limbs, had I but
known that by contenting my self with these desires, I should have lost my
life. Here many Christians are falsly bottomed, they are troubled about their
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40159:84"/>
estate, come to some or other and professe their desires are after Christ and
grace, &amp;c. And then comforted (as in sinking fits a man snatcheth at any
Flag or Twig) with them desires, before they have followed the Lord in the
use of all means to get the thing they desire. And here is the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Lords forsaking of them, and theirs of the Lord, and he is left
alone only with his desires, that if any duty be neglected, desires comfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t him;
if grace resisted, desire; quiet him; if sin keeping him captive, desires fill him;
<hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. And so like a Bird that lies in the nest, but its wings never
grow, there it perisheth. I know Saints may comfort themselves with desires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the things be given, because promised, but you shall see an endless reach in
them in the use of all means, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. Others think their neglect of means to be
but an infirmity, &amp; that their desires will serve, &amp; hence abuse that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They that neglect the means and yet hope to come to their end, because
of worldly clogs and incumbrances here; for this is the very spirit of many a
man. If God keeps the house from being burn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, and family from being sick,
it may be family prayer is neglected, if not that, yet secret is omitted; if not
that, yet meditation; a man can get no head nor heart, nor time for it, if any
good is got, its lost again; Sabbaths spent, and no good gained; a man knows
his soul lies waste and common without any fence or watch, and that he would
not let his fields lie as he doth his heart, overgrown with cares and lusts and
vain thoughts. Now many a man though he doth dislike this, yet lives in
this. Why? Is this your home, are these things your portion? No, but yet
thinks he may with a safe Conscience continue thus, and God forgive him too;
why the family is great, children encrease upon me, (and they are so busie and
long a dressing on the Lords day, that Sermon is out before they come) and
we are not called to book it all day as Ministers can, and worldly employments
are so many, and the best are entangled here; and they think this is an excuse,
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. 18, 19. Nay many a one convinced of this, yet lives in this against the
light of conviction, hoping that one day the stream of worldly occasions will
be run by. I confesse, as the Lord hath given us his Ordinances to seek him
in, so he hath appointed our callings to walk with him in: <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise
must not be idle, but look to the garden; and in this land those that will be
good husbands for God (least they discredit their profession by bringing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a piece of bread) must be good husbands for themselves: But here is
that which stings, when to worldly emploiments, men are servants, not Lords of
them, when men do not make their occasions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ow down to them, and serve them,
that they may serve and seek a God, but they bow down their knees, nay, basely
their backs, under the feet of any mean imployment, and that must be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with neglect of God. Do not say who is not entangled here? I tell you if
Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it doth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. Oh look to this! it may be some of you do not only neglect
the Lord in means, but when the Lord comes to you in means and quic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hearts and kindles many resolutions in you; you neglect the Lord, all dyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
oh it is the world! know your estates by this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Those that depart from God in the neglect of means, because they finde
no good, and do not feel themselves a whit the better for them; they neglect
this trade, because they finde it a gainless trade: For thus God executes his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
rejection upon many a soul: As it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> it was one of the last
Vials God powred out upon him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 5, 6, 15. saith he, <hi>I am sore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed,
and the Lord answers me not by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>rim nor by Thummin, and therefore am
I come to thee;</hi> let a Devil comfort me if God will not: So many a soul having
committed some sin that lies glowing on the Conscience, is sore troubled, and
first it goes to the Lord, and the Lord answers not, there is silence in heaven, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40159:85"/>
in all means, but the noise of fears within; now at last the soul doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Lord for Satan plainly, but what means can comfort them that they
seek for, and in time a man is weary of waiting at Gods gate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, and hence a
form of duties, and prayers, and custome of devotion is kept to quiet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
but they are not restless for the gain of them, for the Lord in them:
they think 'tis in vain, to no profit, as those in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. to walk mournfully.
<hi>Ionah</hi> was cast out of Gods sight, yet through <hi>the belly of a W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ale he would look
toward the Temple.</hi> So 'tis with the people of God, though they sometimes
conclude thus, and think not to seek any more, yet their hearts have tasted the
good, and their faith beleeves there is that hid in the Lord in his Temple<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
that it never saw yet, hence they look still. What made the man <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.
hide his talent in the earth? I thought thou wast an hard Master, and lookedst
for so much gain, and I could not get it, and hence he hid his Talent. Hence
men keep the means, without use of the means, and some that have for a time
been used to do so, keep it as their custome without making any such work
of it, as to gain the end of the means.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Those that do neglect the Lord in means by an effectual pursuit of them,
because of some sips and taste of some good in them; and so me thinks 'tis in
this case as 'tis in some Countries where if a man comes to their house in
the afternoon, and both have a minde to part, yet loth to part without shewing
some kindness, and the other without tasting of it, they lay their voiding nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,
and finding that refreshing there, they are content to lose their, supper.
So 'tis here, a man comes weary to the Lords House, to his Ordinances, the
Lord will not let him go without some expression of kindness, nor they depart
willingly from the Lord without it, and hence the Lord gives them light out
of darkness, joy out of sorrow, peace out of trouble, a taste of his sweetness,
after tasts of sins bitterness, and then they take their leave; as they <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 2,
3, 4, 5. And here the Lord leaves many a poor creature, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 2, 3, 4. they
did see something, and tast something, and there they rested; Oh but the Lord
gave them not eyes to see, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For no Hypocrite living is fully emptied of
his lusts, but hath somewhat to fill him; but some emptiness he may have,
hence may have some desires after the Lord, and hence it is not the fulness of
God onely that satisfie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> him, but some tasts of Gods kindness, and small thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
do and must fill him; his lusts fill him in part, and something of God is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that some little matter doth make up. Hence when this is done,
means is neglected fearfully, a mans heart is hardned and ignorant, a little light
and sorrow stays him, as the stony ground though there be a stone at bottom;
a man is full of doubts, and a little hope which frees him from fears quiets him,
hence he never conquers unbelief: A man hath lived a loose course, a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of heart stays him, though the heart will depart again, as those <hi>Deut.</hi>5.
27, 29. the Lord hath but little of their hearts, and the Lord shews them but
little of his: And hence this is usual to see a false heart most diligent in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord when he hath been worst, and most careless when 'tis best. Hence
many at first conversion sought the Lord earnestly, afterward affections and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>: Hence
the Lord when in mercy he deals with men, keeps them long fasting till the
time of extremity comes, and then he pours waters on the thirsty. Hence bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for those never to have known, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>2. 21. and an hypocrites last end is to
satisfie himself, hence he hath enough; a Saints is to satisfie Christ, hence he
never hath enough.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Those that do neglect the Lord under this colour of receiving Christ, they
can do nothing themselves, and Christ must do all; and hence neglect the Lord
secretly, and sometimes quarrel with the Ministry privately, when pressed to
a duty or to beleeve. Alas what can a man do, when all the Ministers in the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40159:85"/>
world have preached their hearts out, at last they must bring us to Christ; what
else should the Apostle mean, <hi>Rom.</hi>4. 5. <hi>Not to him that worketh, but beleeveth
is faith accounted for righteousness. I must not live, I must let Christ live,</hi> &amp;c.
And hence say they the cause of perishing is not mens wills, but Gods, he elects
not, he gives no heart; such hypocrites the Lord prophesies of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Many
that say to me Lord, Lord,</hi> i. that advance the Lord Jesus, and live in neglect of
all duties, and bring the Lord of glory not from his Throne in Heaven to Hell,
but which is worse, debase him from his glory to sin; to be the cover of sin, and
protector of it. Beloved, I know no surer sign of a vessel that God intends to
break in peeces then this, to live in this neglect, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>2. 20. Nay 'tis an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
there is no hope, no living hope, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 3. <hi>He that hath this hope,
purgeth himself as Christ is pure.</hi> Many it seems boasted of hope in Christ, so
do Saints, but he gives this Note, He purgeth himself, he will not sluggishly put
all on Christ. Tis true, 'tis the mighty working of Christ that must conquer
thy lusts, but must this put you to neglect striving, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>I strive according
to the working.</hi> And for mine own part, though Ile not dispute the point at large,
I beleeve, there is a constant assistance of the mighty power of the Lord Jesus
in the souls of all the Saints, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. And hence 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. <hi>Greater is he
that is in you, then in the world.</hi> The Saints as they receive the Lord Jesus to

ease him of the burden of Conscience; sometime to ease him of the Lords work,
the burthen of his will; and hence some at last have complained, though hardly
convinced of it, that they could be contented the Lord should act them; but
their end was, that hereby they might be rid of their burden, and so eased by
him. I have heard a Question should be askt, What is the difference between
the workings of Gods Spirit and the Saints? And that the Answer was, 1. The
one is by graces, the other immediatly. 2. The Spirits is, when a man labours
least: quite cross to the stream of truth: Take heed how you understand these
points aright, the depth of the most hellish villany in the world lies un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wo to thee that canst paint such a Christ in thy head, and receive such a Christ
into thy heart as must be a pander to your sloth; the Lord will revenge this
wrong done to his glory with greater sorrows then ever any felt: To make
Christ not only meat and drink to feed, but cloaths to cover your sloth. Why
what can we doe? what can we doe? Why as the first <hi>Adam</hi> conveies not
only guilt but power: So the second conveys both righteousness and strength;
as Christ is now triumphing by his eternal Spirit, and his life is heavenly; so
if you be in Christ, there is a Spirit of Christ, whereby a never dying life is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
that can and doth conquer; though it be but a spark, Christ maintaining it,
it shall come to victory. You are forsaken of Christ if you want this, or else
take heed this colour make you not forsake him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Those that neglect the means, and yet look for the end in hope of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
time, and so neglect the present season. Thus 'tis with many a one; the
day of life and health, and day of Ordinances continues; and hence the slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
cryes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 33. <hi>Yet a little more slumber,</hi> i. Ile have but a little while
longer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence when Conscience checks, Ministers warn, the Lord wooes,
the Spirit cries; a man puts off all with this, I hope it will be better: And
hence it falls out with them as with those <hi>Matth.</hi>24. <hi>The Lord comes in a
time they look not for him;</hi> and of this many on their deathbeds have cryed
out. Think of this you convicted persons that know its miserable with you,
before God stop your breath; you have nothing to plead for your neglect, but
hope of time. Know it, Gods present seasons are golden, one moment worth
eternity; and now is the time, if you neglect his season, he will not regard yours.
God is never found in your time, but in his time. Oh lay these things to heart!
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40159:86"/>
especially you that are grown weary of means, that faint in your way; God is
not yet weary of continuing means, art thou weary of gaining by means? Oh
consider this you that have had many hopes, desires purposes, but all blasted,
your time and means neglected: Think on this you that have had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
affections, but your spirits are gone; Nothing can make you
mend your pace, not all Ministry and Word, but you are clog'd with means.

that neglect, and that makes the Lord neglect thee in thy ineffectual seeking; else
thou mayest seek and never finde, and that is some lust, something that easeth
the heart which is not God. When the soul hath not bread, it will with the
Prodigal then resolve for home; men could not live as they do, so many days
without God, unless they did feed on somewhat else beside the Lord. Hence
its usual for men in means, to use means for a good, and out of means to resist
that good, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 1, 2. <hi>Zac.</hi> 7. 6. Men that would have their load drawn, must

him now; those that are like children born before their time, that have
had some sorrow after the Lord, but comforted before it was deep enough; have
some desires, but eased with other things before they were satisfied with
Christ himself; that have run for a spurt, but are grown weary before they
come half way home, and so sit down in the way; like Clocks set slow in
the first hour of the day, run slow all the day after: So these set
back and think they are set right too, run slow all their life after. That
as he said of a covetous man, he had a strong desire for heaven if any would
bear his charges thither: So these. And to you I speak, not that never sought,
but that have been seeking; yet effectually to use all means, this you never
did.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider how far men have gone? What means they have used?
yet have never found to this day, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. <hi>Strive,</hi> saith Christ. This
I speak because men think they may neglect their seasons of earnest
pursuit after grace, men may sit still, and put all care from themselves to
God, and live in their sloth. Oh no, Consider so many snares, so many by paths,
so many deceits within, so many sins and lusts to subdue, all time and means is
little enough: Take heed of spending prodigally, and think Christs grace will
bear you out. Oh! look upon the cries at death-bed, to see some men that have
been like famishing men that have wanted bread, and then have cryed bread,
bread, but could not eat it. Oh saith <hi>Paul, I beat down my body, lest in preaching
to others my self become a cast away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider how others have broken down the greatest difficulties, and are
now in glory, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>They loved not their lives to the death.</hi> They have
not only spent their time, lost their name, their comforts, but their blood, that
have passed through waters, fires, bonds, imprisonments, and with <hi>Paul</hi> have not
<hi>accounted their lives dear, that they might finish their work. David</hi> was full of God
one would think sometimes he had enough, yet when he awakes, he is with God
at midnight, <hi>his thoughts and reins instruct him; the Law was his meditation day and
night.</hi> You shall see him in the Temple blessing God, on the Throne advancing
the Lord, on the dunghill, in banishment longing after him, when he sate among
Princes meditating; and was there here too much cost, might any of this oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have been spared? Consider Christ himself, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3. cast off sloth,
<hi>Looking to Iesus, who for the joy, despised the shame, endured the Cross,</hi> and that not
for himself, it may be for thee, that thou mightst not, now he is at the right hand
of God: So are the Saints in Heaven, and now rejoycing that ever they sought
him, that they spent so much time on him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider, There is a time of neglect of Christ, which when past, you shall
never finc'e him again, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 3, 4. <hi>Ye shall seek me, but never finde me.</hi> You have
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40159:87"/>
had many Diamond-days and seasons, and God gives you a space to repent,
and saith, <hi>My Spirit shall not alway strive,</hi> it may be some are but within that
space, that the Lord is at the last cast with you.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider whatever your condition be, shake off your sloth, and set upon
the means, the Lord will be found; do it in good earnest: This will be good
news to you that think he will never, but be thy heart like steel, and hard, the
Lord will break it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>he will be found of them that seek him diligently:</hi>
And the greater things thou seekest for, the more like to get them; as one of the
Fathers thinks that to pray with repetitions, is to pray for small things. <hi>Open
thy mouth wide Ile fill it,</hi> and it may be presently in a moment, when
thou thinkest least of it, it may be at that time when thou findest most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness
and difficulty to seek, seek then and the Lord will be found. Oh this
damps many a man in the use of means, he thinks the Lord will never help, and
hence is tormented with this thought, and sits down and rests: If you would
keep a Labourer from work, or a Traveller from walking, put thorns in their
feet; now the work is neglected, there is pricking s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his business now: So 'tis here, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 19. Take heed therefore of sitting
down with such thoughts as these; its strange thou shouldst be killed for every
cut, and because wounded for sin, to fall off from the Lord by unbelief too.</p>
                  <p>II. Motives to you that have followed the Lord, but now have begun to neglect
him: For what cause I know not, but I am sure the Lord hath given you none:
Yet a spirit of slumber and sloath is upon you, that you are not the men you
were. It may be some for want of place, want of time, many occasions, many
sorrowes and temptations in this wildernesse; and hence no means sweet, no bed
easie, your bones are broken. It may be a little time of neglect hath emboldned
you to a custome: It may be loose examples, the spirits of others flat, and thine
is so too, whom God sent into Church-Fellowship to quicken them: It may be
an ill Husband is an hindrance, a bad wife, as <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, or whatever 'tis, Oh
that God would speak this day to you!</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider thou art nearer to thy salvation than when thou didst first believe;
and then you thought no time, no pains too much, but all too little, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11, 12.
Mariners near the Shore, look out for Rocks, Lord that I may not split now.
Truly as it was with Christ, the longer he did live, the more sorrows, so with you.
God hath carried you near salvation, Oh now being neerer, there are worse rocks,
look about you now. Satans last temptations are strongest. Oh give not in now!
It may be not many daies nor weeks hence thou shalt come to thy journeys end:
Awaken then out of sleep.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider how glad the Lord is of thy company, he hath been so, and will
be so again; thou canst not come in too late, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 21. as poor and vile as
thou art, Prov. 8. <hi>His delight is with the Sons of men.</hi> Witnesse mercies, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
afflictions. Oh then seek him! Witnesse desertions, then seek him; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
his sweet entertainment of thee, many a time when he hath given thee meat
that the world knows not of; witnesse so many hindrances which Satan laies in,
who knowes how crosse 'tis to Christ, Jer. 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>I remember the love of thine
espousals, when thou didst follow me;</hi> especially when with most difficulty, when
little strength within, when little hope without, yet Ile not give over. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forgets this. The Lord hath never such sad daies as when thou turnest thy
back on him, and thou never so good, as when thou seekest him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider thy gaines, there shall not be the least endeavour, desire, pursuit
after the Lord, not the least Word, Prayer, Thought, time spent, but an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
recompense is in Christs hands, 1 Cor. 15. 58. <hi>Ever abounding, knowing
that it shall not be in vain.</hi> A man that rowes against the stream, a little neglect
of rowing carries him down again. But oh <hi>be ever abounding in the Lords works,
for your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:40159:88"/>
4. Consider if after admonition again and again, yet you nourish sloath, there
is some heavy stroke neer thee. Believe it, he will not alway bear with thy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.
As nothing joyes him more than your company, so nothing cuts him more
than your neglect: But though he save you from eternal misery, yet sometimes
your greatest comfort is lost by this means, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 38, 40, 44, 45. First he stirs
them up once and again, then leaves them, and comes again, and saith nothing,
but the third time, <hi>sleep on, the Son of man is betrayed.</hi> So your comfort, and
Christ and his presence are betraied. Some have had their husbands, wives, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
estates gone, but which is worst of all, the Lord betraied, the comfort of
their hearts gone, and hence horrours and fears surprize them.</p>
                  <p>III. Motives to us especially in this Countrey.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God hath put the price and wealth of the world, better than all Gold
and Silver into our hands, who are most unthankful, most unworthy; and will
you come so far for means, and here neglect them? Will you thus neglect the
Lord? Like men in Consumptions, they long for any thing, and when it comes,
they cannot touch it. If it were night, you might fall to sleep, but the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth.
Shall God plant his Vineyard, but you never come to eat the fruit
of it?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your Temptations are greater here to neglect the Lord. Others are tried
with the scorching Sun, there is no sleeping there. God tries us with the shadow,
sets us under the Vines of Ordinances; others are in storms, we in calms. <hi>When
thou eatest and art full,</hi> saith <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 8. 10, 11. Oh <hi>forget not the Lord</hi>! You
lose in your estates, and now you are hungry after the same again. Satan when
Christ was hungry, assaults him. 'Tis a thousand to one if he makes you not fair
offers, and overcomes. Things that cost us much, we prize, and keep, and
improve, if of any use. When we go Twenty mile to a Sacrament, Oh then
its precious! While under the bondage of oppressors, oh liberty of Conscience,
and Ordinances are precious? But when at liberty, we have liberty to have
them, hence take liberty to neglect them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our enemies will be upon us. Who sees not (that observes the Lords
dealing) that some sorrows are toward, unlesse the Lord awaken; some sudden
blasting blow. If any wind be stirring, men on the tops of the mountains will
feel it. The Lord hath set his mountain above all others, and its f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>lly to think
to flee from the Crosse, unlesse we flee from Christ. 'Tis part of the portion he
doth owe us here, if he loves us. Yet seek the Lord, neglect no seasons to gain
him, and you shall he hid, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 2. Nay when worst times come, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.
3, 4, 5. when there is no peace, they that seek him shall find him.</p>
                  <p>I do fear there is at this day as deep mischief plotting against <hi>New-England</hi> as
ever the Sun saw. Enemies will first deal subtilly before cruelly, but subtilly
that they may deal cruelly. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deals wisely, he means to kill. Yet
the Lord shall be with us, as of late hath he not been seen in the midst of us for a
refuge? Whatever any think, I believe never did the Lord stir up such prayers,
Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amongst us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Oh therefore seek the Lord still in private. If you find no good, find out
the sin. Is not meditation neglected? Communion of Saints not improved?
Do not say, we can do nothing, and why are we prest to it? If you cannot, yet
'tis your duty, and you must be prest; and perish you shall if you seek not; or if
you be called, there is some spirit of the Lord in you that is mighty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Being come hither for publick helps, and means, and all Ordinances; Oh
do not betray your Liberties! but lose your Bloud before you lose them, and the
Lord in them. Bear the Arke still on your shoulders, that the Lord may dwell
with you. Hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you would have the Walls of Magistracy be broken down (the means to
preserve the Church and means among you) If they make Laws, deride them;
if they execute Laws, appeal from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:40159:88"/>
2. Would you have confusion the mother of discord among the people? let
every man then once one day in the year turn Magistrate, and out-face Authority,
and profess tis his liberty. Would you have rapines, thefts, injustice abound?
let no man know his own, by removing the Land-mark, and destroying Proprieties.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Would you have Gods Ordinances in the purity of them removed? keep
out the load of Superstition, but yet for peace sake, suffer a few seeds to be sown
amongst you.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Would you have all the Messengers of the Gospel at first revised, at last
massacred? Profess they are no better than Scribes and Pharisees, persecuting
Egyptians, enemies to the Lord Jesus, and the more devout the worse; as those
that stirred up storms in <hi>Germany</hi> said, Christ had four great enemies: The Pope,
Anabaptists, <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> but especially <hi>Iohn Calvin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Would you ruine the Gospel? set not Popery against it, but Gospel against
Gospel, Promises against Promises, Christ against Christ, Spirit against Spirit,
grace against grace, and then he is twice beaten, that falls by his own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Would you have oppressors set over you, to remove ordinances, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
your burdens? Maintain this Principle then that they will not assault
us first by craft and subtilty, but openly and violently.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Would you have this State in time to degenerate into Tyranny? Take
no care then for making Laws. When they are made, would you have all
Authority turned to a meer vanity? Be gentle and open the door to all comers
that may cut our throats in time; and if being come they do offend, threaten
them and fine them, but use no Sword against them. You Fathers of the
Country be not offended, this I speak not to disparage any, the practise speaks
otherwise; I onely forewarn: I hope the Lord hath prepared better days and
mercies for us, I am sure he will, if what means we have we preserve, and what
we preserve, we through grace shall improve.</p>

Vessel: So that the Vessels were not separate things from the Lamp, as though

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40159:89"/>
which kept the oil to serve this end: And hence the folly of five of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
that they would carry burning Lamps with empty Vessels; just as if a
man should draw the wiek through the oyl that it may burn for a time, and
provide no oyle in the Vessel to maintain the Lamp; however all comes to
one (if they be separate) in respect of that that I aim at.</p>
                  <p>Thus Literally we see what the Lamp, Vessel, and Oyl is: Now what is
Spiritually meant thereby.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Oyl: What is that? I intend not here to shew the fond and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
apprehensions of Popish Writers, who understand by oyle, alms, good
works, a good intention, &amp;c. But by Oyl is meant the Spirit of Christ, and the
graces of it, peculiar to all the Elect; and thus in Scripture phrase, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 27.
the Spirit is called <hi>the anointing;</hi> and the graces of the Spirit, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>The
smell of Christs ointments:</hi> Harlots love him for the gifts he sends, but Virgins for
the grace he hath. That oyle which ran first on our <hi>Aarons</hi> head, and runs
down to his skirts is here meant. Now as Christ himself had not the Spirit
without graces, nor these without the Spirit, but both: So both these being in
him as in the Fountain, they are in us as in the Vessel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Christ being the Fountain of all grace, and having the Spirit without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and therefore hath enough to spare; he cannot be meant by these Vessels
which had but their measure, and such a measure as that they had none to spare
for the other. Therefore by Vessels are meant principally the precious souls
of the faithful, into which this golden Oyle was put, and therefore, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.
<hi>We have this treasure in earthen vessels.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. <hi>They are vessels of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
prepared unto glory,</hi> and so frequently; so that herein the foolish fall short,
for the foolish boasted of Christ out of them, but where was the Spirit and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Christ in them? And this is conceived to be the reason why the main
difference is not made, by the want of the external principle, <hi>Viz.</hi> Christ, but
by want of the internal principle and work; this they had not. 1. They had so
much oyle, <hi>i. e.</hi> lighter strokes of the Spirit, as kindled a profession but they had
not enough. 2. They had so much oyle and light as continued their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for a while, but it continued not long:</p>
                  <p>Here therefore observe these four things:</p>
                  <p>That the precious souls of the faithful are Vessels made only or chiefly to receive
and preserve the presence of the Spirit and grace of Christ.<note place="margin">Obs. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That within these Vessels there is an inward principle of Grace and Life.<note place="margin">Obs. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there is a certain measure,<note place="margin">Obs. 3.</note> degree, plenitude or fulness of the Spirit of Grace
in the hearts of the Faithful, which the unsound, though most glorious Professors
of the Gospel fall short of.</p>
                  <p>That the graces of the Saints wherewith their hearts by the Spirit are filled,<note place="margin">Obs. 4.</note> are
constant, and of an everlasting, and eternal nature.</p>
                  <p>These three last answer three Questions, If any ask the difference between the
Virgins; the foolish want, and the wise have an inward principle of the Spirit
of life. If it be said, Hypocrites have an inward work, yet this inward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
is such a fulness of Spirit which they ever fall short of, and this will make
them known for the present. If again it be said, That many flourish gloriously
for a time; yet its of an everlasting nature: And this will manifest them one
from another in time to come.</p>
                  <p>The First Point therefore Ile only touch on now.</p>

of the Spirit of <hi>Christ:</hi> That as it is with the souls of the wicked, they are
made onely to hold Satan, sin and wrath, and so fitted for destruction; so the
souls of the Saints are made and fitted onely to receive and nourish the Spirit,
grace, and love of Christ. That as 'tis with Princes, the best rooms are reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
onely for them; their Attendants may come in and out to serve them, but
its their room, their lodging: So here, the hearts of the faithful, and the best
rooms, best affections of it, are onely to entertain the Lord, and his grace and
Spirit; yet other things may come in and out as Attendants to him, to serve
him, but the rooms themselves are onely for his proper use, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20, 21.
The Church is Gods House; now there are many Vessels (many souls) some ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
of wood, and earth, some of honour; what are these? <hi>Answ. If a man
purge himself from these;</hi> for no man is born with a next disposition to receive
grace, as a Vessel full of puddle water that must first be cast out: Now when this
is done, he is a Vessel meet for his Masters use, prepared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The best Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
abide in the house, not for their own or servants use, but for the Masters use
onely. And though the Spirit may withdraw for some time, and they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to do any good work, yet they are prepared for the Spirit, and so for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good work, and here is all the use of the vessel of honour. Hypocrites

the profound judgments, deep heads, eminent Christians, but not Vessels
of honour, because not Vessels of use onely for their Master, onely to receive
the eternal anointing of the Spirit of the Lord Jesus. If you would know the
certainty of this more fully, 1. Go and ask themselves; Is it so or no? If

Ask the world whose they are? and to what use and purpose they serve? they will
answer, they are none of ours; and therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 19. <hi>The World hates
them.</hi> Ask the Lord himself, he will profess though many wants and weaknesses
in them, nay, though sometimes they are weary and neglect him, fall and soil
themselves, yet <hi>Isai.</hi> 43. 21. <hi>This people have I formed for my self:</hi> Vessels for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

                  <p n="1">1. Because all the creatures in the world are theirs, and servants to them,<note place="margin">Reas. 1</note> and
therefore they are for the Lord onely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 23. If the more we took
care for, and set our hearts upon the creature, if the more we were conversant
with it, the more we should have, and the better we should live; Or if they
should not serve us, unless we did first bow down our knees to worship them,
and our backs to bear them; Then seeing the world lives by catching, we might
then dis-robe and dis-throne our souls, and care more for these things, and less
for the Lord; love these things more, and the Lord lesse; but the Lord Jesus
having taken all care for his people, and bearing more love to them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more care of them than themselves, and therefore having given all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the heavens, sea and dry land to serve them, they ought to be, and are
onely for him, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 21, 23. When a man is the seed of God, and born for him,
Now all creatures serve him; hence 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17, 18. Tis a prevailing Motive
with all the Saints, we have a living God that gives us all things; all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
being dead, and not able of themselves to help us, therefore trust not on
these things, but him onely, be not high minded in these things; but magnifie
him onely. We know how angry God was with <hi>Belshazzar</hi> for profaning the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40159:90"/>
Vessels of the Lords House in making them quaffing bowls, and turning them
to common use. When a man is brought to that misery that he hath none, nor
knows of none to be a friend to take care or thought for him, none that loves him,
then he shifts for himself and becomes a servant. But those that know, as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that they have rich husbands to live on, they take care 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 34. how
to please them: So here. Whats the reason that men are mad for this world?
Because they poor creatures have no friend, know no friend; but Saints have
him, and know him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 2. The Saints are given to Christ, Christ to them,
and all the world put into Christs hands for us, (for the creatures are not given
to us immediatly to our own dispose, and hence we have not much of this world)
to what end? That so he might give eternal life begun here. This is the only
gift, and last, and best, and worthy of himself, and this only we receive.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In regard of that blessed Liberty all the faithful are brought into,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> for what is
a Christians Liberty? Is it to serve men? No, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. Therefore serve not
your selves: Is it then to serve your own lusts? No, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>You are made
free from sin, and servants unto God.</hi> Is it then to serve any Creature out of your
selves? No, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. The world is yours already, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22. given to
you, bought for you, spend not therefore one groat more to purchase it, but keep
those affections and hearts for the Lord; much less imprison not, and imbond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
not your selves for it. A Christians liberty which God crowns him with
above all the Princes of the world, is to be onely for the Lord, which liberty all
creatures groan to be in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21, 22. To be for God and a lust, for Christ
and this world, its a shameful bondage, and most lamentable, and you are not at
liberty yet, if not onely for the Lord. When the children of Kings and Peers,
of Princes shall be made to come at the call of their Grooms and Kitchin-boys,
if ever they stood before the face of Princes, they will count this a heavy thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and bondage: So if ever you stood before the God of the whole earth,
you will account it an heavy bondage, to have an heart sometime for, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
not for the Lord. Is not this liberty? No, but to have a heart only deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to the Lord; as 'tis in Angels, and in the man Christ Jesus. Verily look
as the Lord leaves his people for a time to their liberty in sin, so that their hearts
are determined onely to sin, that they are fit onely to receive the suggestions
and pleasures of it, but fit to quench the Lords Spirit: So the Lord Jesus
making himself and grace more sweet than their lusts, their hearts are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
onely for him, their Vessels are onely for his Oyle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of will that <hi>Arminians</hi> plead for is nothing but the hypocrisie of a false
heart, whose heart being toucht partly with God, and partly with the creature;
hence is alway falling from one to the other, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. <hi>Double minded men;</hi> but
the Saints are determined unto one, and hence made perfect in one.</p>

and so the Spirit of life, that have quickned our hearts when dead, that do put fresh
life to us when dying, that comfort our hearts when sorrowing. Here is the life

some women, because God doth not feed so liberally their sweet tooth, their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corish

Hold here. Never think to have one prayer answered: If this night thy day of
misery should come, cry thou mayst, but no God to hear thee or help thee.

and their Profession shines.</p>
                  <p>For this I understand by oyl in the vessel, the Spirit of Jesus, not out of us, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in us; not coming only upon us, for so he may on foolish virgins, by <hi>Balaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitish</hi>
ravishments, and hypocritical pangs, and land-flood affections; but abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in us, and that not as it doth in hypocrites, but as it is in Christ Jesus, without
measure, both Spirit and Graces, so it abides in us in measure: in Him as the
fountain, in us as the vessels, from whose fulness, we receive the same. So that
by oyl is not meant the external Principle of all Life, the Lord Jesus having
Spirit and Grace enough, but keeping our hearts empty of it: but the Lord Jesus
in us, who is not in us, but by his Spirit, even the Spirit of Life, from whence all
our actions spring, and from which oyl our lamp burns. This therefore I say, the

burns. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>You hath he quickned, who were dead in sins,</hi> i. e. you were held
as fast under the power of your sins, as a dead man is under the bonds of death:
but now in the room of that death, there is the Spirit of life, and the life of the
Spirit. Now life is an inward principle of motion, of any thing in its own place;
as the sun, and trees, and grasse, and cattel. You may take a stone, or milstone,
or wheel, and move it, yet they have no life, because this is not from an inward
Principle so: hypocrites may be acted, and moved by the great power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

but no spring that is running winter and summer. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 9. This is called
the seed remaining in him: which is that new creation, new birth, which the

cannot be a sinmaker. <hi>Balaam</hi> could not curse the people of God; and many

from some other respects: and hence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. the stony ground fell away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had not the root within. This is called the inner man; the good trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the heart, opposite to the evil treasure of the heart of a wicked man.
Now, as an evil man acts not only from Satan, the evil spirit; but the inward
power of lust; so the Saints, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 35. And here I intend not to shew
what this inward Principle is particularly, for that I reserve to the two last
points. Yet, least any should stumble, let me speak to two sorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Know some of you, that there is not only external actings of the Spirit
from whence we act, but a new nature in the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let others know, 1. That as before the Lord cals we are dead, so after
we are alive this inward principle is not perfect here: Hence actions sometimes
cease, and when they do not, yet are corrupted, as <hi>laesa principia</hi> act, but ever
erre in their act, hence have need of pardon from and acceptance in the Lord
Jesus. 2. That this is not in us as in <hi>Adam,</hi> who did not need to borrow life
of another, but it stands in daily need of the Lord Jesus, and hence this inward
principle acts, but 'tis by faith, the operations of which are the wagons to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
the camp continually, especially in time of need, and which is part of this
inward principle; and hence 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>You are kept by power and faith,</hi> i. your
souls, graces, lives are kept by the Spirit, but through faith in us <hi>to salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me therefore prove these three things to you for opening of this point.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Spirit of the Lord Jesus is in the souls of the faithfull.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is a principle of created graces, or the life of the Spirit in
them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That from this principle of the Spirit dispensing himself by his graces, our
lamp burns, our acts of profession spring and shine forth.</p>
                  <p>First, That the Spirit of Jesus is in the soules of the faithfull, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 27.
<hi>The anointing teacheth you all things.</hi> Rom. 8. 11. <hi>The Spirit that raised up Iesus
from the dead dwels in us.</hi> The manner of his being in us I intend not to meddle
with, unlesse I saw more cause: I do beleeve the manner of his abiding in us,
and his nearnesse to all the Saints, when seen of us, may astonish our own spirits,
and shall one day confound all the world; Only know, as the Martyr said, <hi>He is
come, he is come.</hi> The spirit of the world and Satan is cast out, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. and
in room of them enters the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Spirit so is in the faithfull, as that there is a principle of
created graces in them, or an inward principle of life and grace. Not that these
alone make this inward principle, but the Spirit in us working of them, working
by them. And truly 'tis a sad thing if the proving of such a principle shall be an
attributing too much to grace in us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Therefore to deny this is to deny Christ to be our sanctification: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the passive obedience of Christ, we are justified by his active obedience also,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40159:92"/>
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> his inward conformity to the Law, and his external obedience to the Law.
So that graces as they are in Christ become our justification; and hence he is
said to be <hi>our righteousnesse.</hi> No man can stand before God but by perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but by doing whatever the Law requires, and continuing so to do; this is
not in us, this is in Christ: This as 'tis in Christ is properly our righteousnesse
or justification. Now what is our sanctification? if not graces in Christ, then
graces received from Christ Jesus, which is this inward principle now I speak of;
and therefore to deny this is no lesse than to say Christ is not our sanctification:
But saith <hi>Paul, The Lord sanctifie you in soul and body and spirit,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 23.
And if it were so, a man may have a heart unsanctified and Christ too.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there should not be those graces, then a Christian was not bound to adde
one grace to another, but then the Apostles precept should be broken, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.
7, 8. and so a Christian could not grow in grace, for graces are perfect in Christ;
and the Spirit doth not grow in grace, and the immediate operations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
increasing in us, are not properly graces, no more than the act of seeing is the
eye, no more then giving goods to be burned is love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then we are not to pray for graces, if there be no such things to be found
in the hearts of Saints, but <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 10. <hi>David</hi> praies, <hi>Create in me a clean heart;</hi>
now if it be a thing created in me, 'tis not the Spirit only in me, for that cannot
be created. I doubt not but <hi>David</hi> had a clean heart, but he fell in part; and
therefore look as there needs a creating power to make, so there is a creating pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to restore us again to what is lost.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then the Saints have none of their sins mort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>fied; for 'tis as with the eye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made to see; if sight goes out, darkness comes in, and if that be subdued, sight
is renewed: So the Soul being made only for God, and to bear his image;
blot out that darkness and sin comes in: cast out sin, the Lord and his Image and
Graces come in. If therefore there be no Graces in the Saints, then no sin
mortified: truly if so, then the end of Christs coming, and dying is quite aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 8. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Then the Lord should be false in his Covenant, and break Oath, and be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn:
for, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 32. <hi>I'le write my Law in their hearts. Luke</hi> 1. 73, 74.
So that if you will not believe man, yet believe God: and if you will not believe
his Word, yet his Oath. Oh, but many good Christians find no such thing.
But is it so, as they find it indeed? Either then they are no Christians, or else
the Lord is forsworn.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That by the inward principle of Spirit, and Graces, our lamp burns, and
shines, our actions issue. The Spirit enables a man to know, &amp; hence the act flows,
he doth know the Lord. The Spirit enables inwardly for to love the Lord, and
hence it doth love him. That as Christ saith, <hi>a good tree brings forth good fruit,</hi>
from an inward sap received from the root, and by abiding on the root; So
here.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those that are renewed to <hi>Adams</hi> image in their measure, have according
to that measure, power to act; or in those Graces there is power to act, for he
had power so to do. Every creature in the world had a Law of Nature to carry
them to their end; and so were carried to it. But <hi>Adam</hi> had a Law of Divinity,
whereby he being a cause by Counsel, was enabled by God to carry himself to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his end. Now we are renewed to that image in part, Eph. 4. 24. I know there is
difference between <hi>Adams</hi> power to act, which had no Faith, ours that hath. And
do not think that this doth advance nature, &amp; the power of man, no more than the
execution of the Promise of the Covenant of Grace, doth destroy Grace and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
nature. For the writing again the Law in our hearts, is that which this
Covenant promiseth; nay, this doth honour the riches of Grace: that a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the power of sin, and cannot get deliverance, the Lord should now
give an humble conquering Spirit: never a precious heart but will be thankful
for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:40159:92"/>
2. Because the Graces in us, are received from the Lord Jesus his fulness,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 16. Now the Graces in Christ are not dead, but living, are not weak, but
powerful; the Spirit of Grace 'tis now triumphing in him, 'tis so in us only:
'tis in him in the highest degree, in us in a lower. And therein consists our like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. And to deny this, is to deface the Image of the
Lord Jesus; and this is part of the Beauty and Glory of Christ: hence to deny this, is
to obscure the glory of the Lord Jesus. Without Christ a Christian can do nothing:
but how doth Christ do all, by the Spirit without Graces? (I speak not of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
where 'tis without Graces as causes) No truly, as he acts, so we act in
part. Unless any will say, we have not received grace for grace; or are in no
measure like the image of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the first <hi>Adam</hi> hath conveyed to all his members a power of corruption,
then the second <hi>Adam</hi> also a power of Godliness, contrary to that, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.
yet in measure still, so as the Apostle saith, <hi>we can do nothing against the Truth,
but for the Truth.</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 8.</p>
                  <p>But what measure of power is it?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know no man that can from any ground limit the measure of it.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> For it may
be in some men in greater power, in some men in less, in the same man at one
time in a greater measure, at another time less. If one ask of trees, what measure
of fruit they can bring forth; we cannot tell, because sometime more, sometime
less: and the same tree more one year than another, and more at one time of
the year then another; for they have their winter season. Only this, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conversion he is stark dead to act, now he is alive and is not dead. And if
a man should after conversion be but in the next disposition to receive Grace,
then how could one Christian be more grown and stronger in Grace in his inner
man than another? I know not any to question this, only I speak it to cut off
their carnal hopes, that think Christ is theirs, when they have nothing, can do
nothing, and sleightly say he must do all; I cannot, I tell you the Saints can,
they cannot but love the Lord, and choose the Lord. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But must not a Christian deny himself, and alway go to Christ for power to do,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note>
and so be humble, and empty?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You must, because this is the meanes to live to Christs;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> but this doth not argue
you have no power at all. A man must pray for his <hi>daily bread,</hi> much more for
<hi>daily grace;</hi> but doth this argue a man hath no bread in his house? No, this
is the means to have it continued and blest. Easily can the Lord take away
bread, or the staff of bread. Graces extinguish not Faith, but help it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Christian can do no duty perfectly, hence must repair to Christ to help
him to do every duty better; hence though he must use that power he hath, and
do what he can, yet he must not content himself with what he hath, but seek
for more, and what a sweet life is this? What honour would here come in?
God lets in a new light into my minde, now I may and must see his truth, I saw
it yesterday, but I may and must go to Christ to do it better; I must not quench the
Spirit of prayer, but carry the key with me, and next day pray better. And thus the
soul is thankful for what it hath, and emptying it self notwithstanding that, and
daily then receiving from Christ. And I beleeve many Christians fail here:
As in the body, meat feeds and strengthens life, so I cannot live without
Christ.</p>
                  <p>But doth not this make a man trust to graces?<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To act from them is not to trust to them,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> no more then for a diligent hand
to trust to his diligence, when he acts diligently that so he may be rich.</p>
                  <p>But doth not this dishonour grace to do all by the power of it?<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Saints in heaven that are made perfectly like Christ,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and that
love the Lord perfectly, should not honour grace by this means, when as this
is it that makes them honour it most of all. As <hi>David,</hi> Lord what am I,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40159:93"/>
and my people, that we should offer willingly: So here.</p>

                  <p>SEE hence what cause of thankfulness to all the people of God,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that the Lord
should make their souls the Vessels (which he might easily and justly have
dashed in peeces) to receive and preserve this eternal anointing; I do beleeve
there is no man that knows the bitterness of sin, the plague of his own heart,
but when he sees Christ is his, yet it makes him mourn that there should be so
little suitableness between the Lord and him, so little likeness between his life
and Christ; what though the Lord love me, and yet my heart weary of him?
what though the Lord bless me, and my heart abuse him? and hence this makes
it thankful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24, 25. This is so far from dishonouring grace, as that
the Apostle makes this the matter of admiration of Gods grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3, 4.
<hi>God who is rich in mercy, when dead in sins hath quickned us:</hi> Not only quickned
our head, for hence is cause of eternal praise, but us; and hence he hath set us
up <hi>in heavenly places in him:</hi> This is the state of all men, they cannot do one
spiritual act; now that the Lord should help when all creatures left us, is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
but that it should be with such a life, even the life of Christ Jesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for the same Spirit that raised him from the dead dwells in us, and the same
Spirit that is now in glory with him, is in us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. This is mercy indeed;
that he should not only die for us, and live in heaven for us, but that he should
love so dearly as to come and live in us, that when our sins had slain him, he
should not onely come and dwell in our houses, nor onely lay his head in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
but live in our hearts, where he finds such poor welcome, and ill entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at our hands, I tell you this is wonderful, to make his habitation in us,
that before we go to live with him, he should live in us: Let them that never
knew what this meant refuse to be thankful, but if you find it so, forget not this
love, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 17. <hi>Ile send the Spirit whom the World cannot receive, because it knows
him not.</hi> The Lord sends the Spirit in common graces, and the World doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that also in prophetical and miraculous gifts, and it doth receive that; but
this Spirit which God pours on the thirsty, this Spirit with which God fills the
empty, they cannot receive this. Oh that you should have it, when as they
know it not.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence therefore take heed of not owning the Spirit in this his presence.
Do you thus requite the Lord, oh unthankful world! not so much as to own the
presence of such a friend, neither in your selves, nor yet in others. How like the
world is it to think that there is no such thing?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed therefore of not esteeming highly of it. If ever God broke
thy heart, thou wilt esteem this life, this principle as the greatest piece of love;
and say, Lord I shall account this as the greatest part of love in the world,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 68. <hi>Thou art good, oh teach me thy Statutes:</hi> Now to undervalue this,
and to account it common, and hence as no sign of love, 'tis a part of unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed of imprisoning the Spirit of grace, common truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18.
It was fearful to imprison and silence that, much more this. It was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of the Church in those days, <hi>None stirs up himself,</hi> Isai. 64. 7. What
strength the Lord gives, let me use; what I want, the Lord hath enough to help
me withal; put it to exercise, or else affliction will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Take heed of enfeebling this Principle, weakning of it: The Church of
<hi>Sardis</hi> things were ready to die in it, you should strengthen this inner man, not
weaken it, either by not feeding it with Christ, or wounding it with known sins
against Christ. Therefore let all the Churches know this, and take heed that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40159:93"/>
you do not refuse to own this: where else will you make the difference between
men, that either Churches may discern them, or you may discern, and so have
peace your selves.</p>
                  <p>Hence see the reason of that inward hypocrisie that is in many mens hearts,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> so
that the best profession of many a man is but a <hi>Scheme;</hi> an Image, a very craft<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
a very artificial form; all the duties are fair without, but sapless, liveless, within:
Here is the reason they have no inward principle of life, or if they do go to Christ,
they have no such principle within them, to carry them to him, so as to receive
life from him; and hence confess sin without sorrow or shame, petition without
thirsting, live without love, do without life, because there is no spring, but a dry
heart within; and hence they must do duty, but they must make dead work of
it, and hence all is but an appearance, and at best but a would be: This is in a great
measure in Saints when the Spirit within is quenched, but it is in full age and
strength in hypocritical hearts, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 14. when the profession of <hi>Iudah</hi> was great,
and the Prophets had scarce any thing to say against them for outside, <hi>Oh Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
wash thy heart from wickedness,</hi> there thy wo lies, it enters to the very
heart; so Christ, <hi>How can he that is evil, bring forth good fruit.</hi> And this is that
which may make men mourn, if I forsake all profession, I shame my self before
men, if not, I must blaspheme the Lords Name, and play the Hypocrite before
the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 33, 34, 35.</p>

whole, or in part, for this inward principle, being the life of Christ in us,<note place="margin">Of Caution; and sad Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note>
to deny this is to deny Christ, and to take away his life; and such the Lord will
deny before his Angels another day: When they shall say, <hi>Have we not eat and
drank in thy presence, he shall answer, I never knew you:</hi> I shall therefore here direct
my speech to four sorts.</p>
                  <p>First, To those that deny created graces in the Saints peculiar unto them only, its
said there are none such in the Country, if there are not, it may be there have
been, and it may be will be, and therfore ile speak: For I beleeve 'tis a delusion dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and hatcht out of the steam of the lowest sink in Hell: And therefore that
all may take heed of the evill of it, I will first shew the evill of it, then the
causes that do beget it.</p>
                  <p>I. The evils of this delusion are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It settles and fastens a man under the power of all his sin, and yet with a
quiet Conscience, and yet to keep his Christ too. It transcends my capacity from
whatever I have read, or have heard, or have felt, or can imagine how the power
of sin can be taken away, but where the Spirit infuseth the contrary grace; an
empty house swept and garnished with common gifts, is but a fitting house for
Satan to return into: Say therefore a man may have no such graces, and yet have
Christ, and them in Christ, you stake this man down under his sin, and make this
member of Satan, a member of Christ Jesus. And upon this ground all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the Land may be forced in Conscience to take in all prophane members,
if they plead Christ, and their allness in him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This blurs all the glory of a Christian, or at least the greatest part of it:
For what is the glory of a Saint? 'Tis to be like Jesus Christ the Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to bear his Image before God and men: As to see a man with a Swines face
would be the shame of a man; to see a Christian with Satans Image, is the shame
of a Christian; but to be like our Head, this is our glory, though it be in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. heavenly, humble, compassionate, holy, as he was; and hence
when God hath a mind to make Churches or Christians base in the eyes of the

world, he will withdraw here, and when he intends to draw the world after him,
he will glorifie it with his glory, <hi>Isai.</hi> 60. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It cuts off a Christian from all hope of glory, how many be there that
scramble and catch at Christ, and every one saith he is mine, The proud man
saith, he is mine, and hopes now verily to be saved, but that hope is vain; they
have Christ out of them, but where is Christ in them? The life of Christ, and the
Spirit of Christ? <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Christ in you, the hope of glory.</hi>

                  <p>II. The Causes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A magnifying Christ, and making him our Sanctification, when as you

we lie,</hi> &amp;c. And hence it seems they denied men to have sin, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. boasting
of fellowship with Christ, <hi>vers.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because there are (say men) onely immediate actings of the Spirit. If
this be so, then there is seeing in a Christian without an eye, and hearing without
an ear, and knowing Christ without an understanding, and loving without love,
and living without life, and feeding and eating without a mouth; and then when
these actings are over, a Christian is like another man, there is no Law remains
written on his heart, and so Christ should enter into his Saints, like Satan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Serpent, who only acts the Serpent, and when that is done, he remains
a Serpent again. Know it, the Lord Jesus his greatest work is not onely to
change the acts, but to change the frame of the heart, not only to put new acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but a new nature into men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because men know not the Spirit, never felt the presence, not power, nor
comfort of it themselves; and hence men do as some Countries, because them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

with a curse from God: A man hath been a dry Professor long, Conscience
saith, There is no grace in the heart, and hence is troubled; True, saith he,
there is none in Saints, it is in Christ, and there he catcheth and deceives himself.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Those that do acknowledge them, but any power or activity in them
they deny; they say there is oyl indeed in the Vessel, but it helps not, 'tis no means
to make the Lamp to burn or shine; there is the life of Christ, but it is a dead
life, they call them the graces of Christ, but they are but fruitless graces. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it, if you consider them without the Spirit of Christ, they are no true graces,
much less active or living ones; but consider them thus, they have a power, as
take the least grain of corn, there is a growing power in it, &amp; fructifying too in it by
dying first, though it actually doth not fructifie presently, and though there must
be rain, and Sun must shine also, and a providence accompanying of it, so it is
in the graces of Saints: And hence its called a <hi>Law of the mind,</hi> there is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of a Law, as of sing and hence as Christ grew in wisdome and stature, so all the
members of Christ are like unto him.</p>
                  <p>I. The evill of this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This abates of the excellency of grace, as from a Jewel to take away the

God, not weak; which is living, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> dead. This is not like the glorious Graces
of Saints triumphing. This makes the Graces of Saints of less excellency then
common Graces: common Grace will make a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ide over many a sin, and run
exceeding fast, though he fall at last. A man that hath bin angry, it will make him
very quiet and still, and is there no more power in this?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This will make a man content himself with a bare form, with a false confidence
if this be true. For take a man that hath bin long seeking to get strength against
a vile heart, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e finds none; there is no power of heavenliness, he is earthy;
no meekness, he is proud; I would say to him, do you ever think to get any power
of meekness, love, faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You shall never do it, never have it here; all your
strength is immediatly from Christ, look for it there; in conscience a man must
cease there. And 'tis certain all our strength is in, and from the Lord; but 'tis dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
mediatly, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16. Paul prays <hi>he may be strengthned with might in the
inner man.</hi> Or thus, a man may not pray for strength of Grace, which <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then the Saints if they be asked whether they believe, or can love the Lord
Jesus; their answer must be, no I have no power to love, nor beleeve, and then
<hi>Peter</hi> did ill to answer so, <hi>Lord thou knowest that I love thee.</hi> Then <hi>Paul</hi> to say,
<hi>We can do nothing but for the Truth.</hi> Then that Martyr that to then that said, <hi>the
Lord strengthen you:</hi> yes saith he, the Lord doth. I know if the Lord withdraw his
Spirit, we are gone, as <hi>Adam;</hi> but is there not the immutable assistance of it? Is
there not the Promise, <hi>I will never leave thee,</hi> though sometimes weaker, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
stronger?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This will make a Christian hide and not improve his Talents; he hath Grace,
but no power to put it forth. Then suppose God gives power to see Truth one
day, I must not see it with this eye the next; but look up to Christ, and say, I
cannot see at all.</p>
                  <p>II. Causes of this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In opposing the outward principle of life, or first principle, and this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, I have no power to act my self
in any measure, because all my strength is in him. Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> if this were true, a
man might argue, because all Grace is originally in Christ, hence no Grace in
me, because all Glory is in Christ originally; hence no Glory shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to me. No, this Scripture reconciles these: <hi>Because I live, therefore
you shall live also,</hi> John 14. 19. Because Christ is strong, hence he will make us
strong in the inner man, and not in the Spirit only: because Christ is glorious,
hence we are predestinated <hi>to be made like unto him.</hi> Because all sap lies in the
root, to say therefore there is no sap or power in the branch to fructifie; this is false.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The hypocritical activity of false Professors, who having no spring to feed their
wells, no Christ, nor bucket to draw from him; hence are their own men, and set up

as to go through se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Grace of Christ in him to go from land to sea to make Christians.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sloth, A man sets upon a duty, and now because he cannot do it easily, nor
quickly, he cannot do it at all. A man would have Grace active without means;
and God will not help in that way: and hence many Christians cannot cleave to
Christ by love, or desire; no, so long as they pore upon their wants, no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
but turn the mind, and consider well of the love and glory of Christ,

A man hath given special occasion for the Lord to leave him, as the Camp in

                  <p n="5">5. That hereby a man may have his sins without trouble, for a man hath bin
troubled, and cannot get power, now he heats there is no such power to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,

                  <p>Thirdly, Those that deny the evidence of it, the evil of which apprehension, I

killing thy lusts; Where is the life of the Spirit of Jesus in you? Where is the
Oyle in your vessel? Truly I look for the Bridegroom, but I regard not that,
neither are others to regard it in way of evidence. Then I say the chief evidence
is destroyed in the Churches. I have known many that have had assurances, yet
never saw them prove right, till it witnessed this was here. What should be the
causes of this, and that men should make blusters in the Churches, because of this,
as though it was building on wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hence make them all no Churches. A man is apt to think, because I have rested

of all the Church, but search your hearts, and see from what principle it proceeds,
for if this be wanting, all is naught: As he that had Beer given him, when Milk

the Milk is good, but the Beer is naught: So Profession, affection is good, but

moral performances, wherein a man saith, he doth what he can; for there is this
principle in most men, a desire to be saved, nature saith so, and according to the

sooth up themselves, when they see they cannot do as others do, or as the Lord
commands; I do as well as I can. Nay, when condemned by the Word which
meets them, I do as well as I can, I beleeve, I repent, I pray, I remember the
Word, I do as well as I can, and so they hope God accepts of that; and though
I beleeve no man but may be hired to do more than he doth, yet nature may do
much; hence I heard an Arminian once say, If faith will not will not work it, then set
reason a work, and we know how men have been Kings and Lords over their own
passions by improving reason, and from some experience of the power of nature,
men have come to write large Volumes in defence of it; and its known the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi>
though they ascribe somewhat to grace, and in words all to grace, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they lay the main stress of the work upon a mans own will, and the royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

all I do is full of weaknesses, yet I do what I can; and thus they are like to men
that have old garments new dressed, they have made them as good as they can; and

is of the will and power of man, but oh this is not this inward principle which the
Almighty power of God creates; and therefore know it, if you get no other oyle

                  <p n="2">2. When a mans principle is the power of holy example, whereby many a one
is drawn to do more than otherwise he would. Many men think for a while as that
man spake; Men talk of being worth thousands, I would fain see the men. Ministers
preach and others speak well, we must do this &amp; that, but I would fain see the men
that do it. Now it sometime falls out that the Lord sets before mens eyes some
pattern-Christians, hereupon they think thus; here are two contrary ways, they
cannot both lead to heaven, their way is better than mine, and doubtless leads to
life, mine doth not, and therefore let me live like the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hear it; nor any duty in Family, but they will imitate it, and hence read and
learn, that they may be like them. No Christians in the Country hated, but they
will love them, nor Ceremonies cast off, but they will abhor them; and hence
they reflect upon their patterns, and think their estate safe, because they are as
good as a Christians outside: And hence like some dead C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

good but their skin; so there is nothing good in these, but their imitating out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
Thus it was with <hi>Ioash</hi> while <hi>Iehoiada</hi> lived, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. Hence he fell
like Ivy with the Oak, when God cut him down: Thus it was with these five fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

imitating the wicked, not from imitating the good; because good men may be
in many things ill examples, and it ever proves so in these men that have no
more then this Principle; hence if they be loose in their tongues, or on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
their plea is, they are like unto them. And hence come all your acquired

                     </gap>; a man is an imitating creature, led by example, and a carnal man
out of the heart of hypocrise in himself, will imitate the divine nature which
is in another; and hence men not only take up such practises, but such opinious
only, because such and such are of that mind: And hence men change practises
and opinions as Examples do change; in <hi>Ioshua's</hi> time great Reformation, he no

Gods Worship, now they serve <hi>Baalim:</hi> Oh consider, here is an outward, but

                  <p n="3">3. Those whose principle is nothing but external applause and praise of men,
and this will carry a man beyond all the best Examples: Nay, sometime to be
singular, and a man alone; a Pharisees Trumpet shall be heard to the Townes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,
while simplicity walks thorow the Town unseen: Hence a man will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
covertly commend himself, and my self ever comes in, and tells you a long
Storie of Conversion, and an hundred to one, if some lie or other flip not out with
it. Why, the secret meaning is, I pray admire me, hence complain of wants
and weaknesses; pray think what a broken-hearted Christian I am; and hence
if comforted they complain, if not, they will comfort themselves; hence many
lift up eyes and hands, and fetch deep sighs in prayer, remember and note Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
look now what a gift I have: Hence if you come to their companie, they
will have so many good words as may make you think well of them, and then the
Market is almost done with them: Hence men forsake their friends, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
underfoot the scorns of the world, they have credit elsewhere: To maintain
their interest in the love of godly men they will suffer much: Hence men in the
Ministry pray for grace to beautifie and perfect their parts, that so they may preach
and convert and have credit: Hence men meditate new Light, and profess deep
things that few know, that men may worship the rising Sun: Hence the Lord is
neglected secretly, yet honoured openly, because there is no winde in their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to blow their Sails, and therefore there they stand still: Hence many men
keep their profession, when they lose their affection, they have by the one a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to live, and that is enough, though their hearts be dead: And hence so long as you
love or commend them, so long they love you, but if not, they will forsake you;
they were warm onely by anothers fire; and hence having no principle of life
within, soon grow dead: This is the water that turns a Pharisees Mill, and the
Lord passeth a heavy doom, <hi>You have your reward.</hi> I have wondred that the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of men, nay, dream of mens thoughts should act men; onely 'tis a curse of
God, that when men despise his honour the greatest good, they shall be fed with
the basest good.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Those whose Principle is nothing else but their own gain of outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.
Many there be that make not their honour, so much as their bellies their
gods, and thy rule them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. hence the Shop-keeper will give good words

Hence people would be as good as the best, they cannot get a lot in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
else. Hence a man is somtime content to forsake all for Christ, that he may
make a booty of Christ, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did. Hence when Christ feeds them with
Loaves, then the people will make him a King, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. though afterward they cry
<hi>Crucifie him.</hi> So men deal with Christ as the Souldiers did, that caught him,
that they might strip him of his garments. And hence many men if they see sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and wants attending them, if they attend on Christ, forsake him. Look
upon our own Land, many so long as they could enjoy Christ with fair weather,
cry out of Ceremonies, and prophaning of Sabbath: yet this not being to be had,
creep to them, and read the Book for prophaning thereof. Many shadows
have been seen since our Sun hath risen here, and this way they looked: but
viewing other mens wants, and fearing their own losses, and conceiving they
may meet with <hi>Massah</hi> in this Wilderness, refuse to follow. And least this
should seem to be the cause, cry out we are Separatists, or strongly possess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against all relations, there is no living at all here.</p>
                  <p>Look but at home, how many Dove; (that prove but Ravens, and live on the prey)
come hither to our windows, and have followed Christ to this Worlds end; when
he fed them with loaves, they made him their King: but now he hath taken away
what once they desired; because there is better Bread to be laboured for; now
they forsake him, and live on the spoyl. This is no inward Principle. And hence
when mens Expences for Christ, exceed their Receipts from Christ, they cease
spending, and fall in the high way to begging at the door of the World.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Those whose Principle is nothing else but the strength of natural Conscience,
which will set men a doing, when they have neither praise from men, nor gain
from Christ for their labour. For the Lord deals with some men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>as the <hi>Romans</hi>
did with some of their Prisoners; they would chain a Prisoner and his keeper to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and let them go up and down: so God chains many a poor Prisoner of
hell and his conscience together, and lets them go together. And hence many a
man keeps pace with his conscience, and cannot give it the slip for all the world
heaped up with gold, as <hi>Balaam</hi> said.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two things in a natural conscience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To accuse, Hence a man dares not omit prayer, dares not commit a sin
he hath a mind to; conscience would then roar. Hence many keep constantly
set duties in private, and tremble at small sins: not because they take any delight
in the one, or are weary of the other; but because they are ever under the eye of
this Judge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Excuse, and to give much sweetness when a man follows the dictates
thereof; hence a man though carnal, will die for his Religion, and that with some
chearfulness, because conscience chears within, and sings him asleep in trouble.
And hence a man will cry out of all the glorious hypocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ies of men, because to
walk according to Conscience is sweeter to him. And hence a man comforts
himself, tis my Conscience, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 33. To love God <hi>is better than burnt
Offerings.</hi> Hence a man will profit exceedingly in what he holds, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 14.
because zealous for it for Conscience: and yet this is but a Principle of Nature,
not an inward Principle of life, whose property is to seek the subversion of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature, as natural Conscience seeks the garnishings of it and the actions
thereof.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Those whose Principle is the fear of death, and hell; raised not so much by
the power of Conscience, as by the power of the Word. And hence come com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
about a mans Estate; that a man can have no rest by all duties that he
hath done, or doth. Hence following of the means, running to the best Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
mourning, and lamenting, and confessing sin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Oh generation of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40159:97"/>
&amp;c.</hi> And hence prizing of favour and Comfort, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 34, 35. Hence
many do take this for their Conversion, and say, I heard such a Minister at such a
time, and then I cryed out I was damned, and thought I saw the Devil, yea,
and to Hell you may for all this, if no other Principle. Indeed, there is this fear
in the elect, but drives them to the Ark, as <hi>Noah:</hi> But those, when their fear is
over, they fall to fight against the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Those whose Principle is nothing else but the immediate actings of the
Spirit of God upon them. For sometime the Spirit of God comes upon men, as
Light shines on the mud wall, yet dwels not there as in the Sun. And hence
many speak, pray, prophecy admirably, as <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 24. 3, 4. Many men
like Carriers bring others goods, that are not possessors of them. Now these are
1. External enlargements, and hence a man do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>h many things which he hath no
inward power to perform, the Spirit is there assisting; hence he cannot do so at
another time, but 'tis the Spirit only assisting. And hence a man may have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of knowledge, and he not affected with it; he may live, and pray with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of men; others wish they were like him, yet live without love, &amp; speak without
feeling, and do without life, hence men leave themselves here. 2. Internal
pangs, the Spirit of God begets some inward grief, especially when outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
press, then inward flashes and desires, but they are soon done. There is no
Spring, no Principle within. What the difference is between Saints uneveness,
and this unconstancy, you shall hear hereafter: yet these are wrestlings of Spirit
not yet conquering, and hence it possesseth not the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When men; Principle is nothing else but common gifts, which are inward,
and abiding long in the Soul. That a man now thinks he hath Grace, and sure
signes of the Lords love, and here is fastned: when there be two things wherein
it appears here is no inward Principle. 1. These gifts ever puff up, and make a man
something in his own eyes, as the <hi>Corinthian</hi> knowledge did. And many a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man thinks himself fit to be a Minister, many a Minister better than all the
Parish besides; when <hi>Paul</hi> was the least of all the Saints. And hence commonly
they degenerate to pride &amp; form. 2. These keep men strangers to Christ, &amp; the life
of Faith; they have these affections, yet ignorant of Christ, take these as signes of his
love, &amp; live without him. And this is indeed the inner Principle which all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the world want; there is in true Grace an infinite circle: a man by thirsting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
&amp; receiving thirsts for more. But hence the Spirit is not poured out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
on Churches, because men shut it out by shutting in, and contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their common graces and gifts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 29. Examine if it be thus. If so,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You cannot come to the Lord, John, 5. 44. <hi>how can ye beleeve</hi>?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor to receive any thing from the Lord if you do, Jam. 4. 3. <hi>When you ask

                  <p n="3">3. This puls down the Kingdome of the Lord Jesus, when other things rule us,

To what purpose are <hi>your new Moons,</hi> Church-reformations, if it be thus? Now,
because it hath been replyed to what was formerly said, that Christ was the vessel,
not our Souls. I shall therefore confirm the latter to be the truth, by these reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Mystical places of Scripture are to be interpreted by plain. Now though
Christ may be the Antitype of these Vessels of the Temple, yet he is not plainly
said to be a Vessel; but Souls are called so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 15.
<hi>Paul is a chosen Vessel.</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 4. <hi>we are to possess our Vessels in holiness.</hi> 2 Tim.
2. 20. <hi>Vessels of honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit is not in Christ as in a Vessel, but as in a fountain; hence <hi>Ioh.</hi>
3. 34. <hi>Christs hath received the Spirit without measure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The foolish Virgins had Vessels; because its sayd, <hi>they took their Lamps,
but no Oyle with them.</hi> Their folly was not in not providing Vessels. Hence the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40159:98"/>
Virgins did not afterward beg their Vessels, but their Oyle.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The wisdome of the Wise did appear, in that they did provide Oyle for
their Vessels. If therefore the Vessel be Christ, therein lyes the wisdom of the
Wise, that they got the Spirit for to put into Christ, and the folly of the foolish,
they got not the Spirit to put into him. Or the one go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Spirit; the other, Christ Jesus void of it. When whoever hath Christ, must
have in him the fulness of the Spirit also.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The other interpretation crosseth the main scope of this part of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which is to shew the difference between the Virgins; all professed Christ,
went to meet the Bridegroom; but here was the difference, they never looked for
to get the Spirit in them: and this is most suitable to men raised out of the dregs
of Popery, where Works being abolished, Christ is owned, and therein do well,

means? To tie the Scarlet thread at the window: Oh she would be sure to get
and keep that there. You know the Lord Jesus will come and discover the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
profession, and destroy the glory of the World, and Churches too: It may
be you have had some fears, what if he should cut me off, and cast me out as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
he may? and I may as well as eminent Professors. I tell you, none ever
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40159:98"/>
perished but because of this. How just had <hi>Rahabs</hi> judgment been, if she had
refused to get her scarlet thread there, and yours if now you get not your Oyle in
your Vessel? How many are there that have lived fairly and died quietly, and
when they are dead and knock, the door is shut: That then wring their hands, Oh
had I but known of this! I would have spent my care and strength, and tears,
and thoughts how to have filled my Vessel, but I knew it not. This time
will shortly came, and if you know it now, and do not set upon
it, what a cut will this be? As therefore the Apostle exhorts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a promise of entring into rest, fear lest you fall short of it.</hi> I say so much
more here, knowing how only you shall enter into Christs rest, fear least you
fall short of this; I hope I shall not, I thank God my course is blameless, spotless,
I have forsaken the sins of places, and pollutions of Ordinances; so these were
Virgins also. Oh but my Lamp burns as bright as any mans I know: So did the
foolish Virgins, oh but they all think well of me, so were these thought of, till
the Lord said, <hi>I know you not.</hi> Oh but I look to Christ, to meet with him, and
salvation from him; So did these, and yet were shut out from Christ. If the Lord
should have said it was because they had not wealth enough, nor world enough,
every man would not have been wanting here, but would have striven to have got
enough of that, though it were not to be had; but there is enough in Christ to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
you, who hath the Spirit without measure to do it: The Spirit may breath now.</p>
                  <p>Labour to feel and mourn under thy whole corrupt principles,<note place="margin">Means 1.</note> that have acted
thee hitherto: For many men are sensible sometimes of some particular acts,
and jarrings of their hearts and life with the rule; and then they seek forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of, and grace against them, and then they hope all is well, then they do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things, and hear <hi>Iohn</hi> gladly, and in plainness and integrity of their hearts
think that all is well. But still they fall short of a Principle of life, because they
never felt a whole corrupt Principle, and how in every thing it crosseth God, not
only in the corrupt, but most glorious actions. For all men living naturally turn
from being open, to secret enemies; and from being secret, to be subtil enemies,
and to undermine the Lord in all they do. Now many see it but not the evil of it,
nor mourn under it. Hence the Lord never sends another Spirit, because they
have not the Spirit of heaviness for want of it. But when a man sees that in
every thing he is carried and acted by a principle of bitterness against the Lord,
and lives without the Spirit of the Lord to act him; the Lord is not far from
that soul when he feels this, and mourns before the Lord, because of this, and the
want of that, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 38. So Christ said, <hi>Because I said I go away, sorrow hath
filled your hearts,</hi> John 16. 6, 7. This is the very reason why Saints have the
Comforter, his absence fills their hearts with sorrow; because when he is gone,
oh the straitness, vileness of a corrupt heart! you say it may be. If this be not a
right Principle, what is? <hi>Answ.</hi> To undermine all false works; oh therefore,
feel this plague! If ever God works this grace, feel you must the want of it, and
if you do mourn then you are under it: And oh mourn, 1. By considering the
evil of it, you can mourn after a dead father, and shall you not over a dead heart.
2. To think there should be so much Spirit in Christ, and not a drop for me.
Is he so angry with me? See therefore I pray you that you are led by ill principles,
or false principles. I pray, but self-love sets me a work; I profess, but praise of
men acts me; I observe duties in secret, but natural Conscience only carries me.
No surer sign of ruine then for the Lord to hide these things from you; nor of
love then when he shews this, and gives you not only sense of some one act, but
a spirit of heaviness under this. This empties the Vessel, and so makes us Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of honour; do not therefore set thy self so much to do, as to see where thy
evil principle is, in all thou doest.</p>

And hence useth many periwasions to himself, yet they continue so still, because
he never looks to this blood. There is this excellency in Christs blood, not only
to cleanse from guilt, and power of sin, but from dead works, and none else can.
Now therefore repair hither for it; know what your lives will and must cost.
Now how shall this be done?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Prize this blood, and satisfie thy Soul with it, choose it, and rest in
it, in the Lord himself as sufficient, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 53. <hi>Except you eat and drink, &amp;c.</hi>
many account it a common thing; you receive it not then, but trample it under
their feet, many esteem of it, but they feed not themselves with it, nor quiet
their hearts with life there first: and hence it falls out thus.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Keep this Rule, content not thy self with that measure which thou hast
from Christ, but be thankful for it, and falling short, call ever for more; but satiate
thy self with that which is in Christ.</p>
                  <p>If thou canst not do this, and it is beyond thy strength, then consider Christ
hath words of life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. Oh beg for that, and for those words! <hi>Hear what
the Lord will say, Psal.</hi> 51. 8. You cannot see nor come to Christ: Then <hi>hear,
and your souls shall live.</hi> Who knows what the Lord may do. 'Tis not possible
for man to do it, but the Lord Jesus may and can.</p>
                  <p>Oh then you that have this Principle,<note place="margin">Use 6.</note> Let all your actions issue and spring from
hence! As <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted <hi>Timothy, Stir up that gift that is in thee. Up Deborah,
up. Awake Harp and Lute,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> Do not say, I can do nothing, and so the
Lord must do all. Do not say, I have a dead heart, and can do nothing, but stir it up.
It was the Lords complaint, Isa. 64. 7. <hi>None took hold of the Lord nor stirred up
himself</hi> to that end. It may be some of you have some strength. Oh put it
forth? I know all strength is from Christ, but there is a pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>manent strength in
you. You are not dead to act, you wrong the Lord and his Grace if you think
so. As 'tis a heavy sin to shut up and imprison natural truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. So
much more the power of Grace. Others have lost it, oh recover it! And hence
<hi>Paul</hi> praies for this earnestly, Eph. 3. 15. <hi>The Lord strengthen you with might in the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40159:99"/>
inner man.</hi> And therefore put this forth to act, and be sure you act only from
this Spirit of Grace.</p>
                  <p>How shall I do this?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Set the Lord Jesus in all his Glory before you.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> There is that excellency of
the knowledge of Christs Person, that it makes us be and live like him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the propinquity of our souls and eyes to Christ, so we are like him, As

                     </gap>tis with the Sun, when it is gone from the earth, there are not so much as leaves
on the Trees, yet when it returns, the Trees bring forth fruit. Or as 'tis in
Heaven, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 2. so in this life, when we see him in a Glasse, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.
That look as 'tis with an ambitious man, when he is in the presence of men he
will manifest all his excellency, nothing shall be done to gain discredit. So if
the Lord and his life be your excellency, when you see Christ, you will approve
your selves to him. See him therefore beholding and accepting; and that Grace
you would put forth, see it in him: 'tis strange to see what a stream of spirit
comes somtimes this way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Keep the remembrance of the exceeding greatnesse of his love fresh in your
minds, in that <hi>he hath quickned you, Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5. and that this life was by his
death. All the Flowers of the field cast their savour but for a time, and then
away with them; but Christs love and Christs death do usually alwaies breath a
savour of life to a sincere heart that ever knew what the sting of death meant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 14, 15. Christs love constrains, because he dies that we should live. But
how? Because we thus judged. God hath made man an Agent by counsel.
Now some Christians go to the Lord to help them, but set not prayer of Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
and hence have no water of life: Some do, but use not other means to
set the understanding (the mind of Faith) on work, to quicken it up to act, and
so would have life brought in, but not by the right door: An empty Vessel will
not be full of this water till now, that the mouth of the understanding is open.
Now many things are to be considered to act every Grace, as Gods Command
and Promise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is that which in the general quickens, oh Christs love
which constrains the Soul to live to him! According as a man thus receives from
Christ, so he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>urns to him. As 'tis observed, one sign that when a people visit
not their Minister, they receive no good; so here: That is sign of a decaying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
for usually they that get good by Christ, cannot by their good will stay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from Christ. So then the soul will return in all fruitful obedience to
the Lord, when he receives the sweet of the Love of the Lord. The Lord doth
me good methinks, and hence he follows the Lord. Satan hence prevails with the
heart, because of his external objects, and a party within; so here Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails,
because there is a party within, when external Objects are propounded.
Let a man have life, if he have no food he will never live. If bread be before
him, and he feed not on it, and that abundantly, he will never have strength,
so this love of Christ in us, is life in us, and food for us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Famish the contrary principle, the strength whereof is by sucking in the
sweet, and receiving in carnal content from the creature, Rom. 13. 14. <hi>Put on
the Lord Iesus,</hi> his Spirit, his Righteousnesse, his Life, his Graces, <hi>Make no
provision for the Flesh.</hi> Many Christians look up to Christ in all means, but can
do nothing, because they have some delight either in lawful or unlawful things,
that lies between him and Christ. Hence that grows strong, the other fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Die to all self-confidence in Grace received, or self-contentment with any
measure of it; for thereby you stop the Spirit: For we of our selves cannot think
a good thought. Therefore be strong in Christ, and hence <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 10, 11, 12. A
man is apt to fall to a double extream, to be strong in the Lord without putting
on Graces; and to trust to them without being strong in him. Corn must die
before it lives, so must you: and rest not content with the measure received, but look
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40159:100"/>
for more, and hence be thankful, and say, 'tis not I but Christ; yet look for
more.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If no means come to give strength, consider sadly if you have not broken
covenant with God, as in <hi>Samsons</hi> case, God was in covenant with him, but he
had broken it on his part, hence his strength was gone. I know no place that
breeds men of larger Covenants than this place, by Sea and Land, personall,
and especially Church-Covenants. Now thy strength is gone. Dost not live
in breach of Covenant? Not only it is broken, but you live in it. You cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to cleave to the Lord, or if you depart, to return soon again, but you lie in
your falls. Nay your Covenant and returning heals your horrour only, not your
sin. You covenant to love Brethren dearly, but a little offence one gives; or
hopes of a bigger Lot, will tempt thy heart to leave them to their own shifts.
You covenant to submit to Officers in the Lord, but some take liberty to speak
what they will, and others do what they list. To watch over your brethren to
put life in them, but you grow a stranger, and it may be see them not once in a
quarter, unlesse at Church: But can it be said they are any better for thee? Oh
your sins are double, and hence your plagues of heart are worse now, more hard
to be wrought upon, and hence sin and Satan lead you, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 57, 60, 61. Oh
consider this sin, the strength of God is taken as Captain of the Camp, that
when you cry, Lord help, there 'tis. But alas 'tis gone from you, and 'tis in
Satans hand, not only your strength, but Gods strength, and the soul is taken
captive. Oh therefore mourn for this, lest you mourn at last.</p>

Grace in the hearts of the Faithful, which the most Glorious, yet unsound
Professors of Virgin-Churches want, and have not in their Vessels, but fall
short of.</p>
                  <p>Just as these Foolish Virgins, they had their Lamps, a burning and shining
Profession. And had they no more? Yes surely, for their Lamp how could it
burn, but by means of some Oyl? They had their wiek toucht and dipt in Oyl,
some lighter stroaks and superficial impressions of the Spirit. They had not their
Vessels filled with Oyl, they had not this degree and full measure of the Spirit.
This they fell short of, and herein appeared the difference. There are certain
inward touches, an inward lighter Dye of Gods Spirit, which serves to beget a
most eminent Profession before men, but never to make the Soul sincere indeed
before the eyes of God. That look as some Naturalists make three or four kinds
of life, differing only as higher or lower degrees of life, though not of the same
life; as Plants have a Vegetative life only to grow, but no sensitive to see; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40159:100"/>
their forms are more drowned in their matter; sensitive in beasts, yet not
rational; rational in men, but not Angelical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So here; a greater degree
of the Spirits working, makes a difference in kind between Christian and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
'Tis the Spirit that makes a man live a civil moral life, 'tis the same Spirit
by a greater stroke, makes a man live the life of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. Yet here are
two kinds of lives as far different as sensitive and vegetative; and though the
rational hath both, yet 'tis neither of both. So though a Saint lives the life of
reason and morality, yet there is another life he hath, which doth differ from
these of a higher degree, and of another kind. I do not say therefore that a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
soul only hath a greater degree of the same Grace, but that he is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a greater degree of Grace and working of the Spirit of Grace from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
heart. As a man may love another, but not with a conjugal love, here
is now a degree of love, but not of the same love, for 'tis not a whit conjugal;
it might then be sinful in some men, so 'tis here. A man that hath filled his
stom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re, not in
that degree; hence not hungry at all. So <hi>the sluggard desires and hath not,</hi> a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

and hath not, but another hungers and is filled; he hath not any degree of
the same hunger. 'Tis therefore granted there are desires, and joyes, and light,
and growth in false hearts, but there is not that fulnesse of joy, that fulnesse of
light, that fulnesse of the Spirit which is in the Faithful, and here they ever fall
short. Yet note,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is not a perfect measure; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I. That Hypocrites may have not only outward shews, but some inward lighter
stroaks of Gods Spirit. As</p>

<hi>Paul</hi> was blameless, nay he had no mind nor will to many sins, nay did not think
he had any living contempt and enmity of God in his heart. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9.
'tis said, <hi>When the Command came sin revived.</hi> Was it not living before? Yes,
but it was asleep, it was benummed, like cold Snakes, but not killed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the Spirit preventing and exciting unto many, nay, to any duty of the

Covenant?</hi> Yes, yet what is said of them? Psal. 78. 37. <hi>They were false in Gods
Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There may be some operative and quickning Grace of the Gospel, Heb. 6. 4.
<hi>They were enlightened,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There may besome edifying and cooperating gifts of Law and Gospel,
whereby a man may not only be useful and helpful to some, but to the Church
of God, as those that did prophecy in Christs Name. And these may be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that they think themselves clean and sincere; as <hi>Abimelech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. That the reason of their unsoundness is because they have no more than
lighter stroaks of Gods Spirit.</p>
                  <p>As I might shew in all these, <hi>Paul</hi> is blamelesse, yet far enough from having
sin mortified by Christ, and hence professeth, <hi>We did serve divers Lusts, Tit.</hi> 3. 3.
The <hi>Israelites</hi> cry out, they <hi>will do what God will have them:</hi> Yet <hi>Oh that there
were such an heart! Deut.</hi> 5. 29. They in Heb. 6. <hi>were enlightened and tasted,</hi>
yet fell. He therefore adds, <hi>We are perswaded</hi> (v. 9.) <hi>better things of you.</hi> They
did <hi>prophesie in Christs Name,</hi> Mat. 7. Yet <hi>depart from me you workers of iniquity.</hi>
But see it more particularly, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 33. Saith the Scribe to him, <hi>To love the
Lord,</hi> oh '<hi>tis better than all burnt Offerings.</hi> Some <hi>Iews</hi> did rest there, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the inward work; but this man, the inward work was prized in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he had both profession and some affection: And was he now entred into
the Kingdome of God? No. Here was his wound, he fell short of it some
degrees. Hence its said, <hi>thou art not far from the Kingdom of God.</hi> So the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
Why did not they enter? Was not the Land good? Oh yes! That
report the worst of the Spies brought: But their hearts were not taken with the
goodness of it, as <hi>Calebs</hi> and <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> were. And hence they were shut out,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 27. &amp; 14. 7, 8, 24. So it is here. So an unsound heart may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,
as 'tis there, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. But there is a marvellous light which they
never have, they have not such a degree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. And hence, Deut. 29. 2, 3, 4.
<hi>The Lord hath not given you eyes to see to this day.</hi> Did the Lord give them no eyes
to see, no hearts to be affected with what they did see? Why came they then
out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> Why did they sing when they saw <hi>Pharaoh</hi> drowned? Why
they had not such eyes and such hearts as <hi>Moses</hi> had, not unto that day.</p>
                  <p>So for turning to the Lord. Do not many unsound hearts turn over a new
leaf? Do they not, not only outwardly, but inwardly too? Where is the flaw
then? In the degree, Jer. 3. 10. <hi>Iudah hath not turned with her whole heart, but
treacherously.</hi> So there may be some growth and life in false unsound hearts,
that may after fall away: But where is the wound? Look in the Parable of the
Seed; Some grew not at all; some did grow, but not having depth of earth, fell
again: Others fell not in persecution, but there were the roots of Thorns that
choakt the Seed; the good grounds seed came to ripenesse and fulness of fruit,
though some in a greater degree than others; yet none at all (no ripe fruit) in
the rest. Hence the Lord is said to <hi>weigh the heart, Prov.</hi> 16. 2. Men think they
are humbled, and do believe, but God finds them too light, as <hi>Belshazzar was
weighed and found too light.</hi> And thus it will be seen at the last day, when Christ
Jesus shall appear, that all the most glorious Profession of many a man is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rejected, because found too light.</p>
                  <p>III. That there is a fulnesse which the Saints have, and which others fall short
of. Which I shall shew,</p>
                  <p>I. Positively and affirmatively from what hath been said, Prov. 12. 26. <hi>The
righteous is more excellent.</hi> John 14. 17. <hi>Whom the world cannot receive, because it
knows him not.</hi> There is that Spirit in Saints which no unregenerate man knows,
hence desires not. Because he dwells in you, he doth not only send some gifts,
or work somwhat there, but he dwells there, he fils the heart. Hence the end
of Christs death is, <hi>to purchase to himself a peculiar people, Tit.</hi> 2. 14. Of such a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40159:101"/>
spirit, such holiness that only themselves know. So 'tis that which all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
press to, to a higher pitch; and hence that charge of <hi>Iosh.</hi> 22. 5. And 'tis
a peculiar fruit of Election, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. 1. <hi>To be holy.</hi> 2. <hi>Before him.</hi> 3. <hi>In
love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. Negatively. If there should not be such a distinguishing fulness,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then the whole Ministry of Christ is in vain; and so destroyed, for what
is the end of that, that God raiseth up any Ministers in the Church, but this, <hi>Acts</hi>
26. 18. <hi>To turn men from darknesse to light.</hi> If this light was only that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
then the end of the Ministry was to work hypocrisie. <hi>And from the power of Satan
to God,</hi> there the Lord leaves them not, but <hi>that they may receive remission of sins,</hi>&amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there should not be this fulness, most of the Promises should be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Gods Faithfulness fail, and the Saints be deceived. For Promises are
made to them that mourn, to them that hunger, to them that believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now
many Hypocrites mourn, and desire, and the stony ground believed. Then it
seems the promise is not true. Yes, and therefore there must be another kind
of mourning, another and higher degree of the Spirit of Faith, <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> not of
the same Faith, but of another kind of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If not, then all Christian endeavour after a higher measure of Grace should
be destroyed. For if any man only hath Christ in his eye, that he may have
him, I say that is sweet; but I say you shall never have him, unless you receive
him. Oh but many receive him! as <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 23. yet Christ <hi>commited not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to them, for he saw what they were.</hi> Now therefore if you regard not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<hi>i. e.</hi> such a kind of receiving of him, you will never seek for it, pray for it,
nor learn to know it. And hence 'tis said, Prov. 15. 24. <hi>The way of life is above
to the righteous,</hi> If it were not above, of that height, he would never come over
difficulties to it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If not, there is no true hope that any man can have: But 'tis utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
1 John 3. 3. <hi>He that hath this hope purgeth himself.</hi> I am as good as
such a one: But, <hi>as Christ is pure.</hi> That is his Copy and his Pattern.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The very people of God are destroyed from having a being in the world, if
this measure makes not the difference. If it be replied, the Lord Jesus makes the
difference. 'Tis very true, those that are in Covenant, they have God to
be their God, that makes one difference; but if there be not some peculiar work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
of the Spirit in them, then though they have God their God, yet the
second part of the Covenant is destroyed, <hi>i. e.</hi> They are not the Lords peculiar
people that have more than common wash-work. For we are not only the Lords
people by choyce and purchase, but by new Creation also, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 7, 8, 9.</p>

upon and breathing in your hearts at any time, in any means. Because you
may then fall short of this measure of it, and so be shut out at last. Look as it

                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>nce they were pricks,
nay snares to them. So the Lord begins to work strangely upon some men, but
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40159:102"/>
they are presently humble enough, and have comfort enough; and Grace enough,
and cannot be better, and hence God makes their sins snares and thorns to their
sorrow and ruine afterward. Nay Beloved, many a one will quench the Spirit.
Oh take heed of it! Thus,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Spirit not only convinceth, but humbles his heart, and shake; his
spirit with fears of sin. Now what should he do? He should welcom it, and
say, oh blessed Spirit, dost begin to cast me down to the dust for my sin, before
I am cast to Hell for my sin! What wilt have me to do? Oh humble me more.
Give me not only an act of heaviness, but a spirit of heaviness! As she said of
affliction, <hi>I pray God this Plaister may never cease cleaving, till healed.</hi> Now what
do many men? Why either game it, or work it, or sleep it away. The young
man will not so soon lose all his mirth: The man that hath thought his estate
good so long, will not believe 'tis so with him now. Or as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>isement, and so casts it off, and catcheth
hold on Christ and comfort, and there staies, before the Spirit hath done it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If they dare not shake it off thus till the Spirit easeth, then they satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
themselves with some hopes the Lord gives, and some tast of his sweetness,
before they are satisfied with it, as those did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. And hence Psal. 90. 14.
<hi>Oh satisfie us with thy mercy, so shall we be glad all the daies of our lives!</hi> So satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
as to live upon it alone. As many say, they could be contented it should be
so, but they do not live upon it. As if you should ask a man, could you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be made King, and come from Beggery? Yes; but he is left there,
'tis not so; and hence lives a Beggar still. Men cannot live without their lusts.
Yet saith Christ, <hi>My flesh is meat indeed, and drink indeed, i. e.</hi> This gives real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
satisfaction indeed. And here many a Christian sinks, and goes up
and down short of saving good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence many walk in some desires which the Spirit hath wrought, but to
break through all difficulties, and follow the Lord indeed, and come to that they
know they must indeed, this they will not do, but depart from Christ sorrowful,
and hope the Lord will accept of them; and hence the Lord complains, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8.
of this generation that had desires in their flocks, but lame ones. <hi>Will thy King
accept this?</hi> And so all their work is overly and superficial by stinting the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Thus far you shall go but no farther. Oh Beloved, this is the frame of a
sincere heart, the Lord empties him, but he is never content till the Lord fills;
and when he finds it, he sits not down content that the work is done, but as his
want made him beg before, so his tast makes him long more now, as <hi>Moses,</hi> to
see more of the Lords Glory: As <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13. Oh therefore when the
Spirit comes, intreat it to go on and finish. And hence <hi>David</hi> begs, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
132. Oh <hi>the mercy that thou usest to shew to them that love thy Name!</hi> Why so?
Oh <hi>David</hi> saw mercy to others, that sets God awork to do somwhat for them, work
somwhat in them, but 'tis not such mercy. Oh beg for that mercy that humbled
others, quickned others, that are now in Glory; that, or no mercy Lord!</p>

                        <item>1. A Fulness of humiliation for sin.</item>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. Fulness of humiliation under sin, opposite to fulness of sin.</p>
                  <p>For every hypocritical heart hath commonly some humiliation and casting
down, which is the first Principle of all his Profession, and hence can tell you of
his miserable estate that once he lived in, and for which he was troubled, but
it was never deep enough. For as there was before his terrifying, a full power,
a fulness of the dominion of sin, his humiliation for sin, never reached, never
came to that fulness or measure, so as to deliver the soul from that. For I do not
account that true humiliation whereby a mans heart is rent, troubled and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with sin, but whereby 'tis rent from sin; not from the being, but from
the power, not from the bondage of some, but yet from the power of all. For if
rending with sin should be humiliation, then the Devils should be more humbled
then any. Then also a man may have too much of humiliation, and of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
If rending from the being of all sin should be humiliation, then no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40159:103"/>
should be sincerely humbled; unless we dream of an est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>te of perfection
before it comes, and of the day of triumph in the time of warfare. If rending
from the bondage of some sins should be humiliation, then a man might be
truly humbled for sin, and yet under the power of it. And therefore look as
in every one the Lord humbles, there was once a fulness of the reign and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of sin in the full strength of it; so that full measure of Humiliation which
the Lord works in his, it ever comes to that height, as to break that power down,
<hi>Ehud</hi> -like, it not only wounds the flesh, but leaves the dagger in the heart of this
Tyrant; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are mighty to cast down every
thing that exalts it self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I should leave this Point thus, I should but leave you as doubtful as you
came, and so in the dark; therefore for the better clearing of this Point, let me
explain five things to you: The Scope of which is to shew you, what I mean by
sin, and the power of it, and that Humiliation that removes it.</p>
                  <p>I. That besides the outward acts of sin, and inward lusts and breathings of
sin, and the spiritual plagues with which God strikes men for sin, as blindness,
hardness of heart, there is in every man living another sin, commonly called the
sin of nature: (as in the Serpents, besides the spitting of poyson, their nature is
poisonous) which sin is generally beleeved and confessed, but felt by few. This
is called in Scripture by the name of <hi>Flesh,</hi> Joh. 3. 3. <hi>The Law of the members,
The old man.</hi> For as in men, there are actions, breathings, and the man himself;
So here: Which sin of nature is the deordination of the whole man, or a corrupt
bent and set of the whole man against God: And it expresseth it self in two
particulars; 1. In a constant departing from God in every action, Civil and
Moral: Like a man set out of his way, every step he goes is ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>; or like a Clock
out of frame, every stroke is false, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 3. <hi>The wicked go astray from the very
wombe.</hi> 2. In a fierce, invincible, resisting and contradicting of God, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> he
hath overtaken the soul to draw it home, and turn it back, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. We account
it a doleful thing for Christ to bid the soul depart at the last day, that wo is past
upon all the sons of men by this sin now; only with this difference, 1. They
are forced to depart then, men willingly depart now, and hasten away in every
thing from God as fast as they can. 2. They depart into fire, these to broken
Cisterns of creatures. I do 3. Believe they would not resist the Lord, if he should
come to save them from their separation then from him, this makes nature resist
him now.</p>
                  <p>II. That this sin of nature is most properly only the reigning sin. The text is
evident for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Let not sin reign, to obey it in the lusts thereof.</hi> There is
1. Obedience, <hi>i. e.</hi> the outward acts. 2. Lusts, the inward breathings. 3. Sin it self
where those lusts are seated. It hath been a Question, What a mans raigning
master sin is, and many discoveries have been made of particular sins, as that
which riseth and awakeneth first in the morning with us, that which rides and
labours a man upon the Sabbath day, when the Lord or sin must ride in triumph:
yet that is the misery of a carnal heart, that when he gives his beasts rest, yet such
is sins tyranny, he being sins beast, that he shall then have no rest. Now if
their meaning be, that some particular sin may be a raigning sin, or a mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
reigning sin; then 'tis true, <hi>Iudas</hi> loves his bag best, and <hi>Achitophel</hi> and
<hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>

                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> his whore most. But if they mean a mans
natural reigning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>; the reigning sin then, 'tis not any particular sin so much as
this: For no sin is able to reign over any man but by commission and power from
this. As the Weeds can never grow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>all, but by vertue of their soil where they
grow, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 19. All the boughs flourish by vertue of the root whence they
grow. And hence we shall see, let Satan sow his seeds of pride or lust or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in a man whose nature is changed, its impossible they should come to any
perfection there, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ey will die away within a time, because the heart of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40159:103"/>
soil is gone, and power of sin removed; and hence also it comes to pass, that a
mans master sin may be changed: Those sins that are his master-sins in his youth,
are not in his old age, those that are at one time, in one place, are not in another.
Now there could never be such change of Governours and Vice-roys, unless there
were some great King, that sets up one, and pulls down another, <hi>satis pro imperio;</hi>
This is therefore the raigning sin, which hath taken possession of every part, which
hath its hand in every act, which pulls down one sin and sets up another under
it, which gives strength to every sin that hath any, which fights it out till the last:
This is I say the reigning sin; hence think not that then the reigning sin is down,
when your personal sins are destroyed, though it be with a most sudden and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
destruction.</p>
                  <p>III. That when the Spirit of God humbles the soul indeed, he strikes the head,
and wounds the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eart of this sin; he doth not only cut off some limbs of it,
not only binde it, but slay it of its life and power. That as 'tis with some men,
they may have many pains, gripes, diseases, yet live and recover again, but the
pangs are not so strong as to separate soul and body, for then the man is gone:
So a carnal heart he may be troubled, and have many gripes of Conscience, and
apply the promise, <hi>Come to me you that be weary,</hi> and so he may finde rest, and as
he recovers his peace, his sin recovers its strength; but when the pangs are so
strong as to separate body and soul, sin of nature which hath lived there; now the
man dies, now the soul falls down indeed. Now this effectual humiliation car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the soul unto Christ, and hence <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>turned from the power of Satan
to God,</hi> Col. 1. 13. <hi>He hath delivered us from the power of darkness.</hi> And hence
Gal. 5. 24. <hi>They that be in Christ have cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sts:</hi> For if the Lord should only humble a man for the sins of a wicked life,
and some wants in the heart, the Lord should only bruise Satans heel, but never
strike his head; the Lord should slay the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>kites,</hi> but spare the <hi>Agag;</hi> 'tis true,
the Lord usually at first conversion sets one sin upon the soul that brings to minde
many other, and the Lord humbles for them, and here the soul is apt to rest as
many do, but when the Lord comes indeed to work, he cuts thus deep as now I
speak. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in heaven, he will be sure above all other sins, to strike the head of this, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
this; and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hearted Virgins, but they only assault the soul; So on Saints, but Christ then strikes
at the sin and saves the soul, <hi>Isai.</hi> 57. 16, 17. And this I add, there may be a
great power of Christ put forth to humble the soul, but mens hearts resist this;
and even <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was humbled, but its never saving, unless it strike the very
power and throne of sin, and so this sin; and now the soul is humbled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                  <p>IV. That no unregenerate man ever had such a measure of humiliation, as
ascended to, and ended in this, though he may have all that Humiliation which
is precedent unto this. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord may arm first some few, and then many of the sins of their
lives upon them, so as they may feel the most intollerable burthen of them; not
only to stand convinced they are most grievous sinners, but to shed many tears;
nay, to be sore troubled and distressed, oh the heavy wrath that lies upon my
soul! Thus <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 15. And hence many make heavy complaints,

of the Saints, as the damned now; for the Lord lays this burthen upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
backs in measure, but the Lord empties out the whole sack upon them, and
the ground of this is but the sting of sin, or the gnawings of particular sins in the
Conscience, not the burthen of the sin of nature as yet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:40159:104"/>
2. You will say, these fell from God, never looked to Christ, not left their
sin; but I have done so. I have seen the mercy of God in the Gospel, the Lord
Jesus hath been revealed there, and I have seen sin, I must part with my sin, if ever
I have him, and so I have. And this you may have, you may see an excellency
in Christ, and be so affected with hope of his mercy, and melt at the thoughts of
his Love, as to cast off all outward evils that thou hast, or the world lives in, 2 Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

2. 20. So that thou maist escape these, by coming to him to remove them, and
by seeing that else thou shalt have none of him; and hence hated thou maist be
of the world. The reason is, Christ hath only washed thy skin, but never chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
thy nature as yet, so that you may thank God my Conscience is clear.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You may have not only outward acts, but for a time inward lusts quenched,
that a man hath no mind nor heart to any sinful way, nor to the dearest sins he
hath lived in, whilst horrour lies upon him. As in <hi>Iudas,</hi> when God did hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And hence f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

money and Christ escaped with his life, and his sin pardoned afterward. And
hence its said, Mat. 27. 3. <hi>When he saw he was condemned, he repented,</hi> and as a
man not worthy to live in his own thoughts, <hi>he goes and hangs himself.</hi> 'Tis with
the soul as with water, all the cold may be gone, but the native Principle of cold
remains still. You may remove the burning of lusts, not the blackness of nature,
from a carnal heart, and the ground holds, nature is not changed. This I say
an unregenerate man may have, but yet never find this change of nature, where
the power of sin lies: change of Conscience from security to terrour, change of
life from prophaneness, and civility, and fashions of the world, to escape pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof; change of lusts, nay quenching them for a time; but the nature
is never changed in the best Hypocrite that ever was. As 2 Pet. 2. 19, 20. <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

these hidden works. Especially seeing some Divines think, that as the first <hi>Adam</hi>

troubled with it, but when the Lord makes the dejected soul feel it as its greatest
evil, so long as it remains in its being; (as it will) worse than death, than hell,
than all afflictions, and miseries. 'Tis not a particular sin, but this that he feels
thus. You will say, this is a high pitch. I say, consider if any man was ever
humbled under sin, but he that felt sin as it is. For if I feel it not as 'tis, I am
deceived. Now 'tis the greatest evil; To depart from a living God is worse
than for soul and body and all creatures to depart from me. To make God misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is worse than for all creatures ever to be made so, and sin in its tendencie
doth so, being a cross to his Will, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 24. Hence he that feels it indeed,
feels it so; the beginning of which is a sorrow and mourning after God, that it
might be so, Isa. 63. 17. <hi>Why hast hardned our hearts from thy fear?</hi> But thus
'tis indeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. And when 'tis thus, it will hold thus till death, while
the cause remains; nay the more life and love, the more tender it grows; setting
aside some careless fits. And hence its greatest joy is to think of the time it shall
be for ever holy. And hence accounts no such mercy as to be set at liberty to
live to God indeed. A graceless heart sees and fears it, and cries out of himself
for it; but stay a while, and he loseth his tenderness, either because he cannot
part with it, or because of Christ, he looks now to him, or because he hath now
some sprinkling of the Spirit, nature is eased thereby, and he is quieted; and
hence never any carnal heart, but some root of bitterness did grow up at last in
this Soyl. Hence Ordinances profit not, because feeling is lost. But the soul
thus feeling it, beholding the Holiness of God and Love of Christ, and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
withdrawings, resistings, oh it cuts deep!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then the nature is changed, when the Conscience being still and quiet,
and the soul assured of the Lords love, yet nothing gives the heart quiet till 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
to God in Christ to enjoy him, in his Holiness, and in the love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of his whole will. For this is a certain Rule, If the nature be not changed,
if Conscience be but once quie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it, and hath not God indeed, nor his work to quiet it, it will fall to lusting after
Creatures and live upon them, and feed the heart there. For as 'tis impossible
for a man to live, or to be without provision, so the world being provision for the
flesh, meat, drink, sleep, and these lawful things, there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> doth and will lie
quiet without God. But now where the nature is changed, and there is another
nature, there is somthing else provided for it to live on, and that is the Lord and
his Will. As Christ said, <hi>'tis my meat and drink to do his Will.</hi> And Rom. 7. 22.
<hi>I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

heart would rest and give over somtimes, yet 'tis a Law of the mind that the soul
hath, he can have no rest, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. And therefore take a child of God, let him
have meat, drink, sleep, blessing in his Calling, preach, pray, and have honour,
yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

me good? When I rise up, lie down, eat, drink and pray, and do all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him? An untuned heart all this while. The world stands between him and
the Lord all this while, but this doth not. Many a sincere heart hath heavy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40159:105"/>
and many doubts, because 'tis not thus; this rather is an evidence of
peace, than Gods war against it. Its an old Rule, he that can live in Heaven,
shall; and there is nothing but a God to suck in, and breath out, and live unto.
Is this thy Element now?</p>
                  <p>Oh consider and examine your selves here you poor Saints, that you may be
comforted. Others of you, if now you do not, the Lord Jesus will another day,
and bring these secret things of darkness to light. If thou findest this was never
yet done, know it, all thy tears, and fears, and prayers have been in vain; and
under the power of sin and Satan thou still art, through the fierce wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee: And there I leave thee till the Lord find thee out.</p>

                  <p>BUT let it be first noted that I speak not here of Revelations of future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.
When Virgin-Churches shall fall a dreaming, 'tis a sign they fall a
sleeping. Nor of revelation of new Doctrines, nor yet of the Love of Christ and
assurance thereof; but of the Person of Christ, a work common to all the Elect,
and not peculiar to some, for Christ may not appear in his promise of love for a
time to a sincere heart, yet this is then wrought. I shall therefore express my
thoughts herein in four Conclusions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all unregenerate men are under the power of darkness,<note place="margin">Conclu. 1.</note> of ignorance,
Eph. 5. 8. <hi>You were darknesse</hi> in the abstract, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. So that <hi>they cannot
understand the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Especially the Lord Jesus,
for the knowledge of him is above nature, not only corrupted but pure nature.
Nay though the Lord gives the best and clearest means of revealing himself, yet
they cannot see, John 1. 5. <hi>Light shined in darknesse, and it comprehended him not,</hi>
no more than he whose visive faculty is lost, when the Sun shines round about
him. Nay, that light which is in them is darkness, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 23. And then how
great is that darkness? For many men might have known Christ, but that they
thought they did know him before, and so are delivered up in these chains of
darkness to the Prince of darkness, but are like wilderness-shrubs, shall never
see when good comes. Ministers (as Christ did) may mourn over them, but
can never help them until the Lord pull off their scales. For they please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in darkness, and love it more than light, and are not as <hi>Paul,</hi> praying and
mourning under the Scales that are upon their eyes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is a state of light to which God calls his people only;<note place="margin">Conclu. 2.</note> or rather,
that there is a spirit of Light, Illumination or Revelation let into the mind,
which is Peculiar to the Beloved of Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. As of other things, so es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
of the Lord Jesus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. And 'tis so Glorious a work that
Christ himself admires the Father, and stands in a ravishment at it, Mat. 11. 25.
<hi>To Babes,</hi> uncapable of all others of knowledge; yet to them doth the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
some things that the wisest in the world never knew. I do believe that the
greatest Scholar that ever lived, never had one such thought or apprehension of
the Lord and the things of the Lord, as the Saints have. And hence Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
oh <hi>blessed are your eyes that they see;</hi> and themselves bless him, and fall a
wondring many times, <hi>Lord why dost manifest thy self to us, and not to the world?</hi>
And therefore 'tis an injury to the Grace of God, to make precious things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and all the work of the Spirit on the understanding to be common to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,
and to say, the difference lies only in the work of the Spirit upon the
will, John 6. 45. <hi>He that hath heard and learned of the Father, comes to me.</hi> If
the Learning of the Father be common to a Reprobate, then either they may
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40159:105"/>
come to Christ, which is there denied, or Christs promise is false, for then a
carnal heart may hear and learn of the Father, and never come to Christ.</p>
                  <p>That notwithstanding 'tis thus with them, yet foolish Virgins may have some
light in their Lamp; some sight and knowledge of Jesus Christ.<note place="margin">Conclus. 3.</note> It is said we
live in dayes of light, and so indeed we do, but as the Lord said to them that had
seen his Miracles, <hi>yet the Lord had not given them eyes to see to this day;</hi> they were
inlightned yet fell, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 4. I shall therefore speak not of the revelation
of all the Word, but of Christ the end of it, and the knowledge of whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all the rest.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a knowledge of Christ in many a man which is begot by common
fame, and humane private instruction, which men hearing from credible men,
conceive of and believe; As that Christ is the Saviour of the World, is come,
is dead, is risen, is at Gods right hand, that in him Gods justice and mercy is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
that there is mercy with him for the greatest of all sinners, &amp;c. And
according as men are more or less instructed; so do men conceive and beleeve.
But now this knowledge is but traditional, and begot by common fame and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
report, like <hi>Herods,</hi> that heard many things of Christ, and yet indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
him. The Lord I know doth make use of this to cause the soul to come to
further sight of him, as in the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> but its far enough off from giving
any saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus; and hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 46. when they had been
with Christ, they do not wish them to rest in the report, but <hi>Come and see;</hi> so you
hear of these things, but come and see these things. You have learned them from
man come unto the Lord that he may teach them; and hence we shall see many of
the people of God that have been put to a Question of all things that ever they
learned, and learnt them over again; as, Whether there be a Christ or no, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
they never saw these things indeed, until the Lord taught them a second time;
hence therefore those that have been thus trained up, and have been troubled and
comforted by some conceived promises of Christ, but never saw any more of
his person, then what you have learned before; <hi>Your eyes are closed up to this day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If any man should see and behold Christ really, immediatly, this is not the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
knowledge of him. I know the Saints do know Christ as if immediatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
they are not strangers by their distance, if others have seen him more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
I will not dispute it, but if they have seen the Lord Jesus as immediatly as
if here on earth, yet <hi>Capernaum</hi> saw him so; nay, some of them were Disciples
for a time, and followed him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. and yet the Lord was hid from their eyes;
nay all the world shall see him in his glory which shall amaze them, and yet this
is far short of the saving knowledge of him, which the Lord doth communicate
to the Elect. So that though you see the Lord so really as that you become fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with him, yet <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 26. <hi>Lord have we not eat and drunk, &amp;c.</hi> And so
perish.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A man may see the Lord in his wonderful works, and glorious kingdome
and government, and yet not know him savingly, wondrous deliverances, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of himself, and of Gods people, dreadful destruction of enemies, such as
they cannot but say, <hi>This is the finger of the Lord,</hi> and yet know not, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 1,
2, 3, 4. And hence <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 24. and hence men think such things are done,
and shall I ever be vile again, yet they become as bad as ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He may see the Lord Jesus yet more clearly by the letter of the Scripture,
which though it brings to the saving knowledge of Christ, yet to see the Lord
Jesus no otherwise then by the strength of fancy and understanding, from thence
is no saving knowledge of Jesus Christ; and hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 26. the Mystery of
the Gospel was hid from the Jews, but now 'tis revealed to all Nations; literally,
to all where it comes, savingly to some few. For between the saving knowledge
of Christ in the Gospel, and palpable ignorance of him in the Gospel, there is
this middle knowledge which is literal, whereby a man doth see, <hi>yet in seeing, sees

by turning old affections upon another Object, but changing them first by this
bent, and so turning them. For a carnal heart may have the first, as the same eye

never have fallen, nor have been able to fall in respect of the assistance of the

Rule of Justice; for if he falling, all his posterity are forsaken of God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

and constant assistance and presence of his Spirit, whereby being once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of him, &amp; called to him, they never afterward depart from him. And though
weak in themselves, yet assisted by this Spirit, do not, cannot depart wickedly
again. The Lord Jesus having stood, they cannot fall, because by vertue of his
standing they have this presence of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Because I live;
you shall live also.</hi> John 6. 57. <hi>As the living Father sent me, and I live by him,</hi> &amp;c.
Christ standing next to the Father, lives by him; we standing next to Christ,
live as infallibly by him. And I say the ground is Christs standing. For though
there be many reasons why the Saints can never fall from Christ, as the Spirit
of Grace, Covenant of Grace, Intercession of Christ, yet the main ground is
Christs standing without the least fall from the fulfilling of the first Covenant,
which we having the first moment of believing kept in Christ, hence the Spirit is
given, and the Covenant of Grace, of strength. And hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 21. &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 17,
18. And hence the Spirit is said to dwell in Believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. And we

them, so that they cannot depart from the Lord again; hence <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 21. <hi>My
Spirit shall not depart from thy Seed. Iohn</hi> 14. 'Tis called <hi>the Spirit that abides

that love-knot to be untied again. When the soul is weak, the Spirit helps him,
when careless of it self, the Spirit keeps him, though the soul offers to run from
the Lord, yet this Spirit follows him; though he grieves the Spirit, yet this
Spirit still keeps his own house, will not depart from him; and so not suffer the
soul to depart from the Lord. And this is the reason why the Saints never fall
from the Lord, though they have weak Grace, poor beginnings, many sins, and
<hi>Adam</hi> stood no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which some call the Spirit of Adoption given to him, because he had not
fulfilled the first Covenant, which we in Christ have, which is not only the
ground of our never falling, but of assurance we shall never fall. For what breaks
a mans peace after Faith? Apparition of sin in the Conscience: What makes
that terrible? The Law. Now when I see in Christ, I have kept all things in
the Law, not only the cry and accusations of the Law and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fall off: But when I say so, I say three things. 1. Their whole heart never
departs. 2. They do not depart for ever. 3. Though they do depart from the
Lord, yet the Spirit doth not depart from them; as it is in common reason, the
same thing may go either in a straight or crooked line to the same point. As a
River may run in a straight or crooked line to the Sea. So the Saints, their
springs (their hearts) being set a running after the Lord, though they do not follow
him in a straight line, so as never to depart to the right hand or left; yet they are
so kept by the Spirit that they are continually making after him, cleaving to him;
though with many crooked windings of their hearts, this way and that way from
the Lord. And therefore as it is in a wheel, it stands bent for such an end, yet

(it is not I, but sin) and hence it is against the bent. The whole soul therefore
never departs from the Lord Jesus, but the Spirit keeps it there. As 'tis in the
body of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

made dis-union, so the whole soul returning makes the union. And hence if ever
after the whole soul should depart, the union should be broken; and hence look
on a Christian when he is himself, he cannot stir, nor depart; partly by a spirit
of fear, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 40. Like a man in a Ship, he cannot cast himself into Sea, it

look as 'tis with Satan, How doth he carry the heart from God? You shall see
it in <hi>Iudas,</hi> John 13. He stands at the door and knocks by a sinful thought liked

he was like other men, and was made to grinde, but they grew again, and then
he was like himself again: So when the affections and hearts to Christ are cut,
they are like other men for a time; but they are continually coming and growing
again, and then they are like themselves again. And I say they must return, for
when the Spirit carries a man indeed, there is a necessity put upon him, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.

doth not return, and desires and endeavours for to do it; but what if it be hard?
and it seem impossible to be better? Now he falls down and thinks this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
which God will pardon, and so Satan conquers him; I say again, not
temptation, but Satan conquers him: For then a man is conquered, when faith
is conquered, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 4. then Faith is conquered, when returning to Christ with
the whole heart is conquered; the whole heart returns not until a mans will

the Spirit of God puts the soul upon a necessity of returning to the Lord,
that when the heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Lord help; it must be saith the soul again, and it is so, I am not able to bear

the Lord commands it, when one waye calls in for another, mercy must step in,
and hence <hi>my prayer is to thee.</hi> Now this necessity of return to the Lord

appears chiefly in breaking down all oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

fears come, and discouragements, either by reason of outward losses or the

that hath thus abused it; and it hath thought God himself to say so, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
in not hearing and helping in so long a time, to witness so: Yet it will
return, though the Lord never save it; it will not sin: <hi>Ionah</hi> yet looks again
to the Temple, when he could not come to it, yet he would look to it. The
soul will turn up its eyes and mourn; Oh that I have so abused the Lord and
mercy! that Love it self should be angry and frown! <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. The Psalmist

of Gods Promises, and hence they wait for accomplishment of them; but the
Lord carries it quite cross to his promise to their seeming. He promiseth to

back like a broken bow which was bent backward, when stretched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
And now when God calls to any duty, especially when thy will and ends
are crossed, that is a burden, and thou art drawn to that as a Fish to the dry land.
It is like a Feaver-fit to thee, and never mournest for this. But when any matter

that you smell of the field; or if there be any life or joy, yet <hi>the lean kine eat up the

                  <p>THis work of the Spirit hath had many scratches, and passed under divers cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
that if that question should be asked of it, which once Christ made
concerning himself, <hi>Whom say men that I am?</hi> We shall five several appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some have made it common, and that this treasure may be digged out of
dung-hils, that the Lord casts these Pearls to Swine, that a carnal heart may have
all these gifts and graces which the righteous have, and <hi>Adam</hi> had, and perish
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40159:112"/>
at last. And hence no evidence from it at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some have not made it thus common, but proper to the Elect, and that
none are justified but they are sanctified, and <hi>Ã¨ contra.</hi> But it hath been, and
they think 'tis so disguised with the mixture of sin and temptation, and cannot be
known, or very hardly. If so, that though the Lord Jesus <hi>come unto his own,</hi> and
dwell not only in their Houses, but in their hearts, yet they know him
not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some say it may be known, but not as dwelling in our hearts,
but as inherent in Christ, making the inherent Grace of Christ in Christ
himself to be our Sanctification, which the Apostle makes to be our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
And so as the Papists abolish Christs righteousness for justification, by
making it to consist only in infusion of Grace in us; these abolish Christ to be our
Sanctification, by making all our sanctification to consist in inhaesion in Christ
out of us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some say there is a sanctification in us, But wherein doth it consist? Not
in any habitual Holiness, or Graces in us, but in the immediate actings of Christ
in us, and so the Lord makes his Musick without any strings, and reveals things
to us without eyes, and makes us live without any power of life: And so after
justification they put a Christian in such an estate of Sanctification as that he is a
mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> Patient, in next disposition to move if he be moved: Like a weather-Cock,
which hath no power at all to move, but as the wind blows it, good or bad.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Some grant that there is a sanctification proper to the Faithful, and in the
Faithful an habitual Holiness, and consisting in a most blessed, inward, total
change. But when they come to the application of this to themselves, they
think that if they have some reformation with some inward affection, they think
every overly change is presently sanctification, and this must be a good evidence
to them. And so like some Herbalists that treat of the Soveraign excellencies of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
herbs, but when they come to gather them in the garden, they take their
counterfeits in the room of them. The causes of which variety of apprehensions
is the rareness of it (and therefore 'tis unknown) and the corrupt experience of
men.</p>
                  <p>I shall therefore lay level these things, by shewing you what that measure of
sanctification is which is in us, and which is peculiar to the Elect, and which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
may be known by them which have it: And therefore shall not speak of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
at large, which is the change of the whole man by the death of Christ,
whereby he is separated from sin, and sin mortified in him; and by the life of
Christ, whereby he is dedicated unto Christ, and lives his life. But I shall treat
of it now so far forth especially as this change may be known by it; and therefore
I oppose it to self-seeking.</p>
                  <p>But why do you oppose Sanctification to Self-seeking?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because this Sanctification,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> I now speak of it so far forth as it may
be seen; now it is seen here chiefly, because it may be said here it is:
But Hypocrites have a change, Wherein may it be known to be different from
theirs? Why, the change of the heart chiefly appears in the change of the utmost
end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because as the pollution of the whole man, and all his actions civil, moral,
and religious, consists chiefly, and appears in this self-seeking, or making our
selves our utmost end. This makes the most glotious actions vile, and stains
them all. So the sanctification of a man consists chiefly and appears in making
the Lord our utmost end of all we do: So that though the actions be never so mean
and poor, yet this puts a Glory and lustre on them, and is the Crown of them,
even of the <hi>giving of a cup of cold water,</hi> Mat. 6. 22. <hi>If thy eye be single.</hi> Look
therefore, as before the Lord justifies the soul, every man living seeks himself as
his last end and good; and out of this captivity no power can redeem them.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40159:113"/>
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 4. So after it, the Lord sanctifies the soul with such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his Grace as makes the Lord his utmost end: And this no other
have.</p>
                  <p>Let me therefore shew you what this Sanctification is more fully, and with all
the cheif ingredients in it, that so it may be the better known.</p>
                  <p>It's the renovation of the whole man, appearing in the change of a mans ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
end. But more particularly,</p>
                  <p>'Tis that work of the Spirit in the soul, whereby the soul beholding the Glory
of Christ, and feeling his love, hereupon closeth with the whole will of Christ,
and seeketh to please him, as his happiness and utmost end.</p>
                  <p>For look as in self-seeking there are four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A man beholds himself and some good in himself.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Loves himself abundantly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Pleaseth his own will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Doth this as his utmost and last end. So here in this description of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
which I oppose chiefly to self-corruption, are four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The soul beholds the Lord in all his Glory, seeing of him present with
him in all his Glory, and set before him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 8. For this is one necessary
ingredient to his sanctification and seeking the Lord as his utmost end. For why
doth a man seek himself? He sees some glory and good in himself, none in the
Lord. And hence we say of some men, whose pride spoyls their parts, they
know themselves too well, and hence Saints when they see their own vileness,
and see the Lord, they are so far from seeking, as that they loath themselves.
Therefore when the Lord reveals himself to the soul in his Glory, this makes
them seek him and not themselves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Christ is made wisdom, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>that all might glory in him.</hi> For this is the Glory of Christ, and the
first Principle of seeking the Lord, the soul sees his good laid up in the Lord more
than in himself; nay wholly in the Lord, not at all in himself. His wisdom is
in him, he cannot but wilder till utterly lost without him. His righteousness is
in him, he could never have one sin pardoned by Angels holiness without him.
His sanctification is in him, he could not have the least thought nor desire, but
the Lord must work it in him. His redemption is in him, there could not be
freedom one hour from unknown evils but by him. Hence seeing him such an
one, he seeks him. As why do men seek men, especially if great? Why do
men desire to stand before Princes, and please them, so that they will not gladly
offer them the least distaste? Because they see them before them, beholding of
them, apt to be angry, if displeased; and their greatness awes them: So here.
Why is not the Lord Jesus pleased? He is not seen in his Glory, nor made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
present; and hence <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 12, 13. When they saw him <hi>on his Throne, they
cast down their Crowns and gave him Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The soul also feels his love, and so abundantly loves him again. For how
come men to seek themselves in every thing, and they cannot but do it? 'Tis
because they love themselves, and that abundantly, necessarily, as fire burns;
though they burn so hot in this love that at last they consume themselves. So
how do any, can any seek the Lord? We know the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.
<hi>Love seeks not her own.</hi> When the Sun hath put out this fire of our self-love,
when the sense of the Lords love hath kindled that love to the Lord again, as that
it abundantly loves Christ, now it will seek the things of Christ, and not its own
things. And as there is abundance of self love, that men are eaten up with it;
so there must be much love, which must be abundantly shed in the heart, so as to
eat up that; arising from the sense of the Lords love, and that abundantly. For
many a man comes to have some good will, and affection, and love to the Lord,
but yet never comes to seek the Lord as his last end, and live to him. Why?
Because he hath not tasted abundantly of the Lords Mercy, Grace and Love,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40159:113"/>
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. 12, 13. And hence the incomparable Spirit of <hi>Paul, I seek not yours,
but you;</hi> Wherein? In being <hi>willing to spend.</hi> But save your self <hi>Paul:</hi> nay, <hi>and to be
spent:</hi> With much ado; Nay, <hi>most gladly.</hi> Though you love me not, because I love
you: So here, though Christ should not love it, yet he is worthy, he hath done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and now the soul will not only do, but rejoyce, nay, in sufferings; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his love is not dropt, but shed in our hearts. And hence 'tis a never-fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rule, little love or assurance of it, little seeking the Lord; much assurance,
much seeking of him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hereupon the soul closeth with the whole will of Christ, and pleaseth
it, because it pleaseth him. Its with every man, as it was with <hi>Samson,</hi> he would
needs have a wife or the <hi>Philistims,</hi> Why so? <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14. 3. Because <hi>she pleaseth
me.</hi> So, why will men seek themselves, save themselves, love themselves, and
please their own wills? Because it pleaseth them. Look therefore as the soul
when he loved himself, did seek to please only his own will in every thing, and
'tis good because it pleaseth me; so the soul, whose heart is now indeared to
Christ, though he cannot perfectly do it (that's in Heaven) yet he seeks to give
the whole will of Christ content, because it pleaseth Christ. And this is that
that God hath sworn his people shall have, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74, 75. <hi>And that</hi> Christ <hi>hath
delivered us from all our enemies,</hi> (For the great reason why men cleave not to the
Lord, and please his whole Will is, because they have many things to care for,

                  <p>But why do you make this to consist in pleasing the whole will of Christ, and not of God

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because our sanctification now cannot please God as a Creator,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> though it

were never sent but to discover who were dross, who were gold, and the main
end of all Gods Tryals is to discover this Truth that I now am pressing upon

<hi>Saul,</hi> and it doth discover it was but an overly work; For this is the Question
God makes: Is it through or no? I, saith a carnal heart, Yes, saith a gracious heart.
Hence its strange to see what men will do when a tryal comes. A man main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

but a little fills them, and quiets them, and so damns them. And hence men at
the first work upon them are very diligent in the use of means, but after that they
be brought to neglect prayer, sleep out Sermons, and to be careless, sapless, liveless,
who is the better for them? Because I say that now they have got something,
the main work is wrought, they call not that into Question, and so when God
comes to reckon, they are found too light. Oh therefore keep the Vessel emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
never content thy self with any measure. Hath the Lord called thee? Yes
I think so, and beleeve sometimes so, but I am afraid I may at last be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <p>Its a sure way never to be deceived in lighter strokes of the Spirit to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for any, but to be content with no measure of it, and this cuts the thread of
difference between a superficial lighter stroke of the Spirit, and that which is
sound.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Look that your vessel be not broken, nor crackt, that when the Lord pours
in, it runs not out again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 12, 13. Oh here is the wound of
many a man, he hath many affections in Word, in Ordinances, and they take
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40159:118"/>
hold on him to convince; to affect him, but he takes not fast hold on them, he
keeps them not as his life, with thankfulness for any little, and with watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And hence a man is where he was, dry and barren. It's true the Lord
will not give that out of an Ordinance which he doth in an Ordinance. But it's
one thing to have it lost out of thy hands and the Lords hands too, another
thing only to lose it out of thy hand. It's one thing for the Lord to withdraw it,
another thing for thee to spend it away by the prevailing power of a lust, <hi>viz.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the world without, or contempt of Grace within; you esteem it not as your
life, and hence seek not to keep it, you will lose the Oyl in your Vessels. And
I am confident this is one reason why a man lives long under means, and never
profits, the Lord sees if he should poure any thing into the heart, it would be
lost. He takes fast hold of world or self, and keeps that, and hence all runs out
again.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Look that you be at the cost to get this Oyl in your Vessel. These <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we shall find the reason why mens works are sleight, their buildings, their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
why, they will not be at the cost; so mens work of Grace is sleight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they will not be at the cost. They find a want of Grace, and prize it,
and would fain have it, but it shall cost them little: they will not be at the cost
of their time. Somtime they can seek the Lord in an Ordinance, but what if
he comes not? They depart from him. Sometimes in pangs, and fits when
the Spirit comes, they seek, but to be ever seeking, ever carrying sense of sin,
'tis too much time and trouble, they will not be at the cost. Some affections
and hearts they spend, but not their whole hearts: Hence Christ exhorts, oh
<hi>strive, because many seek and are never able.</hi> Look therefore as it was with <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 14. 45. said <hi>he should die:</hi> No, the people said, <hi>not so, for he
hath wrought with God this day.</hi> Not that a man can get Grace by his own strength,

at cost first to get the Lord Jesus himself; As <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 33. <hi>He sold all and bought
the Field;</hi> and when he had the Field, now he had the Treasure. Oh think no
time too much, no lusts too dear, no affections too much for him (and then
you have all things with him, and shall receive life from him) and not for a
dead, but for a living, risen Christ. Christ bestowed Gifts on <hi>Iudas,</hi> on <hi>Saul,</hi>
but whom he bestowed himself upon, those never wanted any thing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 1.
But here I might take up a doleful complaint; Oh that men content themselves
with colours and tinctures of Truth and Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some Naturalists observe,
that Brass would be Gold, it tends to it, had it but more heat of the Sun to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct

<hi>The eternal God is thy refuge.</hi> Let what evils can come, there is a refuge. Yea so
long as I can stand. But what if I fall? <hi>Underneath are the everlusting arms.</hi> Let a
Saint fall never so low, yet Gods everlasting arms are still lower; where ever he
falls, he falls at last into the Lords arms; For else it was impossible for any soul
to continue, <hi>Isa.</hi> 46. 3, 4. <hi>From the womb to the hoar hairs I will carry you.</hi> Saints
when they are little, think they shall fall at last, and when strengthened, fear if
they live till old age, their hearts and spirits will die; yet they do not. But how
comes this about? <hi>I will carry you.</hi> And hence 'tis impossible they should ever

die or perish, no more than the Lord Jesus, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 19. So that if Gods purpose
is firm, his promise sure, his Spirit able, the Spirit of life and grace in the hearts
of the Faithful, shall be kept even to eternity.</p>

have been in horrors and then fell to reformation, and there rested, it will not

then say, God must do all, but they grow not into the Covenant, they will die;
But here though God keeps thee short and naked, and thou only pleadest the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,

And of such Apostacies as argue want of grace, take the following Discoveries.</p>

or at least the cause, through his corruption, <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> Time was a man lived a loose,

or speaking with some Friend, he comes to be convinced of his misery and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
condition, and sees no good, nor grace in himself, he hath been even hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
deceived; at last he comes to get some light, some taste, some sorrows, some
heart to use the means, some comfort, and mercy, and hope of life: And when
'tis thus with him now he falls, he grows full and falls, and this rising is the cause
of his fall, his light is darkness, and death to him, and grows to a form of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
His rising makes him fall to formality, and then to prophaneness, and
so his tasting satisfies him, his sorrows empty his heart of sorrow for sin, and
his sorrows for his falls harden his heart in his falls, and all the means of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him harden him; that now if men never had had means, even <hi>Sodom,</hi> they
would have relented before now. This is a sad token of falling away, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had only lighter work, it being a plain evidence that at their best they were

now. The Saints little measure makes them forget what is behinde, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 18.
He shines <hi>brighter and brighter till the perfect day.</hi> So that let him fall he
cannot be quiet there, but when he remembers from whom he is fallen, if once
he tasted the Lord, this will fetch him again, and make him restless till he return.
But if it be so as now it is with these, then the case is woful, when there is such
a plague on men and they know it not.</p>
                  <p>When a man saith to himself, as the Glutton said to his soul, <hi>Take thy rest, for
thou hast goods laid up for many years;</hi> so thou hast repentance, and grace, and peace
enough for many years; and hence the soul takes its rest, grows sluggish and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent.
Oh if you die in this case, this night thy soul shall be taken away to Hell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If when men fall from the Lord, and they rise up only in Ordinances,
but fall down constantly out of Ordinances without feeling. A carnal heart falls,
but he thinks himself is not therefore without all grace, because in an Ordinance
his heart sometimes is affected, so they were <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. The Prophets Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
was sweet to them, <hi>but their hearts went after their covetousness,</hi> their Hogs,
their houses, their lusts, their lots; and they joy in the Prophet, but never mourn
for that. A precious heart also falls out of Ordinances, but he feels his falls<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Though he falls from the Benefit of his rising, yet not from the feeling of his fall,
But to another man the sweet he finds in Ordinances, is but Musick to his meat,
or as a man falls from Musick to his meat, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 26, 27. <hi>He that heareth my
words and doth them not, that mans house is built upon a Sand, which falls,</hi> and the
cause of great falls is this: Look as 'tis with corn-ground, if rain falls upon that,
though it be long before any ripe fruit comes; yet it makes it at last come to some
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40159:122"/>
ripeness: But if it falls on other ground, seed is sown there, but it brings forth
Briars, though it drinks in rain, 'tis nigh to cursing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7, 8. Look as it was with
<hi>Saul, God had forsaken him, 1 Sam.</hi> 16. 14, 23. and a Spirit of Satan came upon him,
yet when <hi>David</hi> played with his Harp, it stilled the spirit in him, &amp; affected him
much; it did not cast out the spirit, for when he had done playing, <hi>the evil spirit
came again upon him.</hi> So 'tis at this day, a man is forsaken of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and
haunted with an evil spirit of pride, world, passion, lust, Libertinism; a man prays,
hears, and is made much better; tis stilled, not cast out; for after this a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to his old spirit again, and in time he cannot be quieted with preaching,
nor praying, no more then he could with his harping.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When a man is so fallen, as that he returns not in the season of rising:
Look as 'tis with Trees in Winter-time, their leaves, their blowths, their fruit,
their beauty is gone: Is it then dry and barren, and quite withered, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
One would think so for the present, but 'tis not so, because the season of
fruit and leaves is not now; if in Spring and Summer it should be so, then you
might well suspect it. Thus <hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 5, 7, 8. yet they said they were wise, and they
had Law and Ordinances among them: True, yet they did not know their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

of many men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When Jesus Christ the Sun of righteousness draws exceeding neer unto
the soul, and that to the reviving of others, <hi>Isai.</hi> 55. 6. but thy heart never a whit
the better, not yet much troubled it is so bad. When <hi>Peter</hi> falls, a look reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
him; when <hi>Ephesus</hi> falls from her first love, to <hi>remember from whence she is
fallen,</hi> is enough to restore her to her love again. When the Disciples fell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christs death, yet when he arose and opened the Scripture, their hearts burned
within them. But thou hast had Jesus Christ opening the riches of his grace
from heaven, and thou hast heard a voice, but not seen the sight, the glory of
the Lord in this thy day; and this thou hast done though the Sun hath come to
his full height sometime: This is thy season; Gospel, and Christ, and promises,
are grown common to you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As it was with the possessed man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 15.
<hi>The Devil takes him oft, and casts him into the water and fire,</hi> but if when he come
to Christ he have no help, the Lord be merciful to him then: So you have been
possessed and fallen, but when the Lord Jesus comes he casts them out; but if the
Lord speaks, enlightens, and cometh saying, Remember me whom thou hast abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
my wet locks, my watery eyes, and my sorrowful heart which thou hast bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

for ever, if your old master still pleaseth you; especially when all means are used;
when the last of a course of Physick is taken, and is ineffectual.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the Lord is ready to depart from the soul. Somtime Saints do not
melt at love, but the Lord departs, now this recovers them. As a man that hath a
friend, though they grow weary of their company, and they begin to carry away
divers things, yet when they come to take their leave indeed, now they recover,
and they cannot part now. Like <hi>Ioseph</hi> and his Brethren, they can neither of them

thou hast neither Summer nor Winter-fruit. Oh look to thy fall here!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When men so fall from the Lord, as that their whole hearts make choice of,
and are espoused to some lust, wedded to some distemper. For though the Saints
may fall, yet never to another Lover; for they cannot fall into any sin that breaks
Covenant between them and the Lord, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 19. When men make choice of
any thing in the world to take content in more than in the Lord, or together
with the Lord, and hence defend it as lawful, and are fully free in it. There
was never Grace there. For if any thing doth give the Saints content, 'tis not
their choice, but refusing: But you are wedded to your lust. <hi>David</hi> could say,

                  <p n="5">5. When the Cause of a mans withering is a withering root. Trees in winter
cast their leaves, as withered trees, but others root is hurt. If the branches do
wither, yet if the root remain, it will recover again. So the Saints cast their
leaf, and their branches wither in desertions and temptations, but they preserve
themselves at the root. But why do others wither? 'Tis because their Faith
withers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 39. &amp; 3. 12, 14. Many a man withers because of his Faith:
He feels many wants. Why lives he so? Why dies he in beggery? Why see,
<hi>Micah</hi> 3. 11. When a man <hi>is twice dead and pulled up by the roots,</hi> so that the root
perisheth; <hi>for him is reserved the blacknesse of darknesse for ever.</hi> That the means
and way of enriching Saints is a way of beggery, to these 'tis very fatal. There
is some false Faith in Saints, but it is not wholly such.</p>
                  <p>Oh consider these things! No Grace, What no Grace? I say then no life, no

the Lord only in good moods. Dying pangs are not eternal graces; Withering
Grace is flourishing and prosperous wickedness. If the Spirit of Grace in the
Saints be of an eternal, constant nature; that is not the Spirit of Grace which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
salvation, which is alive to day, but dead to morrow, which a man is
full of to day, but quite empty of to morrow. Hence the Prophet cries out, <hi>Hos.</hi>
6. 4, 5. <hi>Oh Ephraim what shall I do?</hi> What more means can I use for thy
good? Why, do we not get good by means? Yes, but <hi>thy goodnesse is like the
morning dew,</hi> soon lickt up by the Sun, <hi>and like a cloud which passeth away,</hi> which
promiseth much, but is scattered again. The Lord knows not what to do with
such men; yet how many be there of such, that like <hi>Ionas</hi> Gourd, spring up for a
time, and then die the next day, and they comfort themselves under the shadow
thereof. That take them in their Moon, they are as good as you can wish, more
than men, but out of it, they are bruit beasts, not men. Whatever is in a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, the likeness and similitude of it is for a time in an Hypocrite. Would you
have earnest prayer for a blessing? look upon <hi>Esau,</hi> he <hi>seeks for it with tears,</hi> and
mourns for it for a time. Would you have following the means, and that the most
powerful and searching<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and joy in it also? See <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 35. <hi>What went they out
into the wildernesse to see? a Prophet,</hi> a burning and shining light, and rejoyced
therein for a season. Would you have hazarding life for <hi>Paul</hi> and Ministry of the
Gospel? <hi>Alexander</hi> did thus for a time. Would you have people enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God? Look upon the <hi>Israelites, Deut.</hi> 29. with 31. 16. <hi>I know that
after they death this people will go a whoring.</hi> Would you have thankfulnesse? <hi>Psal.</hi>
106. 13. <hi>They sang his praise, they soon forgat the Lord.</hi> And these Affections
are for a time stronger than the Saints, like land-floods; and because they be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and strong, they last not long. But however, it argues a wretched false heart,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 37. <hi>Their hearts were not right,</hi> because <hi>not stedfast in his Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what man is there but changeth? What body so healthful,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that is found
alway in the same temper? Do not the Saints find their hearts soon cold, their
joy soon quencht, their affections soon spent? This therefore will discourage
them.</p>
                  <p>I answer to it two waies,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, They sometimes deny the constancy of Grace, where constantly it is,
(for the Spirit of Grace in us is like life, for 'tis eternal life. It's ever acting or
remaining in the soul) and this they do by reason of many mistakes. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They think the Grace of God in them perisheth, when the act ceaseth.
Whereas a man may be weary of actions of life, where life remaineth, as in sick
men. A man may have a rich treasure alway with him, yet not alway spend it.
There is a gracious frame of heart which the Lord regards chiesly, which is before
the act, &amp; hence may be without it. The wheel doth not run that it may be round,
but it is made round that it may run. Hence when the act of running ceaseth, the
frame whereby its fit to run again, remaineth; And this is <hi>the Seed of God,</hi> 1 John
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Many think the act of grace ceaseth, when it doth not act alway upon the same
object; as some think, because they have not the sence of Gods love alway, all
grace is lost, when it may be there is sence of corruption at that time; sometime
God gives victory over temptation, it riseth again: Now the soul thinks the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
act of grace ceaseth, when yet its now warring against the temptation; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40159:123"/>
the Spirit of grace may lead a man to prayer and sadness, sometime to a
mans calling and cheerfulness. The act of grace is small, its dominion large.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They think they are not constant, when they are not so at all times, as they
are at some times: As a man thinks he is unconstant at prayer, because he is
not all day upon his knees; not heavenly minded, because he is not all day long
minding heavenly things: Whereas the Spirit should be ready so to do and be
at all times, and in every worldly occasion to be sowing or reaping some spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
good; yet 'tis not a season alway to be upon the Mount. Somtime <hi>Moses</hi>
must come down to the camp. God requires every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>it season for his special Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
not every Particle of time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Many think the power of Grace is ceased and taken away, when some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
enlargements are: As a Christian shall find at some times, having special
work to do, special miseries to go through, he hath special enlargements of the
Spirit, of joy, courage, boldness with God, love and zeal. These lasting not,
he thinks all is gone now. But look as it was with <hi>Ionathan,</hi> 1 Sam. 14. 8. Then
<hi>he alone and his Armour-bearer went against an Host,</hi> yet 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 11. Against
<hi>Goliah</hi> not a word. <hi>Paul</hi> to his death was a faithful and able Minister of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
though sometime his mouth stopped, and his heart straitned: The Ship may
be going to the Harbour, though somtime greater, somtime lesser winds.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But yet I confess there is much changeableness in the Saints, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenness
in their course, and their Spirits are apt to grow weary and faint, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they had not need to be exhorted not to be weary, and when they are lifted
up, they soon sink down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. And hence question, Was there ever grace
in this heart? But yet there is much difference between the unconstancy of the
one and of the other, in three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An Hypocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>es affections when they cease, they are raised in him again by
some external Principles and Motives; but the Faithful when they have lost
what they had, they recover it again by a new nature, an inward principle;
which is an evidence there was the being of Grace all this while. Empty a Pond,
it will never fill again till the Clouds above it poure down rain. Empty a Spring,
though it sees no Clouds in the Heavens, yet it runs of it self, and will fill it self
again. So when an Hypocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e is left dry and empty, if some clouds of displeasure,
fears of death and hell come, he is filled; but a child of God when no fear of
death or hell, yet many times somthing within begins to work, as in <hi>David</hi> Psal.
39. 3. <hi>While musing, the fire kindled,</hi> the sence of sin, to lie out from God, to
quench his Spirit, the Beauty of Grace, the Command of God, the honour of
the Lord Jesus recovers him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. They spake as largely as any
could desire, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

principle, but only from external fear. <hi>When the Priests feet touch Iordan, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
stand on heaps;</hi> but <hi>when they are passed through, they overflow all the Banks</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
according to their nature. So when the Word is preacht powerfully, and
the Gospel with authority, and the Priests feet touch mens Consciences, and
they come to make way for the Arke, for the Lord, men in fits fall down before
the Lord against their natures; &amp; for a Sabbath day men are as full of good purposes
and hearts as may be, yet pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pangs come from external principles; and hence take them away, their affections
die. Somtime the novelty of a thing affects a man; the sight of shore is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
at last when Manna proves dayly bread, 'tis loathed. At first Ministers feet
are beautiful, they would pull out their right eyes for <hi>Paul,</hi> yet afterward cast him
off. A <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in Thunder and fear of death, cries, <hi>take away the Plague.</hi> A
man in affliction promiseth much; when 'tis past, his care to find out his sin, his
seeking to be purged from his sin ceaseth. <hi>Ioash</hi> is good while <hi>Ieh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40159:124"/>

                     </gap>
the one to fall, makes the other to fear, and so to stand. A Conceit carries a
man on, but when his Conceit is gone, he falls. Look as 'tis with dead men,
they may have heat and colour, but 'tis from the fire; a living man may be cold,
and his beauty gone, yet he comes to be hot again, not from external heat, but
internal life within: He can get himself heat, as we say, so 'tis here. Or as
'tis with the Clock and the Sun, the one moves by Art, the other by nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppose there be some inward Spirit to raise their Affections, yet these graces
arise in them without the destruction of the contrary Corruption. And so are like

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>h arose from the sense of his own insufficiency to
think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> good thought. The Saints see great things but 'tis in such a way, as that they
<hi>that see not, might see,</hi> Joh. 9. 39. <hi>Paul</hi> is sometime set at liberty from pricking
temptations, yet he hath them sometimes that he may feel them, and so be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
again. Hence many people suddenly finde they love the people of
God, and love the Lord, but never felt the contrary sin; suspect 'tis but a pang,
as <hi>Capernaum</hi> was much affected, yet repented not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The continuance of the risings of a Saint are life to him, they are his life;
his coolings, and declinings, and decayings, death: But <hi>Ã¨ contra</hi> to an Hypocrite,
the continuance of his affections in Ordinances are deaths and burdens to him;
the loss of them his liberty and life, wherein he allows himself.</p>
                  <p>As for example, Take an Hypocrite to prayer, he is affected for a time, but let
him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e long at it, he is like a Fish in a Feaver fit out of the water, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13.
So for sanctifying the Sabbath, and being very strict, but stay long here 'tis death,
'tis burdensome to him; and hence we shall see his decays are his life, and that
which makes him walk loosely is, sometime he repents and beleeves, and hath his
Canonical set hours of prayer, and he thinks this is enough, and pleaseth himself
with this, (who is constant?) But now take a childe of God when his heart is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>nlarged for the Lord, that is heaven; it is his food, and now he is in health, as
<hi>Paul</hi> said, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 7, 8. <hi>Now we live, if you continue stedfast:</hi> So for others, so
also with himself, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 22. and if it might be ever thus, then happy; and the
thoughts of this sweetens heaven; but take away these, 'tis his death; and hence
he groans to God for the removal of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 4, 5. What good doth Christ,
mercies, Ordinances, heaven do me with such a heart? Be not discouraged you
people of the Lord, nor encouraged you that are good only in your Moods, as the
winde turns you; whatever love you have 'tis whorish, and whorish tears, if you
follow the Lord and yet have your haunts, whatever service you do it is odious
to God, to work all day for another Master, and twice a day come to the Lord
for bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all the world, or be like the Hypocrites whose beauty soon fades. And here let
me commend three things to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take heed that there be not found in your hearts <hi>a root of bitterness to grow
up and choak you, Hebr.</hi>12. 15. If your house be left empty, and yet one living
lust left in it, seven Devils will enter again, <hi>and your latter end will be worse then
your beginning.</hi> You do not know what hearts you have. <hi>Am I a dog,</hi> saith <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael,</hi>
ever to fall so? Let there be a lust after any creature, you will finde the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of prayer die; then to think them too long in the Word, then to forsake the
assemblies of Saints, then when your lust is met with, to oppose men, Ministers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> One reigning lust will bring all into captivity to it self, it will slay some,
and make others serviceable to defend it self, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed of taking on you the profession of a Christian course without
finding the rest, peace, joy, sweetness of such a course, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 10, 11. There is
a satisfying pleasantness in promises, commands, Ordinances, you will never hold
out else; for where-ever the heart finds rest, there it will abide, and for want of
that it dies. As in Creatures, if it had rest there, the soul would not be unquiet,
if in God, it would never go to the creature. Some sweetness you may
finde, but look to finde full rest; as men do find some sweetness in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and so in Ordinances; yet being used to them, they grow weary of them,
because they finde no God there, <hi>no fulness of rest,</hi> Hebr. 4. 11, 12. and go through
all the world you shall never have it: Get all the terrors of Devils upon
you, you will never stand by that; consider therefore as 'tis in sin, there is the
act, and there is the pleasure; so in every Ordinance and Duty there is both. All
Apostacy is from this, Ordinances are too burthensome unto men to be held
unto.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed you neglect not private prayer, build your houses fit for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40159:125"/>
though you sell some of your clothes; you will for your Swine to lie in, and
will you not to meet God in? one hours meeting the Lord in private will quit
your cost: And pray for this, do it least you do it in the woods, and desarts, and
dens of the earth: So much strangeness from God, so much Apostacie; Pray that
you may hold out in this hour of Temptation; that you may with <hi>David,</hi> not
<hi>be forsaken, when gray-headed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you see now the particular Difference between Wise and Foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
and what is the ground of the acceptance of the one, and not of the
other? What then will be said? Can it be, That there are no Grates in
Saints: Or, That there is no Difference between the one, and the
other?</p>

1. They <hi>Slumbered; i. e.</hi> fell a nodding or winking, as the word most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

from the gross pollutions of the world, and Antichristian fornications
and bondage, then either there is or will be general Security: For these Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
when they first made profession of their Virginity by their burning lamps,
were for a time all awakened, but at last they all slumbered and slept: This is the
temper of the body of the Churches.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Look as it is in our ordinary sleep, so it is in this general Security:
There are these six things in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A man forgets his business, his work he was about, or is to be exercised
about; so in a carnal security, men forget the Lord, his works, and his will;
that which we most think of while we be awake, we least think of indeed
when we be asleep: Take a man awakened indeed, O then the worst remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Lord and his Covenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 47. But when asleep, the Lord and his
errand is least thought of; and hence security is exprest by <hi>forgetting God,
Psal.</hi> 50. 21. And hence <hi>Ierusalems</hi> security was in this, <hi>they remembred not
their latter end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man in sleep fears no evill until it be upon him, awakening of him; so
this is another ingredient into carnal security, though sin lies upon them, they
fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> not till evil comes; as <hi>Ioseph <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>brethren, though warning is given them,
they fear not: Like them in the days of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot.</hi> And hence <hi>Iob</hi> 21. 9.
<hi>their houses are free from fear;</hi> the misery for the same sin is lighted upon
another; yet the secure soul fears not, as in <hi>Belshazar, Dan.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In sleep all the sences are bound up, the outward sences especially, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40159:126"/>
eye watcheth not, the ear hears not, the tongue tastes not, the body feels not;
to this is an ingredient of carnal security, it binds up all the sences, as it did the
Prophet <hi>Ionah</hi> his in the storm; when misery was upon him, he heard not, he
saw not, he felt not; so when misery, outward or spiritual, is upon a man, he
that had quick sences before, his eye sees not, watcheth not; Christians neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
their watchfulness for their friends, the Lord, and his Spirit, and coming;
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> watch against their enemies that daily besiege them; the ear hears not the
voice of the Ministry, the voyce of Providences, the voyce of the spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
the soul smels not, tastes not the sweet of any promise, any Ordinance,
no nor of the grace of the Lord himself; hence it commends them nor; nay the
soul feels nothing, no evil, no good the Lord doth him; that look as the Lord
there said, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 9, 10. <hi>The Lord hath poured upon you a spirit of sleep, and
hath closed your eyes;</hi> so the Lord closeth up all the sences, that a man is
now stupid, when he is fallen asleep in security.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In sleep there is a cessation from speaking and motion: there a man keeps
silence and lies still; so in carnal security, the spirit of prayer is silent, <hi>Isa.</hi>
64. 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1, 2, 3. <hi>David</hi> calls it a keeping of silence; <hi>up, why sleepest thou?
seek to thy God,</hi> say the Mariners; indeed men may talk in their sleep, so
men may pray in their deep security, yet not throughly awakened: And there
is a lying still, no progress; so in carnal security the soul stands at a stay, goes
not backward, grows not worse, but goes not forward; such a one is compared
to the door on the hinge.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In sleep the sences being stupified, and motion ceased, a man falls a
dreaming; some dreams he forgets, some he remembers, and in his sleep
fully and firmly believes them; so in carnal security, now a mans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> mind dreams
of that which is not, and of that which never shall be; a mans mind is grown
vain, and full of fancies and dreams; those things which never entered into
Gods thoughts, something a man dreams of the Lord that this is his will and
mind, which is not; of the world, that it is a goodly thing; of things to come
which shall never be.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In deep sleep, though a man be awakened, yet he presently is overcome
by his sleep again; so that is another ingredient into spiritual slumber; sleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is predominant over his watchfulness; and thus it was with the Disciples in
the garden, they slept; the Lord came once and twice, and awakens them,
yet they slept till temptation surprized them; scarce any Christian so secure in
the chambers of Christ, but he hath some knocks of conscience, some cries of
the Ministry, some woundings from the Lord, and they do awake him, but yet he
falls to sleep again.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p>WE shall now shew the Reasons why Virgin Churches in the last days are
or will be overcome by security.</p>
                  <p>First, Because that in Virgin Churches there are the strongest provocations
to this sin:<note place="margin">Reason. 1.</note> Which are chiefly three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Rest and places of peace, and freedom from hard bondage; <hi>Iacob</hi> may
sleep with his stone under his head, but much more easily under his own Vine
and Figtrees. A man may be secure in the times of trouble, but much more
in times of peace, when we have our beds made soft for us, and easie pillows.
Friends can boldly desire us to rest, where there is lodgings for us: The world
thrusts us out of lodging: While the prick is at the brest the Nightingale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes
and sings, but when that is taken away it sleeps in the day. In times of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40159:127"/>
persecution <hi>Paul</hi> is preaching till midnight, and the Lord is remembred in the
songs, and sighs, and prayers of the night-season; but in times of peace, peace
like <hi>Iaels</hi> milk and butter stupifies all the sences, though destruction be near;
Hence <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Then forget not the Lord.</hi> Do you think that <hi>Noah</hi> in the
Ark, when the waters swelled above the mountains, was secure? no, but
when the waters ceased, and he had his Vineyard planted, now he sleeps in
his drunkenness, because he knew not the strength of wine. In the Virgin-Church,
where this sleep is, we suppose this freedom from evil.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because there men are most free from inward pain; for where there is
much grief and pain, there's no rest, though all the house about be still; but
when the house is still, and the body well, now tis hard but there may be rest;
Whiles the Christian doth live under Antichristian pollution, his Conscience
hath no rest, and hence 'tis awake there; here (saith the soul) I want the
Ordinances of God, Oh that I had them! Here I see sin and wickedness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding,
that my childe is like to be poisoned therewith; here are such and
such superstitions that my Conscience cannot bear: Hence Conscience is kept
waking. But in Virgin-Churches, where the house is swept of these, now
Conscience is quiet and at rest; now I have got a Levite into my house, God
is now blessing me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Conscience hath laid down its burthen, it falls
down to sleep; now they cry, <hi>The Temple of the Lord,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because in such Churches there is most aptitude in men to spiritual ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>viz.</hi> plenty of the means; there is all the Ordinances; in this mountain,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 1. Gods feast is made, and fulness of spiritual gifts and graces, because
they have now escaped the pollutions of the world, conquered the enmity of
the world; now have come to a good measure of grace, and conquered the
way of their enemies, got the better of them; hence, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> made
peace with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> not when they were too strong but too weak for
them: So now the Soul comes to be at rest, to lay down its Warfare, and to
yield to a truce, to a league to his lusts and distempers for a time. When
men are kept short of food, now they awake; so when the Word of the Lord
and his Ordinances be rare and precious, and hard to finde, now a Christian
can trudge after them; but when men are full, now they desire rest; so
'tis here.</p>

with weariness; A man that never walkt on in a holy way, may at first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

to faint; especially, if he sows much, and reaps for the present but
little. And hence <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>You shall reap in due season, if you faint not:</hi>
Now in Virgin-Churches, these Virgins are such persons as have begun to
make a profession, and have made a fair progress; O how difficult now is it
not to be weary! it's strange to see what short spirits after the Lord, what
large after the Creatures vve have.</p>
                  <p>II. Because they are the more easily overcome by this sin,<note place="margin">Reason. 2.</note> than by
any other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it's a sin which a man least foresees or fears: The Apostle saith, <hi>They
that are drunk, and that sleep, sleep in the nigh;</hi> and yet here men sleep in the open
light; Why so? Men see it not, men know it not; sleep steals upon a
man: It's lawful to sleep; carnal security arises chiefly from the use of lawful
things, on which a mans heart and thoughts are spent; they eate, drank, gave
in marriage, they could see no hurt therein. When a man is had before
Councels, now a man fears to sin, he knows he shall be tempted unto sin;
but when the Lord brings the shoulder from under such burdens, now to fear
out Tables, our Beds, our Wives, our Children, our Callings, our Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and the snares of these, Oh it is exceeding hard!</p>

2. Because Security is so sweet a sin; O sleep is sweet; meat is sweet, but
men may be soon full of that; but when sleep comes, many hours are little
enough to entertain that: Some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

away; but sloth is a sweeter sin than any else besides. Let a Christian ask his
heart, when he can take no content in Pots, or loose company, or Queans,
and can find none in the Lord, yet this will give him ease, <hi>viz.</hi> his sloth: When

when there are causes of fear, when War is proclaimed, and the causes known,
and yet they are never feared: How many men have the hand-writing of
death in their Consciences against them! this they confess is naught, they
have lived careless, sluggish, and have had some sence of it, yet no awakening
fear of the terror of the Lord; when a Prince is nigh us, now to commit a little
lewdness is great wickedness: where is the man that trembles at the nearness
of God to us? when a breach is made, then fear enemies. Divisions and
breaches go before falls of Churches; where is that spirit of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> that
feared and proclaimed a fast? When God hath begun to smite, what cause is
there to fear! We have been hurt, and yet not laid it to heart; the Lion roars,
shall not the people fear? I believe we should not have had those Pequot fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

but see not; are not mens ears sealed up? Some Sermons men can sleep them
out; mans voyce is heard, but not the voyce of the Son of God: Oh how

of Magistracy and Ministery, what would this despised Country do? and what
would become of your children? then no Schools for them, when no Gospel
left among them; then every mans sword shall be against his brother, and God
spreading the place with darkness, which through his presence is made light;
what little hope of a happy generation after us, when many among us scarce know
how to reach their children manners? How apt are we, like to those <hi>Asian</hi>

them? how many fall off, and in time break forth, that it would make men

that lays things to heart? who hath the condition of the Country written

Oh men are silent because asleep! How do sins run thorough men as water

more dreams men have that are never spoken; every man hath some drunken
conceit that rocks him asleep; dreams are quite contrary to the truths. What
meaneth these, if men are not sleeping? First, Drunken dreams of the world.
Secondly, golden dreams of grace; that these things advance grace which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
destroy grace; that there is no grace in the Saints, no grace in Christ, no
humane Nature, no promise to evidence grace; no Law to be a Rule to them
that have received grace: Who would think that ever any should so fall by a
simple woman? But if this be not general; yet look how do men begin to
dream concerning the world? scarce a man but finds want, or is well; if he
wants, Oh then, if I had such a lot about me, such an estate, how well then
were I? and <hi>Ã¨ contra,</hi> They that have it, and now they take their rest: <hi>Take

temptations to make them all slumber and sleep; here their beds are made

taken though never so strong, if it grow once secure: no wonder if the world
be entred, and men are grown more worldly; and if Satan be entred, and
men grow more passionate than ever before; no wonder a mans work be
neglected, if he be asleep, Ordinances more slighted than ever before: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shall you see Security fall upon a man alone, but it brings its train with it;
when the Husbandmen sleep, tares will be sown, and when the Disciples sleep,
temptations will enter; This is that which the Lord testifies of his people,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4. I remember what thou didst in times of streights, in a land not
sown; every one that touched you did offend; but in the seventh and eighth
verses, when brought to a plentiful Country, they did not so much as say, Where
is the Lord that hath done this for us! But yet the Lord questions his people
for this, <hi>What iniquity have you found in me?</hi> which question you cannot
answer without grief here, or confusion another, day. You that are the Lords,
often have heard this complaint (for this may be your condition as well as
<hi>Noah'</hi>s and <hi>Lot'</hi>s) but now see the cause of it, how hard to awake on hour?
how hard to walk with God one day? short awakenings you have, but long sleeps
(this may be your condition for a time) but you cannot continue so for ever if
you are the Lords. But if you do continue so, especially without bemoaning
this unto the Lord, 'tis a question whether ever there was that oyl in your

knock them, because this is the way to awaken them, and then they hear;
so the Word and Spirit speak to a man, but such soft still winds rock them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep
rather than awaken them; hence the Lord layeth his iron hands upon a
man, and knocks by blows, and now when affliction is upon you, now you
can hear; When as the winds and water were ready to tear the ship in pieces,
now they enquire, Why were they sent? <hi>And the lot fell upon Ionah,</hi> who was

it is one of the heaviest Judgements, for the Lord to let a man go on in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

                  <p>Thirdly, If thou knowest nothing from them, then relate thy own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
this is a most lovely provocation, and exhortation unto another frame,
for one great cause that hardeneth men in their security, is because they see
no such living Christianity in the world: But when they do, <hi>now (Zach.</hi> 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>)
<hi>many shall take hold of the skirt of a Iew, for they shall say God is with you;
Agrippa</hi> was almost perswaded and awakened when he heard <hi>Paul</hi> relate his
conversion; although there be many impostors in the world that do so, Tell
me, are all things in peace with you? the Devil is in you then: What? hast
no temptations? yet many; Dost not observe how they prevail? yes; dost ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
get strength against them? yes; hast no good days after them? yes, much
peace and life, and presence of God! Hath the Lord given these talents to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40159:130"/>
thee to be hid in a Napkin, this treasure to keep and not to spend? who
knows but that the speaking of these may awaken others? these temptations,
and this condition is mine, these sins I find he makes a great matter of them;
Lord what will become of me that am hardned under them? this peace they
finde, my Soul is a stranger to it; Conscience will work thus: Women
should speak thus to women, and men to men; others were provoked
by the example of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to help others; so there is a provoking power
here.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If this prevail not, speak often to them, of the sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
in condemning others you condemn them; and this will make them look
about them; view the fields, and shew them the tares that are grown up
by security; and laying down these sins you strike at the root of theirs;
It may be, you cannot tell certainly, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40. The Lord made this one
means to awaken a <hi>Belshazzer, Dan.</hi> 5. 22. God turned thy Father into a beast,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to live in the woods, yet thou humbledst not thy self, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How many
Professors doth God deal so withal?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Enter into Covenant and brotherly promise to exhort one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ionathan;</hi> If any hurt be toward <hi>David, Ionathan</hi> will
speak of it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. Some may in Church-fellowship be more nearly knit
than others, to call one another to account, to tell one another their fears,
to know of one another their progress. Canst not give an account to man?
how wilt thou give an account to God of it? I am perswaded many a
man lies smoothered to death by means of this. Canst not come to the
light of a candle? Oh how then canst thou appear before the light of the
Sun.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Provoke one another to frequency in Ordinances, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23, 24.
and therein consider one another; dost see thy Brother in doubts or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
call him to pray with thee; dost see things go ill in Churches,
and men bite the bit? call to fasting and prayer, three or four together,
as <hi>Paul,</hi> when he saw the ship sinking, then he exhorted them, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 22.
Especially when you see danger near mens hearts, ready to be lost in the
World: In these times suppose only two, or three, or four should go and
pray one half hour together, and tell one another their wants, now
help here; in our times it hath been so, one living Christian helps others
dying.</p>
                  <p>But yet how is this neglected, as if men were resolved not only to dye
sleeping themselves but to let others sleep also? No, you will say, not my self;
yet it may be in your family it is so, and before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>What art alive to God and family, where thou canst do but little common
good, and art dead to thy Brother? it is made a sad sign of a man forsaken of
God, if when he thinks he shall sleep his last, and be damned himself, yet
he would have others damned also. Tell me, would you have all <hi>New
England</hi> lye in security as well as your selves? No! do you not desire it
when you use not the means that prevent it; and that is mutual exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Oh therefore do it; Ministers may preach, and every man sleep
still, unless some awake and rouse up the rest (as some, when others are abed
and fast asleep) that lye a dreaming: Some there be, that though Doomsday were
to morrow, they would sleep; Oh therefore let me perswade some one
or two to fall to his work, lest their security prove your undoing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
speak oft one to another, forsake not your assembling, visit one another,
pray one for another, warning one another, that you may awake with the
Lord one hour.</p>

                  <p>LEt every man not only exhort his brother,<note place="margin">Use 5.</note> but fear this himself; You
have a race to run, many enemies to conquer, sleep not lest you fall
short, sleep not lest you be taken captive: lest in exhorting others, your
selves proves Reptobates: I will not tell you what I fear, but <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. take
heed lest your hearts be overcome; be not drunk with some delight, be not
filled with vain cares; Hence, prevent it, as <hi>Noah moved with fear made
an Ark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Set a high price upon those awakenings and revivings of heart that
God sometimes giveth you; I am sure you finde these sometimes. A man
that hath nothing to lose, will sleep with his doors open in the night; when a
man hath a treasure he will be watchful to keep it; all security comes from
an undervaluing of the Spirit of grace, and its presence among us, <hi>Prov.</hi>
4. 13. keep her, for it is thy life; and when it is lost, what are you but
dead?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consider thy continual danger; if enemies be at the gates, all
the Town is watching; one would not think the depth of security that is
in a careless heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>I said I should never be moved;</hi> he had
good days and a thankful heart; then God did hide his face: A man would
think <hi>Sampson</hi> should awake when the Philistines are upon him; but here
Devils be upon thee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. If all be well now, yet remember evil days;
would you know when? even then when men say peace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Know the work you have to do, and make it your main business;
when men have weighty business of the world in hand, they cannot sleep in
their beds; and as the wicked, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>They sleep not without doing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;</hi>
and so 'tis their main work.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Call thy self to account daily, let not thy Soul long go on
without reflecting, What do I do? Harts and Hawks kept from sleep lose
their wildeness, but they must be constantly tended and kept watching: So
consider the account you must give to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. with 11. Hence
<hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 5. Sins were upon them, and they repented not; miseries, and
those were not removed; because they considered not their ways, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
before the great Tribunal of God. I am perswaded the reason why
men walk in their sleep, and go dreaming up and down the world, is this,
they consider not, nor reflect upon themselves to any purpose; what do I?
whether go I? no Sermons awaken, you consider not of them.</p>

for all the Virgins here first slumbered before they slept; they

for a longer time: a Christian is a slumbering Christian
before he is a sleeping Christian.</p>
                  <p>The truth of this may be seen not only in these Virgins, but also in other
Examples of security in the Scripture: As the old World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>They saw

                  <p n="2">2. Then <hi>they took them Wives</hi> for to solace their hearts in, to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

                  <p n="3">3. Then <hi>they became fleshly and sensual;</hi> spiritual things are out of taste

not him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Then God sets a time; no stronger means to awaken than this; and yet
they go on; and now they were come to their height.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Israelites. Deut.</hi> 8. 12. 1. They <hi>ate and grew full;</hi> here is first
spiritual fulness. 2. <hi>Blessing themselves,</hi> in their estates, herds, flocks. 3. Then

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon saw the sluggards Garden over-grown;</hi> now as it is in fields,
the weeds do not over-grow all the ground in one day, but they are a

                  <p>
                     <hi>Be sober, be vigilant;</hi> security is a kind of spiritual drunkenness; a man
is not for that time his own man, not a sober man; now this is by frequent
and often sipping; a man he is half gone first, and then he is wholly gone;
he hath not presently drunk out all his sences, not dead drunk; So it is
here.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p>IN regard of the quickness and power of the life of Conscience; whether it
be a natural Conscience awakened, or a spiritual Conscience awakened;<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> it
is with Conscience as it is with a prisoner in a house; though all in the house sleep,
yet he is bound, he cannot, and hence he is speaking, and will awaken the house;
so Conscience hath know, These sins I have watched against, and been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for, these duties I have done; but now, Now saith Conscience, you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
them, now you are worse, now fallen; now a man startles, espcially when
one stands at the door, and calls to Conscience it will awaken; so when there
is a word to call, Conscience will be crying ever and anon within, especially
when any hope or leisure to speak with any as they pass by; so it will take men
sometimes in their fields, and talk with them, and chide them: Security
grows up easily, but the awakening light of conscience cannot be soon done
out in any man; hence sometimes a man sleeps, and then awakens again;
Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. Though they had many sins, yet it would accuse and excuse;
as those that are come out of their own Country to dwell in another, or from a
great estate, in a mean condition, they cannot easily forget their friends
and relations, but in time it wears away, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 27. Conscience is Gods
candle, it will shine, and is not easily put out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the Lord doth never depart from men but by degrees,<note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> and
hence security falls upon men by degrees; when God is near unto men, then
usually they be awakened, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> before the Mount. Now the Lord
to shew the riches of his patience and long suffering, he will not depart
suddenly, and leave the Soul in a dead and sluggish estate. And hence the
Cherubims glory <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 10, 11. departed by degrees. <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 10. with 13.
God doth not so deal, as presently to close their eyes quite up, but they are
awakened to draw nigh to God with their lips, which is of God, and then the
Lord closeth up their eyes; never can a man be cast into a deep sleep, till the Lord
saith Sleep on, or till God close his eyes; and that he doth not presently; as
to the Disciples he comes a second and third time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because this is the most ready way and method for sin and Satan to bring the
Soul into a deep sleep,<note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> nay, to make themselves to sleep, which is that
he aims at; look as it is with those that sell things, their scope is not to put
off their commodities, but to put them off so as they may have money or
moneys worth for them; so it is here, the scope of Satan is not only to bring
men into security, to give them ease and peace, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 21. but to have his
money, that the Soul may give it self to it: Now as it is in buying of Fruits,
Sugars, Wines or Strong-waters, they will not buy all presently, nor buy
before they see and taste, they know not whether tis good or no, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they shall need it all or no: So here, to lie in such a secure condition, as
to neglect all means, to be hardned after all sins, this Satan will not offer,
not will men buy, or give themselves to this, they know not whether this be
good or no, less will serve them; and hence taste first a little slumber and sleep,
and so call for a little and a litle more until a man is a beggar, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 10. as at
first in Paradise; first look, then taste, then eat; so here.</p>

                  <p>DO not think you are out of a state of carnal security, because you have
many times some quickenings and revivings of heart, because they may
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40159:132"/>
be onely awakenings between thy slumbers, which like slashes suddenly come
and suddenly go again, which make thee startle, and rub thy eyes, and stir up
they self, but down you fall again; whereever life is in a Christian, it is ever
acting for spiritual ends; a man will awaken first with God in the morning,
and go first to him in prayer (extraordinary occasions not preventing) and he
will go from his prayer to his work, not as doing his own work, but as doing
the Lords work, howing, plowing, sowing for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now when the life
of Christ doth not act in men, and act men, it is either because there is no life
at all, but onely the awakening of Conscience which soon dieth, or else that
living Christian slumbereth at least then; slumber is upon thee though sleep is
not; make it out else any other way.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>If so</hi> (you will say) <hi>who is not then sleeping?</hi>

while tossed up and down in disgraces and reproaches, his inward man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
day by day, though the outward man die. The Saints have some kinde
of sleeps when they are at their best; but these are sick sleeps; but thine are
sweet sleeps to thee. I know Christ may say to his Disciples, <hi>Watch and pray,
temptations may be near,</hi> but their eyes may be heavy; the Spirit may be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
the flesh weak; and that it is infinite mercy the Lord will awaken them,
a first and a second time it may be by Sabbath awakenings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many cannot
tell what to make of themselves, because of their drowsiness and Gospel-slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
Methinks this may break thy heart, Cannot you awaken one hour?
know therefore your sin; It is a hard thing to be fully awakened, to have all
heaviness to sleep taken away; the Lord hath taken you here alone to himself,
you do by fits watch and pray, but it is onely as men asleep, not awake: The
Son of man is betrayed, Christ, and Gospel, and Ordinances; and can you find
in your heart now to sleep?</p>
                  <p>Oh therefore shake off your slumbers and short sleeps,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> lest you fall to sleep;
and for sleeping, be awakened by some direful blow; Look upon those men
<hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 10. <hi>God hath closed their eyes,</hi> that is a fearful thing; look upon many
professors, all their savor, and heart, and life is gone almost, and they know
not that they be asleep, not all means cannot awaken them, or unseal their
minds again; God knows how far you may fall, if you give way to a little;
especially if God takes away Ministers from you, and that the Elders that
have known the works of God be gathered to their Fathers; especially if you
know it, and yet go on in your slumbers; if you will not awaken when God
crys and calls, you shall slumber and sleep; like the Smiths dog, the harder
the Master strikes, the faster the dog sleeps, being used to it. I knew a man
of great estate, oft quickned by the Word; but he lost all life and heat again,
and he prayed, and desired the Lord to keep him, and yet decayed, but he
could not tell the reason thereof; at last the Word began to grow common,
and he slept there also; Conscience told him there was some evil toward him
which he feared, yet still slept, and continued so; notwithstanding his fears
would thus awaken him oft; at last an affliction came, he regarded not that,
but was impatient and froward under it, till at last all he had was gone,
and then he looked about him; when his house was burnt, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep;
he prayed, but lost all by sleeping when he should watch; so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
grew upon him; and hence, no wonder misery met him: Oh! take
heed therefore of giving way, liberty, or toleration to a sleeping profession,
and your slumbering Religion: as men will not tolerate Ceremonies, because

of it, and Saints the real enjoyment of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. <hi>ul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>. I shall be satisfied
when I awake with thine image;</hi> sleep first shews it self in closing up of a mans
eyes that he seeth not any thing about him; hence, something else contents,
and must do it when you feed not daily on the Lords love; and when that,
then vain cares and thoughts (<hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 34.) overcome a man, and then he
groweth a very worldling, as if he had hope of no other portion; hence no
mind after spiritual good things; hence he sleeps at Sermons, hence he falls
out into passion, and discontent with his present condition, nay, with
every other thing when any cross comes: Because these things are sweet to
you, and God is not, when discontented; the Lord keep my soul from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into thy secrets; Oh consider it if you have had sence of the Lords love
in Sacraments! and some new doubts arise, and you are not satisfied with it;
now look to your selves; it is impossible a Christian should do any work
without rest. Now as bodily feeding causeth rest, so doth spiritual feeding,
spiritual rest; feed and rest here, and it will make you fall to your work; feed
not here, rest not here, and you will in something else; and carnal rest will
bring carnal neglect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When men have lost all fear of the wrath to come, and the terror of
God another day; not always a fear that I shall bear, but a dreadful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
what it is. Many Christians lose the sense of Gods love, yet the Lord
keeps them in the sense of his anger, and so they are awake; but when both
are gone, or this is gone, then there is and cannot but be the first security. For
as it is with children, when their eyes are open to see and consider the things of
the world, now they are begun to be awakned; I never look upon a Christian
fully awakened till now, that the Lord lets him see the things of another world;
and when this is lost he begins to sleep, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. with 11. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11. 12.
Some securelings thought all things were past; <hi>No</hi> (saith he) <hi>there is a time
a coming when all things shall be dissolved; what manner of persons then should
we be</hi>! Hence this being lost, men fear not sin, men prize not mercy, men
wonder not if ever they escape; hence men live and hang between doubt and
fear, never make sure, because they know not what Gods wrath is: Nay,
lastly, hence nothing awakens them, that though they know their misery, yet
they will go on (the highest degree of spiritual security) Oh then keep these
thoughts awake! what it is to be forsaken of God! what it is to grapple
with him!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When men have lost their foresight, and hence provide not against an
evil day; when Christians keep their profession, and go on sweetly in their
course, but to lay up for after-claps, that they do not, when Christians like
Grashoppers sing all the summer, but what have they to live upon in the
winter time? the Ant can learn them that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Go to the Ant thou slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
that provideth her meat in the summer;</hi> the Ant by a secret instinct
(though simple and little) considereth there will be a winter, and that sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is her gathering time; so a Christian, if awakened (though simple) will
be taught to do something which may serve him, not only now, but hereafter
also; when men in times of peace and enjoyment of Ordinances never fear,
muchless provide for that time, that all these treasures shall be taken away and
carried to the King of <hi>Babel, Isa.</hi> 39. when men in their life time think not of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40159:133"/>
setting the house and heart in order before the evil day, when men are not that
now which they would wish themselves to be another day, when men lay not
up treasures of tears and prayers in heaven, nor are provident for eternity, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
think this will be my peace, nay my glory another day, though I lose now;
men will lay up treasures on earth, and provide for themselves and theirs;
hence their hearts are lost here, and lay in nothing spiritual for the future,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 5. he that gathereth in harvest doth right (but a sluggard will not)
his heart and mind is taken up to provide this and that for future; and hence
'tis that the Christian is full of sorrow and tears in times of peace; but when
the day of trouble comes, he can lift up his head (now redemption draws

now stand still they go no further; they lose not what they had, but they gain
no more; they grow not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 26. <hi>Thou evil and slothful servant;</hi> that
hid his talent, and did not imploy it; and here is usually the beginning of a

now they fall down asleep, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 4. and 12. 27. and hence beg the sweet
and gain of Christianity: it's sown in difficult duties; when the Soul denies
it self most: But when men not breaking through the difficulty finde not
the sweet of it, Lord! what a tattered profession is there, that men come to
be the shame of Christ, not his glory! It's easie to pray, and outwardly to fast,
but yet to have a whole heart in the work is hard: it is easie to cleave to the
Lord when quickened; but when God forsakes you, now more than ever to
cleave to him, is difficult.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When men fear not the danger of little sins; they are not asleep, yet
so as not to fear great sins; but in a slumber; and hence however they fear
not lesser sins, hence come to commit them, hence also to be hardned under
them: Many complain of hard hearts, but consider, is not this the reason of it?
you fear not sinful thoughts, nor carelesness in your Christian course; your slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is now upon you; thy Conscience startles at Whoredom, but not at a
wanton word; or playing upon the Sabbath, but unprepatedness for it that's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
sin in a manner with thee; the reason is, because spiritual slumber is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee.</p>

the <hi>Israelites</hi> when the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> came to them; confident of themselves, but
deceived as the men of <hi>Ai</hi> by stratagems; if ever your Souls be hurt, it will be by
appearances; if ever this Country receive a blow, it will be by appearances;
error will creep in by appearances; the most vile wickedness hath been found to
be hatcht under fairest colours: If ever any shall come under an appearance of
piety, and promise of protection, safety, liberty, onely your Government

arms; Grace, and the love of Christ and the Spirit (the fairest colours under
the sun) may be pretended; but if you shall receive under this appearance, that
God witnesseth his love, first, by an absolute promise, where neither grace
nor life is seen; take heed there; for under this appearance you may as well
bring in immediate Revelations, and from thence come to forsake the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
and then no wonder if men fall to deny all foundations in Christianity,
and Scripture also; take heed of meer appearances of repentance in evil
members, be not deceived there: Never was the world more full of craft; be
not laid asleep with appearances of truth: Thus you see the point opened.
Stop security when it is risen to your anckles, lest you be drowned in it, and

in Virgin-Churches.</p>
                  <p>That as it is said, <hi>That the last enemy that shall be destroyed is
death;</hi> so this death, like sleeping, is one of the last enemies
that surpriseth the souls of the wise, but Christ doth destroy
it; and of the foolish, but it destroyeth them: Thus it was here with the Virgins;
what was their sin that were ready with their Lamps burning, waiting for the
Bridegroom? you see the wise polluted with no sin, till they fell down by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
(the foolish were wanting to get oyl in their vessels before) but this
they fell last into: What into open prophaness, or othe foul corruptions?
No, but <hi>they all slumbered and slept,</hi> and we read of no sin after till the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
came; many sins indeed there be, which like branches bud from
the root, but this is the main: And therefore look upon the next Parable,
you shall see this again confirmed, to shew the certainty of this point; the
servant that hid his talent, <hi>vers.</hi> 26. is called <hi>an evil servant;</hi> why, what evil
did he? he did not lavish it (as the Prodigal) upon others, not lose it; but
he did not use it, sluggishness was his sin; hence (saith Christ) <hi>thou evill and
slothful servant.</hi> And hence the thorny ground flourished and grew, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
all persecutions could not consume them; what was their sin? <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 12.
compared with <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 34. it was the cares of the world; they began to dream
(strange fancies came before sleeping) and the pillow of their security was
some worldly content: And this is the reason why Christ and the Apostles
are also exceeding pressing to watchfulness; because this is the sin that Saints
are ready to fall into after they have seen Christs love and care; and because
this is the sin the wicked will fall into, and their last sin; it will be just pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40159:134"/>
their last plague; and hence the Apostle exhorts, <hi>Oh sleep not you,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>1 Thess.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Let me open this thus:</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p>VVE must know that the Lord in subduing a sinner to the obedience of
himself, it is with him as with an enemy in a City, there are many
strong holds of sin, to which he retires and resists, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. and when
one is down he flieth for shelter into another, and maintains that as long as
he can; so it is with men: Or as it is with divers fruits, they have their several
seasons of growing, and then of withering; so it is here; according to the several
seasons of a mans life, so are his lusts growing and decaying; there are the first
and the last ripe fruits.</p>
                  <p>First, Take a man that is born and bred up to some years, man is a soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
creature, and it is a misery to live and be alone; hence the first evil he usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
chuseth is evil and loose company; his lusts are grown up to some years,
and now he desireth a match for them, and first he chuseth a companion; and
Satan hath a mighty hand in this; because as the Lord when he first sends to
do his work, he sends two by two to animate and strengthen one another in
the work; so Satan doth first joyn hand in hand together that men might cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
one another, and harden one another in wickedness; this (I say) is the
first usually; hence <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 2. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 12. Wisdom first keeps from the
evil man; and this sin is for a time the dearest sin; for here he meets with
some pastimes, mirth, and so much love from them, that he loves this last
more than all the friends he hath (though they disswade him;) more than all
the Sabbaths of God, and hence he prophanes them; more than Christ himself,
and hence when he hath many times purposes of turning to God, his company
with-holds him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Continuing long in this sin, at last he comes to fall into the
sin of lust, and from men he looks to women, and this is as deat to him as his
right eye; it may be God keeps him from the act of Whoredom, but wanton
looks, lascivious thoughts, speculative uncleanness, self-pollution (which he
commits when the candles are out, and none but God sees) and yet God spares
him; and this follows him to the Church, to the streets, whiles he is awake,
nay, when asleep, and thinks it is no sin for a time, or if he doth, Oh the
horror that he hath sometimes for it ! Scholars of <hi>Westminster</hi> have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
from twelve or fourteen years of age to live in this sin. This is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:
Hence <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 16. first wisdom keepes from the evill man, next from
evil women.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It may be a man marrieth, and then this sin is out of season; now
therefore another comes in its place, and that is, immoderate love of, and
dropsie desires after the world, and the wealth of it, for now charge is like to
encrease, and it is a shame to walk in rags; and hence now a man begins to look
upon the estates of others, and to admire at them, and then he looks upon what
he hath, and what labor, care, and providence in a saving way may bring him
unto; and hence burieth himself alive in the earth, and feeds upon clods of
earth, and uncertain hopes. And this is the next sin which grows up (though
I know some men will not come to this) but I speak of them that go on in the
fairest way; hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4, 5. <hi>Whoremongers God will judge;</hi> then <hi>let your
conversation be without covetousness,</hi> that follows.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It may be at last God terrifies this mans Conscience, and he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40159:134"/>
begins to see <hi>What profiteth it me to win the whole world and to lose my own soul?</hi>
hence falls now to take up another profession, to hang out another flag, and to
lead a new life; and now pride in spiritual excellencies is his sin; when glory in
worldly wealth dyes, pride in spiritual glory lives: There were divers of the
Heathen contemned the world, yet pust up with pride in their morality; hence
<hi>Chuse no novice Bishop, lest he be puffed up, and fall into the condemnation of the
Devil.</hi> Now Lets of mind come in when he performs duties publickly, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and now he hungers after the honor of men, and sets himself to sale for
it: Oh, saith <hi>Saul, honor me!</hi> When he had confessed his coveting of the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel;
but pride stuck in him still: And when he doth duties privately, he rests in
them, and accounts highly of himself for them, though they neither bring him
to Christ, but estrange him from Christ. Hence Christ chargeth, <hi>when you do
alms, do not onely do it not to be seen of men, but let not thy left hand know what
thy right hand doth;</hi> take no delight in this: This was <hi>Simons</hi> sin, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. he
seeing the gifts of the Apostles, would give any money for them; these gifts
are sweeter now than money; hence such fall to some soul opinions and
crotchets; they can interpret Revelations, and ascend to the Ministry, and
be the forwardest in a Town, but when to do publick service, respect is gone,
their love is gone.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, When this is dying in the Saints, and fallen down in Hypocrites, now
sloth is the last thing that takes hold upon them, and this is sweet; What is
the honor of men? what is this base world? now sloth and sleep is sweet.
Now a man first ceaseth acting, and this gives rest; and now being here, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it's death to come out of this sluggish estate; when the hand of God is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
men, and the spurs be at their side and in their heart, it may be it will be
otherwise; but else not; they will not awaken, sloth is so sweet to them, though
sins yet be to be subdued; time is short, Gods wrath is great; yet that, as it is
said, <hi>He that escapes the sword of Iehu shall Elisha stay:</hi> so it is here, he that
escapes one sin, another shall slay him; but at last sloth shall slay: Hence
let a man look, what joyeth my heart? God doth not, wealth doth not;
sloth doth.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p>BEcause it is the best and most fit season for this sin to arise,<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> when all
the rest are fallen indeed in Saints, and seem to be fallen in Hypocrites;
as the temptation is, so mens sin is; when there is the fittest temptation without,
it broaches corruption within, and it runs not out before; for it is here as
in War; when the enemy (never seen before) is seen in the field (very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and very strong) is it now a season to sleep? no, Arm, arm now; but
when he hath driven and routed an enemy, and is enriched with spoils, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with prey, now it's a season to rest. Hence the Poet notes, <hi>When all the
World could not conquer them, their peace after conquest hath;</hi> now they have
themselves (an enemy within) to conquer; So here. Hence if they should
have desired the <hi>Israelites</hi> to be at peace with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> when they first
came in and had the land; No, they will cut out throats in time; but when
they had conquered them, now <hi>Iosh.</hi> 15. 63. it is said, they could not do it; had
they not had Gods promise for it? yes, and he could make it good, but
they could not, because now they had no list to do it, they were slothful,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 29.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because it is the strongest sin;<note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> No bonds so strong as the bonds
of death; it is a kinde of spiritual death, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 14. though in the Saints it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40159:135"/>
is not death eternal. Now as it is with the Lord, he reserves the best mercy
till the last, so Satan reserves the strongest temptation till the last; and in
many men it is sloth: Now it receives a double strength:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the strength of natural corruption which will remain when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sins dye, and in a great measure in the Saints, when the power of sin is
taken from the Saints; for take the best man and this remains; it is the sickness
of the Soul which will cleave to it: Hence as 'tis with sick men, when no mind
to meat, yet oh a little rest! it is greatest pain to walk, and hence the greatest
pleasure to lie still: sickness binds a man to rest, makes him love his rest; so
carnal corruption, to carnal rest.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The strength of pleasure in some lawful thing; for sloth and sleep's
best pillow is ever some delight in lawful things, that's the shadow: hence,
when a man delights not in gross evils, yet in health, and peace, and freedom
from dangers; and here he wallows, as <hi>Issachar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> Because (not onely so, but) it is the least suspected sin. I have
known them that have been gracious, and long it hath been before the Lord
hath made them know that they have had this (much less loved this) sin.</p>
                  <p>For 1. It is but a neglect or cessation from act; it is no sin that doth openly
war against the soul, but lives within like a friend.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis a neglect which the best have; an infirmity; <hi>All slumbered and
slept.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The main work is wrought; it is not therefore any dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
men think; and hence the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11. would have them
<hi>awake;</hi> why? we shall be saved, might they say, and had peace long ago; but
(saith he) <hi>because your salvation is nearer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because he sees many difficulties before him to break thorow, which
unless God gave him more strength, he doth not see that God calls him unto;
and hence saith, <hi>that there are Lions in the way;</hi> after a long time of profession,
then God presents greatest difficulties; and hence now sloth reigns in a special
manner.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                  <p>HEnce see the reason why many Christians at their first beginnings grow,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
and thrive, and abound in the fruits of Righteousness; but afterward so
poor and ragged; Oh the two or three first years, how frequently in prayer,
meditation! Oh what sorrow and peace! but after this, now they can find little
good they can get; little growth they make, unless it be downward; little life
they have, and what ado to keep it, or to get a good spiritual meals meat!
this is the reason of it; when they first began, then the enemy was out, and
they were up, and now they conquered and had the spoils; but since, they have
grown secure, and loved to sleep, I say love to sleep; and hence, little to be
seen about them but rags; hence (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 11.) <hi>lest thy poverty come as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
man, Prov.</hi> 20. 13. 11. truly this is it, and hence no wonder you are ever so
full of complaints in midst of means; where God gives you matter of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
joy, peace, everlasting glory, yet you find nothing; so that sometimes
you think there is no grace, or are almost of the mind that there is no grace to
be looked for in us; if not, yet finding so little, there's no evidence for it: Oh
your sloth it is the cause; hence 'tis you marvel at the Lord he helps not; Oh
you do not awake, to awaken the arm of the Lord; you shall know, if you
follow on to know the Lord, but that you do not; and hence the pricks and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> you made your peace with, and ate again vexed by them, this is the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40159:135"/>
reason of it: Oh therefore go in secret and say, I complain of my sins; the
Ordinances and God that I seek, and have not, when my heart should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
but oh it is not because I cannot, but because I care not; it is not
because of the strength of my enemy without, but because of my neglect of watch
and diligence within. I know it was a sin for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to charge <hi>Israel</hi> with
idleness, because he commanded work without means; But is the Lords work
so? look up to him for strength, he gives it them that have none; put forth
that strength thou hast, he will accept thy will, but will never allow thee in
thy sloth, but you shall to beggery at the last. Hence men <hi>roast not what they
take in hunting, (Prov.</hi> 12. 27.) after Ordinances; Oh there's world there;
never shall you see a Soul careful, but he finds every Sabbath something.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may learn the reason why many Christians,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> when the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to work upon them, have many combats and sore conflicts with various
temptations, and one corruption after another, and searce any breathing time
wherein they are freed from such; and then many strong crys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they are freed from all, and even these also; and they find nothing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
within or without that greatly troubles them; but they go on smoothly in a
course of profession also, without very much ado with their own hearts; their
Consciences are at peace, their distempers are at peace, and lye not heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; and they think God is at peace with them, and hence they are quiet;
the reason is because they are quiet, and fall asleep, and let their sin and Satan
alone, and hence they let them alone: A sluggard saith, <hi>there is a Lion in the
way, and it's hedge of thorns;</hi> many difficulties God sets before him; now
if a man meets with no Lions, no thorns, pressed with no great difficulties in
his course, it is certain sloth hath seised upon that Soul, and he is carried away
captive by it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 13. For</p>
                  <p>Look upon men, why should they be quiet? is it because sin and Satan are
quite vanquished, that they have no agonies and wrestlings with them? the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
denies that, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 12. Indeed while he keeps the Palace then he is all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
peace, and it is a sign he is entred again if you have this peace: But else <hi>Paul</hi>
himself, and all that are in the field, are opposed, and will have fiery darts; and
hence the Apostles exhorts to <hi>put off the works of darkness, and put on the whole
armor of light;</hi> why not works of light? because then a Christian will find
many assaults, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12. Or it is because they are men of such a refined faith,
and such pure mettal that there needs no knocking, nor melting, nor temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?
I confess the Lord doth nor see at all times the like need, but gives
his servants many sweet seasons; but yet 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8. <hi>they were begotten to a
a lively hope, and they did rejoyce greatly in that hope;</hi> yet they had their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of trials, <hi>manifold temptations, &amp;c.</hi> It may be they thought, did the Lord
ever love us, when such desertions, such fierce oppositions? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know the
Lord may leave <hi>David</hi> thus, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 6. but then God was angry, and he saw
it before many days: No, no, there is both reason for it, and need of it; and
why are you at peace now? it is because of your sloth, <hi>Ier,</hi> 48. 11. <hi>Moab is
at rest;</hi> and hence setled on her Lees, that they neither feel not know their sin,
and their scent is in them, though none is smelt or runs out; hence never stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by any word they hear, nor by any blow unless it be very heavy; they are
now at peace with Sin, Death and Hell, and are at league with them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 15.
And hence as it is, where there be two Kingdoms met, what's the reason that
there is no hurt that the one do to the other? the reason is, because there is a
peace; why so? because War was so troublesom, and rest was good: So it is
here; Why are men never troubled? but only because they are at peace with
their sin; and why so ? because rest is good: Oh they love to sleep; I shall
never overcome it, or I have other work to follow, say men, and hence they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40159:136"/>
spiritually war no more; and hence Satan and Sin are at peace: this is the guise
of men, they think the man is sure: they maintain a name to live before men,
keep duties upon the wheels before God, and have comfort often; and though
a world of vanity is in their hearts, yet it never oppresseth them, because they
oppose not it, and so are quiet.</p>

and that with purpose and decree of heart, to cleave to him in one thing as
well as in another; the heart is not at peace with Satan, and at war with God,
but joyneth to the Lord, and stands armed with a strong resolution against every
temptation; and hence peace with Christ is maintained, not with sloth: as
<hi>Barnabas, Acts 11. 23 exhorted with full purpose of heart to cleave unto the
Lord, when he saw the grace of God;</hi> seeing you find such mercy from him,
oh cleave unto him: But now a secure heart cleaves to the Lord in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
and if he be resolved of any thing, it is only of that which he can do with
ease, and will not be what he would be; he would be better, and know the
Lord more, and this quiets him; but he will not be what he would be, because
his compact and covenant of peace is made with another; he will be sluggish
and secure, and not use the means; oh sleep is sweet, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 27. <hi>The slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
roasts not what he took in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>nting;</hi> he will not roast it, there is trouble
there.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A believing heart, or Faith, finds and feels its rest by trouble.
<hi>Unto the righteous there ariseth light out of darkness,</hi> Psal. 37. <hi>After you have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
God settle you,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 10. <hi>Not as the world gives peace, give I it unto
you,</hi> Joh. 14. 27. For the life of a Christian is a life of faith, which is a life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to sence and reason: When the Lord kills, what doth he intend then to
save me? and when he blinds me, doth he intend to teach me? yes that he
doth, and by their warfare they find peace. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> at the end of his life
makes his trumph, <hi>I have finished my course,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. this makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
precious; when, though a man feels the strength of sin, yet sees the Lord
will subdue it; when a man findes guilt of sin, yet sees the Lord will pardon it
for his own names sake: It's a strange place 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>We were oppressed
without reason,</hi> Why? <hi>that we might not trust in our selves,</hi> ( why, was there no
way but this?) why, this is the life of faith, to find life in death, peace in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
But a slothful heart finds not rest by denying it self, and walking through
trouble; but by pleasing it self, and easing it self of trouble, because it is at
league with it: One that hath broken league, finds peace by war, and then takes
spoils; but another <hi>Ã¨ contra, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A man denies the power of godliness, that's a burden; his slothful
heart will not bear that, that's too hot; for the world carries a condemned
carriage of them; and hence he keeps a name to live, and thereby hath peace
with the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He wrestles not against Satan, and his lusts, pursuing them daily, carries
not the sence and feeling of them; and hence being luke-warm, he <hi>thinks he
is rich, and wants nothing, when poor, and blind, and naked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40159:136"/>
3. Hence, not wrestling against sin, he feels not sin, and so conscience is
at peace with him; <hi>sin is alive without the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Keeping a constant course of private duties, he thinks God is at peace
also, and so his peace gives him rest, and sloth makes him make a league, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loves rest: and hence we finde, a Christian most oppressed in times
of trouble, many times hath most peace; and <hi>Ã¨ contra:</hi> Because as it was
with <hi>Gideon,</hi> he had his peace by trouble, they had their peace by rest whose
flesh he tore with thorns, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8. 7. oh therefore fear and tremble at their
condition.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI.</head>
                  <p>HEnce see the reason why many a Christian, after he hath seen and felt the
work of Gods grace in his heart and soul,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and hence hath been filled with
peace and joy unspeakable, that yet after long profession loseth the sight of it,
and knows not whether there be any dram of grace in his heart or no; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
hath no assurance: but ask him, have you not known it? yes; but
'tis a question whether ever it was immortal seed or no, for then it would not
dye, as I see it hath; the reason of this is, a man falls to a secure condition,
fast asleep, forgets God and himself; and hence though there be grace, yet it is
not exercised, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 26. and hence not seen at all, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8, 9. and one
grace to another, and then an open entrance is made; this makes calling sure;
if this they do not, they will not see a fat off; why? because they forget the
Lord, which is one part of security: Hence we shall find in times of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
never such assurance as then, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. <hi>vlt.</hi> because grace is never so exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as then; and hence men much in prayer abound with much assurance (when
Christ was in his agony he prays more fervently) because then a man is watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and grace most exercised; when a man dyes in prayer, and grows secure,
and hath little exercise of grace, now it is a question whether there is grace
at all or no; and hence when men come to Sacraments, how oft are they put
to it whether the Lord be theirs or no! and hence when men come to the
Word, they lose all comfort, because they know now whether these promises
are theirs or no, because they are asleep, and not waking with the Lord. Oh
therefore lay no blame upon the Lord, but thy self; I have had grace, but
I have not exercised it; I have lived a life of sloth and security, had I lived a
life of thankfulness, prayer, watchfulness, and been ever awake, I should have
seen my own heart, and what the Lord hath done for my soul: Here, here lies
the security of a Christian, not in losing all grace he had, but in losing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it.</p>

end, and that with an infinite love you cleave to that, and then the whole body
will be full of light; but if your eye be double, <hi>&amp;c. Matth.</hi> 6. 24. A ship that hath
but one place to go to, will get thitherward in open sea with every wind. Who
is so great as the Lord? who minds thee but the Lord? doth he provide, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and pity thee, when thou seekest thy self? will he not do it much more
when thou art set for him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40159:137"/>
2. Consider the sweetness of this life. 1. In this life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult. be ever
abounding;</hi> why? oh you know <hi>your labor shall not be in vain.</hi> And what will it
be when you come to dye? <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Remember I have walked with thee:</hi>
And 2. After death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. it may be you account them nothing, but
they shall follow thee; do you not find bitterness in the end of another life?
you will find your pillow hard enough before you dye; oh therefore get some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to make it easie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed of forgetfulness of the Lord, for this is the reason why many
a man is not ever up in walking with the Lord, because he forgets the Lord; It
is not because he will not, or because he cannot, but he remembers not the
Lords love, the glory of his ways, <hi>what an evil thing and bitter it is to depart
from the Lord,</hi> Psal. 22. 11. <hi>They shall remember and turn,</hi> Jer. 2. 1, 6. The Lord
complains of Apostacy, <hi>they said where is the Lord? I remember thee, &amp;c.</hi> So I
say to you, the Lord of glory remembers you, thou art written on the palms
of his hand, and like shew-bread before the Ark, so thou dost ever stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord; hence every moment he is pardoning, purging, preserving
and devising how to do thee good; nay he remembers thy love, prayers, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
after him, nay, thy house and walls of it where thou dwellest: Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
forget not the Lord, that so you may be ever seeking after, and cleaving to
the Lord.</p>

                  <p>HEnce see the reason why men after long profession fall into many sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
opinions,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> because their hearts are surprised with this enemy of sloth
first; and it is Gods just judgement upon men, that seing they love their sleep
and laziness, they shall be lazy by rule, and so be for ever hardned in it.</p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>What are those slothful opinions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> First, What is this but one, to make the Law no rule to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
life? as though a Christian should be like a man at Sea, and carried by
the wind, but he must have no Compass to sail by also: In these last times
Christ's Kingly Office is chiefly opposed; men are glad of Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and death to save them, but when he comes to plant his Laws (as all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
do amongst men) they do then shake them off, and under a colour
of love to their Prince, make his Laws no bonds to binde them; so these
think this is the liberty of a Christian, the liberty of a Prince to be lawless,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That there is no activity of Grace received, no power to stir till
stirred; and therefore leave all upon Christ, they can do nothing; if he gives
nothing, they cannot help it; if he doth, then all is well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is true, till the
Lord doth help what can we do? But there is an immutable assistance of Spirit,
whereby the Lord doth enable his to act more or less like himself, when
stirred up: And if you finde none, because you fall short of Christ, do
not think that the Lord will be a cover to such a cap; nor a pillow for
a slothful heart; there is a sickness in the best, and must be followed, else
we dye.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That Ministers must not exhort: Why? what can men do? If
servants cannot abide to be spoken unto when there is need, from what can it
come but idleness? What can words make better? yes, the Lords words have
a power to help or ruine, when you shall say, oh the exhortations, oh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retaties
I have had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one main means of reconciliation is now abolished,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:40159:137"/>
Fourthly, That Christians must gather no evidence from Sanctification; we
shall finde the root of it to be difficulty, which is never sloths bed-fellow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is difficult to be holy always, but there will be many weaknesses and
sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When we do so, it will be hard to discern what holiness it is, whether
counterfeit or not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When we do so, 'tis hard to keep it, but you will lose it again, and be
put to farther search, and so off and on: I believe Christians make them more
difficult than indeed they are; but yet it is the Lords way; Scripture is plain for
it; and if avoided because difficult (which to many is sweet) what is this but an
invention of sloth?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That what a man cannot do, is always a weakness which the Lord
will pardon: Sometimes it is; but not here : for a mans chief sin may be kept
unsubdued from this ground, which sloth makes warrantable.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That if once the main be wrought, though he never grow better,
yet he is to keep his peace and confidence; Oh intreat the Lord to keep your
heads sound (though hearts be sluggish) so as you may not love, and defend
your security, and then go and leave Christ.</p>

why did I oppose lust and pride? oh, because vile; why, this is worse; it is

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> HOw and why doth this occasion and breed security?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In that Christs absence from the world makes him to be
much forgotten in the world (out of sight out of minde) especially at those times
when men are ready to be overcome by sloth; now forgetfulness of God is the
beginning of all the deepest security that can fall upon men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 18, 19, 20.
whence the Lord saith, <hi>I will hide my face from them, so as they shall not see me,
but I will see them and what their end shall be,</hi> and hence this is made the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of returning to the Lord, <hi>Psa.</hi> 22. 27, 28. <hi>All Nations shall remember and turn,
for the Kingdom is the Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because the absence of Christ keeps those things from being seen
which should awaken, and which sensibly do awaken; that as it is within the
night, when there is little noise, and darkness over-spreads all things, it is hard
now to be kept from sleep, when the curtains are drawn; so while Christs is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
it is a kind of night (his coming called <hi>the day,</hi> and <hi>the day of the Lord</hi>)
because the things of the Lord are hid from men: And those are these two
chiefly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:40159:138"/>
1. The error of the Lord and the wrath to come; why did men sleep all
the Sermon long (which lasted one hundred and twenty years) when <hi>Noah</hi>
preached? because they knew not of the flood; <hi>so shall it be in the days of
Christs coming,</hi> men know not what wrath is; the thoughts of this kept <hi>Pauls</hi>
eye waking, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The exceeding riches and weight of glory that shall crown all the Saints;
hence all the faithful have been abundant both in doing and suffering for the
Lord; (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.) <hi>It is not worthy the glory which shall be revealed:</hi> Hence,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. <hi>They took joyfully the spoiling of their goods,</hi> because they had
<hi>in heaven a more abiding sustance;</hi> they overlooked all things here when they
saw that. When these two things are seen (which are the last things that
shall continue) it would awaken; but painted fire, and a painted Kingdom
never draws a mans heart much; so neither do these work upon securelings;
or if they do see them, they soon are hid from them again, their light de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying,
being not like the morning but declining Sun; and though the Saints
do see them, yet they are very apt to lose (for a time) the sight of them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if the Lord tarrieth; and hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. they had need of patience; but
<hi>when the day comes who can sleep?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In regard of his absence, do things of the world present
and keep their glory before the eyes of men; for what is the reason that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things (which men in their judgements say are vain) yet they are of such
price with men! It is with them as it is with Glow-worms and Stars that
keep their shining, and are very glorious because the Sun is set; so Christ is hid
in his glory, and whilst men are led more by sence than by faith, men doat
upon these things; they know nothing more vain, yet nothing more glorious:
When Christ comes a man shall see all the world, the honor, comforts, wealth,
crowns, greatness of it buried before his eyes; and when an end of these
things shall be seen, now the Lord will be precious; as doubtless when they
saw the Ark floating upon the water, happy are they that are there might they
say; and hence <hi>Mal. 3. ult.</hi> those that said <hi>the proud were happy,</hi> what was the
reason of it? but because of this, <hi>The day of the Lord was not yet come to make
up his Iewels?</hi> Now when once the eye is bewitched with the glory of the
world, nothing causeth security sooner; as strange fancies in the head work a
man first asleep: <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. When <hi>David</hi> beheld the prosperity of the wicked,
he began to dislike all Religion, and to account it simplicity to be holy, until
at last he saw the end of these things.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Because in Christs absence men feel not the evil of sin which doth
befall them in their security, nor yet the evil of their own hearts; for if men
should be presently punished, and smitten by some revenging invisible hand of
God upon them after every sin, and as soon as first they begin to sleep, you should
never see the heart secure; and hence the Devils live in horrors daily, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the judgment of the great day; thus it will be at Christs coming,
<hi>then the secret things of darkness shall be brought to light;</hi> but now is a time of
forbearance, hence a carnal heart <hi>is set to do wickedly,</hi> and to go on securely,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 11.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Because while Christ is absent, conscience lyes still most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and seldom is throughly awake, and hence a man sleeps; for conscience
is the Lords witness, accuser, and notary; now the witness then speaks most
fully and clearly when the Judge is come: Now however God doth awaken
some mens consciences throughly in this life, yet it is not universal, but in few,
to be thorowly awakened, and hence men are very secure, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 14. <hi>Who shall
dwell with everlasting burning, &amp;c?</hi>

time is given to us to make us watch) should make us secure; that men should
turn day into night, a day of forbearance, into a night of forgetfulness; for
if the Lord should not delay his coming, how many thousands would be swept
away before any peace made with God, or before any work finished for God!
now he in pity gives such days, delays his coming for this end, and do
we thus requite the Lord? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. Christ himself doth his work while it is
light; <hi>the night cometh wherin no man can work, Ioh.</hi> 12. 35, 36. Now what
a crossing of the Lord is this? If he should come, thou shouldst be consumed
by him; and if he doth not come, you will grow secure before him.</p>
                  <p>Hence see the reason why the hearts of men are so secure in times of health
and peace,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> but they cry out and look about them in times of sickness, and
when the approach of death is near, because Christ now begins to come, and
Christs presence is near in great terror, and severity, and glory; but be
these are afar off; now the soul begins to see Christ, and how he must shortly
stand naked alone (stript of all comforts and friends) before an all-seeing
God; and now they look about for evidence; but before, the Lord would not
come as yet, he delays his coming, I may live many years and provide thus
and thus for my children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh men complain of secute careless hearts, and
the cause is this, they see not this day a coming.</p>
                  <p>Hence see one special way to prevent and remove security when it is fallen
upon the hearts of any,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and that is by daily setting before you the coming of
the Lord; the Apostles penned this, and Saints believe this, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> I am
perswaded some men have had in their dreams the visions of the Almighty,
of which <hi>Iob</hi> speaks, and have been awakened in terror and fear, even with
the dream of it; but how would this awaken if seen and beheld whilst indeed
you are awake! Many Monkish spirits have been much awakened in their
superstitious way by this; but the spirit of a <hi>Paul</hi> will be much more; for by
this means he awakened all the world to look about them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. And
for himself, this did make him exercise himself, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15, 16. so it will be
with you; you will not only be awake your selves, but keep all awake about
you; and this is not legal neither thus to do. It is certain if you complain
of security, I dare complain against you, that this is the cause; you look
upon the comming of the Lord as a long time off, and see it not daily;
it converted some in scoffing <hi>Athens</hi> to the Fith; much more (if
converted) doth it awaken. Let us therefore commend Three things to
you.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                  <p>First, MAke the coming of the Lord real, see it real, and set it really (as
it shall be) before your eyes: <hi>Heb. 9. ult. to them that look for him,
&amp;c.</hi> Why do not men look for him? truly, very few do look for him really;
it is only a report, a noise with many men; where there is the power of grace,
it presents things as they are, which shall be so; <hi>Faith is the substance of
things not seen,</hi> it puts them in their being; <hi>it is the evidence of things not seen,</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40159:139"/>
for otherwise it will never work upon you. Especially think on these Four things
at that day.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The consuming of all things here in the world, which your hearts are so
ready to doat upon, and of all carnal and fleshly excellencies which you trust
unto, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Seeing these things shall be consumed, what manner of persons
ought we to be</hi>! If a man that is to make a sea voyage, did know that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he brought to shore beside Gold and Pearls, should be consumed as soon
as he comes to shore, he would not fraught his ship with those things: if men
were assured here is a house where you and yours shall be burnt, they would
set it elsewhere; men come from one Country to another, because sin will
consume.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The amazing glory of Christ Jesus (when Christ shall come as a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
to refresh they sad heart) and all his Saints at that day; look upon
Christ as sitting on the clouds of fire, raising the dead, then them that are
alive changed in the twinckling of an eye, coming with all his Angels, Heaven
left empty of them, and Saints sitting at his right hand shining like the Sun,
so that all the word shall stand amazed at them, and then, when Judgement is
done, up they go to Heaven (the third Heaven) with a shout, and so be ever
with the Lord. And then</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider the fierce wrath upon Reprobates, who <unclear>shall</unclear> rise like Toads
coming out of their holes in winter time, standing before Christ's Tribunal,
crying out of the day that ever they were born, and receiving their final doom;
imagine the silence while the Lord is pronouncing the sentence; and when
past, a cry; and then Christ to depart, and shut up himself in Heaven with his
Saints, the Reprobate never to see him nor his face any more; are these things
tales, fables, notions? if they be, blot out the Scripture; but if real, oh
then who can but awake! If God intends mercy to you, the thoughts of these
things will awaken you, you shall see them really; if not, they shall awaken
you by feeling of them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider how many will be found too light at that day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Make this day present: Optick glasses will take within them
the present image of things afar off; a Mud-wall cannot give the form of
them; so by Faith look at these things that be to come as near for if we see
really the Lords coming, but we look upon it as a thing that is afar off, it will
not affect: Now a thing may be present to Faith which is not to sence; It
may be the last and great coming of the Lord is not very nigh (although we
are doubtless in the last times) but the beginning of this, thy Petty-Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before that general Assize, may be nigh. Oh therefore make it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>How shall we make it present?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. By pondering that speech of Christ, spoken to that end, <hi>Matth.</hi>
24. 44. <hi>In an hour you think not of he comes;</hi> so that either thy time is, when
thou thinkest it is nigh, and then you attain the thing; or when far off, why
then is the time, and that he will not come presently is more then you can say;
you see with wrong eyes, and wrong the Lords patience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By comparing the present time with eternity to come; for look as it
is with base and little things, look upon them in themselves, they are not base,
but compared with things excellent, as the Prophet sheweth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 17. so
the time of this life, grant it be never so long, look upon it in self, it is long;
but compared with eternity, it is exceeding short: Set a prick alone and you
may perceive it, but when made at the beginning of a line it is scarce percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible;
this time of life upon which we sit is but a point of eternity: Oh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
will amaze you, and make this time short, yea, nothing; <hi>Moses</hi> hence
<hi>forsook Pharoahs honor,</hi> because <hi>of the pleasures of sin for a season;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:40159:140"/>
calls <hi>afflictions short,</hi> when he saw <hi>the eternal glory which should be revealed:</hi> Oh
that you could think this time to be as the delivery of a childe by many pangs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, so you by many sorrows are passing a short passage to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By making earthly things nothing, or not as great things: A mans friend
is night to him, but there be trees and hills between them, and if these were
down, or he could get above them, he would easily see and say, Oh I see him
coming, he is even at the door, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 8. So Christ is nigh unto us, and we
to him; but the things of the world, mountains, and hills, and cattel, and
ground, this and that stands between us and our sight, that we cannot see the
Lord; these things are so great, that the Lord is little, that though near, we
cannot see him; now when God cuts down these things at sickness, or when
we can get above the world, now we can see them whiles we look at them as
they are, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 11. <hi>The rich mans wealth is a tower in his conceit</hi>
(all things are swayed by conceit) pull down that, now you make all naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you to see the Lord nigh.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Do this daily; else you will grow secure by little and little: Oh
that I could prevail with you to set before you once a day this time! how would
it keep your hearts from dreaming and doating upon these things: When any
sorrow, that day will refresh; 2. When any duty done, that day will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
3. When in want, yet full at that day; 4. When in misery now, blessed
then. When a man is ready with light and lamp at all watches of the night,
oh blessed then! you can hardly keep from security and carelesness by this, how
will you then do without it? you will die in security.</p>

else I do, I will be sure to keep this door, it shall not come in here, and yet do we
not see men fall here! one would think it should not be so in these times, when
God calls so many of his servants to Heaven to him, and is hacking at so many
posts and pillars of this Tabernacle; especially considering withal that it is no
time to seek great things to your selves: <hi>Thou shalt have thy life for a prey</hi> (as he

forth to meet him.</p>
               <p>Then all those Virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N these words is set down the preparation made sometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Bridegrooms coming, and that is by a <hi>Cry</hi> that <hi>the
Bridegroom cometh;</hi> and therefore the Churches should meet
him: This is amplified from two things chiefly;</p>
                  <p>First, The time when this Cry was made, and that was
at <hi>Midnight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the effect that this Cry took upon the Virgins,
from <hi>vers.</hi> 8. to 10.</p>
                  <p>What should be meant by this Cry is disputed of by some: Some think by
it is meant the descending of Christ from Heaven with a shout, the voyce
of the Arch-Angel and Trump of God: 1 <hi>Thess. 4. ult.</hi> which (as I do not
wholly exclude) because there shall be such a clamor before the Lord comes,
as at the giving of the Law; so at the time when the World shall be judged by
the Law: so this circumstance is added (as <hi>Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>us</hi> and other interpret) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Parable, which speaks of Christs coming under the similitude of
a Wedding solemnized in the night time, according to the custom of those
times, who when they came forth out of their several houses to meet one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
a cry and noise is made, <hi>the Bridegroom cometh.</hi> Now,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What is meant by the coming of the Lord, the Bridegroom?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The coming of Christ principally here me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>nt, is that coming of
Christ either to general or particular Judgement in the latter ages of the world.
Then, for when, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 1, 2. they thought the coming of Christ was near;
no saith he, not till Antichrist is revealed and destroyed; therefore when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
is discovered and destroyed, and Churches upon this refined, now there
remaining no more to be done in this world but Christs coming, all promises
being fulfilled except that, so that they live in expectation of that; Christ slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and not coming so soon, Churches grow secure; yet before the Lord
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40159:141"/>
comes to either judgement he hath his cry: yet here is to be meant the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ at other times of the Church when they shall be Virgins; and
hence a command to watch that concerns and bindes all to be ready against the
coming of Christ, whether to general or particular Judgement at death, or
any other coming of the Lord in this life, either in special mercy to his people,
or in terror to Hypocrites, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. Christs coming to hear prayers, and to
avenge himself of his Churches enemies, is a coming. When the Jews shall
be called, and Antichrist destroyed, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. it is called Christs coming: So
the sum is this, look as before the Bridegroom meets the Bride, and cry is made
to awaken them to come to meet him; so before Christ comes to his secure
Churches to take his people to nearer fellowship with himself in this life, or at
death, or at judgement, Christ hath his cry to awaken them.</p>

                  <p>THat before Christs coming to his secure Churches,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 1.</note> the Lord will send forth
his cry to awaken these Churches, to give warning of, and to make them ready
for his coming; his coming either at last day, or at death, or in this life, to take
them into nearer fellowship with himself.</p>
                  <p>It is true, Christs coming is at midnight, at a time when one would think
he would not come; but yet at midnight there is this cry, which prepares and
goes before his coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What is this cry?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not a still voyce, but a loud cry, which hath its effect for which
God sends it. Now we shall find in Scripture there are two ways by which God
doth usually awaken a secure sinner.</p>
                  <p>First, The cry of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The voyce or cry of the Rod<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> So this Cry of Christ is.</p>
                  <p>First, Sometimes the cry of the Word; for thus <hi>Iohn (Isa.</hi> 40. 3.) is called
a <hi>Crier,</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 7, 13. And this is the first course, God takes
to awaken, by giving the first honor to the Word; this is his mercy to see if that
will do it. Now it is not every word that will or can awaken; for many times
it makes men more secure (as some can sleep best by the noise of many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
<hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 9. When the Lord sent to fat them, he sent <hi>Isaiah</hi> to preach to
them; however in it self it is a cry of Christ; and seldom doth he come but
he gives warning by his Servants the Prophets: But when it doth awaken,
there are these particulars in it that it may awaken.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a word of Majesty and glory in respect of those that bring it, <hi>Iudg.</hi>
2. 1. one that preached to them (he was no Angel from Heaven, for it is not
said he came from Heaven, but from <hi>Gilgal</hi> to <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>chim</hi>) why is he called an
Angel? because of that Majesty wherewith God clothed him, when he came
to awaken them; for they had made a league with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and they
began to vex them it seems, and he comes to tell them they should do so still,
and God set on this with majesty upon their hearts, and hence they fell to
weeping: And this is usual with the Lord, wherein he hath a time when he will
awaken men to purpose, he puts a spirit of glory and majesty upon his servants
more than usually, that the most secure shall see more than a man, they shall
see the spirit of glory sparkling, and shining thorow such Lanthorns; as when
God intends to harden a man in security, or leave him for a time, then he shall
despise the Messengers of God, and see no more but man, and shall have
strange opinions of them; and hence <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. when witnesses are raised up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to confound Antichristian Doctrines, the Spirit of life from God entred
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40159:141"/>
into them, that great fear and aw fell upon all that saw them; such light shall
shine through these curtains, that men shall not sleep.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a word of discovery, and that of some secret hidden vein
of sin, which men never knew before; for when a man is once grown se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
it is wonderful to see that torpour that lies upon a mans spirit, a most
palpable and plain sin which may be smelt and felt, yet it is not felt by himself,
like him that sleeps when the ship is sinking, he knows it not; now when the
Lord doth awaken, he doth it by such a discovery, and this makes them look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 67, 8, 9, 12. <hi>because of my house which is waste.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is a word of terror, that burns as well as shines, that so they
may indeed be awakened; for though <hi>Stephens face shines like an Angel,</hi> and
he singles them out, <hi>Oh ye stiff-necked;</hi> yet the terror of God not falling
upon them, they are secure still: But now when the Lord makes his
Word full of terror, it awakens them. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. They would have
a King; they were told of their sorrows; and hence <hi>they feared the
Lord and Samuel;</hi> and now were awakened to see that which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
saw; God helpt forward the terror of expecting of some outward mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A word of power to awaken some or other among the Churches,
and this makes all the rest to look about them, as usually when the Word
comes with never such terror and majesty, we shall see men fall asleep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
without they see the effect of it in some, and one or two will awaken all
the rest; like some that are asleep, when they see others up, What do I
here? <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. The Lord shews how he comforts his people; First it is by
the cryer; and then Verse 9. 10. it is by <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> When <hi>Samaria</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
received the Word, then <hi>Simon</hi> also believed; when the Jew begins
to look toward the Lord, ten men shall take hold of their skirts<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and say,
<hi>The Lord is with you, Zach.</hi> 8. 23. Sometimes this is the cry before Christs
coming, and yet men may shake off their fears, despise the light: Hence the
Lord hath a second Cry, and that is</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, THE Cry of the Rod; for there is a loud voyce in every Rod,
which many times those that are most secure, must and shall
hear, <hi>Psalm</hi> 2. 5. <hi>He shall speak to them in his wrath, Micah</hi> 6. 9. Now
what are these? (I speak not to secure persons alone, we know how the Lord
doth exercise them, but how he speaks to secure Churches) sometimes he
hath lesser blows; but he that is not awakened by the Word and the cry of that,
is seldom awakened by the cry of smaller evils; he may be startled, but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his pillow is still soft, he must bear it, and cannot amend it, he sleeps
again. Now the things whereby the Lord doth and will awaken are
Two.</p>
                  <p>First, By bringing Churches into great extremities and distress, that
they know not what to do, scattering them one from another in woods
where they know not what to do for bread. <hi>Iudges</hi> 6. the <hi>Midianites</hi>
prevailed against them seven years, untill they fled to Dens like beasts hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up and down, and at last they have no bread, but begged, and their
cattel destroyed; Verse 6. Now they cry unto the Lord because of the
<hi>Midianites,</hi> and he sent a Prophet to make them cry for their sin; for
this is the nature of a secure heart, while it hath any thing to ease it, it
will not be awakened throughly, if it be in a sleeping vain; and hence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40159:142"/>
the Lord distresseth them; hence <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29, 30. after Antichristian tribulation
shall there be worse? yes, after that <hi>Sun and Moon shall be darkned, i. e.</hi> there
shall be a confusion of all things (for it is the language of the Eastern Countries
so to express it,) <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By ruin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ting of Churches, breaking the Candlesticks, quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lights, delivering them to spoylers, until the Land be almost left
without inhabitant, some slain, some carried into captivity; and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
cryes, Word cryes, and Rod cryes aloud to awaken them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 9.
<hi>Go and make this peoples heart fat;</hi> Lord how long? <hi>until their house be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate;</hi>
and then you hear of the sparing of a little remnant whom the Lord
awakens, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. you see them secure, Verse 7, 8, 9. there's captivitie
and plagues to destroy families; will the Lord deal so with <hi>Iacob,</hi> the most
excellent people under Heaven? yea, saith the Lord, I abhor them, and
when you see them on the banks of <hi>Babylon,</hi> then they remember <hi>Sion, Levit.</hi>

                  <p>In regard of the people of God, who are secure with them that are vile

without crying; but because they are there among them, the Lord will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken;

of pardon without faith, and this faith is never severed from repentance;
and hence the Lord will not come upon them unawares before he hath
broken their hearts (not from infirmities, for they will last till death, but)
broken their hearts for and with their iniquity, their chief sin.</p>
                  <p>In regard of Christ himself,<note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> that so he may be received with esteem, and

3. That did once delight in approaching nigh to Christ in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in going forth in them to meet the Bridegroom; but now they not
onely neglect this, but take delight therein, and rest upon their neglect; as
a sleepy man takes his delight, not in his work, but in the neglect of it;
and though their hearts tell them of this, yet they go on their way, and
dye so; what shall we think of them? I will not absolutely determine,
but they give shrewd signs, that they are fallen into a dead sleep: For the
Lord will awaken his Virgins before his coming; nay, he will awaken very
many others for their sakes, rather than they shall be secure; Look as it
was with Christ, the nearer he came to his end, the more enlarged, and
heavenly, and spiritual; so it is with them that have the Spirit of Christ:
Who are the Servants whom Christ shall bless at his coming? <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 37.
<hi>Blessed are those that shall be found watching;</hi> That look as there is no
smaller evil, but usually before it, comes the Lord and gives warning; so
the greatest and last evil Death, that so they may prepare for that; as
<hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7. <hi>The time of my departing is at hand</hi> (how could
<hi>Paul</hi> tell that?) the Lord gave him secret hints of it, he could smell that
state before he saw it or touched it; he could observe by the course and
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ncurrence of providences; now my course is finished, the corn is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
all in <hi>Asia</hi> forsake me; so the Lord doth many times unto his people;
however he doth keep them watchful: Oh consider it therefore, you that are
secure, if the Word now doth not awaken, yet when thy sick bed comes, and
death appears, remember this truth; But remember it now, I carry the brand
of a Reprobate upon me.</p>
                  <p>Hence see what little cause any man hath to take pleasure in his security;<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> no
pleasure in any sin (especially to a holy heart) as of the sin of security; for if a man
takes pleasure in his cups, or in his course company, or in dancing, as <hi>Herod,</hi> or in
gaming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conscience will give him knocks, to every bit he snatcheth here;
there's honey, but then a sting in them also; But now when a mans carriage
is fair, outward duties performed, conscience is quiet; when a man hath been
at work, he thinks in conscience he may sleep; for deepest, sweetest secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
comes after most work we have done; it is but a neglect, a slip, which
I hope to recover out of one day; it is not an unlawful thing, but a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that I quiet my heart upon: Now I have good company, freedom from
dangers, Ordinances, curtains drawn about me, the best sleep with me; and
what hurt is here? but see the little cause you have to sleep, especially in
this Country.</p>
                  <p>First, It will not be your rest alwayes, for there must and will come a
cry; <hi>Moses</hi> took but little delight in <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> pleasures, they were but
for a season; and therefore as the Lord there said, <hi>Micah</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Depart, this is
not your rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the Word doth not awaken you out of it, your cold prayers,
your heartless hearing, your careless walking with God, that your lamps be
not burning (burning love to the Lord and his people, shining holiness, so as
others may walk after your light, and be glad to follow you) that present plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you take is the rotten wood that breeds the worm of a gnawing conscience,
when in the time of your trouble, it shall say, What hath your idleness gained to
you? and it is the fore-runner of misery; that if lighter miseries will not do, the
Lord will bring seven plagues more, and drive you into a wilderness, and there
shall you be famished for want of bread; and if this will not do, God will send
spoilers that shall sell you for slaves, and that shall carry you away captive, and
then you shal remember <hi>Sion,</hi> and the days you slept over your time: Find any sin,
but security in it will make a desolate Country and familes; if you sin and rest
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40159:143"/>
in it, (though not gross) nay do but decay in what once you had; many say
it is more here then ever; I deny it utterly, unless it be to them that are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure;
and if it be so, the loss of your first love (a small thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) will
hasten breaking. Let this truth therefore be a burning Beacon to awaken
you; for God will make this word good, and not let one tittle of it fall to the
ground. <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 3. them that trembled put away their strange wives, and
wept sore for it; so do you; you think you may have this and the Lord too;
true, but the Lord will not long abide with you if secure.</p>
                  <p>Hence see the reason why the Word strikes deep,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and is very smart some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
upon the consciences of men, that a man speaks as if he were in their
very bosom, that a man saith, God is here, that the Lord leaves thee with sad
qualms upon thy conscience, and no peace from all (it is oft sanctified unless
no grace) nay, after all this affliction comes; if thou wert not secure, why
would the Lord cry, make his Word cry, and his Rod cry? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore
be not weary of either, but bless the Lord for, and quietly bear both; unless I
had those terrors within, and afflictions without, I had gone astray, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 4, 5.
<hi>David</hi> was secure and kept silence, he confessed, and the Lord pardoned;
for this shall every one that is godly seek; Oh so do you! think then, am not
I in the number? oh let me seek then and confess my sin!</p>

it is certain.</p>
                  <p>For though it be midnight, yet he comes we see: For this
coming at midnight is not to be understood of the last day of
Judgment which shall be at midnight (as the Rabbins and Monks
in their devotions conceive) for Christ speaks here of his coming to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
judgement also, which is not always at midnight: The scope of the Parable
is to provoke to continual watchfulness; because though the Lord doth not
come in the beginning of the night (as was the custom of the Jewish marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages)
yet he will come late, even when you look not for him; even at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
there is a cry. I confess the Lord speaks principally of his coming to
Judgment; yet it is true of any other coming of Christ to his people in this
life; and because particular examples and instances are the roots of general
truths (as Circumcision a seal, so all Sacraments are so; Christ is a Saviour
of his people; it is meant of great salvation at last, yet is true of all salvation
beside) therefore I shall speak of the coming of Jesus Christ to his Churches
and Servants in the general; and so involve the whole coming of Christ, for
the more use and comfort to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:40159:143"/>
Now we shall finde that the Scripture speaks of a sixfold coming of Christ,
that as all our deliverances are but shadows of our great and last deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
so Christs coming now is but a shadow of his great and last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>First, Christ is said to come to his people, when he comes to hear their
prayers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 8. And the Lord argues strongly, Will an unjust Judge arise
at night, to help a widow a stranger, when she is importunate? and will not
the Lord hear his elect and chosen? <hi>yet when he comes, shall he finde faith? i. e.</hi>
such prayers of faith as shall continue; oh no! but soon apt to be weary before
the time comes.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p>Object. BUt if they cease, how do they pray night and day?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because they do so for a time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When they cease, then they are ringing in Gods ears; so that let the
prayers of the elect for any mercy be once offered and presented as incense
before the Lord, the Lord will not be worse than an unjust Judge, never to
come to his people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Christ is said to come to fulfil his promises; for sometimes the
Lord keeps his people exceeding short, and gives his people answers to their
Prayer in particular promises (you find it so) <hi>Psal.</hi> 85. 8, 9. <hi>I will hear what
the Lord will say, for he will speak peace to his people,</hi> that so they may live
by faith, and glory more in the Lord then in themselves; yet he will come,
though it be very long, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 36, 36. <hi>Ye have need of patience, that ye may
receive the promise; for yet a little while, &amp;c.</hi> We think it long, yet it will
be so.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Christ is said to come to his people when he speaks peace, and
breaks the clouds of fears and troubles, and shines upon his people; for while
the Lord is angry, and hides his face, that a man is beyond sight of the face and
love of God, now God and Christ is said to be gone; so then, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to speak peace, now he is said to come, as that Martyr said, He is come,
<hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 16, 17. <hi>I am r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>turned to Ierusalem, with my mercies, and the Lord will yet
comfort Zion;</hi> for when the Lord forsakes his people for seventy years, and takes
away all his Ordinances, the external visible signs of his presence, one would think
he would never come, yet the Lord will come and comfort his people, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 2.
God hath sent and anointed him, and the Spirit hath filled him, and he is as
willing himself to comfort them that mourn, nay when they have the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of heaviness; and when it is done, Christ is come; then that is a coming
of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There is a coming of Christ when he comes in more full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his Spirit to his people, and that in his Ordinances; for there is a state and
time of Christianity, wherein a man is carnal and blind, and the Image of
Christ darkly stampt upon the soul, and is exceeding weak; now the Lord is said
to come when he doth this, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>I will see you again,</hi> and <hi>I will not
leave you comfortless,</hi> Orphans alone without any one to take care for you; now
though it be long before the Lord do come here; yet come he will, when the
soul thinks it impossible, and the thing incredible; <hi>Behold thy God, thy King
commeth, Isa.</hi> 40. 9. with 23. <hi>He shall come like the rain upon the fleece of
wool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Christ is said to come when he comes to destroy and root out the
enemies of his Church, whether outward enemies or inward enemies, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 21.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40159:144"/>
Now grant it be long, the Lord doth suffer them to prevail, and to be pricking
bryars to the hearts of Gods people, and to the heart of Gods Spirit in his
people, yet he will come; and hence the Church pleads this with God as an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
thing with him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 1, 2, 3. He comes when men look not for him, yea
he came so here; and the name of God lyes upon it to make known his name
to his adversaries, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 5. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his
word; your brethren that hated you and cast you out said, Let the Lord be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
He shall appear to your joy, but they shall be ashamed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Christ is said to come to the soul, when he comes to it at death, to
abolish all sin and sorrow, and to possess the soul of immediate fellowship
with himself, and at Judgement when the great mariage day shall be, and the
Bride made ready, and the Bridegroom in their perfect glory to the view of
all the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 3. Oh many a one is troubled now the Lord is gone from
it mediately to comfort it; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled,</hi> you have a God in
his Word to believe in, cleave to that, and me in it; but when death comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, and enemies come against me, and heart fails, and eyes fails, will
the Lord come? Yes, I will come again, for I go but only to prepare a place
for you, and make Heaven sweet and ready for you; some would have all Christs
coming here, but there is some hereafter.</p>

                  <p>BEcause the love of Jesus Christ never fails his Churches and People;<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> love
will keep men from being ever absent from the thing they love: Now look
as it was with <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom Christ loved, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 11. 3. he heard that he was

stay of thy heart, not only for righteousness, but for all fulness of comfort, and
that not onely to thy conscience, but to thy heart and will: for many rest on
Christ for righteousness; but what comforts their hearts? they joy in other
things, and are greedy after things in the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as a man that
rests on Christ for righteousness, he abhors all other righteousness; so if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
rest on Christ for consolation, you will deny all other things to comfort
you also, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 5, 6. <hi>Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, he shall not see when

our fathers trusted in thee and were delivered:</hi> Yes, but not you that are so poor
and vile: True, I am so in the eyes of the world; but on God have I been cast;
To trust to Christ for righteousness, but not for consolation, is to marry a man to
pay debts, but not to live upon his house; try if it be so or no; thou feelest the
Lord gone, yet thy faith is not gone from him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Lord hath given thee a heart, whether the Lord comes or no, not
to trouble thy self about success, and time of coming, as to minde the doing of
his work against his coming, that thy heart is resolved and will live to him
though he never comes to thee. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 5. When <hi>Mary</hi> said that wine was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
saith Christ, <hi>it is not my hour;</hi> then, <hi>what ever he bids you do, do it; Heb.</hi> 10. 36.
you have need of patience; for all impatience ariseth from minding inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the success, what the event will be, and distracting the mind there; but (as a
poor servant) when a man thinks whether Christ come or not, these sins shall
down; this argues love never to be forgotten; <hi>Iudges</hi> 10. 16. nothing grieves
the Lord and makes the Lord absent, but because grieved with sin, misery comes;
now sin is removed; it may be no assurance while thou diest or livest; yet if
resolved my soul shall follow the Lord, now it is right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if while the
Lord is now gone, your hearts are jolly, and loose every way, way desire you the
day of the Lord? it is darkness to you.</p>

                     <hi>that deep security can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
always make the Lord to reject them;</hi> and therefore we shall
find three expressions of the love and kindness of the Lord to
the wise and foolish Virgins also.</p>
                  <p>First, When they not only slumber but sleep, and that long,
even to the coming of the Bridegroom almost, yet Christ
spares them, and doth not all this while cut them off, and bury them out of his
sight, as men that do forget him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He prevents them with awakening grace, and the Lord is up
when his servants be abed, and is awakened for their good when they are asleep
and regard not him; and first by his cry he awakens them before they shake up
themselves; when once the Churches fall asleep, they would sleep their long
sleep, and never awaken, if the Lord should not by some cry or other prevent
them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He longs for their fellowship and company though secure; and
therefore it is not a cry of terror and wrath, the Bridegroom hath forsaken you,
for your secure careless course; but it is a cry of grace, <hi>go forth to meet him;</hi>
yet he is willing to have communion with you, yet he desires that you would have
communion with him; oh come out to meet him; I shall wrap up all these
together, because I shall be brief. Wonderful was the grace of Christ to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the old world, when for the space of one hundred and twenty years he
waited for them, who after they had been an hundred and nineteen secure,
yet then the same spirit that waiteth for us in these days of the Gospel, preached
the Lord unto them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was very long speaking to <hi>Israel</hi> (as the other Prophers) in so

the Lord as thy Husband? will he keep his anger for ever? Nay, the Lord cast

                  <p>IN regard of the foolish,<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> there is no reason, but the Lords pitty and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to a sinful people; he hath compassion on them because he will; for he
doth not pity people only in respect of their miseries, but in respect of their sins,
2 <hi>Chron. ult.</hi> 16. he sent his Prophets among them (and they despised them)
<hi>because he had compassion on his people;</hi> the cords of grace are let down to all

                  </p>
                  <p>In regard of the wise Virgins, because his Mariage-covenant with them is
not suspended on any thing on his peoples part;<note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> for though there is a condition
which the Lord doth require of his people in Mariage-covenant, yet the Lord
so requires it, as that he intends to work it, and undertakes to maintain it; and
there is no evil in them, but he promiseth in this Covenant to remove; he will
heal them of it, but he will not cast them off for it; hence <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 25. Christ
loves his Church; what, because it had loveliness? no, but that he might wash
it; and if he loves it to this end, that he might wash it, then no pollution can
make the Lord utterly to cast it off; if he loves because of deformities, that he
might wash them away, then none can quench his love; hence no security, no
carelesness, though deep, though long, so long as the Mariage-bond between man
and wife conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>s, so long as no sin is committed that can break this Mariage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond,
so long infirmities or other distempers never separate. Now, no sin in
them that are given to Christ can break the Mariage-bond, because it is wholly
undertaken on the Lords part; women may commit Adultery, and break their
Mariage-bond, because they are not kept by their Husband from that; but
the Lord undertakes this for his people, <hi>to put his fear in their heart, that they
shall never depart from God. Hos.</hi> 2. 19, 20. <hi>I will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fall to fits of doubts after security, though deep and long (as many
Christians do) and so are ever laying and pulling up foundations; after most
peace of conscience, most security, and then the Sea rageth again, and it is
hard for any man to keep his peace; have you had such mercy, and love, and
will you thus be careless and loose again? believe it, the Lord will break your
bones if you love your beds, and not give you rest till you finde it on another
pillow; but yet do not deny his love, though you have forgot it; do not
say you are not Virgins, because fallen asleep; and that the Bridegroom will
never come to meet you, because you have lingred in meeting him; for
<hi>behold he cometh:</hi> I know there is a difference between the security of the wise

them; <hi>the Spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak;</hi> and when they were awakened,
their vessels were not found empty; <hi>Peters</hi> vessel was full of love to Christ
before, and when the Lord awakens him, he tells the Lord he loved him; and
his fall and security in it for a time made him more humble, and love the Lord
with less self-confidence, and more purity: But oh, wonder at it, rejoyce in
it, and be thankful for it! especially you that have fallen into any secure frame
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40159:147"/>
since ye came into these Virgin-Churches; which you cannot but do, if you
consider the greatness of this sin; to sin and be long secure, and fast asleep, is
strange.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is the great provoking sin; look throughout all the Book of God,
let the sin be grear, and immediately after conscience smitten, bones broken,
and heart awakened, we shall never see the Lord but he is pacified, the Lord
hears their groanings, and remembers his Covenant; but little sins fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and by security continued in, the Lord visits for this, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. When a
man shall not only sin, but take delight in it, as a man doth in his sleep.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is a sin in places of liberty and Ordinances, whereas the Lord was
never so good to thee, and thy heart never worse to him, never so secure, you
thought and purposed never to be so watchful and tender as now; to be secure
here, greatly aggravates such security.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This sin is a common sin; now this adds to a sin, when a man has a hand
in a national sin, that runs in the blood of all the Churches; for so you see it is,
all the Virgins secure: when all forget the Lord, as though there were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to lay more loab upon the Lord; what doth this but harden others in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity;
thy wives heart, thy brethrens heart, such a one is secure; as though
it were not enough to fight against the Lord, but Ciant-like to fall among the
troops of them that securely dishonor the Lord: When the old world was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
we heard nothing of that; but when the Sons of God came to be secure,
and all flesh corrupted their ways, the Lord falls a mourning, and repents that
he had made man: When any sin groweth general in Churches, that sin is most
grievous to God; Princes children when they sin alone it is grievous, but when
they take part with all the mutinous crue against their Father, this strikes deep;
Oh that ever mine eyes should see this evil.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a sin which is the last, and is the ruine of all the foolish Virgins,
and perfects their perdition, as here it did; they slept till it was too late; oh
that the Lord should not cast you off for this! admire at this; and let thy heart,
and house, and work be filled with praise for this: You have complained long
of a secure heart; see it humble thee that it continueth, but make thee wonder
that the Lord will not cast thee off.</p>

they thought themselves well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now I see my error, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh Lord, what
if I had been left to these thoughts; yet this is ever the frame of a secure heart
(like swine) well when it is in the mire, basking in the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is pleasure; but consider, it is but short; long security will end in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
affrights, and doleful awakenings, for one days short sleep: I remember
<hi>Nineveh's</hi> are set out by this, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>This is the rejoycing City, that dwelt
carelesly;</hi> painting out their misery for this sin above all the rest; so when
plagues be upon you, God and Angels shall point at you, This is the secure sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that lived loosly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It deprives you of more rest and ease; carnal security keeps a man from
knowing spiritual security; while your sin and sleep is sweet, the grace of
Christ and the sense of his love shall be strangers to you, and to your hearts;
Christ is anointed to preach to a weary, not to a sleepy sinner: <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 4.
There are seasons of refreshings and coolings, which such shall never know.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This which is thy pleasure, is the Lords sorrow and grief; look as when
the sinner mourneth under his sin, the Lords heart is quieted, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17, 18.

by soiling themselves, and all through neglect; now they trimmed them,
when first, they wiped off the soil; secondly, made search for that which was
necessary for the shining glory of them; Thus far the foolish trimmed their
lamps, who yet did not find that oil in their vessels, which was the main thing
to beautifie them indeed, which the wise had; so that they all trimmed their
lamps; the wise trimmed theirs indeed; the foolish theirs, so well as they could.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the serious real apprehension of the nearness of Christs coming, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to awaken throughly the most secure Virgens:</hi>

that have been awakened to know any thing of the Lords coming) this will
awaken them; for when the cry was made He cometh, now they all arose;
whilst he did tarry as they thought, then they sleep; but when the cry comes, that
he is near and coming, oh now they awake.</p>
                  <p>This coming is meant either of his coming to the last Judgement, or of
his coming to particular Judgement immediately at and after death: I shall

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11. When the Apostle would awaken them out of security, <hi>Your

saw death and the Lord near them, now they feared, and cryed, and repented;
<hi>Oh we dye,</hi> say they, <hi>pray for us:</hi> It is with the Soul as it is with Sea-men,
when they first set out in the Main, if the wind be good, and all things well,
they take their rest and sleep, though going nearer every day than other; but

which have bound him up in the bonds of security; a soft bed, and an easie
pillow, and much feeding in a place of rest, will procure much sleeping; the
heart of a man would never be secure, if it had not some delight or other to
quiet it self withal; now at Christs coming there is an end of it, then a man
is stript naked of all his greatness and honor, friends, blessings; and when a
man sees an end, and is come to an end of a sinful way, now all a mans delights
and hopes perish; the beginning of a sinful course is sweet and beautiful (like pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
seen afar off beautiful) but the end is gal and woormwood; for every sinful
secure course is sweet in appearance, or indeed; if only in hope, and conception
(as in a dream) when the end comes, all a mans hopes perish. If indeed it
hath been sweet, now there's the more grief; now my heart, my life, my blood
must be taken from me, and what profit is there now in this my stubborn way!
when a man is sinking, and the boat is breaking, what a miserable wretch now,
Lord help! hence <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 3, 6. when an end is come, now they fling their silver in

shall seek peace and shall not find it,</hi> verse 25. now <hi>they shall seek a vision of
the Prophet,</hi> verse 26. Like a man that is drawn into a fair way, and is out of
that his way, when he comes to an end, and is forsaken of all and left in a wood,
now what's the profit?</p>
                  <p>Because at his coming there is the entrance and passage into eternity,<note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> and
into an eternal state of weal or wo; now though the apprehension of the end of
a secure sinful way, may and will awaken, yet when eternity is apprehended it
will amaze; for this time is but a little spring or river which runs into
eternity, and carries all men living down with it to eternity: Now
when men see an end of time, and the beginning of eternity, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
posting thereto, it is as when a man sees himself floating upon the waters,
where there's no bottom, and all stay gone, though he hath been long secure,
now he will cry out if he sees it. It is with men now, as it is with those that
are ready to be cast down from some Towr, it makes the heart tremble, oh!
where shal I alight! oh it's impossible but if men do apprehend eternity, and that
also near unto them, but it will awaken them; it will make a stout, stony-hearted
<hi>Saul</hi> to run to Urim; it will make Kings and Princes run to Monasteries, and
men to Cells and Deserts; It will make the proudest <hi>Felix</hi> tremble when <hi>Paul</hi>

that in Virgin-Churches under all awakening means, Ordinances and
Providences of God; men put far from them this day of death, and time of
Christs coming, they think seldom of it, come not near to it, nor make it near
to them; sometime they complain of a dead sluggish spirit, secure heart, and
yet remain so, and wonder sometime at the reason of it why it shou'd be so;
why? this is one reason of it, either you think not of this coming of the Lord,
or see it not near, even at the door, but number many days to your selves,
and this is the cause of it, you do not lodge in, nay look to your Coffins, and
walk to your graves side often, and so stand there and hear the cry, and see the
Lord a coming; there will be more in what I say than what you see at first blush
of this truth; but this I know, and the Word proves it, universal security ariseth
from hence. As for instance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Why do men minde the things of the world so much? that there is
such care for them, such eager desire after them, that many times prayer is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
Sabbaths neglected, when will they be at an end? God neglected, Souls
of wife, children servants, a mans own soul neglected and overgrown with
nettles; that there is such an high opinion, dreams of worldly goods, and
when a man hath them, then at rest; because, with the glutton, they think they
have goods for many a year; and hence we shall see when a man waketh, death
is near to him; and when it is near to a man, now he thinks he hath been
deceived in all the things of the world, that they are not good for him, 1 <hi>Cor.
7. 29. The time is short, and the fashion of the world passeth away:</hi> Nothing
makes these things so sought after and good but only esteem; now this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men look only to things present.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why do mens hearts sink with the meanness of their outward condition,
and the troubles of it? (for this is security) it is because of this, they do not
remember the nearness of the coming of the Lord; it is but a little while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and then the God I have chosen will alone be sweet, and he will make me
amends for all my troubles, and therefore let me bear up my head a little while.

                  <p>Thirdly, It will be very glorious; works even of dying men are very
glorious and successful: Speeches of living (yet dying Christians) sink
deep; for then God is near unto us when we are near unto him, and see
things as they are; and hence such speeches are commonly blest to men; the
speeches and works and carriages of Christ were never so glorious, as when
most near his end.</p>

to be awakened partly by fear to the apprehension of these things; for
God hath sanctified them for this end, and though these do not work grace
(where there was none before) barely, yet the awakening of conscience, is
that whereby the Lord prepares for grace; and this is good in its kinde; and
it stirs up grace where it was before, as here this cry makes the Virgins to kindle

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Truly till the Lord teach us the number of our days, we can
never do it: yet three things do;</p>
                  <p>First, Convince thy soul of the sin and evil of looking after to morrow,
and reaching after that time which is to come, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 1. 1. It is none of
thine. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Nothing draws the heart so much from God. 3. You will never
find what you expect hence; these are lying vanities, therefore come not to
these wells.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Either thou wantest assurance, then fear his coming, for fear
will make misery present, and so awaken; and hope (<hi>Ã¨ contra</hi>) good present:
Or thou hast assurance; then love his coming, see all thy good wrapt up there;
and love will make things absent beloved, and present comfort in the thoughts
of them; as wicked men that love the things of this life, and are in certain
hopes to have them, they oft rejoyce in the hopes; because the good is present,
they reckon upon it as theirs already.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, See how near you are unto the Lord Jesus: 1. That you are made
for the Lord, not to enjoy these things; they are made for you, and not you
to serve them; because God hath called you out of this world, from the grave,
hell, sin, to life; now the next is glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5.</p>

him with open face; this will make you look for the day of delivery.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In regard of the baseness of other things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
men do use to glory; the wise man in his wisdom, the strong man in his
strength, the rich man in his wealth: There are Three things which make these
base.</p>
                  <p>First, These things make a man not the more to be accepted of God; the
Lord respects not, values not the worth of any man by these things; and to
make all the world know this, <hi>he staineth the pride of all glory,</hi> and <hi>chuseth the
poor and foolish things of the world to confound the wise;</hi> a wise man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
respect the horse the more because it carries store of rich treasures, he will
not fall down and reverence it for this; hang Swine about with pearls, who
honors them the more? and will a wise God respect a man the more for these
things? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. What is that that is of great price with God? Holiness is of
great price with God: And what though all the world honor a man, and a man
honoreth himself, while this is wanting?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All these things leave a man dead under the reign of Satan,
power of his sin and dominion of death; and hence <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Let no man glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in his wisdom, &amp;c.</hi> Death is entred into your windows; take any bondman
bound with fetters (though golden) doth any man account him the more
glorious? a Prince that is made a vassal and slave to every base fellow, is he
the more glorious? no: So whiles men lye under the reign of death; stick a
man that is dead with flowers, what is he the more glorious? alas no! his life
is gone; now the Spirit of holiness is called the Spirit of life, even of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40159:152"/>
life that never shall dye, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And therefore as it is said of a Flye, there is
more excellency in a Gnat than in a Cedar, than in the glorious heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath life, which the other hath not; so though men wonder at the
goodly trappings of wicked men, yet the poorest and most despised Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
that hath the Spirit of life, is more glorious.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Because these things only purchase the more credit and honor in
the eyes of men, and that of wicked men; for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>We know no man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the flesh;</hi> if they do, it is that which they account themselves beasts and
fools for, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. And what is the honor of man? it is the

                     </gap>sest thing that is; for it is that which is without a man, it is no excellency
within the man; it is but the thoughts of a mans head and heart, than which,
what more vain, what more mutable? nay, 'tis but the dreams of a mans head,
for they are mistakes: If all the town should dream another was a King, who
yet were indeed a Beggar (which when they awake they see) what were he the
better for this? <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. how he doth glory in priviledges, which

rest, a decay in holiness; the lamp is defiled, the light and lustre of it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, and who will reverence it then? 'tis admirable to see the complaints
abroad.</p>
                  <p>First, Look but into Families, what is the reason there is so much discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
there, that Servants are weary of their Masters, Masters of their Servants;
and there is such complaints one of another, little respect one of another? it
is for want of holiness, power, and life of godliness; the Master saith, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
is unruly, froward, surly, flothful, unfaithful, untrusty, and must not be
spoken to; the Servant saith, his Master is passionate, unkinde, wants pity to
his body, and sometimes strikes him without cause, and much more careless
of his soul, never instructs him, but is eaten up with the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> truly this
is the cause. It seems the Lord wrought upon divers in Primitive times, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40159:153"/>
the Apostle gives Servants an item, <hi>that they may glorifie God, and adorn the
Gospel of the Lord Iesus;</hi>

very holy, and very prudent; and Ile warrant did his Masters work better when
his Master was absent than before, and prayed for success in his business, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's</hi>
Servant. Look but upon Husband and Wife, it is strange to see what
divisions and jars there; and what's the cause of it, Wife doth not honor Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
nor Husband honor Wife? how comes this? oh, there is little holiness
seen in their private walking one with another; the woman thought the man
godly; had I known this, I would have seen you a hundred miles off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the
man also he complains of his wife, I see now I am like to be troubled with a
continual dropping, a very fury of hell, so impatient, (and the next neighbor
hears of it) nothing can please her; what's the reason of this? your sin makes
your shame, and there's the want of holiness, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. man might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the Wife, and the Wife by the Husband; not that it is always so, but
usually so.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Look into Churches, what is the reason people lose their honor
much in the hearts of Ministers? he respects others, but not me; and sometimes
they think, now he strikes at me, and meaneth me, and then the heart swells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
what's the reason that <hi>Paul</hi> professeth he will come with a rod among the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians?
they were babes, and carnal, and contentious, and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and life;</hi> and what's the reason he sets out the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> so? 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 5.
because of this they did abound, and hence commended of all Saints; hence
want of growth and holiness; they travel in birth till Christ be formed, and
when they cannot see that, hence they are in throws for you; what's the reason
Ministers lose their glory among people? I confess 'tis not always for decay
here; for <hi>Iohn</hi> in prison did not lose his holiness; and hence, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
him, Christ commended him, and his reward was with the Lord; it was
not a testimony of his unholiness, but a fore-r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>nner of the end of his days, as
well as of the end of his work; and hence when all <hi>Asia</hi> forsook <hi>Paul,</hi>
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>it was the time of his departing now at hand.</hi> But that which is
the cause of it many times, is want of holiness within; and hence though men
fee not, yet the Lord will not give a false testimony, nor let men do so; hence
neither judgements nor their speeches reverenced; or because men see not the
ancient Spirit of holiness, hence no mourning for them in secret, no holiness
in speeches, they smell of the field, not walking as patterns before them, <hi>Mal.</hi>
2. 8, 9. <hi>not caring for the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ock which Christ hath purchased with his own blood.</hi>
What's the reason there is that complaint of want of love one man to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
one member to another, who are bound by covenant to it, such jars, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions?
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Truly nothing makes so firm an union between man and man
as holiness and grace, this tieth the knot; and it is not holiness hid, but
now seen; it not being seen, hence comes all your breaches, its impossible
else such small things should make it: Oh a tender heart and the life of
Christ is not indeed seen; a holy man exact shall never want love, that in every
company scatters something, that like Christ, goes up and down doing good,
healing the diseases of mens hearts; there's a man I could dye with him in my
very bosom: I am perswaded the decay of holiness in the lives of men, is
the cause why Sanctification is questioned as an evidence of Justification; and
hence division.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Look abroad into the world, what is the reason the Churches lye
among the pots, and are soiled with so many disgraces, that though we be the
people of the Lord, yet we are not called so? why, ja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s, divisions, earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
want of love and mercy, murmurings, loss of former life. When Jews
are shining with the glory of God, Kings and all Nations shall bring in their
glory to them: Oh consider this! sin doth make you vile in Gods eyes and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40159:153"/>
mans eyes: Many complain they cannot be respected, nor received; this is
the cause of it, you excell not here; others take notice of your unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 29. <hi>Because thou honorest thy sons above me,</hi> this and that I will do

God will blast the wisdom of the wise for it: Oh therefore let this be enough,
and then you will not hunger after other honor; for this is glory and honor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and you have thought so, when your selves, Oh if I may but honor the

may carry it out fair for a time; the fairest professors that by their Sorceries and

look as it is with Christ and his people, their cross and shame here, it is but
their preparation to their crown; and hence, when Christ was put to the most
open shame, then was the day-break of his glory; so all that you glory in, which
God gives, 'tis but a solemn preparation for your shame: And hence, when
<hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> is at his highest pitch and thoughts of glory, then is his down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall;

glory; when poor men come to the Court and see no King there, they bow
down to his Chair; whereas if he was seen he should have all the honor then; so
when men see creatures, but see them like empty chairs, the God of glory not
filling of them, we bow down to creatures, but when God is seen, now the soul
gives all glory to him; a man that lives without any in his house as chief, all
servants attend on him; but when the Prince comes with his train, now all his
Servants with himself are too little to attend on the Prince; so here, when men
come to pray, or preach, or speak, Oh how doth a wicked heart seek it self? but
when the Lord is seen, now all attend on him; hence when God sends his
people to honor him, he first appears to them in his glory, and it never is long
out of their minds; hence <hi>Abraham</hi> forsook his own Country, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. <hi>Moses</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Take heed of harboring an ill opinion of holiness, for
then if your judgements dislike it, your tongues and your lives shall disgrace it:
Take heed of imagining that First, there is no grace in Saints, only immediate
actings of the Spirit; this is no spirit of holiness, no more than in <hi>Baalams</hi> Ass,
through which God spake to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That these graces are only common; who will seek much after
that, or esteem that which is but common? this is to despise the Spirit, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
the blood of the Covenant, whereby the Church is sanctified.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That grace is so dark and obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ure a thing always as no evidence can be
had by it, though it be peculiar grace: this is a high degree of disgrace to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Grace; if one should say here is a man, but believes not his testimony,
'tis doubtful and very questionable what ever he saith, it is a dishonor to
him, take heed of this: When the Spirit of Holiness comes to us in form, it
comes thus, with little peace; but when in power, with much assurance, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi>
1. 5. It is a sad thing, if that which was the complaint of the Prophet, shall be
the complaint of the Spirit, <hi>Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of
the Lord revealed!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed of decaying in a spirit of bounty and love, and in largeness of
heart to all the people of God, nay, to all men, so far as you have time and
strength; let a man be never so great a Prince, if he once lose his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he loseth his glory; so here <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 8. <hi>Give bread to the hungry, then
shall thy light break out of obscurity:</hi> Many complain that <hi>New-England</hi>
hath so little love, Non-members not visited, not regarded (though many
times unjustly) Oh they thought to see so much love, and care, and pity;
but here they may live and never be spoken to, never visited; Oh take heed
of this; Nothing beautifies a Christian in the eyes of others more than much
love, (hypocrisie is naught) Oh excel here; visit poor families, sit one
half hour and speak to discouraged hearts, shew kindness to strangers; such you
were; Ile warrant God will bless you, this was the glory of Christ, full of
grace and truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be very careful in receiving in of Members into Churches, one ill
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40159:156"/>
man will be a spot and pollution to all the rest, <hi>Iude</hi> 12. <hi>spots in your feasts;</hi>
you know how many come over, how it begins to be pleaded for, What, not
baptised, and Professors? and yet how many are disfigured? therefore try them
well; take heed of thinking Elders or Churches are too strict.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly be much in prayer for the Churches, <hi>Isa.</hi> 62. 7. <hi>Give the Lord no
rest till he make Ierusalem the praise of the whole earth,</hi> that's the way; do you
see any sins in the Country, go and stand in the gap with <hi>Moses,</hi> and though
the Lord offer to do good to you, yet turn him not off so, till he promise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his poor Churches also; beg and this will do it; be much in fasting; it is a
shame for us (who are laying the foundations of many generations) not to be
much with God in prayer and fasting; and that when in other places there
is so much sowing of this seed.</p>

forward, decay; their gifts decay, life decays, and these <hi>are last: and last are
first;</hi> many newly brought home to Christ, excel them, and live so, and die
so, that one would think should never hold out. I need not speak more,
Scripture is so abundant: I say it is after some time of profession; for at first it
rather grows than decays and withers; but afterward they have enough of it,
it withers and dies: And look as it is with some bodies when they are healthful,
they grow by all means; but when once Nature is spent, and now declining, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
recovers them, though they may be kept at a stay for a time, but dye they
will with their best cordials in their mouths; so it is here.</p>
                  <p>For Explication of this Point, we are to attend how and why this is
thus; and that not in the worst, but in the best of the foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</p>
                  <p>First, The Spirit of God comes upon many hypocrites in abundant and
plentiful measure of awakening grace; I say it comes upon them as it did upon
<hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 24. 2. And as it is in overflowing waters, which spread far, and
grow very deep, and fill many empty places, they fall upon the ground, they
come not from any spring within the ground; and hence though they last not
always, yet they last some good time; so it is here, the Grace and Spirit of God
come suddenly and plentifully upon many a man, which gives them a time of
flourishing, it comes not from imitation, or education, or moral perswasion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but physically from the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 12. when they wondred
that <hi>Saul</hi> was among the Prophets, one answered, <hi>who is their father?</hi> who
gave them this gift of prophecy? is it not the Lord? so the fame Lord is rich to
<hi>Saul</hi> also: And I say it is only awakening grace; for renewing grace, savingly
to change their nature, is not given, but awakening grace, which works upon
conscience, and conscience upon the whole man; and thus it was here with
these Virgins, they had wonderful light, and a spirit of illumination to see the
Lord Jesus, and hence to look for him with much affection and forwardness,
as well as the wise, and to keep them company in Church-fellowship, and
though they were secure, to complain of their decays, and desire the spirit of
grace which they saw in the wise.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though it doth come upon them thus, yet it doth never rest
within, so as to dwell there, to take up an eternal mansion for himself, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 10.

                  <p>Thirdly, Hence it doth decay by little and little; as a man that dwels not,
but so journeth for a little time in a house, he removes by little and little, till at
last he is quite gone; as ponds filled with rain water, which comes upon them;
not spring water that riseth up within them, it dries up by little and little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til

                  <p>First THrough want of daily nourishment and supply from the Lord Jesus;
for look as it is with many bodies, suppose they have life, yet if there
be not daily nourishment for it, and wholsom also, it will dye ere long, and
consume; so it is here, there is a kinde of life which hypocrites have from
Christ, and it may be fed, and so they live for a time; but this the Lord ever
doth for them, they are not always fed, and hence die, as it is <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. some
were quickened to follow after Christ in the wilderness for loaves, some for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ends (as his Disciples) but the Lord knew their want, <hi>labor not for them at
that perisheth, but for that which gives everlasting life,</hi> which Christ will give
you; and hence the whole Chapter is spent upon this, to feed upon himself,
whence the best were offended: Let a man partake of all Ordinances, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
he shall finde nothing else but decay unless the Lord be in them all to
give daily nourishment, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16. daily, I mean, as there is decrease of that
taste they have had of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Through the emptiness of a form; for when the Spirit of God
dwells not, but only comes upon a man, it is not long but it corrupts into a
form ever after; a man at first knows many truths, and at first is affected with
them, he doth not presently forget them, or shut his eyes against them, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he hath known them a little while, at last the sweetness of that knowledge
is lost; and so he hath a form of knowledge, like lessons which a man hath been
much affected with, but having plaied or heard them oft, he hears and knows
them, but is not affected with them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>ult.</hi> So at first a man doth many
duties with delight; stay a while, and he keeps the duty, but the delight is gone in
it, and so hath an empty form; now where the power of godliness and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life of Christ is not, it degenerates firstly usually into this form, and this is
all that is left; and the form being empty, hence first, A man comes to loath
the truth, and profession of the ways of God which once he loved, and so in
time to fall and decay without as well as within; as drink or milk at first are
sweet, but stay a while and (the spirits not preserving themselves) then it grows
dead, and sowre, and sapless, and so it is here. <hi>Capernaumites</hi> at first be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then they fall to a form, then hard to be wrought upon, their hearts fat
under all means; <hi>if thy light be darkness, how great is that darkness</hi>!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Through the power of lust; for where the Lord dwells not, there sin
reigns, and it will get head where it hath had any affront, and so choak the
power of all means, and hence a man withers, as in the thorny ground, it grew
up and choaked the word.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Through the fitness of external temptation, which must and will
prevail, when the Lord is not within to keep the Palace; it is stronger than all
common graces in the world, and will draw away the heart and life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10.
there is an hour of temptation which tries men, which will discover men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
now those temptations are ever suitable to places and persons.</p>

                  <p>First, SOmetime the temptation is extream want, as it was with the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>es,</hi>
when they were under the oppressions of <hi>Pharoah;</hi> Oh to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to the Lord in a wilderness, and to enjoy the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where
they should have Ordinances, Oh they are much taken with this! and many
prayers and groans to be delivered out of their oppressions; but when they
came to the wilderness, and there did want bread, and then water, now they
murmur; which murmuring God remembers, and casts them off for: Had
they not <hi>Moses,</hi> and the cloud, and God's promise, and experience, why
did they complain? Oh to bear want, they could not! extream want is like
extream sickness, it makes all sweet things bitter; some wants men can bear,
but not extremity; this saddle doth pinch so hard; so the young man, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
all for me,</hi> saith Christ, but he could not; God and Creatures are enough,
but not God alone; so it is with many a man, he can be content to lose
something, but when brought very low, cares and fears grow up and
choak all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sometimes the want of spiritual supply; a man looked for much
from the Ordinances, and finds it not; not because the Lords heart is streitned,
but because theirs are not enlarged; and hence they have enough of God, and
all his Ordinances; they have had the heart of them, and now let them lie fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<hi>Zach.</hi> 11. my soul loathed them, and theirs me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, sometimes abundance of outward blessings, peace, liberty, plenty
here; now these things, like ground in Summer, 'tis strange to see what lusty
weeds now there be, that did appear dead in time of winter, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then take heed thou forget not the Lord thy God; now proud and secure, and
forsake all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Sometimes persecutions from men: if hot and total ruine be
threatned, this scares from God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Sometimes corrupt Teachers and delusions among them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Increase of iniquity in good and bad, in the place where men live;
hence love waxeth cold: All which are <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>I will name no more, but thus mens common grace comes to wither, and

sends divers of his faithful servants to a place, and many at first hearing are
wrought upon, battered down, convinced, mourning after peace, going to

eminent profession; the Lord hath here foretold that after some professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their lamps will go out; we do not wonder if ponds full in winter are dry
in summer, because it is the time and season of it, and they want springs to
feed them; and never was there any time since the world began that there
were such Apostacies as now.</p>
                  <p>First, One man after much profession intends to follow the Lord, consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is troubled at humane inventions; Oh, saith he, if delivered, well enough,
though I lose never so much! well, he lays out all, and is delivered; but that
which quiets conscience, doth not quiet his heart and affections; but his very
loss for conscience makes his lusts and desires after other things break out more
eagerly, and men cannot now live upon Gospel only, with bread and water;
no, no, you are deceived; as it is with sick men, they let go all their estate for
recovery; but when recovered, they must get up their estate again, this will
not satisfie: And thus some fall spiritually.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others they sought for much in Ordinances, but finding not
what they looked for, Ordinances are but as pictures fair a far off; but when
men come near them, Word, and Fellowship, and people of God, then they
despise them, because they find not a living God there.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, While God keeps men under sad temptations, wants and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
Oh then they are humble, and pray; but when blest with ease, and peace,
and plenty, and honor, then how lofty and secure? this is better than the
Lord: Never such a decay of the spirit of prayer; never was there such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confusion
in the world, such burning of Cities, slaying of men, rents of
Churches, God minding to stain the pride of all glory; and yet never such
hearts.</p>

in their minds; a spirit of discention from the people of God.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Scarce shall you see one man in a hundred that is vile in every thing,
that falls totally; the foolish Virgins did not so, yet their oyl was spent, and
their lamps going out; there was a man that was slain suddenly, and his blood
in his face was fresh, his beauty glorious, and many weeks continued without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction,
yet life within was gone; so 'tis the condition of many a man by one
wound or sin: And hence a Physitian at <hi>Wittenb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to that which will last; if it be rotten, let whosoever will take it; and be sure
it is so; for when God doth fully awaken you, you will see it is not right; the

suspitious here; fear lest a promise being left, any fall short of it; other things
will not last, neither Creatures, nor the Lord to do you good, unless you have
everlasting grace. It is a time the Lord is stripping the world of all ornaments,

there? no, our oyl is spent, and hence <hi>give us of your oyl;</hi> they saw nothing

now. The same persons that are sometimes so puft up, that they think they
are rich and stand in need of nothing, may be basely dejected, and so feel a want
of all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How may this appear?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> First, Because this is no more than what the Devils have; if this be
Sanctification, to see, I have no Sanctification; if this be Humility, to see, I
have no humility; if this be cleanness, to see, I have nothing but uncleanness;
the Devils then are sanctified and cleansed; who as they are unclean spirts,
and accursed of God, and set apart to all evil and sin, and bound up in the chains
of darkness, so they know it; they believe the Word, and they know they have
no Christ, no Grace, no love of God, never shall see mercy, comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and tremble at this, <hi>with whom there is nothing but a fearful looking for of
Iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because this is no more than what the Law may bring a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
<hi>For by the Law Rom.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>is the knowledge of sin; i. e.</hi> not only of gross
sins but also of secret sins; for Conscience which is in every mans heart will
discover the first, men that live under the Law see more; and hence <hi>Paul</hi> speaks
of himself, <hi>so far forth as under the Law, Rom.</hi> 7. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Now that
which may be wrought in a man meerly by the Law, may be wrought in a man
under the Law; a man under the Law, is under the reign of the Law, which is
to convince of pollution universal, and so to curse; <hi>The Law is not the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life to any man,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. and if the Law may convince of
sin thus, this sight of sin and vileness is no part of eternal life; and therefore
foolish Virgins may well come thus far; and this will especially be found
among them where there is a searching Ministery, that there is scarce any
close conveyance but the Word discovers them: <hi>Gehazi</hi> cannot carry it so
closely, not <hi>Ananias</hi> so cunningly, but <hi>Elisha</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> will find it out; <hi>Heb.</hi>
4. 12. <hi>The Word is quick and powerful, and searchetls,</hi> which is but a common work;
and hence when <hi>Peter</hi> had told <hi>Simon Magus, Thou art in the gall of bitterness,</hi>
he denieth it not, but saith, <hi>Oh pray for me;</hi> indeed if the Word discovers the
strong-holds, and high forts, and secret lusts and imaginations, and beats them
down, and so brings the Soul in subjection to Christ, and into captivity, that
is it which is the power of the Gospel, and love of Christ peculiar to his peoples
works; but to let a man see he hath nothing but filth, and to be a little affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it, this is no more than what is wrought in a deceitful hearer. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.
23, 24. The Law or Word lets a graceless heart (a forgetful hearer) see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and what can it truly discover to him but his vileness? this glass will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their smallest spots; this Sun will let you see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>otes; you know and see,
and that's all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Because this is no more than the awakening of sleepy Conscience,
which the worst man, and closest hypocrite may in time have; <hi>Cain</hi>'s consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
while it is secure, thinks his offering as good as his Brothers; but when awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,
now <hi>my sin is greater than I can bear; Saul</hi> goes on in persecuting
<hi>David,</hi> and thinks God will help; and hence 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 5. goes to Urim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but God answers him not; now he sees his condition, and makes a doleful
complaint of it, That God was departed, and no answer: This is usual; <hi>Psal.</hi>
9. 20. Put them in fear, O God, that they may know themselves to be but men,
weak, sinful, vile men: When the Lord sets up his Judgement Seat in a mans
conscience, not only gross evils, but the secrets of all hearts, all mens hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisies
are then opened to themselves, as at last day to all the world; and
hence as hypocrites consciences shall be broken open at the last day, so now
also in this life, they may see their profession to be but paint; hence <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 14.
Hypocrites are afraid when God appears in anger; <hi>Oh who shall dwell with God?</hi>
they are sometimes so confounded with the holiness of God, and the terror
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40159:159"/>
of God from thence against sin, that who shall dwel with God? are there
any in the world that can stand before him? now all is paint, and vile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Because Hypocrites may have experience of a great change
wrought in them, which decaying and corrupting, they may sensibly finde a
want of what once they had; which though they thought it had been saving
grace, or that which would commend them to God; now they see they have
no grace at all, hence are lest as these Virgins; if a man never was rich, he
cannot be sensible of being a Bankrupt, a Beggar; Look as it was with <hi>Adam,</hi>
he was in a happy estate, in the image of God; now when lost, he saw himself
naked, and was ashamed, and was this saving grace? no: So though Hypocrites
attain not to that righteousness, yet they may attain to many spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>al excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which they may prize exceedingly, as those that commend them before
God and men; but these corrupting, they may now easily see their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and vileness, and want of all: <hi>Saul</hi> had the Spirit of God we know, but
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>an evil spirit came, and Gods Spirit departed;</hi> did not <hi>Saul</hi> know
this? the having of Gods Spirit made him more sensible of the evil spirit; so
it is with many a man; the Spirit of God doth depart, and he cannot pray nor
prophecy, nor speak, nor think, nor do, as he did; nay he may find an evil
spirit upon him; and is this unknown? may not foolish Virgins know this?
as <hi>Sampson</hi> when shaved.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Because that which is sometimes a just judgement of God upon a
carnal heart, that they may see and feel; but many times (I say not always,
because the Lord doth use this to prepare for mercy) it is so that men that have
despised grace, and Christ, men that have coloured it over with God, and
thought highly of themselves for what they had; they shall see all their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is but paint, and all their Gold, Tin and Copper: <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>You shall seek
me, and shall not finde me, but shall dye in your sins;</hi> seeking ever presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a want; so that you shall finde a want of me; and if of me, of all life, of
all grace, of all comfort and good; and this loss the Lord makes a punishment
which they shall bring upon themselves by contempt of him.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p>HEnce we may see the woful condition of those. <hi>viz.</hi> First, Consider how
far from eternal life those are that never knew their fall;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> the foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
knew their want of oyl and shining, and yet were foolish, and yet were
shut out; how great is their fall then, and how great their misery, that have had
burning lamps, but now know it not? this is the state of many a professor,
many a man who is fallen from the Lord, and the affections once he had, but
he knows it not; God did enlighten him, but now he is blinding of him; he
did affect him, but he is now benumming of him; he did make him tender, but
not he is making his heart fat; he did make him low in his own eyes (as <hi>Saul,</hi>
but when a King then pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>t up) so God is swelling of him; but this is most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
he knows it not, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. If a man did know his lamp were going out, he
might seek, as these, for it, and possibly find it; but now no hope unless the
Lord help; as we see men wounded and falling, they are astonished at the blow,
that they know it not, and may die, unless those about them dress them, and
send to and fro for help for them; so it is with many; men are so stupifled with
some blows of their lusts, that unless Christian friends exhort, admonish and
send their prayers and tears to heaven to the Lord, no hope of recovery again;
and whether the Lord will be entreated is hard to say; surely it is rare, and yet
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40159:160"/>
thus it is 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. sometimes, if it be not a sin unto death; but in a Brother,
grace will fetch help; but if the man never had grace, and now fell without
feeling, there's little hope; if a man can feel no sun rising upon him, nor yet
how the day goes away, whether the Sun be setting or no, it argues miserable
carelesness, or miserable blindness, and that the man is in darkness; so
here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What will become of them that were never cast down so low as
these, that never came to be so good as Hypocrites,</p>
                  <p>For 1. You were born and have lived not only in a sinful estate, but in a
Christless estate; dead without all life, every part of thee polluted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Lord doth draw any out of this estate, he will make you know
what poor creatures you be, that you shall say, I thought I had been thus and
thus, but I see I am wretched; I thought I should be saved, but now I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
so that your mouth shall be stopped, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. else you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to the Lord, to your Fathers house, and prize the grace of God, if any
husks to live upon now.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You never knew this; never came to complain to any Christian, Oh

is scattered still; which as it is pleasing to many a graceless heart, and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his lust, so it carries a fair cloak of Humility and Self-denial in
it, and makes way for such an Evidence which the Scripture did never yet
declare.</p>
                  <p>Poverty of Spirit is a Grace peculiar to them that shall have the Kingdom
of Heaven; But to see no Grace is common to those that shall be shut out
of the Kingdom of heaven; none but those that are justified can be savingly
sanctified; many that shall be condemned, may see, do see that they have no
Sanctification: And therefore this is no Sanctification.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If this be Poverty of Spirit to see no Grace, then Common-grace is Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial-grace,
peculiar to the Elect, as true Poverty is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then it is a grace of the Spirit of God to maintain an untruth, and to
give the holy Ghost the lye; for where there is Poverty, there is Grace and Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then the Grace of Poverty of Spirit, should be quite contrary to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Grace, <hi>which makes us know the things given us of God;</hi> but this poverty
of Spirit makes us not to know them at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40159:160"/>
Yet many will profess this true Poverty of spirit, and this is true Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
indeed.</p>
                  <p>First, It is true, where there was never any of the Grace of Christ, but
men have run upon Reformation without Christ, and affection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there
men are bound to see their black feet, and happy is the heart that can pull
off every feather from such crests; but where it is, and the Lord hath given
evidence thereby according to his Word; now to deny it is devilish, for
it was he that said <hi>Iob did not serve God for nought,</hi> and is a lye, of which
he was the Father; and is great unthankfulness to the Spirit for what he hath
done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If there be no Grace in a Christian nor Spirit, but all in Christ,
then say it upon the house tops, and be not ashamed of it; men must see
nothing, because they have nothing; otherwise let this delusion rot, and
never find acceptance in holy hearts; and yet how many still describe an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
by all the Graces of the Spirit, Faith, receiving Christ as King,
Priest, and Prophet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so are clean creatures and upright men, by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing in themselves, contrary to Christ, <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is true, a gracious heart is apt to deny all the Lord hath done
for him; yet the Lord likes not this; as <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks <hi>Peter</hi> did, Lord,
hands, and feet, and all; no, saith the Lord, thou art clean in head, and
all but thy feet; and hence needs no washing but in that: And what more
frequent than this sin? but to make what is sinful a duty, this is to turn
day into night, and night into day, to call evil good, and bitter sweet.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In regard of their unregenerate part, which the longer they
live, the more they feel of the evil of it, and so the more poor they grow;
they see no good there, and so account themselves the most miserable men,
mourning more under it than ever; yet to see no good at all in themselves,
this, if their eyes be open, they are not to say, <hi>I delight in the Law in the
inner man;</hi> and hence a regenerate Christian is vile in his own eyes after all
duties and enlargements, he sees how all is defiled with a filthy heart, and
hence <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 4. <hi>I am brutish;</hi> and he speaks of his natural estate, and in that
part, for else it is cross to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They see nothing in themselves to commend them to God in point of
Justification; here all <hi>Paul</hi>'s past and present righteousness is accounted dung.</p>

do so? what is the difference?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The differences are many. 1. He that is truly poor, sees so much vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as that he loaths himself, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. But the Hypocrite if he hath any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
remains full of it, proud with it; if it be gone, he seeks himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and loaths not himself.</p>

<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> for here men now are perplexed, either 'tis by seeing no grace, and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the witness of the Spirit, or by seeing some saving work of grace, and
so looking to the witness of the Word, and waiting for the confirmation of the
Spirit; for seals do but confirm the Promise and Covenant; if it be by seeing
no grace, then either by seeing no grace, without having the being of it, and
now wait for a revelation, and then 'tis a delusion, for he is under the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Word, and therefore far from consolation of the Spirit; or by seeing no
grace without seeing the being of it: If so, then a man must seek for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Spirit, without understanding the meaning of the Spirit, or of the
witness of it; and so a man must shut his eyes against part of the truth, that
he may see another part; a man must see that he is beloved, but not thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
or thou called, art loved or justified. Oh then take heed of this way of
evidence; or else by now seeing grace, and waiting for a witness; now this is
safest; for when ever the witness comes it is certainly right now, not a delusion:
Hereby we shall see the full meaning of the witness and compass of the Lords
love. And therefore take heed of denying all grace, and seeing nothing, and
then wait for a Revelation, and if it comes now 'tis right; no such matter; you
may see nothing, and to hell, and no consolation to them that see nothing;
think not that this is poverty; it may be a seal to a blank, to such a one as the
Lord never intended mercy unto; that which God promiseth pray for, <hi>Zach.</hi>

                  <p>First, They may feel a loss and a want of it, and having some hope in this

Acts</hi> 8. 24. when he was convinced he was in the gall of bitterness; he doth
not only content himself with his own, but doth commend himself to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires

                  <p>Secondly, They may have a high opinion of it, and see a marvellous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in it, and hence may be drawn to desire it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 33, 34. <hi>My father
gives you bread from heaven, which Moses gave not, and such bread as gives
life unto the world; then said they, Lord, ever give us of this bread;</hi> and yet
they were carnal, and desires carnal, arising from the sight of the excellency

which you have, and shall never see it, never shall have it: when <hi>Davids</hi>
heart began to be drawn away by the evils of the world, and then beheld the
vanity of that, his desires are now turned another way, <hi>Oh it is good for me
to draw nigh to God,</hi> that's good: As if he had said, though it be good to
have the things themselves; yet it is not good for me to draw too nigh in my
desires and esteem of them, but <hi>good for me to draw nigh to him.</hi> It may be
sometimes your hearts are taken off from esteeming your condition, and what
the Lord hath done for you; and hence no desire after the Lord or his Grace,
but the lawful comforts of the world, not inordinately, but if I had so much,
or as good as others, then well. <hi>Psal.</hi> 141. 4. <hi>David</hi> entreats the Lord not to

their desires filled here, shall say, Oh that I was in that mans estate! Let the
Lord therefore exercise you with many wants and sorrows; remember this,
your end will be peace, which the worst would give a world for another

                  <p>What then will become of them that never desired grace at all, because
they are well enough without it!<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> a man cannot live (say they) by praying, and
hearing of Sermons; such duties are troublesom; hinderances, not desirable

heart, and then sow these, and plant these from heaven, and you must fetch it
out of heaven, else it is naught; for when the Lord works saving desires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
he ever sows them in a broken heart, which is throughly broken indeed;
when God sets the smoaking flax on fire (which are desires) he first bruiseth the
reed it self.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The subject in which these desires are; a man hath a Son and a
Servant; the Son hath all his desires granted him, because he hath a sonly spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
all the Father hath is for him, that may be good for him; a Servant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
importunately, but he prays from the spirit of a Servant, and all that his
Master hath is not for him; and therefore if he pray for the inheritance or a
part of it, of the portion of the Son, shall he have it? no, he shall have what
is fit for a Servant; so it is here, the Lord hath some Sons in his Churches; these
praying and desiring from a son-like spirit, all that God hath being theirs, they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40159:163"/>
shall have it; and hence <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 18, 19, 20. <hi>He will fulfil the desires of them
that fear him, and love him, and delight themselves in him;</hi> for that is the
son-like disposition; when he is cut short of all comfort in the world, nay,
when he may have his fill of them, yet he delights in his Fathers face, love, and
grace, and fellowship, and house, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4. <hi>For they are heirs and coheirs with
Christ, being Sons;</hi> but now there are Servants in the house of God; shall they
have their wills and lusts? no; thus it was with these foolish Virgins; they were only
Servants in the house, no true Spouse or Sons, and were foolish at best, and had
not the spirits of Sons, but had their lusts; never were espoused savingly to the
Lord Jesus himself, nor laid up all their hope in him, but were foolish and that
is the ground why others desires are heard, not theirs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Unsound desires make after a certain measure only, whereas the
desires of Saints seek after this Grace without measure; and thus the foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
fell short of the wise; all that they could get was little enough for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but the foolish look after some of their oyl, as many a man looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the gifts and parts of another; Oh, saith he, if I was as honest, as humble
a man as such a one! and many a man sets up such a measure, and if he hath
that, is well, while he wants that miserably: Look wistly upon the foolish
Virgins, they did content themselves with a measure, and now they are in want
of it, seek for it; at first a little did content them, and now when it is spent, a
little will serve them again: And what is their measure?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. So much as will beautifie and adorn them before men, <hi>our Lamp
is out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. So much as will comfort them against the coming of Christ; for now
they were troubled that their oyl was spent, whereby they might meet the
Bridegroom: he that desires it for a little measure of it, his desires are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
unsound; so much as will serve his turn (he cuts his coat according to
his cloth) but he that desires it without measure, <hi>Ã¨ contra,</hi> as Paul, <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 12. <hi>That I may apprehend by any means, that for which I am apprehended:</hi>
As <hi>Chrysostom</hi> calls <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>insatiabilis Dei cultor;</hi> for he makes it his last
end; as he that desires wealth without measure, though he gets not all the
wealth of the world, yet the more he hath, the more he craves; this his fleshly
lust is his last end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But he may desire it without measure for his own ends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I confess 'tis true; for men may desire honor and no honor but by
gifts, and no gifts but by grace; and hence may desire infinitely, but yet it
is but a measure, <hi>viz.</hi> to serve his own ends, but not the Lords ends; to set up
himself; true desire of grace, is for that which may pull down self, and make
God all, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is not their only desire, or the only thing they desire, <hi>viz.</hi> the
good Spirit of the Lord, and that they might not live or any thing else in them,
but that the Lord may live, and his Grace and Kingdom may prevail in their
hearts; the desires of Saints are only after this; or if their desires are after other
things, the Spirit lusts against them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. As carnal desires are after life,
and the comforts of it, so spiritual desires are after the life of Christ in them,
and the comforts of the Lord thereby, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 3, 4. <hi>One thing I have desired,
and that I will seek for;</hi> what was it? a Crown, a Kingdom? no, <hi>but that I may
dwell in the Lords house for ever, and visit his Temple:</hi> Notable is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 11. Two things he met with that might draw down
his desires.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He came to a land which God promised to give him, where he lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
enemies and in fears.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He might have returned to another Country, and now have been
better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:40159:163"/>
3. <hi>God blessed him, &amp;c.</hi> but it was nothing he desired, only another above;
hence God is not ashamed to be called his God; but the foolish Virgins fell
short of this, and hence they now seek only in times of extremity: And this
is the frame of many graceless hearts in time of extremity. 1. When
all grace is gone. 2. When death is come, then they seek earnestly after the
Lord, and Grace; Oh their sin lies heavy! Oh then an humble heart is sweet!
but before their hearts were overcome with lusts after other things; and this
double heart every carnal heart hath, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 3, <hi>fulfilling the lusts of the mind,
i. e.</hi> Diabolical lusts, <hi>and lusts of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

state of all men; and hence promises are not made simply to mens seeking the
Lord, for they may miss, but to them that do it with their whole heart <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The lusts after grace and worldly things in an Hypocrite agree
together in the same heart; but those lusts which are after the flesh and spirit
in a regenerate heart are contrary one to another, and like fire and water one
seeking to destroy the whole being of the other. <hi>Exem. gr.</hi> A man wants the
things of this world, he seeks and desires after them, riches, honor, rest, and
peace; but thinks he, if I have no more but this, I may to hell; if no Grace;

and goes on sweetly in a way of profession a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d prayer; and a gracious heart
is ready thus to do, and to make his head lye soft with two pillows, but yet the
Spirit riseth up against this, that the soul thinks, I shall fall by this heart; Lord,
how apt to rest in these lees!<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> lusts in Hypocrites are like brethren, that help one
another, to this end to get peace; but here as enemies, to destroy such a cursed
peace as that is in the Godly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a false heart, lusts and desires after these things are dear to them,
like their limbs and best members, they cannot be nor cannot do without them;
but in Saints they are sores and blains, and so hated of them; <hi>ex. gr.</hi> Let a
man have a full table, and fair estate, and outward blessings, promising much,
and the Ordinances of God, and a heart to follow God there; now see him
lively in the service of God; but let him be brought to extremities, and want
of all this, and fears of poverty, estate wasteth, poverty appears, many rates
come in, and the wife crys out; now he falls down to the earth in discontent
or worldliness, and his life and affection to Ordinances, or the fervants of God,
is now gone; as it is with a bird, when she hath two wings she can flye,
but when she hath only one, then she falls, and the fowler takes her, because
it was a limb precious to her; so here: Thus it was with <hi>Davids</hi> servants at
<hi>Ziglag,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 4. <hi>all wept till they could weep no more;</hi> but here it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
with <hi>David,</hi> he could flye to God without those wings; so when God
gives a man a condition not so great as he would, and the heart lusts after so
much, and God crosseth; he cannot be content with a little, or with a mean
estate, because his lust is his limb, he cannot suffer it to be cut off, or be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>s; oh it is dear: So it is with a man that hath a lust
after any thing, it is dear, and hence he is said to live in them, and to be in the
flesh; but the desires after these things in a gracious heart, they are blains, they
can be without them; Oh never such a happiness if the Lord would dead them
to me, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>they that are in Christ have crucified the flesh, with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and lusts thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The lusts and desires in a false heart are reigning lusts, and make the lusts

all is spent. The Scripture is pregnant every where for this. But let us look
and see the causes of this.</p>
                  <p>First, Sometime it is because they know not what that measure is which doth
accompany salvation; but they set up an imagination of their own heads,
which is a false image of Saving-grace, and when they have that, now they
think all is well, and they go no further. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 11, 12. People that know not

                        </gap>th
hot, and spoilers come,</hi> now they cry unto the Lord; What is the reason why many
a man falls short of the righteousness which is of God, <hi>viz.</hi> of Faith? Because
he sets up in his head a righteousness of his own; and if I get that, then I hope
the Lord will accept me, and forgive me; and hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31, 32. why did
they miss of it? Because they sought it by a righteousness which is of their
own; so why do many miss of Faith? because they think it is an assurance; or
when a man rests upon Christ, not considering the need of an Almighty power;
and hence the Apostle prays for this, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 19. So for Repentance, why do
men fall short of it? they think it is when Gods anger is exprest, the soul then
comes to seek the Lord, and findes some comfort <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. and
so runs away with it: So for Holiness, they think it is to be like others; and
then well, they think these are the men that shall live, and are happy; and
look as it is like it was at <hi>Babel,</hi> when head and tongues were confounded,
one calls for a Brick, the other brings him a Trowel, Hammer or Tile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he did but imagine what he spake, and so understood not his language;
So 'tis here; men read and hear God speak, and Ministers call for Faith, and
knowledge of God; but earthly minds cannot understand heavenly language;
and hence they imagine that is Faith and Repentance which indeed is not, and
so miss of that which indeed else would continue; and this is the misery of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands that in seeing see not. The experience of the work of grace,
makes men savingly to know what Grace is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 37, 38. Now men
graceless never felt it in the life and power of it, and therefore cannot
tell it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the nature of Common-grace; the nature of which is as
the Apostle speaks of lifeless knowledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1 <hi>to puff up;</hi> it never leaves
the soul more sensible of his vileness, as Saving-grace doth, <hi>Ezek</hi> 16 <hi>ult.</hi> and
so makes a man never rest in seeking after the Lord; but makes the soul feel
himself full, and hence the stomack is gone from seeking after more, as <hi>Rev.</hi>
3. 17. <hi>She thought she was rich, &amp;c.</hi> The Spirit of Grace which is but common,
that heals a vile, proud heart, it easeth him, it quiets him, in healing some sin,
which lies sore on the conscience; it heals and quiets the man, so he is well,
needs no repentance; but the Spirit of life indeed destroyeth the man, and

                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ays corruption, and hence he resists; and now saith the soul, I never felt my
heart so vile as now; and hence, saith <hi>Paul, Sin revived, and led me captive,
Oh wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>tched man</hi>! as it is with a Prince, if any great ones come and serve him,
he likes them, this gives him rest, settles him in his Throne; but if any one
come to reign over him, now he gathers all his strength to oppose: So Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
grace it ever comes as a servant to corrupt; and hence take a man of best
wit and parts, he turns them against the Lord, and makes them serve
himself.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From an apprehension of this difficulty, and an unwillingness
in the heart to break thorow the difficulty of seeking after the Lord; many a
man sees (as <hi>Dives</hi> in hell, <hi>Abraham afar off</hi>) Grace, and God, and
Christ afar off; but there is a great gulf between them and Grace; now to be
watching, fasting, seeking the Lord diligently, to follow the Lord hard, <hi>Psal.</hi>
63. to keep the heart lamenting till the Lord comes, this is hard, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

'tis said, <hi>They could not enter in because of unbellef.</hi> 1. They thought they could

                     <note place="margin">Numb. 14. 9.</note> they could not believe that to be bread that is so hazzardful. So
'tis with many a man; and hence he sits down with desires and hopes, and so

but never break difficulties, and so perish; and so not like to the Merchant

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>oth to dig for it, they love their
ease so well, and hence rest in their desire after it; but indeed miss it; and
hence many can come to, and follow God in outward Ordinances, but never
find fruit and comfort in any of them, because of difficulty, yet sit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
because they seek for Ordinances, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 27. <hi>The sluggard roasts not
what he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ook in hunting;</hi> there is a very great delight in coming to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
as travellers under the shadow, but then to climb the tree that is hard,
and hence lose the fruit; and hence God seeing a man love his sloth, and hath
that base esteem of his Grace, as that he will not follow so hard after it as he
hath done after his lusts, let's loose Satan, and he comes and stakes down a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in this, God must do all, and there he rests, and so he falls short; like one
that comes to Husbandmen, and tells them they have taken much pains and
care to get their ground good to bring forth much, but for time to come their
ground shall bring forth fruit without planting or sowing, only reap you the
fruit, it would be good news to them, and they beleive it, and then when the
year comes about, they are to seek for corn; so this affects, and here they rest, and
by this means want.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From feeling the unprofitableness of seeking the Lord through
difficulties, and hence they give over but a little before they finde that that will
continue.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some follow the Lord for carnal ends, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, but he finding the
purse grow lank, and the bag empty, he forsakes the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some for comfort, and hence pray and mourn; and hence <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14.
what profit is there that we have walked so? as it was with <hi>Naomi,</hi> when she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home, both her daughters accompany her some part of her way, <hi>Return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
saith she, <hi>to your friends, here is no Husband for you where I go;</hi> the one would
not be beaten off, it is not a Husband I came for, but a God; <hi>thy God shallbe
my God;</hi> the other hearing her speeches, and loving her Fathers house, and
Country, goes back, not without some affection; so it is here; whereas Faith
will cry the more.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, From the offences which usually Satan casts in when they are in the
heat of their first endeavours; as the stony ground being offended fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
As,</p>

                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p>NOw there be four things which do concur to this fulness of satisfying
sweetness.</p>
                  <p>First, Manifestation of the Lord Jesus in his full proportion, and in all
the dimensions of his goodness to the soul; the soul of man is made for, and so
desires an infinite eternal good; whiles this good is not known to be such a one,
it never satisfies; and hence let a man look upon any one creature, there is
much sweetness in it, but not all; hence it satisfies not; there's sweetness in
honor and wealth, but if sick, a miserable man; there is sweetness in health,
but if poor and naked, a desolate man; and if one creature had all in it, yet
when one thinks this must be taken from me, it is like <hi>Ionah</hi>'s gourd, it never
satisfies:</p>
                  <p>Now the Grace which satisfies must first, Manifest the fulness of infinite
goodness suitable to me in the Lord; if that now do I want any outward blessing
it is in Christ, for he is Heir not only of heaven, but of all the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do I want spiritual blessings? <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. there is all in him; life, and
peace and glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Have I nothing to move the Lord to do any of these to me? yet there
is fulness of tender mercy, and pity in him, <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>s.</hi> 1. 17. and 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Possession of this good as mine; let a poor man see heaps of
gold before him, it satisfies not him, because it is none of his; let a Christian
hear of Kingdoms, peace, glory, in and with Christ, yet it satisfies not him;
it troubles him the more, if Christ forsake him, and grow strange to him; but
to be sure that Christ is mine, this makes the soul do, nay suffer the utmost for
Christ, and to know that nothing can separate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a man that knows he shall
kill, and not lose his life, will venture like <hi>Sampson</hi> upon an hoast of men;
they may wound me, they cannot bind nor slay me, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> there is
joy and some satisfaction in finding the pearl of great price, what joy when it
is possessed!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Communication of this good to the soul; let a man have meat
and drink, but he cannot come at it when he hath need of it, will this satisfie if
it be lockt up? let a man have real possession of never so many lands, yet if
he hath not the benefit sure to him, as well as the thing, he will never hold
out; what am I the better? so that grace satisfies that brings the sould to fruition
of the good, that it is now in respect of the benefit of it conveyed to the soul,
<hi>Psal,</hi> 16. 4, 5, <hi>the Lord is the portion of my lot and cup,</hi> and he maintains both;
and hence <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>Why art thou like a man astonish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>d, yet in the midst of us</hi>! if a
man have meat and clothes, and the one never feeds, the other never warms,
would this satisfie? no, unless that he may feel them, nay he would think this a
curse; so let Saints have God in his Ordinances, the best in the world there
is, if not fed thereby, Lord! what a misery is this? especially if the Lord helps
not in time of need.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Reflexion of good again to the good which doth refresh us, else
it never satisfies; if a man have meat dealt out, and it is very sweet, yet if it
gives him no strength to perform acts of life; if a man have a friend, and
he cannot love again, nor shew testimony of love, it will not satisfie him; so
that grace satisfies which makes the soul reflect the love of God to God again;
<hi>shall I serve the Lord,</hi> said <hi>David, of that which cost me nothing?</hi> you know
the Vine and Olive, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. were quietted by this, <hi>that they did rejoyce the heart
of God and man;</hi> what do you tell me of bonds? <hi>I acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Now a carnal heart gives over before he sees or possesseth or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Lord, or found the sweetness of a holy life in walking with God.
Hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He loaths and is weary of all his profession and truth he knows, and the
God he talks of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence they break out to some lusts or others; which because if not satisfied
here, they must satisfie themselves some other way, either in vain conceits or
opinions, or lusts of the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence, desperate doubts, Is the Lord mine? whereas if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
then as it is with a man, ask him, how do you know you eat and drink? it
satisfies me, saith he, it puts strength, I should die daily else.</p>

                     </gap>ld I know that satisfying sweetness?</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Ah methinks you should say, Oh that I did know it! yet
wary I would be of giving any just occasion to break off what the Lord in his
grace hath wrought; yet you may know something of it by this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When the Spirit of Gods grace dispensed in his Ordinances doth glut
you and slay you, and make you worse; here is not the grace of Christ which
doth satisfie you; if the more knowledge you have of the truth, the less glory you
see in the truth, and the less you love the truth; if the more comfort you have
sound by it, the less you now desire after it; if the more abilities you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by it, the more proud you grow, and high-minded; if having come for
to seek the Ordinances of God, the less good you find by them, the more weary
you grow of them, and the more you despise them; it is certain, the satisfying
grace of Christ is not here, when the bread to feed, is poison to slay; is not
this the condition of many? what is the cause they are growing worse, that
they are worse in their latter end and middle of their Christian profession, than
the begining, because they are grown full by Gods Ordinances, and so worse;
what is the cause in places of persecution the Lords Ordinances were precious,
not when they come to them? Gods Ordinances plenty makes them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
them through their sin; that look as it is with men in consumptions,
whose life is going out, they think they can eat, yet when it is before them,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40159:167"/>
loath the smell of it, or a little serves them, whereas another finds it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
not but that Saints may think thus, but they with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> mourn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>I have hewen and slain,</hi> what is the cause? <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
your goodness is like a morning dew, which soon vanisheth, therefore have I
slain them.</hi> Oh God loves us, and we are the best people in the world, because
we have Ordinances; no, but because you be shallow, hence you shall have
Prophets to slay you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If any man maintains any living lust in himself in the midst of
his profession, and hungers after it, and the life of it; for when a man hath
better food to feed upon, he will neglect his own at home, as Christ said to
them when they asked him, why he did not eat; how many be there which
have strange gifts, and have had marvellous ebbings and flowings of the Spirit of
Life and Peace, and yet one sin have they lived in, and would not, could not
live without it. Look as it was in the wilderness, they were for a time pretty
well content with their allowance and wilderness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>walks and provisions, but
they could not stay long, <hi>They asked meat for their lusts, but he sent leanness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their souls, Psal.</hi> 106. 14, 15. So that there it is, if lust be stirring, the Lord either
denies it his own people, because he will starve the lust, that the soul may grow,
or if he gives it, slays the lust by it, gluts it, makes the soul grow weary of it,
and prize his first Husband more; as <hi>Solomon</hi> by his experimental discovery of
the creature: Many men confess and pray aginst their sins, but by their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and desires, they do maintain the life of their sin, fall to it as the dog to
the vomit; you will be cast away at last, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>ult. I beat not the air, lest I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a cast-away;</hi> whereas a gracious heart doth not maintain, but waste and
consume his lust. His life is to live to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If a mans heart and affections reach not the people of God with
the dearest embracings, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> yet mourn for the want of such a heart; for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
there are some drops of the Lords goodness falling into the heart,
whereby the soul cleaves unto the Lord, and is moved and ravished, and bears
much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

God, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>re they fall short; because <hi>the love of Christ is not shed abroad abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
into their hearts, filling and satisfying of them;</hi> and hence have none to
poure out upon the souls of their neighbors, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 20, 21. In our own
Country, what was the accusation of Saints? <hi>viz.</hi> They are Hypocrites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; What did you think of those men that said so? <hi>Answ.</hi> Surely they
were enemies to the Lord, and that never loved him; for then they would
love his people. But what is the occasion here? Now they say they come far
for Ordinances; but they are unjust oppressors, cruel; poor men may starve
before regarded by them; and so they cast reproach not only upon some few,
but all the people of God, and Church of God; If that it be so, their accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is Gods accusation; if not (as generally it is) for many, though unable
to do much, yet if called to it, would lay down their estates and lives for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
then know thou never hadst Christ's love shed in thy heart (which
will continue) but drops of it only; because thy love cannot reach to these.
Beloved, what is the end of your coming over hither? is it not to enjoy first
Christ, and nextly his People, so his Ordinances? because next to fellowship of
Christ, the Saints company is most precious; and do you here bite, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and devou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e, and neglect, and reproach one another, and upon any
conceived injury stumble? are poor men neglected? It is a sad sign the love of
Christ in not in power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If there have been abundance of sweet affections and sweet refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
thereby rising up within the soul, without the death, and killing, and removal
of the contrary lusts and sins; it is certain this soul was never truly filled nor satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the Spirit of Gods grace; for as it is with vessels, while they be filled
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40159:167"/>
with lime or chaff, they cannot be filled with wheat or with water; so while
the heart is filled with some noisom distempers, it cannot be filled or satisfied
with the Lord; look but abroad in the Churches; how many be there that say
and think they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ate their sin as the only evil, they close with the Lord Jesus,
they love the people of God all of them, they seek the glory of God, and yet
they do but think so! for though they hate sin, yet it is unsoundly, because they
see not how closely their hands are knit to their sin; they never did believe,
because they never felt their unwilling heart to close with Christ; they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
loved the Saints, because they never felt their contempt of Saints; never
sought Gods glory, because they never mourned under that which did stain
it; they never make work with their own hearts; the stony and thorny
ground withered because their soil was naught; a heart filled with sweet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which never felt the strength of contrary corruptions lying under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
it is an ill soil, and where those affections will never prosper, nor
prove right; and hence, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20, 21. he that purgeth himself from these
things shall be a vessell of honor, ever preserved, never broken. Do not put
it to a venture, it may be I may have grace, and so put your salvation on the
hazard of such hopes; but the Lord that hath come to thee knocking, open the
door that he may come in and feast; cry for infinite creating power and
mercy to make haste and come and help thee; what have you to do else but to
get your old lusts purged away? what do you labor for else? if you have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to bring up, if you have any love to them, nay if swine or cattel, meat
you will have to feed them, and satisfie them if possible; and yet behold thy
soul perishing for want of true spiritual refreshings!</p>

in a mans Faith and Sanctification it springs from that first error of his
Humiliation; if a mans Humiliation be false, and weak, and little, his
Faith is light, and his Sanctification counterfeit, as may be seen in the stony and
thorny soil; if a mans wound be right, and Humi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Faith is right, and his Sanctification is glorious; for Christ cannot be exceeding
sweet and satisfactory to the soul, unless sin be first exceeding bitter; and this
is the reason why Christ is not sweet nor precious at first nor afterward, because
sin is not so better to them, especially heart sins; Christians shall find it, the
esteem and price of Christ falls, whiles sin lies light and is not bitter.</p>

                  <p>This Answer of the wise Virgins contains two things.</p>
                  <p>First, A denial, together with the reason of it, which is a
check to their folly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Their counsel and advice directing them to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
if there be any which might supply them with oyl; <hi>Go to them that sell and
buy for your selves.</hi> The Spirit of Grace comes not so lightly by: You would
have it given; no, you must buy it; you would have us help you; no, there
are others appointed for to self it you; away to them before the Bridegroom
comes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Not so</hi>] They are words inserted in the English Text, not so in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal;
but yet they are safely put in, partly because they are intended direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the strength of their reason, and involved therein, implied thereby; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because they do more clearly express the meaning of the words, and give
their sense more distinctly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Lest there be not enough for us and for you</hi>] What did the foolish now
look to works of supererogation and prayers of Saints, and the treasury of the
Churches holiness and Indulgencies? surely no, for these were Virgins, had esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the pollution of Antichrist, and they go for this not to Popish Treasurers, but
unto them that are wise; neither is it likely that Christ's coming could awaken
them out of their security to fall to gross Popery so suddenly, whiles they were the
Companions and Imitators of the wise, and therefore this is not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as some have wrested the words, and so make the Answer of the
wise to be a Protestant Answer to a Popish Petition, and therefore bid them

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> WHat then are the wise unwilling to communicate of the Graces they
have? what Christian but is willing?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> First, We are not to adhere to words in opening Parables, but the
scope; now their scope was hereby, First to sink and humble the hearts of
the foolish, and to let them know that all that which they had in time of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
was little enough for themselves at this season.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This answer is made answerable to the ground of their request;
you know how Hypocrites in Churches rest in outward priviledges, and how
they are carried unto Ordinances, but not above Ordinances indeed to Christ;
and though they have some knowledge of, and lookings above them unto
Christ, yet missing him, like men sinking catch hold upon that which is next,
and so look for help thence; so these being in the fellowship of the wise, and
admirers of them, and having got good by them, and imitated them, hence
they relye too much upon them for it; and hence they answer, We have but
our measure, and therefore it is not in our hands to dispense grace in times of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;
that must come from him that hath received the Spirit without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
so that this answer doth not imply unwillingness to communicate, but to
let the others see that they were not the first that could communitate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You are to consider that God had now broken open the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the foolish, that they professed they had no oyl; hereupon the wise
Virgins are not unwilling to communicate altogether; but considering
other means are sanctified to beger Grace where it never was, or rather
of greater efficacy and power; hence they send them to other means,
to them that sell, professing this for their ground, that they had little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for themselves; and it was not in their power now to convey any:
This I conceive is the direct scope of the Parable in this Verse: Hence three

Oh therefore dally not under Ordinances; to have them, but no gain of them;

he could not say This man I will give grace unto, and not to that; a Minister,
as <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 18. 10. may in general know that there is some people in such
a place, at least probably, but who they be he knows not, no more than
<hi>Samuel,</hi> who knew one of <hi>Iesses</hi> Sons was to be King, but not one whom he
liked, but whom the Lord did chuse; and hence a Minister calls all, because
he knows not who they be: only some are called, because Christ knew, and
therefore in his hand it is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The power must be omnipotent, both to lay the foundation, and

                  <p>Thirdly, Shedding of blood, dying and bearing wrath, to purchase and so to
have the Spirit to send; for the Spirit of Grace could never be given, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,

are said to be healed by blood, and we cleansed from them by it, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the
Spirit purchased by it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>Blood sprinkled purifies your consciences with
blood, i. e.</hi> the vertue of blood applied by the Spirit: If any of the Saints shed
blood for the Church to redeem it, then they have power to convey the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

to dye.</p>

only such as have Grace, but such as are lively in the use and exercise of
it; for those God sanctifies especially to communicate Grace to you; if a
living hand be knit to a dead arm,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 3.</note> sure little good will it receive from it,

                  <p>BEcause they are set apart principally by the Lord for this end;<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> for Gods
separation of any thing for an end, though the thing be unlike to bring
that end about, yet by this it hath a strange power accompanying it; as the
Brazen serpent, how comes it to heal? It was set a part for that end, and
sanctified of God; and hence God setting apart an Ordinance, is present with
his Ordinance; as <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were sanctified for the service of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle:
and this is done two ways.</p>
                  <p>First, By the Church, according to the will of God, they are set apart from
all other employments, unless those which other relations bind them too,
that so they may dedicate their time, their strength, their private studies, their
selves, their prayers, and tears, and all for them; and this ought so to be unless
necessity compels, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 4. The Disciples would give themselves to the word and
prayer, and would not be cumbred about the Deacons office; and so their studies;
<hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to give himself to reading, to think on these things,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13, 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By the Lord himself, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15, 16. What is true of Gods sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<hi>Paul</hi> to an extraordinary, is true in a measure of all his servants set apart
for ordinary work, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. For the Church sometimes may not set a man
apart, yet the Lord may and doth; and hence (by these sometimes he sends
to call a Church before there is a Church to call) and how is such a one set
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40159:173"/>
apart? not as an ordinary Christian, but as an extraordinary Ambassador, as it
were in the room of the Lord Jesus himself; For Christ being Mediator of
his Church, two things are required to make peace. 1. To speak to God for
us. 2. To speak from God to us; The first he doth by his intercession. But we
hear not from him? Yes, for he sets these in his room, and by them he speaks
as Mediator to our ears and hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. so that if Christ was here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to speak, we would look for the Spirit by him and his Ministry; Now all
Messengers of the Lord Jesus are in the room of the Lord Jesus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, if
Christ was here, the Spirit would not come but by this means; and hence
Christ converts not so many as the Apostles by their Ministry within
<hi>Iudea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Because the Lord hath furnished them with special abilities to dispense the Grace
of Christ for the Churches sake;<note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Christ ascended on high to give gifts
for edifying the body;</hi> if a man should have an Apprentice set apart to sell, but
his shop is not furnished, how could he then sell, and how should men in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
expect to buy? I will not speak of what is required to make men able;
Christ not only as a free agent sets them apart, but as a wise agent furnisheth
them with abilities for that end. There must be that knowledge which may
make the man of God wise to salvation from the Scriptures, which cannot be
without knowledge of Tongues and Arts in some competency and study a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
both.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They cannot think a thought; Christ furnisheth them with thoughts;
the Minister knows not what to say, yet his thoughts are from him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They cannot speak; hence <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 19. the Lord opens their mouth;
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> must be dumb for a time.</p>

watering-pots, when grass and herbs are dying; but yet sometimes the rain falls,
and that hath a peculiar vertue in it, as being fitted for that end; and hence
Ministers are compared to clouds; and hence men will pray especially when
many clouds are, the Lord grant these bottles may drop; so hither you are to
look; dish-milk and flit-milk may convey some nourishment, but brest-milk

it be seen that the Lord is present there; Satan doth not cast out Satan, neither
is his Kingdom divided; when <hi>Peter</hi> fisheth for himself, all night he catcheth
nothing, but when the Lord comes, and for his sake he casts out the net, then
the net is full; and for to be a means to convey the spirit to any, it is their

and the Gospel comes to hell with the Spirit, to a poor sinner when he is blind,
captive, broken, mourning, never so miserable; now the Gospel penetrates
thus low, and brings the Spirit with it; it makes the soul not only to see Christ,
but gives it him, and now it is safe. Oh (beloved!) if the Spirit be glorious,
then is the Gospel glorious; if the Ministry of men could bring in, and draw

<hi>Israel:</hi> Are there not many <hi>Amaziah's</hi> in these days? do they not take the

to be opposed of God; and the first they are come to: Oh but they garnish

by some, who though they have not yet been able to reach them by their
power, yet by vile reproaches so pursuing most of them, that one would stand and
wonder at the blindness and boldness, not of moral men, but Church-members
and Professors, and at the wrath of God upon them, that ever they should be left

fit to deceive.</p>
                  <p>And hence if Ministers have perswaded men to believe, and receive the
Gospel, what can we do (say many?) God must do all; if evidences and signs of
a good estate be called for out of the Word; it is a way of works, almost flat Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in their books: If Ministers have had the Spirit burning within them, seeing
people led from the truth, and so speak against them that deceive them, 'tis
passion and bitterness; if they have sought to keep the hearts of Gods people
close one to another, the strong man then keeps the palace: What should I

                     </gap>andalized?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. For preaching that we are justified by Faith, and that Faith is required
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40159:176"/>
to the entertainment of Christ as a condition of the Gospel; here is not bread
(say men.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For preaching that Sanctification is an evidence of Justification; and
though it be granted the Lord never justified any without a work of vocation at
least, and this is not against Gods Grace to justifie by Faith; yet it is against
Grace, and 'tis a way of works, say some, to see my self justified by Faith.
If the Word did reveal a second Justification by Faith, and a first Justification
without Faith, then our first evidence might be without sight of Faith, because
there is some word which reveals our being Justified without it; But the Word
reveals all our Justification to be by Faith; and thus for preaching the Gospel
of Christ have the Servants of the Lord been reproached. And though they
keep it in, yet how many are there whose hearts go after these detestable
things!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some resist the Spirit by despising inwardly, and so casting off the Word
of the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>if we neglect or slight so great salvation;</hi> and when
was the Gospel more slighted by many? every thing we say is dear but Gospel,
which should make us mourn that ever it should be said so in this Country;
you despise the Spirit of God; a man of greatness suffers by nothing so much
as by contempt; so it is with the Spirit of Grace: And it is a thousand to one
but that there will be something to make them despise at last the Lord himself:
But the Word comes thus to be despised and cast off</p>

                  <p>First, PArtly by the false reports of others, as if they were factious distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of peace, men under a Covenant of Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is the
Jesuites policy to raise up lyes; and though all will not beleive them, yet some
will stick.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Partly by covetousness; the glory of the things of this world is
greater than the glory of the Gospel; tell them of living by Faith and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
they deride you in their hearts; tell them of a Kingdom, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of holiness, they slight them; to be so rich and honored, it is glorious
indeed, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 14. The Pharisees scorned him because they were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sometime because Ministers and Ministry are Bills of charges to
a congregation, and are too costly inhabitants among them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Partly because of ignorance of the truth; why was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
foolishness? it was a mystery; so many come and understand not the truths
preached; they be too high points for them to conceive of; let truth be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so precious, they esteem it not, because they know it not.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Partly because they have known all that our Ministers do preach
before, which is now like flowers and roses withering, which were flourishing
heretofore; <hi>Capernaum</hi> despiseth that which <hi>Sodom</hi> would not, and <hi>Tyre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> and
<hi>Sidon</hi> would have repented at; and say, They can do as well themselves as
this, and better.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Partly because Ministers are so long at it; and that may be delivered
in one hour which is stood upon an hour and half; and they wonder men preach
so little, and yet so long; which argues contempt, and that every truth is not
precious. Men cry not out of men when they are telling money to them many
hours; and yet this is more precious; <hi>Eutychus</hi> grows sleepy; thank <hi>Paul</hi> for
preaching so long; and falls down; thank long Sermons for that: This is the
sinful language of some.</p>

                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:40159:176"/>
Seventhly, Because they cannot profit by them; hence when they should
mourn for themselves they despise the truth of the Lord, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>are not my
words good to him that walks uprightly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Because some have weaker gifts than others: And thus I say, the
Ministry of the Lord and his Spirit is despised, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 8. <hi>Take heed you despise
not little ones, for Angels behold them:</hi> Oh what is it then to despise the Spirit

ascended; others in the Valley of <hi>Iehosaphat, Ioel</hi> 3. 2. which as it cannot

As first, The glory of the Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 27. the brightness of his Diety, his

                  <p>First, He hath come already to redeem his people from sin, which is the
greatest evil, and which redemption w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

<hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>all judgement is committed to him, because he is the Son of Man.</hi> And
though it be long, yet surely he will, he must come, especially seeing himself

So here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the Justice of God, that that may be cleared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the eyes of all the world; men sin now, and are not punished; but
flourish, and the Saints are grieved; every man sees patience, bounty,
long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sufferance exercised; but the wrath of God against the least sins
is not yet made known; there must therefore be a day to declare it, and the
equity of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In regard of the Wisdom of God: Look in all Commonwealths
well governed in the world, and we shall not finde any but they have Court
days, and their Petty Sessions, and great Assizes, as in <hi>Israel;</hi> for to what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of wickness would places come to else? so here; Shall the wise
Governor of the world never have a day of hearing and trying causes? hath
he no care? others are but in his room under him till that time: neither is it
enough to say that there is Judgement of death<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> That is only Christs
judging the soul in private either to his shame or glory before Christ; but the
body is to be judged as well as the soul, to shame before men, or glory before
all the world.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In regard of Christ's soveraignty and excellency; the coming of
Christ is called his Kingdom, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. Why, doth not Christ rule now in the
world? Yes, but it is in the midst of his enemies; his enemies rule and he
rules also; but there must a time come that no enemies must rule, but Christ
alone<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and this is his kingdom in a most illustrious manner; for the things of
Christ are said to be with us, when they do in a special manner appear; as the
coming of his Spirit, and his love, so his Kingdom; now Christ must reign till
all his enemies are put under foot; for it is not fit he should lose his Kingdom;
hath the Lord suffered others to reign and rule, and himself to be hid, and his
glory lost, and that so long? and will he never return to his Kingdom to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
there to reap all his glory that he hath lost by all his enemies in the
world? Was there ever King that would ever endure one generation of
Rebels after another, and never make himself sole Sovereign? however Man
may suffer it, yet the Lord will not, he must reign. And wherefore doth Christ
reign? It is to trample <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40159:179"/>
Christ sets death his enemy, to destroy his enemies, and keep them as in
a Goal; but afterward Christ will call them forth, and pass an irreversible
doom upon them.</p>

the first coming of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. they did thus, saw the Promises
afar off, and embraced them; so see it afar off: There be divers people
that profess this truth that do not fully believe it; for if they did, they
would never live as they do: That look as men that know the Judge
rides Circuit within half a year, dare not commit any open sins; so if
you believed this, you would make conscience of secret sins which this Judge
shall judge.</p>
                  <p>Others there be that do believe it as they do reports that every man saith,
but they do not see that really to be true indeed, which their hearts literally
believe; and hence mens hearts are not a whit moved with grief, or sorrow,
or joy, or fear at the remembrance of this day. For as it is with us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

their misery, because they do not see it acted before their eyes; God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
not their sorrows; and hence they are not moved; but when they do
see them acted, then they are moved much; so here. Look as it is with a
man awake and in sleep; a man awake believes the day of Judgement, and
never stirs; but when asleep he dreams of it, and is much affected with
that because he sees it acted before his eyes; much more when men have
not dreams but real visions or sight of it, it will affect: And hence set,
painted fire before a Malefactor, it affects not, but shew him really it

and both meet in person; 1 <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the whole man, it is so also; but then the whole man shall meet him;
these eyes shall see him, and those arms shall imbrace him; you are left as
Orphans here in this world alone; it will not alway be thus, for there is a time
of meeting.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Then all deformities shall be taken away from his people, and
he shall adorn his Bride in perfect beauty; for this is one part of Christs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and with shame: as in this life why are Saints unwilling yet to be with the Lord?
<hi>viz.</hi> because there be so many deformities and spots abiding on the Spouse;

                     </gap>ake way for his glory; and
hence he was delivered out of prison by the Kings command; now his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and countenance, and name, and estate, and all is changed; so here,
all your sheme, imprisonment in the grave-chains of sins, that enter into your
soul, doth but make way for this certain glory; As it was with <hi>Iehosuah,</hi> Satan
stood at his right hand to accuse him, he only stands before the Lord, at last
the Lord saith, <hi>Take off these filthy garments;</hi> is not this a brand? So Satan and
Conscience accuse often here, but then it shall be so that all thy filthy garments
shall be taken away.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Then there shall be an open manifestation, and glorious decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the dearest love of the Lord toward them; before the great day of
mariage comes, there is love expressed, concluded between the parties, and
it may be some few know of it, as Friends, and some of the Family; but the
open declaration is at the day of mariage; so Christ loves his people now, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and will not only love them then, but openly declare his love before all the
world; <hi>Come ye blessed;</hi> he shall declare then his own love, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 32.
<hi>Luke</hi> 12, 8. He that hath made it his glory to confess Christ in a holy life,
Christ will confess him before God and before Angels; and so before all the
world: Men in great place will not know their poor friends, especially in
open places; but the Lord Jesus will, and he will divulge the Fathers love to
them also, <hi>Act,</hi> 3. 19. <hi>You blessed of the Father, Ioh.</hi> 17. 22, 23, 24. <hi>I have
given them that glory, united them and made them flesh of my flesh, that the
world may know thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.</hi> Here the Lord
doth love his people dearly, but it is not so known; the Sun shines on good
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40159:181"/>
and bad; the world hates and persecutes them as Hypocrites; civil men think
them like themselves; worldlings think them as little loved as any, their estates
thrive not; Hypocrites bear a base esteem of them; and if they love them, 'tis
because they love them; Saints themselves many times suspect them; or if
not, yet they judge as well of others as them; nay it may be they are so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
sometimes by those sores that break out of them; that they know not
themselves; but now the Lord will openly declare his love to them,
and to all the world besides; These are the men which I have born on my
brest, and caried on my shoulders; for whom I have built and planted
Churches, and destroyed enemies, and trod the wine-press alone, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above mine own life, and blood and glory; whose hairs have been numbred
by me, whose walls have been continually before me. No greater misery to a
holy heart than this: <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 10. <hi>Where is now thy God?</hi> So when conscience
saith, and men say it here: Oh what a mercy is it that then it shall be heard, I
am now come to comfort thee!</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Then they shall be brought into actual possession and fruition of
all the glory promised unto them, of all their inheritance and portion: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mariage there be promises made of such an estate; but when the day is
come, then they come to actual and full possession of it, and become equal
possessors of the estate; so much in this life the Lord doth promise to possess his
people of; there be promises of peace, redemption, victory, and triumph
over all enemies, fellowship with God, and all the Saints and Angels together,
an incorruptible inheritance, and now they shall enter into possession of all
these; nay, all that Christ hath, signified by that word <hi>Kingdom, Matth.</hi> 25.
<hi>Come and take the kingdom prepared for you;</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 54. <hi>Then shall be
brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> to pass the saying written, O death where is thy sting, &amp;c. Isa.</hi> 25. 7, 8.
So that reckon what Christ hath, you shall have it then. Much mercy the Lord
shews to his people now, but <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 19. <hi>how great is that which is laid up!</hi> then
it shall be brought forth; now you shall have an end of all your desires, prayers,
faith to feel that which you have believed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it was with <hi>Ioshua</hi> 23. <hi>ult. Not
one thing whereof God hath failed.</hi> Here the poor hardly get bread; here many
prayers get nothing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 9, 10. God doth then what
he can for them and gives what he can give to them, then all treasures are
broken open.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Then there shall ever be cohabitation and living with him, never to
be any more parted from him, or he from them; for while any is a Suitor to one
in a far Country, he comes and goes away again; but when mariage comes,
then he carries her to his own house, and now live they must together; so the
Lord in this life is somtime with his people, somtime absent from his people, but
then they must cohabite together, and shall; 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. <hi>ult. And then we shall ever
be with the Lord.</hi> If the Lord should do all the former, and not this, it would
be a bitter cut: When the Disciples had Christs presence for a time, it was
sweet; but when parting came, that was bitter; but here is no more parting
with the Lord; to be in a Kings dominon where peace rules, when other places
are slaughter-houses, and Golgotha's, tis good; but to be with the King, and
ever with him, and to follow him where ever he goes, and to be familiar with
him, this is wonderful; Husbands depart either because not pleased at home, or
because of business abroad; all such motion arguing imperfection; but now
there shall be nothing in the Saints to displease; and Christ's business shall then
be done, he shall have no more to do but only to give up the Kingdom to God
the Father; that is the last work of Christ in this world: To see the Lord in his
beauty of grace and love, will be wonderful; but for dust and worms to be with
him for ever; the poor things of the world to be with him, when thousands are
cast by! we say that's the beauty of a thing which no picture can express; now
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40159:181"/>
to see that beauty in Christ is marvellous; but to be in the bosom of one so
amiable, how great is this?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Then shall the Lord rejoyce over his people, and they in him;
Mariage day is the great day of joy, they long for it before; and when it comes,
the longer it hath been deferred, the more feats of parting, the more are they
affected with joy then; so here, the soul hath desired the Lord in grace first,
and then in glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. Christ hath been desiring after them in glory,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 24. now their desires being fulfilled, all his scattered lost Elect ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
now he rejoyceth with exceeding joy; and the longer lost, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deferred, the greater joy now; hence <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>he shall rejoyce over thee
with joy, &amp;c.</hi> Look as the Lord when they were but converted to him, poor,
and miserable, and sinful, and some of them but very babes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 21. yet
he rejoyced in Spirit, and falls admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing of the Father; so here much more
when they shall become glorious and perfect, and altogether at this day. If
the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 1, 2. would have his Prophets speak to the heart of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
when it had but Seventy years captivity, much more will the Lord himself then
do it at that day; and look as it was with them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 1. to 6. Alle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

                     </gap>
for the destruction of Antichrist, and that Christ reigneth, Oh let us rejoyce;
so shall all Saints meet him with joy, being delivered out of the hands of all
their enemies; they shall cry Allelujah with joy to see them destroyed,
and the Lord reigning; and then shall they up to heaven in a shout of joy
with Allelujah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Gospel; else what need there be any Scripture writ, or Gospel preached?
use you the means, and wait on the Lord thereby, for the effecting of
this:</p>

things that make up the match.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Earnest suit on the one side.</p>
                  <p>And 2. Consent on the other; and therefore if any thing hinder, it ever
lies either on the one side, the man is unwilling, he desires it not; or on the
other side, if he be desirous, she is unwilling; but both these finish the business;
if therefore you would be ever espoused to the Lord Jesus, look to these two
things.</p>
                  <p>First, See evidently that earnest suit the Lord makes unto thee for thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
for thy good will; and this will appear by his own speeches, and this is a
sufficient testimony; by what speeches? by his voice in these Scriptures; for is
this the Bridegrooms voice or no? if not, away with it; if it be, and that
they do breath the Holy Ghost, then know it, it is as if he spake from heaven
to thee now.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But he doth not speak to me there by name particularly; he speaks
to others, not to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Lord when he calls any to himself, he doth not in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Call speak to them by name, and yet they have so received the Lord in the
Word, as if he had called them by name; for look, as when the Law saith All
that sin shall dye, the Lord speaks to all by name; and if conscience be awake,
it will apply it, This sentence is against me; so when the Lord saith, <hi>All that
will receive the Lord, shall live before the Lord;</hi> and therefore receive him;
if conscience be awake, it will apply: As in the three thousand that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<hi>What shall we do?</hi> they were not called by name; but when they heard
that they that repented should live, because the promise was to all, they glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received the Word; so here it should be so; and therefore we see when the
Spirit makes particular application to a man, he so sets on a truth, as if the
Lord spake to the soul particularly; and therefore if you do not, it is because
you are left of the Spirit of God, and the power of the Word; for it is your
duty so to do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though your names are not set down in the words of the promise, yet
your names are wrapt up in the meaning and sense of the promise; and this is
as good as that; for though the Lord doth not desire every man to keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
by name, yet he means every man, and there your names are; so when
the Lord Jesus makes suit to a wretched heart to receive him, he meaneth every
man, as if he had named them; that which is set down in Scripture, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to others, God means not them alone, but all others in like case;â€”as

took Christ because he had worth; but for Christ to take thee when thou hadst
no worthiness! for one to take dross and prize it when others cast it away, it is
much; it is no wonder if pearls be so esteemed of, but for dirt to be prized!

                  <p>Secondly, In case the Lord makes outward peace and blessings to abound
upon you, set not now your hearts upon these things; sometimes when miseries
abound, and there is wracks of all, now the soul is glad to stand upon the
rock to save its life, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 35. <hi>When he smote them, they then remembre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God was their rock;</hi> but when the Lord begins to fill the soul with outward
blessings, it is then exceeding hard not to lodge them in the Lords own room
and habitation for himself, and <hi>the Lord is forgotten and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>saken also,</hi> Jet.
2. 1, 2, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>But when these things are removed, or with you continued, yet let your
hearts still be kept for the Lord; for if these things were necessary, you should
have them in heaven; but there is no need of them there, but only of the Lord.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> It was <hi>Davids</hi> prayer that <hi>he might be delivered from the men who
had their portion in this world; but I shall behold thy face, and therewith be
satisfied when I awake; i. e.</hi> Some outward troubles now made him heavy,
that he slept the sleep of death, saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> but then he should be satisfied;
it was <hi>Davids</hi> argument to prove his faith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. <hi>The Lord is the portion
of my lot and cup;</hi> not his crown nor kingdom; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 30. <hi>Paul</hi> mixes this
with his counsels, <hi>use the world as if you used it not, possess as if you
possessed not, for the fashion of it passeth away.</hi> The love of Christ sweetens
these things; nay, the sweet of them is Christs; he lets into them his love
and his sweetness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh the peace that comes by this means, when
a no outward evil detracts, and no outward good thing adds to your
blessedness! It is so in it self; Oh that it were so indeed unto you,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In case the soul comforts it self in hopes and desires after good
things to come in this world; for sometimes that which fills the heart, is not
things present; a man findes a bottom here, but he looks for things to
come, and so lancheth out his heart in the deep, lets the rains of his heart
go strongly after things to come, and so the Lord alone doth not quiet him;
many mens blessedness here is imaginary, and chiefly because of that which is
to come.</p>
                  <p>Oh consider when it will be found to be blessedness to enjoy the Lord alone,
without hope or desire of any good else to come; thy soul shall say, <hi>Let me
ever see and love this God, and none else.</hi> It was the sweet affection of <hi>Paul, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
much to be with Christ;</hi> he did not desire these things, no not body nor
life; nothing else but to be with him; and that not faintly but earnestly,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. because <hi>he was now absent from the Lord;</hi> Oh the sinful lusts of
men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> men think themselves miserable if they be not satisfied; and they
are not satisfied because Christ is not enough alone. Oh but know it, he will
be so shortly, soul-satisfying blessedness to his people: And this I add,
the way to have all desires satisfied, is, to joy in Christ alone, <hi>Psal.</hi>
37. 5.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In case of all spiritual wants; for this troubles the heart above

this, thou shalt have thy fill of him hereafter; he is absent now,
but thou shalt be with him; he hides his face now, but he will arise upon
thee and never set more, and will supply all thy wants. Thus the Apostle
perswades to love the Scriptures, though they gave but a little light, and
they were in darkness, until this day-star arose; so then all darkness shall be
abolished; so the Saints complain, If a Son, why so unlike Christ? yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

                     <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> though they might have had honorable burial elsewhere,
yet such was not only their faith in the promise, but their love to the Land of

they had lost the life of Christ, and Christ was departed) yet they loved and
begged the dead body of Jesus; so though you have neglected the Lord, yet
now be as near the Lord as you can; Christ himself when he was to depart
from his people, yet he would be as near to his as he could; hence he sends
the Comforter; Oh so be you towards him! I know his love to us exceeds ours
to him; but there is no reason why it should, for we are vile; there is reason ours
should exceed, for he is worthy; this is the honor of the Saints, <hi>To be a people

                  <p>Mens hearts lie further out from Christ than we are aware of; some stars
seem to be within a hands breadth of the moon, when they are indeed far off,

men thus, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 27, 28. <hi>in him we live and move,</hi> as the beam is in the Sun,
so as he may be felt; it is wonderful to think how near the Lord is to men,
not only by the immediateness of his vertue, but of his person; yet they are
far from the Lord, and men are to seek for him; hence vers. 30, 31. he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
unto that, especially to be near God, not only as a Creator, but as a
Mediator, by whom the affairs of all the family in heaven and earth are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                  <p>Oh therefore seek him till you come so near as to see him and find him
hete; <hi>David</hi> saw this really, and that in times of peace, when he had far pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
and full cups, <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. he saw the Lord as his Shepherd; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 1. who
is known of his, feeding, leading, restoring, comforting by rods, adhering to
him <hi>in the valley of the shadow of death;</hi> and then for outward things, furnishing
his table, annointing his head, giving necessities and superfluities; he looked
not only on second causes, but saw God as really doing all these, as carnal men
see second causes doing these: Nay, he so sees the Lord, as that he falls a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering;
and indeed the Lord is never seen in his Providences till then; as

                  <p>To the beasts the Lord is near, but they cannot reflect upon their own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
much less upon the Lord; The Heathens may see we are Gods off-spring,

him, whom he had seen a little before; truly the Lord not only passeth by
you, but is with you proclaiming his name by the voyce of his Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
you, patience, pity, love, truth, wisdom; and yet truly this is very difficult

or at least, they let other things come by providence, especially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

to the promise out of whose bowels they are begot, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5, 6. the Apostle

pressing Gods promise; thou hast a barren, empty, weak heart, because the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

                  <p>Secondly, Labour to enjoy him in the Promise; sometimes the soul hath
a Promise fair, and seeks and finds not; now the heart goes on to seek, but is
exceeding unbelieving, or sad and troubled whiles it doth not feel; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
also, and accounts it self miserable whiles it wants, and so doth not
glory in the Lord, and his fulness, which is his in the Promise, unless he feels
the good come from the promise, like a man that doth not account himself rich
while he hath it in his treasure, a most safe and sure place where it is kept for
him, unless he gets a little out of it into his pockets; and fears he shall be slain
with thirst, though he stands by the Spring and that be full, if his dish be empty;
oh this is vile, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>These received not the promise, i. e.</hi> things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

you are sinful and born down by your distempers, and base, and poor; I say
you have power, victory over all sin and misery, and have eternal glory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in the promise; only here is thy wound, you think you want it because
you have it not out of the promise, though you have it in the swadling
clouts of the promise lapt up there; and by means of this sinful distemper of
heart you partake not of Christ, because you apprehend not your exceeding
great riches in the promise, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 4. <hi>God made an everlasting
Covenant,</hi> this is all his desire; sweet was <hi>Davids</hi> spirit. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Who

though Conscience cry out against you for it, yet you hope to be better one

because private duties are neglected, and thy heart like the sluggards garden is
andressed; is this to be as near the Lord as you can? no, if the Lord oves
you, look for the death of thy Husband, Wife or Childe shortly; look for

some answer to his prayers, and hath sweet affections, he grows full, and
having ease to his conscience, casts off sence, and daily groaning under sin;
And hence the Spirit of Prayer dies, he loses his esteeme of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
feeles not such need of them, or gets no good, feeles no life and
power by them; and whereas before he could catch at every word, and mourn
when he found the Lord passed by him, and speak never a good word to
him: now no such trouble, because he is full. This is the woful condition of
some, but yet they know it not; but now he that is filled with the Spirit,
the Lord empties him, and the longer he lives, so that others think he needs
not much grace, yet he accounts himself the poorest, and feels a need of

20, 21. <hi>He that purgeth himself from these things, is a Vessel of honour,

all they do, but not for the Lords use; it is not their life to live to God.
Promises are sweet, and Christ is sweet, and Heaven is sweet; but the work
of Christ to be of use for Christ, this is not their bliss: I know Saints fall
short here much, and seek themselves; but yet their hearts are prepared,
fashioned, set for this end, and they through the help of the Spirit, refine
themselves for the Lord; that when sin desires them to serve it, No (their answer
is) I am no debtor, nor servant to you; I have lived too long to you
already, I am now the Lords, and for the Lord; Oh that I might have

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He may die in an uncomfortable frame, without great peace
of conscience; for sometimes a mans Lamp may shine brightest, when his
peace is least; but the more prayer, the more searchings and washing of
heart is then to be attended; a godly man may die mourning for ought I
know, and the Lord give him his garment of gladness in Heaven, for the
spirit of heaviness here on earth; because though he loseth the comfort of
his estate, yet not the safety of it, because he dyes under the wings
of a Promise; So that though he dyes uncomfortably, yet not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He may die to his feeling in such a frame, poor, and contrite; for
growing in the sence of emptiness, is not decaying in the being or power of
holiness; the Lord is now preparing of him to honour his grace, when he
doth not help him to honour his Will in that inlargedness of heart to it as
he would, so that this soul is not decaying.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But yet I do not know that the Lord lets his people die ordinarily in a
withering condition; especially if it appear so to others of his discerning ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, in some measure at least; for there are awakenings to the
life of glory in another world, and awakenings to the life of duties in this
world; by the one the soul is raised out of this world to the Lord in Glory;
by the other the soul is raised up to duties in this world; if the Lord awakens
not his Saints to the first, either they are not awakened truly, or not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and effectually; for till then the soul is not ready, <hi>Luk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King, he is not ready for it, untill he stands waiting at the door, and that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40159:198"/>
it is his business; the patternes of mercy, and Vessels of glory, are ever set
out in the New Testament, by this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>ult. Tit.</hi> 2. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>Look as it was with <hi>Simeon, Luke</hi> 2. 25. He had a promise he should
see Christ before he died; hence he waited for the consolation of <hi>Israel;</hi> so
the soul having a promise of seeing Christ when he is dead, it makes him
wait for this time; and when he wants a promise sealed, though he waites
not nextly, yet he waites remotely, that the Lord would cause him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, that so he might wait for it; that is his end, this is the mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>es; he
knows it is best to be with the Lord, where is no sin, but holiness; he hath
found him sweet in his looks, in his words, in his works, in his hopes, his
first fruits, but to be with him is best.</p>
                  <p>This is not such an high pitch which Saints come not to, it is indeed such
which Hypocrites come not to; the Hypocrites end is to escape misery;
hence they desire comfort by duties, that they shall be freed from it, but not
to enjoy Christ; the Lord never tied in their souls such a knot of faith and
love which works this.</p>
                  <p>For 1. Security of Saints, 'tis not the privation of life (that is death) but
a suspension of the acts of a heavenly life; there is in them love to Christ,
delight in him, happiness in living to him, pleasing of him; but it is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended
by cares or contents of the world, and love of ease; hence a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is never throughly awakened, till he comes to that life againe; his heart
is with Christ in heaven; and because he cannot be there, hence he stayes
a while, and looks, and waits for it; anothers security is the privation of
life, of empty duties arising from some vanishing affections, as in the foolish
Virgins which were to quiet conscience only; Hence their awakening are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to that life again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

indeed convert them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Every thing will mightily tend to that to which its nature bends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
it; as a stone if thrown upward, will mightily tend downward. Some

out of thy sinful company, some of which like brands, are now smoaking

even in time of health, in midst of saving healing meanes, that their time
of grace is past, and door is shut to them, before Christ comes against them
at death or judgement; which though God many times turnes for good, to
humble a bold heart which will burne Gods day-light out, and linger in its
sinnes, yet it doth sometimes dead the heart from all effectual endeavours,
and discourage the heart from all duties, makes all the Gospel the Ministry
of blood and death, and a hand-writing against it; and when it concludes
God hath shut the door against it, it shuts God, and Christ, and all his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
out of its heart.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some think they having sinned against light, have had some
blasphemous thoughts, that they have committed the unpardonable
sin, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some others think not so, but yet they heare that some mens time is
out before death; they think theirs is also, having sought so long, they are
even sealed up by God to hardness of heart; and thus some seemingly coming
to Christ, are indeed kept off from him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Others of the Saints meeting with many sore troubles and tryals, and
that for some sins; and one deep calling to another, they think with <hi>David,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40159:203"/>
God hath forgot, hath shut up his mercies, will remember no more to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;</hi>
and though he hath been so, yet because he hath been so abused by
them, that therefore now he will not be merciful again; and thus their hearts
sink.</p>
                     <p>Oh Remember, the Gate of Gods Grace is not shut up before death,
then is the time for it to be shut. I confess indeed there is a time in this
life, the Lord doth cease to strive, and doth forsake the soul; and we may
say of them, as Christ, <hi>Oh that thou hadst known! but now they are hid
from thine eyes;</hi>â€”But yet this is a secret, which as a secure despiser of
grace should tremble at; so those that are awakened, and set in their way to
Christ, should not trouble themselves about it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But oh that I did know whether it be past or no!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall rather give to these people some good counsel, for 'tis
not for you to know these times and seasons; though this I would say, if
the impardonable sin be not committed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This time of the doores being shut, is not in time of health and peace,
but in time of extream trouble, wherein trouble doth affect them more
than the sin; as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. and as many when a sick bed is come, and in <hi>Noahs</hi>
Flood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 20.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or if it be in time of health, this is ever the companion of it, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
hatred, and opposing Saints secretly or opening, because Christ having quite
forsaken him, his heart swells against the Saints; hence <hi>Saul</hi> envied <hi>David,
Esau</hi> hated <hi>Iacob</hi> Murmurers against God; were in the Wilderness, and
against <hi>Moses;</hi> But I come to counsel; for God lets loose Satan full of
malice, upon a poor creature, sometimes to vex and trouble.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Consider the root of this distemper, (viz.</hi>) either great pride, or
despising of the riches of Gods grace.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Pride, for (this we shall finde) such spirits, because they have not
peace sealed, strength against sin granted unto them, and that which they
would have, (if discouraged, and not quickened by this) they regard not
life, meanes, offers of grace; What is all this, if God hath forsaken me?
What is it? Yes, that 'tis; as might at large be shewed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Despising of grace; if I had not committed such sins, I could then
think for mercy; but such evils, such miseries, cannot be remedied. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as it is a despising of a Physician, to think, If I was not so sick, he would
be tender, and helpful; but not now, being so exceedingly diseased; So it is
here, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Consider,</hi> Suppose the time be past, yet remember thou art
worthy to be forsaken of God even from thy birth, not worthy of thy daily
bread, much less to taste of Gods Supper; the Lord was loth to shut the
door; Hence <hi>he we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> thy sinnes provoked the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, if he hath in justice cast thee off; therefore though it be past, be not
discouraged, but lie down humbled, as <hi>Iudges</hi> 10. 14, 15. and as <hi>David,

6. I am perswaded many should quickly feele an Answer to this Question,
by taking this course; but they miss at least of the comfort of Grace and
Mercy, because they will be Disposers of the Lords Grace and
Time.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Consider,</hi> it may be that time is not past, it is a secret only known
to God; the door of grace may only seem to be shut; why doth Christ bid
knock else? When the <hi>Ninevites</hi> heard that they should dye within fourty
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40159:203"/>
dayes, <hi>Ionah</hi> 3. 9. say they, <hi>Who can tell but the Lord may repent?</hi> you
say the Decree is past, and spoken; and as <hi>Spira</hi> said, I have that Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
I say againe, Who can tell, but (if God had said so, but) that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he
may repent? therefore be not discouraged, or faint because of this. Nay,
'tis most probable time is not past.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because the things of thy peace, the discovery of the vileness of

deceive and blinde the all-searching eyes of God, and so not be found out,

know it self; as these foolish Virgins, their souls were looking (in a sort)
in their life-time for Christ, but now they look and see indeed; some know
not themselves, though having light; nor their present misery, because
they desire not to know; and hence reflect not upon themselves according to
light now; or if they desire so to-do, yet they have not leisure; the noise
and multitude of cares, keeps them from a cleare knowing of their estates:
but now men shall be brought to the Land of solitariness, and shall have
leisure to see, having Gods light let in to see by; there shall then be no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,

judgement now; and if so, then the witnesses must appeare; though they
have been silent long before, they shall be forced to speak. Now it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
to see what conscience will speak when God awakens it; men many
times will not see the evil which they have done; but conscience will make
them see it, nay, confess it, when 'tis awakened. Three things conscience
will do, when it is awakened.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It will shew a man his chief sins, which he defended, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated,

                     <p>Of terrour to them who upon cleare conviction from the Word,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> will not

men, and the very sin they live and lie in, is pointed at, found out, and
words, and thoughts opened, as if some body had told the Minister of the
man; and they think He speaks against me, but they will not believe that sin
is so black, or God so angry, but hope well; but if they do sleight, and
regard not these convictions, yet oh remember the time is drawing on, and
it is not farre of, but therein you shall know, the word of the Lord is more

their experience convince them of it. I know men may be deceived; but
as he said in another case, The word is not bound; so the word which like
God, searcheth the secrets of thy heart, and thy Hypocrisie, that is not
deceitful; thy Scepter, O Lord, is a right Scepter, and it cannot be crook't

it shall not be so? if Christ lives, he will confirm it. Is it not better to
know your condition now, and be humbled for it, seeing else you must know
it, when it is too late to know it? If two have a Quarrel against each other,
and the one who hath the better side entreats to agree with him, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his fault, be humbled, he will forgive him, before he comes to higher

his people for a time; but then they pray, and seek his face again, and the

speaks to him, his Son in his Covenant speaks unto them; and the Lord
hears the cry of their weeping, as well as their praying, <hi>Psalme</hi> 6. 8. But

is no wrath like this; for a God so pitiful, as many times to help without
cryes, more than a Mother with tender bowels, and not to regared cryes,

mercy; but 'tis by means of prayer usually, that they might see in what
favour they are in his sight above others, that when he seems to be averse

You will say, There is no great need, thanks be to God, of pressing

and Beasts in the Wilderness. I would to God there was no need to press
this point; but truly, the Countrey being a place filled with discontents,
which ever keeps from prayer, because the Devil is in them; and also of
great peace and rest; hence, here men are more apt to sleep, and grow

so cannot pray; and they quiet themselves with some formes, and their
Coleworts twice sodd, and some cold prayers morning and evening, and
hope that these will serve the turn, and here is all the comfort they have;
nay, not only so, but if others that know their hearts better, and so pray
longer, reprove them for it, they sinfully reply, What? you are like the
Pharisees, that think to be heard for their long prayers. Oh the Lord

to you,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> and propounded to you in the Gospel; we can be content to
want the love of some men, because we can live well enough without them,
and their love; their love lost hurts not us; but if the loss of their love
may be the loss of our goods and lives, then (if it may be had) men will
seek for, and long for it, thoght it should not be offered; but if offered, it
is gladly accepted: So if you could live without the love of Christ, you
might content your selves; but the loss of it is more bitter than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
deaths; and therefore refuse it not when it is offered; but as they,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39, 41. when they saw how they had imbrued their hands in the
blood of Christ, and yet saw grace offered, it is said, <hi>They gladly received the
Word of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Law is a word of condemnation; but that is not the last word the
Lord hath spoken, then I should spend time in vaine now; the Gospel,
even the whole Gospel is a word of love and Reconciliation; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20.
wherein the Lord doth <hi>beseech men to be reconciled; i. e.</hi> to accept of Gods
love offered therein.</p>
                     <p>The Lord knows full well that mens hearts are so full of enmity, that
they will never seek for Reconciliation first, though they have good cause,
because they have offered the wrong; and therefore he stands not upon
termes, but offers love first, without which he knows they are for ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done!
Oh therefore receive it, accept of it when it is offered to you; and
lose thy life, rather than lose his love.</p>
                     <p>For the further opening of this Point, I shall shew three things.

                           <item>2. Upon what termes.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>First, That the Lord doth offer, and how he doth offer his love in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
and this I shall cleare, because nothing can draw the soul to accept of
love but this. For the better understanding of which, you must conceive
that the love of Christ in the Gospel, is diversly manifested unto men; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to men after they be in Christ, and are brought home by it, and this is
a love of delight in them. <hi>Psalm:</hi> 45. 10, 11. Or it is a love of good
will to men not brought home; as it is in Husbands, before their affections
be set upon any, they make love, as it is 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>They received
not the love of the truth, because the truth made love to them.</hi> Luke 2. 14.
<hi>Good will towards men;</hi> and this love, I say is offered; this love the Lord
makes unto you; stand amazed at it, that after all your sinnes, wrongs done
him, nothing but love is offered, even his dearest love; for though there is
patience, power to help, wisdome to guide; though there is terrour in
him, yet, <hi>Take my love,</hi> saith he, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 17. And hence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3.
it is called <hi>Great salvation, or love;</hi> 'tis offered; else how could men be said
to reject it, or neglect it, which he warnes them of? A man may as well
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40159:212"/>
question whether there be a Gospel, as whether love be offered there; for
as the Law is nothing but the manifestation of sin, the hand-writing of death
and wrath against all men, writ with the Finger of God; the Gospel is
the manifestation of grace, the hand-writing of grace and peace to all men,
written with the blood of God; and hence the Gospel is that which brings
<hi>life and immortality to light,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 10. Not that there is life abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
for all, but there 'tis for all that shall by faith accept of it. More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</p>
                     <p>First, It is offered Universally to all wherever it comes, and therefore
personally to every man; the words are plaine, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Preach
the Gospel to every creature;</hi> and not only to them that do belong to
Christ, and shall believe; for though it be offered with the power of it
effectually to these, yet offered it is also unto those that never shall have
God, nor portion in the Son of God; and hence, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. The Lord
of the Feast invited those that never came in; and Christ himself, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi>
11. <hi>He came to his own, and they received him not; he would have gathered
them under his wings, and they would not;</hi> not only to them that be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
(though none will care for Gospel but such) but to them that be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 18, 20. doth this Gospel come. There be many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
Yes, the Lord offers love to them that are his, but not to me? yes,
to thee; there is not a man here, that can exempt himself. And I would
make no doubt to go to every man particularly, and say, The Lord intreats
thee to be Reconciled; nay, if there be one man worse than another,
though his hands have been imbrued in the blood of the Prophets, and his
soul stained with the crying guilt of the most hydeous sinnes that ever the
earth bore, or Sun saw, yet the Lord makes love to him; the price is
paid for him, if he will accept of it, and that the Lord would have him so
to do; neither doth this Universal offer inferre an Universal Redemption;
for the Gospel in the offer of it, doth not speak absolutely that Christ hath
dyed for all, and therefore for thee, as the <hi>Arminians</hi> maintain; but it
speaks conditionally, 'Tis for thee, if ever the Lord gives thee a heart
to receive that grace there; therefore consider of it, there is not one here
present, but the Lord would have you receive his love; and consider this
one reason, Thou shalt be condemned for refusing it; Hence 'tis Gods
command, and Christs desire you should receive it, <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not thy duty to receive it, 'tis not thy sin to refuse it; but 'tis such
a sin, that all men that perish under the sound of the Gospel, are principally
condemned for.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, 'Tis offered really; I put in this, because men cannot see the
reality of this; because not Christ, but Ministers (they think) only
make it, and so the offer is only external and Ministerial; the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
they think is not of that mind.</p>

Never didst thou see any Minister pity thy condition, and offer peace to thee,

These may stand well together; my word as the foundation their word as

rise from the dead, I should not look for more certainty of life by believing

                     <p>Thirdly, It is offered with vehement desires to accept of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 11. <hi>We beseech you receive not Gods grace in vaine;</hi> for you
may say There is some offer, but the Lord desires it not in good earnest; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did man desire to get the affection of another most beautiful, as the
Lord doth thee that hast none; we use to judge of the affection of another
to a thing, by what he is willing to part with for it; As he that sold all for
the pearle, and bought it; So the Lord is content to part with all he hath
to thee; the dearest thing he hath, is his precious blood, and all fruits and
benefits of it; his Spirit to comfort, himself to dwell with thee, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

should receive that, but for him to receive it from thee; and giving it to
him, is better than having of it to thy self. To thee I say, that art like
an incarnate Devil, Dead, and Damned, and undone for ever,
unless thou accept of this Grace, is all this Mercy of the Gospel
tendered.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is offered freely, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1, 2. For this makes many
stand and wonder, Why should the Lord make love to me so vile, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
good for nothing but to sin! dry bones! or what need hath the
Lord of me? what can I do for him? what can I add to him? why goeth
he not into the Palaces of Princes to call in them! but that he should deale
thus with me that have sinned worse than <hi>Paul</hi>

I have known the grace of Christ, yet rejected it; and have
gone on desperately, have been mad in following my lovers, forsaking the
Lord; True, I know no cause, but only his free love, because he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
on thee, and because 'tis for his grace sake; hence he desires it vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently;
for that is worthy to be honoured, received, embraced of thee.
Methinks it is in this case, as 'tis with poor Marines, whose ship is wrackt,

Or as it is in the offer of a Prince to a Traitour, he offers life to him;
Upon what termes? I could crush thee as a fly between my fingers, but I
desire nothing, only accept my favour, come and embrace me, and
then live under my Government in my Kingdome, because that I love thy
company, and because here is my honour, and thy safety; so doth the Lord
in the Gospel, the Lord professeth he had rather a soul should return, and
live upon his love, and under the Government of his love, than dye; <hi>Come
under my wings,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Matthew</hi> 23. <hi>you may all.</hi> I would
have you safe, and near unto me, that you may feel the warmth and life of
my love; this is all the Lord looks for; and who would not accept of love
upon these termes!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Motives to accept of it. Why should I name any more than
what the Text mentions? no woe like this to lose it! and though it may be
now you may esteem it nothing while 'tis faire weather, and whiles it is a day
of patience, yet when the depths of anger are broken up, then you shall see,
and say, No people like unto those that have it, when you shall see Christ
on his Throne with ravishing beauty, and see him tread the Wine-press of
wrath alone, and his garments dipt in the blood of his enemies; then
you shall say, The want of this love is bitter; and hence if it be offered, take
it now gladly, thankfully, joyfully.</p>

their sins with greater peace of conscience; so that sin makes them flie to

that they may be preserved in their sins with peace. For this is the frame
of all men living; sin before it is commited (not all sin, but what is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Now because men have not other good to live upon, or delight in, for God
they have not; hence many an heart secretly saith this, If I can have my

Mony-changers came into the Temple, you have made it a Den of Thieves;
Thieves when hunted, fly to their Den, or Cave, and there they are secure
against all searchers, and hue-and-cryes; so here, but Christ whipped them
out; so when men are pursued with cryes and feares of conscience, away to
Christ they go, as to their Den; not as Saints, to pray and lament out the
life of their sin there, but to preserve their sin; this is vile; will the Lord
receive such?</p>
                     <p>I am perswaded, many a mans heart is kept from breaking and mourning,
because of this; he saith (it may be) that he is a vile sinner; but I trust in
Christ, &amp;c. If they do go to Christ to destroy their sin, this makes them
more secure in their sin; for (say they) I cannot help it; and the thing I
would not do, that do I, and Christ must do all; whereas faith makes the
soul mourn after the Lord the more, as <hi>Paul</hi> did; yet do you think
they that believed said, <hi>Let us sixn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ manifested and arising therein; hence some men may apprehend
Christ neither out of feare of misery, nor only to preserve some sin; but
God lets in light and heat of the blessed beames of the glorious Gospel of
the Son of God, and therefore there is mercy Rich, Free, Sweet, for dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
great vile sinners; Good Lord (saith the soul) what a sweet Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
Word, God, and Gospel is this! and there rests; this was the frame
of the stony ground, <hi>which heard the Word, and received it with joy, and
for a time believed,</hi> Luke 8. 13. And this is the case of thousands that
are much affected with the promise and mercy of Christ, and hang upon
free-grace for a time; but as 'tis with sweet smells in a Room, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
not long; or as flowers, they grow old and withered, and then fall;
in time of temptation, lust, and world, and sloth is more sweet than Christ
and all his Gospel is; 'tis in this case with the soule, as it was with <hi>Mary,</hi>
who applyed the Spikenard only to the feet of Christ, but all the Room was
filled with the sweetness of it; so in the Gospel, the sweet odour of it is
scattered to all; and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>We are a sweet savour of God
to them that perish;</hi> but Christ only applyes it unto the heart of a wounded,
poor, humbled sinner; and though smells and odours refresh, yet men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live by the smell; so 'tis here; such is the rich grace of Christ, that the
worst shall know and say, He is good; As the King passeth by, many
come to see him; but doth he take all up to the Chariot with him? No,
but they go home to their several houses againe, and then they commune,
and speak of what they saw; so Christ accepts only of, and apprehends none
but those that have forsaken all at his call, and so live upon his favour; so
here, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. all his Garments smell of myrth, yet only the Queen
which heares, considers, and forgets her Fathers house, stands at his right

The greatest evil of all, is sinne; 'tis greater than Death, Grave, Hell; hence
Christs greatest love is in Redeeming first from sinne; And as if there had
never been sinne, grave, nor death should never hold; so when he breaks
the power of sinne, no power of Satan, World, Death, shall hold thee

Faith will be stirring, when no other grace can be so; it Victuals the whole
Camp, Relieves the besieged; and it's most strong, when man is most weak.
'Tis true indeed, there may be many acts of presumption for one act of
faith; take heed of that; That faith is not presumption, which the more it
works, the more humble it makes the soul to be, and vile in his own eyes;
because as Faith ever fetcheth of Christs fulness to the soule, so it ever
is attended with sence of emptiness in the soule naturally, and then it's

                     <p>Oh resist not the Lord Jesus, when he comes to apprehend you by his
Almighty Arme!<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> In a shipwrack, if a man sees many drowning, and perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
never a hand to take hold of them, when one is reached out to him,

is a power of resisting, which the Lord complaines of in them, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.
and which he makes his people to complaine with bitterness of in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
when his time comes. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 50. 2. The Lord cryes out of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40159:219"/>
his hand upon thy heart or conscience to apprehend thee. Is the Lord at
work with none of you? art forsaken of Christ altogether? There
are many wayes of Resisting Christ thus; I'le only name these
two.</p>
                     <p>First, When the soul will not suffer the Lord Jesus to bruise, or cross its
will, that so he may prevaile over the resistancy of it. A strong arme, a
strong man when his arme is bruised, or broken, or wounded, takes away
the act of resistance; as taking away the very life from it, takes away the
very power of resistance; so Christ would unite himself to the soul; there
can be no constant union, where there is constant resistance. Christ comes
to take away that; hence bruises and wounds the soul; outwardly sometime
in name, estate; inwardly in conscience, in heart. Now here is mens fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That they will not be humbled, when they heare of their estate in the
Word; they will not believe 'tis so, though they stand all the while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
therein, as if they had been named; nay, they will not think of it;
if it begins to trouble them, or if they do begin, they think it is the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
of the Devil; and if their estates or names begin to dye, they will
not be poor nor despised; they had rather dye, or live in vexing and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
rather than yield; they will have Gods Will bowed to theirs, not
theirs to the Lord, nor yield themselves Captives to his mercy, let him do
with them what he will, who owes them nothing. Thus it was with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim;
Capernaum</hi> heard, admired, embraced Christ, but yet repented
not; that was to live in the smoke and fire; Wo to you, saith he, for it.
<hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 7, 8. <hi>Be instructed;</hi> He saith not, Instruct thy self, but <hi>be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,</hi>
be convinced, be humbled for thy sin, <hi>lest my soul depart;</hi> I am
with thee yet to pardon it, yet to take it away.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When they will not be gathered to Christ, nor come to him,
nor receive his love when it comes to them, but put it farre from them as
much as in them lies. The Disciples told <hi>Thomas</hi> Christ was risen, but he
would not believe unless he saw him; nay, unless he felt; nay, unless he
felt his very wounds; Christ pities, and beares with the weakness of Faith;
<hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>be no more faithless, but faithful;</hi> and hence saith he,
<hi>Blessed are they which have not seen, and yet believed;</hi> this, Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines

not!</hi>

                     <p>Now here resistance is made two wayes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the will; when the soul sees the offer of love faire and full, but will
not be drawn to close with it, because it knows whether to go, and live, and
be yet well enough without it. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 68. <hi>Whether shall I go?</hi> It hath
some other Lovers to give it content; but loss of Christs love, is not for
the present as bitter as death to him; because having of it, is not life to
him, because something else is his life; this is enmity of heart; and indeed
the root is worse (if worse may be) you can finde some pillow to ease you,
when you refuse Christs love to help you.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the minde; the soul knows not whether to go, and yet the minde
doth not, not will meditate with fixed meditations on the grace of Christ,
whereby it might be drawn to Christ; but pores upon its sinnes, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and feares, and objects strongly, and continually against the Lord.
<hi>Isaiah</hi> 40. 27, 28. <hi>Hast not seen, &amp;c.</hi> (Beloved) 'Tis with the minde,

now.</p>
                     <p>First. You may know it by time present; There are two things which seldome
fail in deepest disertxsions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The soul forsakes not the Lord by unutterable groanes, when the Lord

<hi>Psalme</hi> 63. 8. and doth not as the Philistines, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 21. forsake their gods,
when they forsake them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If this failes, it grows poor in spirit, and vile, and loaths it self, as

grace most, when the Lord makes it least; and when the Lord makes it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
it makes God all things to it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If neither of these will serve, yet you may remember dayes of

forsaken him,</hi> but yet now he remembers Ancient mercies.</p>

are the loosenings of a mans heart from Gods people; Like the Apple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it falls, it begins to grow loose from that which holds it. I shall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew how this is, that you may be watchful; many not yet fallen, but
their hearts sit loose from Churches, and fellowship of Saints, and people
of God, even when they think their hearts sit close to Christ; and I will
not name all; for particular men have their particular temptations; but
what is most common; and this is one secret sin, and plague of men in
these Churches, and there will be rendings; Christs work is to gather, and
Satans ever quite contrary, to scatter; and it is a Rule, What is Christs grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

Christ treads on Satan most, there he bites most.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Lord withdraws that honour and love from a man, which either
he looks for, or thinks he deserves from the hands and hearts of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
either they are not lovely, or not loving to others; when they have
either no personal worth to purchase love, or they have nothing to give
of love in exchange for love, or else (to try them) the Lord for a time
leaves his people to a blockishness of spirit; their love waxeth cold, or
they think they are not honoured, or have not enough; and so (if men do
not make) Satan will make them scandals to themselves through their pride
of spirit. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 35. <hi>Saul</hi> desired, <hi>Honour me before the people,</hi> but

judgement of God on men for not loving the truth, but taking pleasure in

                     <p>First, Hereby he shews his wisdome, in discovering the secrets of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and all the wily knots men have tyed, to hamper themselves in their

hence the wisdome of Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hereby the Lord Jesus shews h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s holiness, who withdrawes

who are bound to be holy as he is holy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Hereby the Lord keeps the Communion of his Saints pure; this
is a wonderful glory in Heaven, that only the Elect and faithful of God shall
lie down together; and is the last and greatest glory that ever shall be seen
in this world, <hi>Revelations</hi> 21. 27. One man or woman secret'y vile, which
the Church hath not used all means to discover, may defile a whole Church,

be worn off again, and then men will wish that they had kept their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
pure.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Hereby the Lord abundantly vouchsafes his presence to his
people in Heaven, when the Goats are separated; now come and take your
fill of love, and possess your Kingdome; so the Church hereby gaines
more of the presence of Christ Jesus in publick and private; when <hi>

gone out, now Christ comforts the hearts of his Disciples; when the Lord
hath his Spouse alone, then he sports himself with her. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 4. <hi>

When all in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are holy, there shall be a Cloud and Pillar of smoak
on all their Habitations. And therefore not only the Churches should do
thus, but a godly holy heart will desire it; it's the end of his coming
that he may be searched; better had men be tried and examined now, than
by Christ another day.</p>

                        <hi>Answer,</hi> I remember a godly Divine in answering an Objection of late
repentance from the example of the Thief; having whipt it with many other
Rods, at last lasheth it with this, it's an extraordinary case; and hence not
to be brought in for an ordinary example; hence he speaks thus, When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time comes that Christ shall come and be crucif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

now, puts off thy repentance till then; So I say here, there is somewhat
imitable and ordinary in the Apostles example, in admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ting three thousand
in a day, but something unusual, and farre different from our condition
now; and therefore this I would say when the time comes, that the Spirit
is poured out on all flesh; and that time is known to be the Spring-tide, and
large measure of the Spirit, when Ministers are so honoured as to convert
many thousands at a Sermon; and so God and reason call for quickness; when
Elders of Churches are as sharp-sigted as the Apostles; when the conversion
of men also shall be most eminent, and that in such places where 'tis death,
or half hanging, to profess the Lord Jesus, as that they shall be prickt at their
hearts, gladly receive the Word, lay down their necks on the block, cast
down all their estates at the Churches feet, out of love to Gods Ordinances;
when men shall not have Christian education, the example and crowd of
Christians from the teeth outwardly to press them to the door of the Church,
as those times had not; then for my part, if three hundred thousand were
converted, I should receive them as gladly and as manifestly as they receive
Christ; but truly, there is such little takings now, that we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

be Christs Lambs and Babes, having much ignorance, and carnalness, out
of zeal in some, not guided aright; and pride in others, despising those that

if they were convinced of, would soon lament and amend; and to be so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
toward them, will not be suffered by Jesus Christ, if continued in

I'le add, The Lord may see in some good people that are about to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Church, that which makes them fit to destroy a Church; not
to build up a Church, as in case of some secret sin not sufficiently repented
of, and some decay of the first love, <hi>Rev.</hi>2. 5. and the Lord by this means
may recover them by Word or Rod under witness of the Church against them;

the heap, and heap up all the particular passages of their lives, wherein

him; another he is a man of estate, and his money is in the mouth of his
Sack; another thinks there is one bad enough, but we shall do well enough

we put them over to be tried by the Highest Court of the Kingdome; and
that is very dreadful, if their case be bad; so here, one thinks it a shame to

wants Marriage, and that's the way to it; another thinks of his gaine in a

                     <p>Hence see there is need of conversion in some Church-members;<note>Vse 5.</note> Did
you ever see a Church-member converted? said one, as if then the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of death was past, when once in the Church; some should look about
them herein; I'le only give this Rule, Be alway converting, and be alway
converted; turn us again O Lord; When a man thinks, I was humbled and
comforted, I'le not lay all by, and so live on old Scraps; Oh beware of
that frame! not that a Christian should be alwayes pulling up foundations,
and ever doubting; but to make sure, be alway converting, more
humble, more sensible of sinne, more near to Christ Jesus; and then
you that are sure, may be more sure; and you that are not, may be sure
indeed.</p>

                        </note> Against security. Motives.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because 'tis the last sin as you have heard, which surprizeth Saints; a
Christian at first conversion, strives and gets mastery over many sins, but
some are very hard, that he cannot overcome them; and because he cannot,
hence like the <hi>Israelites,</hi> he is ready to think the worst is past, and I cannot
be better; and hence lies secure, and makes truce with sin.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. 'Tis a very dangerous sin; What temptation may not a man fall into,
and be overcome with, when he is sleepy and secure? A strong man that is
asleep, may not a childe, any weak enemy cut his Throat, or pick his Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
it may be when awakened he may recover his losses, but it is sad for
the present with him; so here.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a most bewitching sin; because nothing is so sweet as sleep, and the
sweeter, the stronger, and the worse.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. 'Tis the temptation of this place. 1. Because when Churches grow
secure, then all begin to slumber; else one might awaken all. 2. Because here's
peace; we have our ease, and our pillows, and feather-beds, and are out of
the noise of persecution; and hence sleep, and watch not; are secure and
dead-hearted, and pray not; our hearts dye, and prayers dye by this means.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because of many sad wearisome Trials, and heavy loads; 'tis hard to live
for some, and their bodies are weak, and cates, and distractions many, and
griefs from servants rudeness, &amp;c. exceeding; and debts come upon men;
sorrow made the Disciples eyes heavy, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 45. The poor loaden horse

the high way, till rest and provender be given him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Oh therefore blessed are ye if you endure temptation, and watch one
hour in this place and time. I tell you the Lord will fet thee down, and
serve thee, and give thee what thou callest for.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Many looking after Christ, deceive themselves here; here is their wound;
they have some taste of sins bitterness, and some taste of Christ, and some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
but the life of Christ they want; not that all must have the same
measure; but consider of what hath been opened to you; Oh these colours,
formes, and figures, and images, and pageants, and pictures, and names, and
paints, and gildings, are the undoing of many.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Consider the example of <hi>David,</hi> who though a Prophet, yet desires, <hi>O
that I might see the Lord in his house! Paul</hi> reached after more and more; as
for his prize, he made work of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Christ is full, and hath enough Spirit; oh therefore seek for more! if
you know this gift, and ask, he will give Rivers of waters; Young Christians,
look to your selves as you wax old; what is become of your gold? why doth
Copper appear now, in comparison of what it hath been (it may be) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For Christs coming; Motives.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This is the beginning of glory; <hi>Adam</hi> looked only for his happiness in
an earthly Paradise, but you are heirs of an heavenly, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You have nothing else to look for; if only of the things of this world
you might look for your portion here, it were another matter; but now when
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40159:226"/>
called, justified, sanctified, sin warring against thee, and nothing but thy body
and breath between thee and Christ; oh look after it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sorrows in the Country cry for it; we think within few years the Land
will be out of heart, and want of cloaths, or not money to buy, or pay
debts, and this and tother evil will ensue; so for particular persons, What
shall I do hereafter? &amp;c. True, but glory will pay for all at Christs coming.</p>
