         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God, to his <hi>New England</hi> People, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
all their wilderness-tryals, and
straits, and sorrows, wherewith they
at first conflicted in those ends of the

with him <hi>whom their soules love,</hi> and had famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
and full converse with him, above what they could
then enjoy in the land from whence they came. This is
that that hath sweetned many a bitter Cup <hi>to
the remnant of</hi> Israel. <hi>The Lord alone led him,
and there was no strange God with him,</hi> was
said concerning <hi>Israel</hi> of old, and this was accounted
mercy enough when he led them into a land where no
man dwelt, and which no man passed thorough. What

what their Sanctuary mercies be, thou hast here a
taste, though but a taste. These notes may well be
thought to be lesse accurate, than if the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had published them, and to want some polishments

truths, and mayest easily discern his Spirit, and a
Spirit above his own breathing in them.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Author; it were worth the while
to write the story of his life.</p>
            <p>It is needlesse to speak in his commendation, <hi>His
works praise him in the gates.</hi> They that know
him, know he had as real apprehensions of the things
of God, and lived as much with God, and with his
own heart, and more than the most of Christians do.
He had his education at <hi>Immanuel-College</hi> in
<hi>Cambridge.</hi> The Conversion and Change of his
heart was wrought betimes when he lived in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
and enjoyed Dr. <hi>Prestons</hi> Ministery, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God had the very best and strength of his parts and
years for himself. When he was first awakened to
lookt after Religion, having before swam quietly in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

stream of the times, he was utterly at a losse which
way to take, being much molested with suggestions of
<hi>Atheism,</hi> (in the depths whereof <hi>Junius</hi> was quite
lost for a time) and moved and tempted to the wayes
of <hi>Familism</hi> also; for some advised him in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to go to <hi>Grindlestone</hi> and to hear <hi>Mr. Brier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
and being informed that the people were wont to
find a mighty possessing over powering presence, and
work of the Spirit when they heard him, he resolved
upon the journey; but God in mercy diverted him;
having reserved him for better things. Yet he read
what they said, and the Books of <hi>H. N.</hi> amongst the
rest, where meeting with this passage, <hi>That a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is so swallow'd up in the spirit,</hi> that what
action soever the spirit moves him to, suppose whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
he may do it, and it is no sin to him; this was
enough: for being against the light of his natural
conscience, it bred in him an utter abhorrency of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se
loose and vile wayes and principles ever after. This

               </gap>tage also he had, that Doctor <hi>Tuckney</hi> was
then his Tutor, whom he acquainted with his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and had his direction and help in those mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fluctuations and straits of his soul. Happy is
the man whose doubtings end in establishments, <hi>nil
tam certum, quàm quod de dubio certum,</hi> but
when men arrive in <hi>Scepticism,</hi> as the last issue &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of all their debates and thoughts of heart about
Religion, it had been good for such if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been born.</p>
            <p>After his heart was changed, it was observed of
him, that his abilities of mind were also much enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
divinity, though it be chiefly the Art and rule of
the will, yet raising and perfecting the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
also; which I conceive came to pass chiefly by
this means, that the fear of God fixed him, and
made him serious, and taught him to meditate,
which is the main improvement of the understanding.
Therefore such as came to him for direction about
their studies, he would often advise them to be much in
meditation, professing, that having spent some time
in meditation every day in his beginning times, and
written down his thoughts; he saw cause now to
blesse God for it. He was assigned to the work of the
Ministery at a solemn meeting and conference of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
godly Ministers about it, there were to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of twelve present at the meeting, whose solemn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was that he should serve the Lord <hi>in the Gospel
of his Son;</hi> wherein they have been the salvation of
many a soul: for upon this he addrest himself to the
work, with that reality and seriousnesse in wooing
and winning souls, that his words made deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
and seldome or never sell to the ground.</p>
            <p>He was lecturer a while at <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rles-cone</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi>
(which I take it was the first place of his Ministery)
<pb facs="tcp:102140:4"/>
where he did much good, and the people there, though
now it is long since, and many are gone, yet they have
a very precious and deep remembrance of him, of the
mighty power of God by him to this day. But <hi>W.
Lawd</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London</hi> soon stopt his mouth,
and drove him away, as he did many other godly
Ministers from <hi>Essex</hi> at the same time. After this
he lived at <hi>Butter-chrome</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> at Sir
<hi>Richard Darleys</hi> house, till the Iniquity of those times
hunted him thence also. Then he went to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>
till silenced there also; and being thus
molested and chased up and down at home, he fled to
<hi>New-England,</hi> and after some difficulties and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes,
by great storms and disasters at Sea upon the
Sands and Coasts of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> which retarded his
voyage till another year, he arrived there at last;
where he was Pastor to a precious flock at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
about fourteen yeers. He was but 46. or
47. years old when he dyed. His sicknesse began
with a sore throat, and then a squinacy, and then a
fever, whereof be dyed <hi>August</hi> 25. 1649. This
was one thing he said upon his deathbed, Lord, I am
vile, but thou art righteous; and to those that were
about him, he bade them loue Iesus Christ dearly,
that little part that I have in him, is no small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to me now.</p>
            <p>His manner of preaching was close and searching,
and with abundance of affection and compassion to
his hearers. He took great pains in his preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for his publick labours, accounting it a cursed
thing to do the work of the Lord negligently; and
therefore spending usually two or three whole dayes in
preparing for the work of the Sabbath, had his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
finished usually on <hi>Saturday</hi> by two of the clock;
He hath some<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ime exprest himself thus in publick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:102140:4"/>
               <q>God will curse that mans labours that lumbers
up and down in the world all the week, and
then upon <hi>Saturday</hi> in the afternoon goes to
his Study, when as God knows that time were
little enough to pray and weep in, and to get
his heart in frame, &amp;c.</q> He affected plainnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with power in preaching, not seeking abstrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
nor liking to hover and soar aloft in dark ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
and so shoot his Arrows (as many Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
do) over the heads of his hearers.</p>
            <p>It is a wretched stumbling block to some, that his
Sermons are somewhat strict, and (as they term it)
legall: some souls can relish none but meal-mouth'd
Preachers, who come with soft and smooth, and tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
words, <hi>byssina verba byssinis viris:</hi> But these
times need humbling Ministeries, and blessed be God
that there are any; for where there are no Law-Sermons,
there will be few Gospel-lives, and were
there more Law-preaching in <hi>England</hi> by the men of
gifts, there would be more Gospel-walking both by
themselves and the People. To preach the Law, not
in a forc'd affected manner, but wisely and powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
together with the Gospel, as Christ himself was
wont to do (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and elsewhere) is the way to
carry on all three together, sense of misery, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the remedy, and the returns of thankefulnesse
and duty. Nor is any doctrine more comforting than
this humbling way of God, if rightly managed.</p>
            <p>It is certain the foundations of after-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orrows and
ruines to the Church, have ever been laid in the days
of her prosperity, and peace, and rest, when she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes
all her pleasant things. This the watchmen of
<hi>Israel</hi> should foresee, and therefore what shoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

melt mens hearts, and <hi>warn every one night and
<pb facs="tcp:102140:5"/>
day with tears,</hi> that in the day of their peace, they
may not sin away the things of their Peace. There
are therefore three requests, which we would desire to
beg of God, with bended knees for <hi>England,</hi> to prepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
the present prosperity and peace thereof; and let
us commend them to the mourning and praying ones
amongst us, that they would be the Lords remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in these Petitions.</p>
            <p>1. A right understanding and sober use of liberty.
For when People come first out of bondage, they are apt
to be not only somewhat fond of their liberties, but to

               </gap>tions of men, though
in conjunction with the powers and gates of hell, shall
certainly fall at last before Truth and Prayer. And
of this is the first Treatise which is seasonably pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd.</p>
            <p>To be fast bound to the rule with all the bonds and
cords of God and Man is the Perfection of liberty.
Hence there is not a surer Corner-stone of ruine to a
Christian Commonwealth, that God will break them
with unparallell'd destructions by some <hi>overflowing
scourge,</hi> when <hi>the day of vengeance is in his heart,</hi>
than to think that Religion is none of their Liberties,
and yet how many sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> are there <hi>void of
counsell, neither is there any understanding in
them,</hi> who <hi>imagine vain things,</hi> and say, <hi>Let us
break his bands asunder, and cast away his cord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from us?</hi> How do men run into extremes, either
stretching and paring every one to the Gyants bed,
and thereby denying liberty to the Saints to serve
him, according to the measure of their stature in
Christ, or else on the other hand opening the door so
wide, as to plead for liberty to all the disguised ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and sins against Christ, thereby instead of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Saints in one, indeavouring though a
dreadfull mistake to unite Christ and Belial? It is a
sad thing when a man is come to this passe, that he is
not able to resolve his conscience whether <hi>Baal</hi> be
God, or the Lord be God, and therefore would not
have the worshippers of <hi>Baal</hi> punisht, for fear lest <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
should be God. Is liberty nothing but indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and irresolution of spirit in the things of God?
wo to <hi>the valley of vision,</hi> even to a <hi>sinfull Nation
laden with iniquity,</hi> and led away from <hi>the truth
as it is in Jesus,</hi> and to <hi>the Host of the high ones
that sit on high,</hi> in the day of his visitation, if this
be the spirit of these times; for in the day when he
visits, God will visit for these things.</p>
            <p>2. That his Word, especially the Word of his
Gospel, may be precious and powerfull, <hi>may run and
be glorified in</hi> England. Alas! as there is much
preaching, but few serious, few heart-breaking Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:
so there is much hearing, but little effectual
hearing. Men stand like the <hi>Oakes of</hi> Bashan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the words of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> no terrour of the
Lord, no news of everlasting destruction, no evidence
of the fierce anger of God upon them, <hi>which burns
down to the bottom of hell,</hi> can take hold upon
their spirits, or awaken their consciences, to make
inquiries after God in this their day: yea if the bars
of the pit of hel, were broken, and if the devils of hell
should come flying up amongst us, in our solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
<pb facs="tcp:102140:6"/>
from the fiery corners of the Pit helow, with
everlasting burnings about their eares, and with
chains of darkness ratling at their heels, they might
fright men out of their wits perhaps, or from the acts
of sin it may be for a time, but it would not work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their hearts, their desperate, dead, besotted hearts.
The fooles in <hi>Israel</hi> will have their swinge in their
lusts, and go to hell in a full cariere, let God do his
best. Oh the hardnesse of mens hearts! And the
main reason of it, is because they hear but a sound of
words, but they do not hear the Lord in that Word:
they hear words that are spoken by God, but they hear
not, they see not God himself therein. If ever thou
wouldest profit by reading or hearing, take every
word as a speciall message to thee from God; and of
this fruitless hearing, and the rules of hearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
is the other Treatise.</p>
            <p>3. Conscience of his Sabbaths. Of which there is
an elaborate discourse of this Author, formerly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
by himself. Therefore we shall adde no more.
The blessing of heaven go with these, to make us <hi>a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
People in the day of his power,</hi> to submit to
his Word, and to come under the wing of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Iesus Christ, as esteeming these spirituall
mercies our best mercies, our choycest and dearest li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
If ever the Lord Iesus (which mercy forbid)
should take his dolefull and finall farewell of the
<hi>English</hi> Nation, as when he laid the tomb-stone upon
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> such as these will be his mournings over
us: <hi>Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest
the Prophets and burnest them that are sent unto
thee,</hi> as they did in the time of Popery, <hi>how often
would I have gathered thy children together</hi> (by
my Word and Spirit therein) <hi>even as a Hen gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her Chickens under the wings</hi> (of my speciall
<pb facs="tcp:102140:6"/>
Government and Protection?) <hi>but ye would not;
behold your house is left unto you desolate.</hi> But
the Lord who doth not only make the day dark with
night, but also turneth the shadow of death into the
morning, even the Lord avert these evils, and the
Lord make the <hi>English</hi> Nation <hi>his Hephfibah, and
the land Beulah,</hi> which is the prayer of his Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He precious memory of the Author
of these ensuing SERMONS,
needs no reviving to any gracious
heart, that had any knowledge of
him. Yea the world knows in part
(though but in a little part) by some pieces of his
formerly Printed (while he was y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>) who
this Author was, what it owes to God for him,
and how justly it might sigh over his grave, with
that of the Apostle, <hi>Of whom the World was not
worthy!</hi> His praise throughout all the Churches,
is farre above any addition by so mean a pen as
writes these lines. But it is not fit that the first
page of any thing published after his death (for
I doubt not but his death is long ago publickly
took notice of) should go without some wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a mournfull remembrance thereof, which
indeed no tears can sufficiently lament. We who
sometimes <hi>sate under his shadow,</hi> and were fed
from God by him, (the poor flock of this <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi>)
among whom he lived, <hi>testifying Repentance
towards God, and faith towards our Lord Iesus
Christ;</hi> and whom he sometimes <hi>exhorted, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and charged euery one of us as a Father doth his
<pb facs="tcp:102140:7"/>
Children;</hi> we cannot but carry sorrow in the
bottome of our hearts to this day, that wee must
here see his face no more. Neither do we believe
that his losse remains with us alone, or only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the limits of this remote wildernesse; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
(and consequently the want) of such a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and shining Light, is of more generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
that we easily apprehend, especially in
this Age, wherein not only many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it in utter
darknesse, but which is more, the <hi>new Light</hi>
thereof is darknesse; and <hi>the Love of many wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cold.</hi> But we must all be silent before Him,
whose judgements are unsearchable. Neither
may we presume to say to him, What doest
thou?</p>
            <p>It is instantly and not without cause desired by
many, that such reliques of his Labours as do sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
him, may be (at least some of them) impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the publick. To effect any thing conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
that way, is not an easie or sudden work.
But this small piece being at present attained; it
seemed not amisse to let it pass the Press. These
were some of his <hi>Lecture-Sermons,</hi> Preached most
of them in the year, 1641. They are now tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by a godly Brother, partly from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
own notes, partly from what he took from
his mouth: The subject (in both the Texts) is
of great use, and needfull for these times; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is more Liberty, than good use of it; and
much more common and outward, than saving
and effectuall knowledge of the word of God.
These posthumous editions are far short of what
the Author was wont to do, and of what the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were in preaching. But though the sense
be not every where so full, nor every thing so
<pb facs="tcp:102140:8"/>
thorowly spoken to, nor the stile so good by far,
(as the Authors manner was) yet the intelligent
Reader will find a precious treasure of truth in it,
not fit to be buried or neglected. The <hi>Prophets
do not live for ever,</hi> but their words do: The
Lord make them such ever-living words as may

there be: <hi>Ieroboam</hi> probably might be treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
who having a party in <hi>Egypt,</hi> lest <hi>Rehoboam</hi> should
grow too great, together with some other pretended
wrongs, might awaken this Bear from his den; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of God, you may see the Reason set down, <hi>Vers. 2.
Because they had transgressed against the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time of this War is set down in the 1. <hi>Vers. When
he had established the Kingdome</hi> by wholesome Lawes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
Gods worship, and countenancing godly men,
2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 11. 16, 17. which continued three years, <hi>and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102140:10"/>
strengthened himself</hi> by fortified places, and munition fit
for war, as in the foregoing Chapter appears. Now when
he had most peace and quiet, he and all Israel suddenly
forsake the Lord, which was the fourth year; and in the
fifth year comes <hi>Shishak,</hi> and with a mighty hoast wastes
all before him untill he come to the chief City.</p>
            <p>Now in <hi>Vers.</hi> the 5. and 6. is set down the repentance
of the people with their Princes especially. <hi>Shemajah,</hi>
who no doubt had spoke against their idolatrous courses
before, takes his season when they were low and tamed,
and tels them the true cause of their misery, <hi>Vers.</hi> 5. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sins there were in the Land, as Idolatty, and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doines,
&amp;c. yet the venom was, <hi>They had forsaken the
Lord:</hi> Let the sin be what it will be, yet let it be such a
one as men forsake the Lord by it, that's the provocation;
hereupon they humble themselves, some effectually, some
hypocritically, yet all outwardly, and say the Lord is
righteous; they extenuate not their sin, they lay not the
blame on man, no not on <hi>Shishak,</hi> but see the Lord, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his proceedings, the Lord is righteous, we unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
although it were more heavy then it is.</p>
            <p>Now in the 7. <hi>Vers.</hi> and in the words read is set down
the mitigation of Gods plague, and the moderation of his
chastisement, <hi>I will not pour out all my wrath,</hi> yet I think
it not fit to shew perfect deliverance, <hi>I'le make them ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
to let them know, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two parts in the words read.</p>
            <p>1. The punishment or chastisement on <hi>Iudah</hi> for forsaking
the Lord, and backsliding from him, which is hondage
and privation of the liberty they had, they must be <hi>shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaks</hi>
servants.</p>
            <p>2. The Lords end, it was very gracious, <hi>That they
may know my service, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For explication.</p>
            <p>1. What is meant by service?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There are two things in service. 1. Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
2. Subjection: cheerfull obedience to that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernemt.
Both the Hebrew word, as also the nature
of the thing it self hath these two.</p>
            <p>God sets up his Government over a people, his people do
or should subject cheefully to this government; By my
service is therefore meant my government, and your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
wrought by me to this governmemt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102140:10"/>
2. They shall know.</p>
            <p>1. Not by the knowledge of the brain, for that they
know now, but knowledge of experience, as it's said in
<hi>Ezek. 6. ult.</hi> When I shall have made the Land desolate
in all their habitations, they shall know that I am the
Lord. Now what shall they know of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> the difference betwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n them, the sorrow of the
one, the sweet of the other; the misery of the one, and
blessednesse of the other; the bondage of the one, and
the liberty of the other.</p>
            <p>There might be many things observed from the words,
but I note only the generall.</p>
            <p>Obser.<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> 
               <hi>That when any people of God forsake the Lord,

                  </gap>ver them, they provoke the Lord
to put them under the bondage of another government.</hi> They
that abuse Gods liberty must be under bondage; the Lord
hath a Kingdome in this world most glorious; hence when
men will not be under it, if they will not be ruled by him,
they must be ruled by the whip; and if Christs laws can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bind, Christs chains must. <hi>Ier. 5. 19. And it shall come
to passe when ye shall say, Where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have
forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye
serve strangers in a land that is not yours.</hi> Psal, 107. 10, 11.
<hi>Such as sit in darknesse and in the shadow of death, being
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound in affliction and iron, because they rebelled against the
words of God, and contemned the counsell of the most high.</hi>
Ezek. 20. 24, 25. <hi>Because they had not executed my Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but had despised my Statutes, and polluted my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
&amp;c. Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not
good, and judgements, whereby they should not live, &amp;c.</hi> Zach.
11. 15, 16. <hi>And the Lord said unto me, Take unto thee yet
the instruments of a foolish Shepherd.</hi> Vers. 16. <hi>For lo I will
raise up a shepherd in the land which shall not visit those that
be cut off, nor seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken,
nor feed that that standeth still, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When people break convenant with God, and loath
him, then saith the Lord, I'Ie not feed and then he sets o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them Idol shepherds.</p>
            <p>This is certain, when the soul will not subject it self to
God, he goes about to subject God to him, nay to his lusts,
<hi>Isa. 43. 24. Thou hast made me to serve with thy sins.</hi> For
one of them must stoop, and a man would have the Lord
be mercifull, patient, and pittifull to him, when he is in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102140:11"/>
league with his lusts, now this the Lord will not do: And
hence, if he does not destroy him, he with-draws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from serving of the creature, and hence other evils
take hold of it, and bring it under. When <hi>Adam</hi>
stood, and was for God, all creatures served him, and
the riches of Gods goodnesse preserved him, the Lord
communicated the sweet of his government or service
to him: but when turned away from the right wayes
of God: Now if the Lord should serve him by gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of him in goodnesse, he should serve a lust, and bow
to the creature, nay to a lust, which is a viler thing,
then for one creature to fall down and worship ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Therefore now hence it comes to passe, because
the Lord will not be a servant to any mans lust, there must
be some other government that must seize upon them.
Hence set all the Saints in the Churches with their
faces subjected to the Lord, his good wil and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wayes, and then his goodness shall flow down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them in a through Christ, for otherwise we have
nothing to do with good, but when we are set right for
God. <hi>Hos. 2. 19. I will betroth thee unto me for ever, yea
I will betroth thee unto me in righteousnesse, in judgement,
in loving kindnesse and mercy, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord will then
command all creatures to be serviceable to his Church
and people; <hi>Vers.</hi> 21, 22. But on the contrary misery
must needs seiz upon the soul that doth cast off the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Lord Jesus: Thus much for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
explication of the point.</p>
            <p>Now in particular. 1. What is this government or
service of God?</p>
            <p>2. What is the bondage he captivates his unto?</p>
            <p>3. Why doth the Lord do thus?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Quest. 1.</note> What is this government or service of God
which being shaken off the Lord gives them over to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> There is a double government of the Lord over
his people.</p>
            <p>1. Internall or inward, of which our Saviour speaks,
<hi>Luk. 17. 21. The kingdome of God</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>comes
not by observation</hi> and outward pomp; <hi>For behold the
kingdome of God is within you:</hi> And this is nothing
else in generall, but when the Lord doth by his Spirit
in the word of his grace cause the whole soul willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to submit and subject it self to the whole will of God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102140:11"/>
so far as it's made known to it; this is the inward king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God and government of Christ in the soul. <hi>Ro.</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
14. <hi>So many as are led by the Spirit are the sons of God.</hi> Ps.
110. 2. <hi>The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of
Zion, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Cor. 10. 4. <hi>For the weapons of our warfare are
not carnall, but mighty through God the pulling down of

to the obedience of Christ.</hi> There are mighty boisterous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs,
but the Lord when he comes in his Kingdome,
to sit upon the royall throne of the hearts of his people,
now they flie: and this is the inward Kingdom
of Christ, like a poor Subject pardoned and received
to favour, he is before the face of the Prince continually
attending on him. <hi>Revel. 7. 14, 15. These are they
which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</hi>
Vers. 15. <hi>Therefore are they before the throne of God, and
serve him day and night in his Temple, &amp;c.</hi> Now this is
meant in part by Gods service in these dayes; do you think
the Lord cared for thousands of Rams? no, <hi>but to walk
humbly,</hi> Mica. 6. Did he care for Temple aud Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances?
no, but <hi>Isa. 1. 19. If he be willing and obedient,
ye shall eat the good of the land.</hi> Neh. 9. 20. <hi>In those
dayes hee gave them his good Spirit to instruct
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Externall or outward, the end and instigation of
which was to set up and help forward the inward; for
externall Ordinances are nothing in themselves,
mean things, but as they are appointed and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for this end, they are most glorious: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ threatens the Jewes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 43. That
<hi>the Kingdome should be taken from them;</hi> what was that?
Surely not inward, for that they had not, but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and externall means called Gods kingdom; all these
helps and means shall be taken from you, and all laid
ruinous. Now this externall kingdom of Christ is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>1. The externall kingdome or government of God
by his Church, in the administration an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> execution,
and subjection to the blessed Ordinances of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the power and Kingdome of Christ is seen, and
thus, <hi>Dan. 2. 44, 45. Dan. 7. 27. It shall be given to the
Saints of the most high, &amp;c.</hi> Not to prophane herds of
beasts, or cages of unclean birds, but to the Saints
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102140:12"/>
of the most high, <hi>Whose kingdome is an everlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
and all the Princes of the world shall subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to this kingdom of Christ.</p>
            <p>This outward Kingdom Christ administreth amongst
his people in this world: And this was part of the Lords
government over his people herein, though various from
our form now.</p>
            <p>2. Of the Common-wealth, which may have divers
forms, and had in the time of <hi>Israel;</hi> but it receiving its
law from God, and governing for God, hence it was the
government of God, and subjection hereunto was subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and service to God himself: And hence when the
people cast off <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam 8. 7. They have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
thee but me,</hi> Rev. 11. 15. <hi>The kingdomes of the world
are become the kingdomes of our Lord and of his Christ, and
he shall reign for ever and ever.</hi> For although the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of <hi>Israel</hi> was made up of the Church, and
hence <hi>Iosephus</hi> cals it a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> where the Lord govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and yet the same thing had divers <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, formes and
respects, and hence there was a diverse government then,
and hence made diverse, 2 <hi>Chron. 19. 5, 8. Iehosaphat sets
Iudges in the land throughout all the fenced Cities.</hi> Such is
the wildnesse, boldness, &amp; carelesness of mens hearts, that
they do not only need lawes, but watchmen over them
to see they be kept: and hence the Lord appointed some
chief, some Judges in every City, and also some in every
Village, as by proportion may be gathered, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ten men had one over them.</p>
            <p>Now this was the blessed wisdome of God to put all
into sweet subordination one unto another for himself.</p>
            <p>1. Every one professing his name is made for God, for
Christ, <hi>as Lord of Lords, unto whom every knee must bow,</hi>
and inwardly subject.</p>
            <p>2. Hence the Lord (it being not good to leave man
to himself) erects a Kingdome of the Church with his
own power, and authority, and government in it for that
end.</p>
            <p>3. This being poor shiftlesse against inward and
outward revenge, hence the Lords sets up Kingdoms of
the world, which either rule for this end of these ends or
not, if they do not, they are to answer it, and shall one
days to Christ, <hi>whom God hath made head over all things to
the Church.</hi> Eph. 1. 22. If they do, then their government,
judgement and kingdome is the Lords in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102140:12"/>
and hence break the yoak of subjection to any one
of these, you cast off Christ, the Lords government and
service; and being so linked together, in truth if you
break one you break all, and this will provoke the Lord
to make you kisse the clink, and to put your necks under
iron bondage that refuse subjection to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Quest. 2.</note> What is that bondage or other government
to which the Lord gives over his people when they have

bondage? when is it that the Lord takes his season for

               </hi> comes at last, and many
years 'tis before the Lord doth it.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> The Lord is various in working, as he is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and hath divers wayes or means of bondage, he hath
more prisons and chaines than one.</p>
            <p>First, sometimes the Lord opens the door of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or State, for the inrode of some forraign, or it may be
barbarous Enemy, breaking in sometime by power, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in sometime by craft, and then ruling like Lions,
which the Lord makes to vex and prick the people of
God; thus here their lives were spared, but liberties lost.
Thus <hi>Iudg. 2. 13, 14. They forsook the Lord, and served Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and Ashtaroth.</hi> And in <hi>vers. 14. The anger of the Lord
waxed hot against Israel, and he dilivered them into the
hands of spoylers that spoyled them.</hi> Ver. 15 <hi>Whithersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for
evill.</hi> And this the Lord doth many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>imes suddenly, that
one would never think that ever the Lord should be so
sudden; the Lord can be as quick to punish, as man to sin,
and that unexpectedly. <hi>Eccl, 9. 12. Man knows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

4. 12. <hi>The kingdomes of the earth, and all the inhabitants of
the world would not have beleeved,</hi> Judg. 5. 8. <hi>They set up
new gods, and war was in the gate.</hi>

            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Sometimes the Lord turns the edge of that lawfull
authority God hath set over them against themselves, to
be a heavy scourge from God upon them: Thus it was
with <hi>Israel</hi> in Egypt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 8, 9. there arose a King
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102140:13"/>
which knew not <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and it's said then they were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
Thus <hi>Ieroboam</hi> whom the ten Tribes chose,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 11. he oppressed the people he will be in
novating, and this becomes their oppression: Thus the
people under the reign of degenerate <hi>Solomon</hi> (though
their complaint might be in part unjust.) Such is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
of sin an unsubduednesse to the Kingdom God,
that the Lord turns light into darknesse, and makes
an aking head matter of sorrow to all the state and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of people. <hi>Eccles. 10. 16. Wo to thee, O Land, when thy
King is a child.</hi> And one man shall do a world of hurt,
one <hi>Shebna</hi> or <hi>Amaziah,</hi> and this the Lord doth in justice
many times for casting off his government.</p>
            <p>3. Sometimes the Lord gives a people up into the hands
of one another to be mutuall oppressors of each other,
that a man neighbour shall be his oppressor. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.
9 <hi>I will pitty no more the inhabitaents of the, land, I will
deliver them every one into his neighbours hands. I will feed
you no more, that which dyeth let it dye, &amp; that which is cut
off let it be cut off, and let the rest eat every one the flesh of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi>
Sometimes the Lord is pleased to send marvellous
straits into a place, that men are forced to imbondage
themselves sometimes by words as bitter as death, as
sharp as arrows; the Lord is pleased for the forsaking of
his righteous wayes to make a mans self rip his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,
the father against the childe, the master shall be a
scourage to the servant, and the servant shall be a scourge to
his master, weary him of his lffe, the government of the
Lord in a mans heart or family being cast off, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.
4, 5. <hi>Trust not in a friend:</hi> No greater bondage in the
world then for men professing the Lord, to be desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set one against another.</p>
            <p>4. By taking from a people all that righteous power
of government the Lord hath set over them, when a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
despising the Lord and inward government first (for
there all begins) and so not prizing what they have, nor
praying for them, nor subjecting to them, the Lord here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
sends some sicknesse, or some other evill, that
they are either suddenly taken away, or gradually, and
when they are gone, all sink, or else such crosse carriages,
that as <hi>Moses</hi> said, so say they, <hi>I cannot bear this people.</hi>
Thus <hi>Iudges 21. 25. Men did what was right in their own
eyes when there was no King in Israel.</hi> No State so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as an Anarchie, when every one is a slave, because

every one will be a Master. Thus, <hi>Isa. 3. 1, 2. 6. Be a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

3. 5. when <hi>without a teaching Priest,</hi> then <hi>no peace at all,</hi>
men will not be under government of them, you shall not
have them, they shall rest in peace, and you shall then
know the want of them.</p>
            <p>5. By giving them over to Satans, and their own
hearts lusts, that seeing they will not serve the Lord, they
shall serve their lusts and their sins, that now the Lord
he hath left off chastising of men, and conscience shall
check no more, prosper, saith the Lord, &amp; go on in thy sin,

The Lord leaves smiting, and sayes, Go on and prosper in
thy sinne: and which is the worst of all, Satan shall so
blinde him and harden him, fill him with pride, passion,
lying, hatred of Gods people, cavilling against the
Lords wayes of grace, slighting of his betters despising
of wholesome counsell from his dearest friends, that he
<hi>knows not that gray hairs are upon him.</hi> And after this when
God hath cast out, in may be the Church doth also, a
most fearfull bondage that the Lord gives such a foul o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
unto.</p>
            <p>There are two reasons of this point, which I collect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the story in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1. Inregard of the righteous Judgement of
God. It's just and equall that he that will not be ruled
by this blessed Lord Jesus, he should be ruled by his
lusts; he that will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot be in subjection to a mercifull
Christ, he should be in bondage to unmercifull men:
this an humbled heart will acknowledge, as these
do here, <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. they acknowledged the Lord to be
righteous: Man being fallen it had been righteous with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102140:14"/>
God to have left all men as the Angels that fell in chains
of darknesse for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But among his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Lord sends the Gospel to proclaim liberty, and
with it sends Christ with his Spirit, to come to the prison-doores
of poor sinners, to give repentance as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins, and now if they will not come out of their
bondage, accept of the Lords liberty, 'tis exceeding
righteous to deal with them as we do with prisone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to die; if the Prince comes to the prison-doores,
and sayes, I am come to give thee thy life, nay and here
is pardon; nay favour, and to pull off thy chaines also,
now if he saies no, I had rather be in prison; every one
will say it is just; and as it was in the year of Jubile he
that would not go free was to be a bondman for ever.
'Tis very righteous to give men their own choyce, 'tis no
wrong to let them have their own will: if indeed the
laws of Christ were <hi>Draco's</hi> lawes, hard and heavy, there
were something to object, but they are most sweet, and
for which of all other blessings men have cause to blesse
him, <hi>Psal. 147. ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Reas. 2:</note> In regard of the mercy or mercifull wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Lord towards his Church and people, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
his peculiar ones, that hereby they keep the closer
to the Lord, set a higher price upon the rules and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord, love his kingdome the more, and the
liberties thereof, and use them better when they have
them again, so here, <hi>that they may know my service, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. How sweet it is, Experience we say is the Mistress
of fools; such is the foolishness of mens hearts that men
are many times never truly taught a truth till they are
taught it by sense, <hi>Prov. 5. 11. and thou mourn at last when
thy flesh is consumed;</hi> tell a man of all the glory of the
Saints, they never understand it till they feel it, tell men
of the woe of their wayes; they will not believe it till
they see it, <hi>Psal. 32. 9. Be not as the horse or mule that hath
no understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and
bridle. Hosea 10. 11. Ephraim is like an Heifer that is
taught.</hi> Like untamed Horses that will cast their rider,
unlesse they be held under and backt, and then they are
gentle, so 'tis here; and truly 'tis long before a man can
learn the sweet of Christs government: hence <hi>Israel</hi> must
be long in <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, and many long miseries, so
that if there be either justice or mercy in the Lord he
will do this, and this point shall be true.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> Hence then see that the greatest liberty and
sweetest liberty is to be under the government of Christ
Jesus, although men do not think so: hence the Lord
tells them here <hi>they shall know my service,</hi> they might
have replyed we do know it. No, till they be in bonds
they know it not, nor cannot learn it. So 'tis now; and
hence let men observe whiles they live loosly, and are
guided by their own wisdome, for their own ends, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own will, at peradventures, at rovers, as
they please, they do think this liberty very sweet; and
'tis better than to be curb'd in: But let the Lord strike an
arrow in the heart of these wilde bucks, that have broke
park and pale, send affliction, and an Iron yoke of sorrow
upon them, or distresse of conscience, if there be any sense
and feeling left, they will bemoan themselves, and say, I
did think my liberty sweet, but now I see 'tis bitter in a
sinfull way: and the Lords way was most sweet, by their
own confession. Hence <hi>Psal. 2. 3. Let us break their
bands, &amp;c.</hi> But Oh now hence learn this truth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
it throughly, that the greatest liberty lies here: do
not in thy judgement think Christian liberty lies, in being
freed from the law as a rule of obedience in respect of the
matter of it to be done, nor in thy practice; but know,
though thou didst meet with a thousand Sorrows with it
and griefs, yet 'tis sweet. Christs <hi>yoke,</hi> (Mat. 11. 30.) <hi>is
easie, and his burthen light.</hi> What? When not a hole to
hide his head in, when a reproach of men, a worm and
no man, when he bore the Fathers wrath? Yes, when he
was meek under it, (<hi>not mine but thy will be done</hi>) it was
then most sweet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 21, 22. To be a servant to
<hi>Solomon</hi> is no bondage, <hi>Psalm, 119. 32. I will run, when
thou shalt inlarge my heart.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> Hence see the reason why the Lord hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
his Churches of their liberty, and his government
over them at sundry times, and hath put them under Iron
yokes, and bonds, and sore pressures, the reason is shewn,
they have either openly or more secretly cast off the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Lord, here hath been the very wound
the aile of all Churches famous and glorious, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.
14. <hi>Oh that they had hearkened, I should then soon have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
their enemies.</hi> The cause is not so hard to find to a
discerning spirit who is privy in any measure to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of God, 1 <hi>King. 9. 8, 9. Solomon</hi> hath a promise that
<hi>the Lords eyes and heart shall be to his people</hi> which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102140:15"/>
him: but if once they slip the Coller, then wo; and
why? <hi>Because they forsook the Lord that brought them out
of Egypt,</hi> they had liberty, but they cast it off.</p>
            <p>What do you think was the moving cause of all
those bloody persecutions, when the blood of dogs was
more precious then of Christian Churches? were not
they godly? yes, I do not doubt of it: but as it was
here, though humbled they must be in bondage, because
they had cast off the government of the Lord Jesus.
And hence in the Apostles time evill times were come,
sad apostasies from the truth, and because it was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were low enough. And hence, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. till the

               </gap> was opened; no crying, as it was with <hi>Israel</hi>
in bondage, no prayer to purpose, and because the Lord
saw they would abuse all liberties if they had them.
And hence in <hi>Constantines</hi> time, when peace came in, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
came with it, and so abused all, that their peace
was their poyson. And hence in the primitive Churches,
they began to cast off the government of the Lord Jesus,
murmurings there were, hence came persecution; but
they were a precious people, and made blessed use of it.
And the Lord couples their chief persecution with
their rest. And 'tis said, <hi>Acts 9. 31. Then had the
Churches rest, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what do you think of the reason of the long reign
of Antichrist, exalting himself above God and all that's
called God, bringing the Church under the heaviest
bondage for body and soul that ever the earth saw?
Men did not love the truth, either speculative to guide
their minds, or practicall to rule their wills; and hence
left to this day.</p>
            <p>What is the cause of Bleeding <hi>Germanies</hi> wo? Oh
poor <hi>Germany!</hi> Whence the Gospell first brake
out in its full strength, that now 'tis a field of
blood, that men in woods like satyres are afraid of
men, and men in Cities glad to eat the intrailes of
Beasts, and sometimes the flesh of their own babes
to preserve their lives. What was there no evill,
but the common condition of the Church to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the crosse? ask them, they cannot tell what
ailes them, but curse the <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Swedes, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102140:15"/>
Oh think of it with sorrow in secret for them that
know it not themselves, they have secretly, I say,
secretly cast off the government of a mercifull
Christ, and hence are under the hand of unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men.</p>
            <p>What is the cause in our native Countrey, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all prayers and tears no diliverance?
truly men do not know it but the Lord sees it, they
know not how to use their liberty.</p>
            <p>And for our selves, what shall I say, I cannot
but blesse God and wonder to see how 'tis with
many, and rejoyce to see many precious holy ones,
to whom <hi>one day in Gods Court is sweeter than a
thousand elsewhere:</hi> but I must professe and cannot
but mourn for others, men that were eminent under
bondage, but never worse then here; as if the
Lord should say, Look here by your eminent ones;
look, and fear, and mourn you Ministers of my
house; here be the people you had thought had
been converted, and that of all others such a one
would never a fallen so; one an opinion takes him,
another a lot, another loose company, another his
lust, another gowes proud, another fierce, another
murmuring: what should I name all? Oh that my

               <hi>Vse</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> Hence see what will become of us that are now
under the government of the Lord; if ever we cast it
off, either inward, or outward, or both. We are not

When old <hi>Israel</hi> the great and numerous tribes of <hi>Israel</hi>

they are by covenant bound to love, either from some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

distasted, because of some reproof in their sin; or by some
opinion, or by some worldly conveniency, or laying out
lots, or restraint of some liberty, &amp;c. or because of some
sin: Now can sit and censure; and I say, when this is

then fare-well deliverance if you be of that spirit; you
shall love one another better if ever the Lord doth that
for you. It hath been the wisdome of some Princes,
when their subjects have been at Civill wars, to call
them forth to a common enemy, and there they can agree.
Oh brethren, there is no sin like this, and yet none so

But found no necessity to come to Christ. Now the Saints
the Lord never leaves them to a spirit of indifferency, but
keeps them in a spirit of necessity. I must come out of
this miserable condition, saith the poor soul, they say not,
flesh is weak, but I must have help. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 110. because
'tis <hi>the day of the Lords power,</hi> they must not rest contented

<hi>Isaiah 63. 7, 8. For he said, Surely they are my

were never subdued. But now the Saints either the

if they do depart from the Lord by reason of the prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

but on the contrary, a child of God being indeed weary
of his sin, and carrying that up and down with him as

at last he comes to get reall conquest over his sin, and
cast it off.</p>
            <p>5. When the Lord in this case lets them alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

<hi>Hosea 4. 17. Ephraim is joyned to his Idols, let him alone,</hi>

            <p>I shall let you know 1. when the inward kingdome
of Christ is set up, and when 'tis razed down, which I
shall do by giving you a briefe view of the nature of it,
and wherein it confists, and so you may the better Judge
of your own hearts in this particular. As Satan hath an
inward kingdome in the hearts of those that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
so the Lord Jesus hath an inward kingdome in the
hearts of all his Saints. <hi>Col. 1. 13. Blessed be god</hi> (saith
the Apostle) <hi>which hath translated us from darknesse to
light, and from the power of Satan into the kingdome of his
dear sonne,</hi> which is very spirituall, little seen, a man
may be under all outward government, and yet naught
here; and therefore attend: this inward kingdome
therefore consists in four things, or when the whole soul
submits it self to God in these four particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. When the whole soul gives entertainment unto the
Lord himself to come into it: for if a people shall say
they are under such a government, and yet will not admit
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102140:18"/>
the Prince himself to come amongst them, but keep him
out of the kingdome, they cast of his government and his
kingdome.</p>
            <p>2. When the whole soul closeth with the whole will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of the Lord; for if a people shall receive a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>3. When the whole soul thus closeth with the will of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Christ by vertue of the power and Spirit of Christ: for
if a people submit to the will of their Prince, but 'tis not
by vertue of his authority over them, command of them,
and helps he hath given them for that end, but it is by
reason of some forreign power, that underhand encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth
them to yield, this is poor subjection.</p>
            <p>4. When the soul thus submits to Christ's will for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Lords ends, denying its own wisedome or will, and is
led by the Lord to his end: for if a people shall submit
to their Prince, but 'tis to set up other princes, he is cast
off from his throne. When a man shall serve God, and
be under his government because it is profitable or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
it suits his own end, this is poor service in the
Lords account.</p>
            <p>1. I say then, the soul is under the inward kingdome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
or goverment of Christ, when the whole soul gives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
to the <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> the Lord himself with
all his traine, in and by the Gospell of grace, the royall
sword and Scepter of Christs kingdome; for when Christ
himself is thus received, the kingdome of God is come to
that soul, and entred into that heart; and hence <hi>Mark</hi>
1. 14, 15. the Gospel is called <hi>the Gospel of the kingdome,</hi>
and when <hi>Iohn</hi> and Christ preached <hi>beleive and repent, for
the kingdome of God is at hand.</hi> Under which word is
comprehended much, but principally Christ Jesus ready
to enter the souls of his people; and hence <hi>Iohn</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ. Now 'tis said, those that were effectually
wrought upon, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 12 that <hi>the kingdome of heaven
did suffer violence, and the violent take it by force;</hi> so that
the kingdome of God is come into the hearts of all the
elect of God, when the soul uses a holy violence, and the
Lord do's draw the heart to an entertainment of the Lord
himself; Many difficulties there be between them and
Christ, and yet they break through all.</p>
            <p>This is the condition of all men by nature, they are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102140:19"/>
strangers to Christ, and live without God and Christ in
the world, and Christ from them, and so Satan takes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
and rules them, and so men are under the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of darknesse, so that the devill himself possesses eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
naturall man, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>he worketh in the
children of disobedience,</hi> to run on so, and remain so. Now
the Gospel of the kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the meanes to advance

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf;
indeed it offers pardon, grace, mercy, life, glory, but
all these are in Christ himself, and we possesse them by
possessing and receiving of Christ himself; as a poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
hath all the wealth of the man by entertaining of the
man. So that the Gospell firstly and primarily offers
Christ himself, and faith doth pitch on Christ himself, and
doth <hi>open those everlasting doores, that the King of glory
may come in,</hi> John 1. 12. 'tis said, <hi>So many as received him,
he gave power to be the sons of God,</hi> 1 John 5. 12. <hi>He that
hath the Son, hath Life;</hi> so that now let a man refuse or
reject the Lord himself as he is thus offered in the Gospel,
he does refuse the kingdome of the Lord, and does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to be under the power of the Lord. True, it may be
said the kingdom of God hath been nigh to him, when
Christ is offered in the Gospell, and God sayes as it were
nothing shall please me so mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h as this, if thou dost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

to them;</hi> then Christ comes into the soul when the whole
soul takes the Lord for himself, Christ, and all that Christ
hath, Christ in a pardon, and Christ in a promise: at that
very day the Lord gave the heart to receive him, then is
the kingdome of God come in that heart, and with him
all, life, peace, joy, and glory, God, Spirit, and all.</p>
            <p>Now the whole soul receives him, when 1. The mind
sees him in the glory of his grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that though it had low,
mean thoughts of Christ before, for which it mourns; yet
the rising of this glorious Sun upon him, <hi>he esteems all
things losse for him that he may win Christ, and be found in
Christ, I in him, and He in me,</hi> in Vocation: <hi>and not having
my own righteousnesse,</hi> in justification: And <hi>to feel the life of
Christ and death also,</hi> in sanctification: And <hi>to attain to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the dead,</hi> in glorification: and now nothing is
dear to the soul but Christ.—2. When the will, after
the soul hath had some hopes the Lord may look towards
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102140:19"/>
it in his grace, and having had many heart-breaking tears
before the Lord, the Lord is now pleased by the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the Gospell to give the will power not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and entertain the Lord, but gladly to receive him.
The soul wonders that ever the Lord should bow down
to him, and offer mercy to him; and when as together
with this, by the sweet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>avour of his Grace that he doth

most dear imbracings into his soul, that now there is none

thee, to give himself, the glory of Angels, the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and that is all, and the Lord never gave thee a heart to
close with Christ himself, it's a strange thing to thee, that
which is the main thing, the Diamond in the Ring of the
Gospel; thou art yet far enough off from the kingdome of
God; I dare not say, not think for all the world, that ever
the kingdome of God came to thy heart. Again, if you
have received Christ, but not with thy whole soul: that
now the offer, promises, blood, life, grace, glory in the
Gospell, are grown common things to thee; that the
Lord never sent thee home wondering at the glory of
Gods grace to a poor wretch, never yet said'st, <hi>Blessed is

hath begun to reveal himself to thy soul, when he gives
thee a heart to mourn for thy standing our against him,
but this never came to thy soul.</p>
            <p>Certainly, here is the wound of many men: The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
of God never hath its proper effect, till the Lord
help thee to give thy whole heart thus to a Saviour, to a
God, to the Prince of peace; and till this is done, the
Gospel is ineffectuall, it doth nothing. It was a sweet
prayer of him, Make thy Son dear, very dear, exceeding
dear, only dear and precious, or not at all; If thou hadst
a thousand hearts, it was too little for Christ to love him,
and do'st grudge him one? when thou hast imparted thy
heart, and esteem to thy lusts and creature, do'st thou love
the Lord with part of thy heart? but a vile lust, a poor
creature must have a share, and the remnant will serve
Christ, is he not the onely pearl of thy heart, to give him
daily communion, know this thou art a stranger to. <hi>Hear ye
despisers, and wonder, and perish, God will work a work in
your dayes.</hi> What is that? the infinit God cannot express
as it were the wrath that shall come against such a soul,
nor I cannot expresse the wrath that shall come upon
such a despiser of the Lord Jesus. Give him all thy heart
or none: if thou hast the Lord, thou hast his whole heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if he had a thousand lives, he would have laid them all
down for thee. He poured out his bloud for every one of
his, but for the present thou art out of the Kingdom of
God to this day.</p>

of Christ, having thus received him, for if a Prince be

that he makes, though never so good, but what they list,
the Kingdome is cast off; For, beloved, there is a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

do you make him a King, and ye will make lawes for
Christ, and you will rule Christ, and his will shall not

in the Apostles time, 1 <hi>Ioh. 1. 6. If we say we have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

            <p>Now when the soul submits to both, then Christ rules

and the like; men have high thoughts against the
Lord Jesus, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 5. Casting down imaginations, and
every high thought that exalteth it self against the knowledge

(not unlesse it be out of fear) subject to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like <hi>Balaam</hi>
that had no love to Gods command, but onely was acted
by fear and constraint; now when the soul continues thus,
it casts off Christs Kingdom; but if the whole soul <hi>first</hi>
comes to the light, though it sees little, sets the whole will
of Christ before it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 22. saith <hi>David; I have kept
the wayes of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from
my God:</hi> and though it hath had many quarrellings against
the truth of God, yet now it hath not, nor dares not, but
sayes, Lord, teach me; the Lord gives them hearts to lye
down at the feet of any man that shall shew them any
thing that is amisse in them, and they say with <hi>David,
Lord, search me, and try me:</hi> I have many crooked wayes,
and therefore, good Lord, find them out, and therefore
come to the Lord for that end; and though there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them that is desperately contrary to the good wil
of God, yet there is an inward man that does delight in
the law of God, and when the Lord is pleased to give
them an heart to submit to the will of God; Oh the soul
doth wonder at the Lord, that the Lord should shew him
any thing, and help him against temptations; and though
there be a great deal of wearinesse in the wayes of God,
yet there is a spirit within him, that it is indeed heaven it
self to him to be in the ordinances of God; now ye stoop
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102140:21"/>
to the directing will of Christ, when this is thy way,
though thou goest oft out of it, yet comest in it again, as
sin is a wicked mans way, although he goeth a thousand
times out of it.</p>
            <p>Now for the other, the correcting will of Christ; The L. hath
strong trials: Now here subjection to Christ is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as well as to the directing will of Christ; then the
soul submits to this will when the mind objects not, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
not God with folly, as <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 18. <hi>It is the Lord,
let him do what seemeth him good;</hi> And likewise the will,
though it hath had many sad bouts, yet this is his frame in
the Conclusion, that the wil of Christ is better than every
thing else, the wil of Christ is alone sweet to him. <hi>Isa.</hi> 38.
saith <hi>Hezekiah, Good is the wil of the Lord,</hi> &amp; so <hi>Lam. 3. It's
good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth, and to turn his
cheeks to him that smites him;</hi> Nay when there is spiritual
evils on the soul, as was on Christ himself, spiritual deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nothing but bitterness &amp; sorrow; yet the soul saith,
as Christ did, <hi>Not my will, but thine be done, Father save
me from this hour, yet Father glorifie thy self,</hi> and so the
soul does humbly submit it self to the Lord; though the
Lord should never pitty it, yet it will lye down at the feet
of the Lord, now is Gods Kingdome come.</p>
            <p>But if the soul wil have Christ, and yet cast off the wil
of Christ, 1. Either in his judgement, that the law of
God as given by Christ, should be no rule to a Christian;
suppose you were in <hi>England,</hi> and were there prest to
bow before an Altar, or Image; what shall lead you, if
that Gods will and law must not be your rule? The Lord
will one day make you know his blessed will, in that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Christ here; and so when men in their practice shall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
against any of Gods truths, and are loath to see it, or
if they do, yet not love dearly every truth of God, but
it's a burden to them; especially if it crosse their own ends
and gain, they will not see it to be a truth, lest they should
be convinced, and turn ro the rule of it; if the will and
ordinances of Christ be a burden to a man, and a man is
not weary of his wearinesse, but weary of them all the

while: Art thou under the government of Christ? If a
man forsaken of God, led by his own counsels, be under
the Kingdom of Christ, then thou art; so long as there is
credit for the truth, so long it is entertained; but now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it be costly, rhat it should bring beggery &amp; affliction

I am in Gods way, canst lye dowu and subscribe to the
equity of Christs proceedings with thee, though he should
never shew favour to thee; if it be not thus, I dare not
say thou art under the Kingdome of Christ. And so for the
correcting wil of Christ, many sad afflictions the Lord tries
thee withall, the Lord tries men marvellously; when thou
art under the hand of the Lord, those very things that
should make men cry to heaven, and wean thee from the
world, those very things do harden thee, and make thee
grudge &amp; repine. The L. be merciful to thee, if this be thy
frame, the Kingdom of Christ never came into that heart;
you are begging for mercy; &amp; the Lord sayes, you mercy?
you have abused it; no saith the Lord, Go to your lust that
have despised the day of grace, &amp; so now you cast off the
Lord, because the Lord will not give you mercy when you
would have it. Will you now quarrel with the Lord? no,
down proud heart; pray still, and mourn still, and
turn to the Lord; and say, Lord do with me what thou
wilt, I am clay in thine hand, thou may'st make me a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell

such a one as is above the Lord and his will, is not under
the Lord, therefore submit thy self to the good will of
Christ.</p>
            <p>3. When the soul doth thus submit to the wil of Christ,
by vertue of the power and Spirit of Christ, <hi>i.e.</hi> when the
soul doth not submit by vertue of its own power,
strength or ability, for this is forreign power; But as it
doth seek to submit to the will of Christ, so it would have
Christ himself act it and rule it, and so inable it to submit
there unto; Now is the Kingdome of God come neer to
that heart. And herein Christs Kingdom is different from

that 'tis impossible man of himself should submit to
it: But the Lord doth it for this end, that the soul should
then come to Christ in its need, that he would do <hi>all the
good pleasure of his will,</hi> and now the Lord himself reigns,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102140:22"/>
and that gloriously, <hi>Ro. 8. 1, 2. For the law of the Spirit of
life which is in Christ Iesus, hath made me free from the
law of sin and death,</hi> Acts 5, 31. <hi>A Prince an Saviour, for
to give repentance and remission of sins.</hi> It is part of his
Princely power for to give remission of sins; both in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from sin, and to God, and all the wayes of God,
and now you exalt him when he is thus set up: 1 <hi>Cor. 4.
20. The Kingdome of God is not in word, but in power.</hi> The
power of Christ Jesus is come into thy soul, and the soul
is under the Kingdome of the Lord Jesus, when it doth
lye under the mighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ,
2 <hi>Thess. 1, 11, 12. We pray always for you, that the Lord would
work and fulfill the good pleasure of his will, and the work
of faith in power, that Christ may be glorified.</hi> Yea, then
is Christ glorified, when God omnipotent reigns over sin
and unbelief; &amp; when the Lord doth this, not only the
Kingdome of God is now come, but the Kingdome of
Christ in glory is come; there is many a poor soul thinks
Christ rules him not, because he cannot do this nor that,
because he finds his heart unable, &amp; unwilling for to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the will of Christ; I find no strength at all, saith
the soul, and I go to Christ and find not strength con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed,
and now he thinks he is not under the Kingdom of
Christ. I answer, that is not the question; but hath the
Lord made thee willing in the day of his power? when
the soul doth lye under the power of the Lord Jesus
Christ, when the soul doth lye like wax before the Lord
Jesus; when the soul saith, Lord there was never any
change of my nature; the good Lord change it, and if
there be any change, the good Lord increase and stir up
the graces of thy Spirit in my soul, and do thou lead me
and guide me. Brethren, the Kingdome of Christ is
come to this soul: <hi>Iohn 5. 40. You will not come to me for
life;</hi> He doth not say, you do not quicken your selves, or
ye cannot come to me, but will not; here is their wound,
they will not come to Christ for life, <hi>Rom. 6. 19. As yee
have yeelded your members serva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s to sin and Satan, so now
yeeld up your selves servants to righteousnesse and to holinesse,</hi>
Psal. 119. 5, 6. <hi>Thou hast commanded that we should keep
thy precepts continually. Oh that my heart were directed to
keep thy precepts continually! Oh that my heart were directed
to keep thy statutes!</hi> When a Christian is grapling with
his own heart, ye will never be able to overcome the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subduednesse
thereof; but when ye bring them to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102140:22"/>
Lord Jesus Christ, that he would take a course with
them. 1. Now ye please Christ. 2. Ye take a sure
course to have the will of God done, he being in office
for that end; for <hi>Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and
Saviour to Israel:</hi> When the soul doth look up to the Lord
Jesus, and lye under the power and Spirit of the Lord
Jesus. 3. You now make the yoke of Christ sweet, and
his name glorious; nothing glorifies Christ so much as
this, when Jesus doth work in a Christian, now the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ is come to the soul, and that in power.</p>
            <p>But now when men will not submit thus far to Christ:
1. They can do nothing, but will not come to him, on
whom God hath laid salvation; you say, you cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
nor edifie by the Sermons ye hear, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
part with your lusts. Ay, but now this is thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
thou wilt not go to a Saviour that he may
teach thee and help thee, when men will not have the
Lord Jesus to reign over them: or 2. If men do come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they will not come to him where he may be found; but
say, I can do nothing; Christ must do all, and so neglect
the means wherein he will be found: or 3. Will submit
and come in means to him, but not then at the speciall
time when He is to be sought, and may be found, <hi>viz.</hi> in
time of temptation. But then forget and forsake him,
and cry not <hi>Hosanna:</hi> Lord, now save, now help me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this lust: When temptation comes, when passion
and pride come, do you now go to Jesus Christ? When
the world begins to draw thy heart away; dost thou say
thus, Lord I have prayed this day against this sin, and
Lord I have no strength against it, now Lord help me?
but here is the misery of the soul, it doth not go to Christ,
and by this means live in complaints all their life-time.
4. If lastly any thing be to be done, they will do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
as <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1. 12. Not but that a Christian should
put forth himself, a Christian is not a dead-hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
at all times, but the grace of God which comes from
Christ, doth act the soul in a continuall dependance on
Christ; and where Christ acts not, there Satan doth. Now
I say the Kingdome of God is come, when the soul doth
thus submit to the stream of the bles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed Spirit of the
Lord, that the Lord may guide it. Oh beloved, here is
the skill, that poseth the Angels how to tell you; so to
yield your selves to Christ, as that Christ may come, so to
abide in the stock, that all your fruit may be from him:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102140:23"/>
So to lye under the Lord, as that the stream of the Spirit
of life may fall on thee; so to be implanted in the Lord,
as to fetch life from him, and bring forth fruit to him. But
try this course, submit to the will of the Lord Jesus, be
nothing in thy own eyes; and if the Lord do give thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, blesse the Lord for it; if any strength against
thy sin, be vile in thy own eyes, and try and see if ye find
not the Kingdome of God, the glory of Heaven come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy soul. Oh the light, life, prayers you might have,
the heavenly conference ye will have together, that it
would do a mans heart good to be with such a Christian;
that those that are with you might say, Verily God is in
this man; verily there is joy in heaven when the Saints
keep in this frame.</p>
            <p>4. When the soul yields thus to the will of Christ for
Christs ends; for such is the subtill wretchednesse of
mens hearts, that men would have Christ glorifie himself,
that he may glorifie and honour them; like <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> that would give any money for Apostolicall gifts,
that he might be some body that way also: Now if a
man shall submit, go to Christ for gifts and parts, that's
to set up another King, to advance a mans self; and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
sin and the devill, and Christ must be made a servant
for this end; He is now no King: like a Rebell that is
not content, that thousands of the Kings Subjects should
serve him, but he will have the Prince serve him a so:
Every man will say, this doth utterly overthrow the
Kingdom of such a Prince. When a man shall secretly
fight against the Lord, and be for himself; and for the
devil and sin within; When a man shall make all the
creatures serve him, the souldiers of his army; meat,
drink, and outward comforts, this is a marvellous thing;
Ay, but when a man shall make Jesus Christ, &amp; God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and profession of Christ, make these to serve him, to
raise up his name, this the Lord takes very ill.</p>
            <p>Only this I would adde; when the soul doth look at
Christ with a single eye, that Christ is sweet and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and lyes under the blessed Spirit of Christ for that
end; and now looks up to Christ, that he may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to him with a single eye, that the name of Christ
may be glorified by life, and death: true it is, self will
be in every duty, and so is contrary to the Lord in all,
and not for the Lord. Yet though it be thus, there
is another thing in the soul that is wholly for God and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102140:23"/>
Christ: and hence seeks that he may do his work; his
heart loves him, and so seeks him; and he begs it with
many tears. Oh that my children might serve and love
this God; nay, that all the world might see, and blesse,
and admire this God, and the Lord inlargeth his heart
herein, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. 19. and truly now the Kingdom of God
is come to thy soul, <hi>Rom. 5. 17. As sin</hi> and Satan do <hi>reign
by death: So Iesus Christ doth reign by life to eternall life.</hi>
Matth. 25. 14. He is the true Subject that improves his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
for the King: Christ will subdue all his to himself,
<hi>Psal. 66. 3. Through the greatnesse of thy power, shall thine
enemies submit themselves to thee.</hi> Rom. 14. 17. <hi>For the
Kingdome of God is not in meat and drink; but in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.</hi> When a
man shall be picking fault with things, &amp; this and that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
him; get ye gone, the Kingdom of God consists not
in that. But when the soul do's go to the Lord, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his peace with God, and love to the people of God,
and joy in the holy Ghost, here is the Kingdome of God.
<hi>He that serves Christ in these things,</hi> the Kingdome of God
is come into his soul.</p>
            <p>He that thus submits to the Lord Christ, he must first
be a man weary of his own counsels, and must loath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
When the Lord hath wearied a man of his own
wayes; he sayes, What am I, that the Lord should shew me
any mercy? And when the Lord calls him to any service;
Lord, What am I, that I should now pray to thee?
Bless the Lord, when the Lord doth keep thy heart in this
frame; but now when men will honour Christ, and yet
<hi>Saul</hi>-like have Christ honour them: Many poor creatures
they think it a credit to be in Church-fellowship, and
they wil seek to know Christ, that they may attain Church
fellowship, and have honour, but know it, till the Lord do
pull down thy base ends, and make thee loath thy self,
and so to submit to his blessed will; truly till then, the
Kingdome of God is not come to thy soul: Think of
these things, for if the Kingdome of God be in our hearts,
then look for good dayes; Brethren, let <hi>New-England</hi> be
confident of it: but if this be gone from the soules and
hearts of men and women in their severall families and
places; though they may have the outward Kingdome of
Christ, yet the inward Kingdome being not set up; I say
no more but what he said, Go to <hi>Palestina</hi> and <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
Certainly, if they had not cast off the Lords government,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102140:24"/>
they had never seen those lamentable dayes; they
had outward Ordinances; Oh, but here was the thing; the
inward Kingdome of the Lord Jesus Christ, and subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the will of the Lord Jesus, and to be for the
Lord Jesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this the Lord saw, was not in them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord hath left them to be lamentable spectacles.
Therefore dear brethren. I do beseech you, pray and beg
for this Kingdome: Thou sayest, I fall short of this:
Know this Kingdome of God is at first like a grain of
Mustard-seed, some little lying under the will of Christ;
if it be in truth, blessed be God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or it; The Kingdome of
God is come, and the soul doth weep and mourn after
the Lord, that the Lord would bring every thought into
subjection.</p>
            <p>Know it, the Kingdome of God is come to thy soul;
and know it, thou hast Jesus Christ at the right hand of
God the Father, interceding for thee; therfore, go home
and blesse the Lord, and wonder at his grace, that hath
translated thee from the Kingdome of darknesse, to the
Kingdome of his dear Son: If the Lord hath let thee finde
the beginning of these things in truth, go home, and
blesse the Lord for it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Try when the externall Kingdome of Christ in his
Church is cast off, for we told you, this was Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
'Tis called the Kingdome of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 1.
And 'tis it which the Lord gives up at the last day to
God the Father: and hence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 12. the members
thereof are <hi>The Children of the Kingdome;</hi> and hence we
read of the rulers and governours of it; and the keys, not
only of doctrine; but of power and jurisdiction committed
by Christ Jesus to it, punctually exprest in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now we know, in the Church there is a three-fold
power of Christ in Government: 1. The supreme Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall
absolute power of Christ, in and by his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
2. There is some derivative power of the Church
from Christ joyntly together. 3. There is a Ministeriall
power of the officers of the Church it self. Hence the
Kingdome of Christ is overthrown when these three are,
when this three-fold cord is broken by the sons of men;
and if whole <hi>America</hi> cast off these, or any of these; then
they fall to bondage; and if particular persons in Churches
do, the Lord will do the like to them much more:
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 4, 5. When <hi>Solomon</hi> had been praying much,
the Lord tells him; <hi>If he would walk before him as</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102140:24"/>
               <hi>his father had done, to keep his statutes and obey his
commandments; then he would be a God, making good his
promise; but if not, then the Lord would cast off him and
that place.</hi> So Zach. 14. 17. <hi>And it shall be, that who so
will not come up of all the families of the Earth, to worship the
King the Lord of Hosts; even upon them shall be no rain.</hi> The
Lord is quick in his judgements, and will spare none.</p>
            <p>1. There is a supreme power of Jesus Christ in his
Church and Ordinances thereof, <hi>Isa. 9. 6. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is on his shoulders;</hi> it is true this power is on others
also, but he is the main, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. Moses <hi>was only a servant
in his House,</hi> Christ <hi>as a Son.</hi> The guidance of all things
in the Church doth lye chiefly on him, or else it would
never be carried along. Christ is a Son, and that in his
own House; into whose hands the supreme power of gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and ordering all things in the Church of God is put;
the experience of Gods Saints and People doth find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
power, which shewes that the Lord Jesus hath, and
doth exercise a mighty power in the ordinances of his
Worship; the supreme and kingly power which he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
in the hearts of his people.</p>
            <p>Now cast off this kingly power, the Lord himself is cast
off; I speak not immediately as in the internall Kingdom,
but mediately. And for this, the Lord will bring into
bondage, <hi>Luk. 19. 17. Those mine enemies,</hi> saith Christ:
<hi>which would not that I should reign over them; bring them
hither, that I may slay them;</hi> which is meant of the Lords
external administration by his servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quest.</note> When is this done?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> When men impenitently break Covenant
made with the Lord. Especially in his Ordinances of
cleaving and submitting to him therein, and remain so
with impenitency.</p>
            <p>This is the main and first Original of all the rest. Now
it is manifest, the power of Christ Jesus, the supreme
power of Christ is cast off; for a man do's professe
by this, that not the will of Christ, but his own will shall
rule him; Christ shall not be Lord, but as they said, <hi>Ier.
2. 31. We are Lords, we will come no more at thee.</hi> When
the League and Covenant between Prince and People is
broke, then he is cast off from being King; this is certain,
the Lord never did receive any people to himself from
the beginning of the world to this day, but he hath done
it by some Covenant: Nor never any people took the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102140:25"/>
Lord to be their God, but by some Covenant, they bound
themselves to the Lord. Whereby they were either
made his people, or continued to be his people, and he
their God; but I cannot now stand to clear this. Now
look, as when the Lord breaks his Covenant, he casts
them off from being his people; (though this he never
doth to the Elect) So when people break Covenant with
him, they cast him off as much as in them lies, from being
their God; they do as much as in them lyes, make the
Lord to be no God. You shall see therefore, <hi>Hosea 10. 3.
They say, we have no King; because we feared not the Lord.</hi>
It is the speech of Conscience, and that at a sad time,
wherein they did not fear the Lord; <hi>They have spoken
words, swearing falsly, and breaking the Covenant.</hi> In their
time of Covenanting with the Lord, there seemed to be
much sorrow and humiliation; yet in these very Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
<hi>Hemlock did spring up,</hi> and hence captivity came.
Many times the Covenants that are made, there is such
outward seeming reality, that not only men, but the
Lord speaking after the manner of men, He thinks cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
these Promises, these Covenants will never be
broke; yet they are broken, <hi>Isa. 65. 8, 9, 10. I said,
surely,</hi> saith the Lord; <hi>This is a people that will not lie.</hi>
Such profession, and such acknowledgements, &amp;c. so it is
said; <hi>In all their afflictions, he was afflicted, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of his presence did redeem them: But</hi> afterward, <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled,
and vexed his holy Spirit:</hi> They cast off the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Lord, they would not be under the
bonds of the Lord, and <hi>so he was turned to be their enemy;</hi>
this is that which brings captivity and bondage, <hi>Ierm. 2.
14, 15, &amp;c. Is Israel a servant saith the Lord?</hi> ye shall see
the reason why he was so; <hi>I have broken their iron yoke,</hi>
saith the Lord, <hi>and I have burst thy bonds, and I have
planted thee a nohle Vine; yet hast thou degenerated:</hi> and this
is that which doth make them vassals or slaves. And in
truth you never see Churches laid desolate; but when
that time comes, men shall see, and shall professe it. When
other Nations shall ask; Why hath the the Lord dealt
thus with his people? The answer shall be clear; They
have broken the Covenant of the Lord. When many
miseries come upon particular persons, what is the cause
of it? then remember the Covenant thou hast broken with
the Lord. <hi>Isa. 24. 5, 6. They have transgressed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

speaking of the whole earth; <hi>And they have changed their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102140:25"/>
Ordinances, and broken the everlasting Covenant.</hi> A people
that might have had everlasting mercy, they would not
submit to the Lord, they have broken this everlasting
Covenant of the Lord: Now what followes? <hi>The earth
is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;</hi> and hence heavy
things that are there written, shal befall the whole world;
It is a sin that defiles the earth men tread on, and the
houses men inhabite in, for it is a sin against most light:
They which make Covenants have a great deal of light,
and also most will. And that do's aggravate a sin; when
the whole heart, as it were, do's give up it self to a lust,
and breaks hereby all bonds. And it is a sin that men
might avoid, if they would be watchfull against: For it is
a sinfull thing to make a Covenant of impossible things,
therefore it lyes heavy on the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n that do's destroy the Law of the Lord:
this sin it do's destroy the very will of Christ. Had'st thou
never been bound in Covenant; hadst thou laid by this
Covenant, the wil of God had been kept whole. As cords
not used, are kept whole; but when broke, are utterly spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
When a man do's bind himself by a Covenant to the
Lord, and then break it; he do's as much as in him lyes,
to destroy the Lord from being King.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Saints and people of God may be said in
some case to break Covenant, but yet they never impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
break Covenant with the Lord; they may break

Lord came to them, and they were under grievous sad
bondage; saith he to them from the Lord: <hi>I have brought
you up out of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and I have broke your bonds;
and I have said, I would never break Covenant with you:
&amp; I said, you should make no League with the</hi> Canaanites, <hi>but
ye have not obeyed my voyce; why have ye done this?</hi> And all
the people heard this; and it is said, <hi>All the people wept.</hi>
Doubtlesse some were sincere, though happily many were
full of hypocrisie; and so the sincere heart laments it, and
renewes his Covenant. The poor soul hath nothing to
say many times, though the Lord should bring never so
much misery on it; yet the soul stands weeping before the
Lord, that it hath broke the Covenant of the Lord, and
made void the Covenant of the Lord; yet the Saints they
never break it wholly, they never depart wholly from
the Lord.</p>
            <p>

Now when a people shall impenitently break Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
as hath been said: that men can study arguments,
how to nullifie Church covenant; nay, worse when in
Covenant, then ever before; and the businesse is, they are
loath to be in bonds; when men shall grudge the truth of
the Lord, others if their judgements be not set against
it; yet notwithstanding, in deed and practice, they live as
if they had never been in Covenant. Once they were a
pleasant plant; but now they are degenerated, as the
Lord doth there complain. Beloved, when it is thus, the
League between the Prince of peace, and the Church is
broke; they do as much as in them lies, seek to cast off
the Lord from ruling over them.</p>

Christ, by humane ordinances and inventions of men;
let any set up new ordinances, new inventions of men,
they set up new gods; and they do as Subjects set up new
Kings, which is indeed to pull down him that was, and
so they do to Jesus Christ; they do deny the supreme
headship of Christ, and his authority over them; though
it may seem a small thing, yet thus it is: And hence ye
shall observe <hi>Ieroboams</hi> calves, though they worshipped
the same God which was at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> varying only in
circumstance; yet the Lord professeth, that <hi>they had set

bondage. And hence, <hi>Col. 2. 18, 16. Let no man he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile

and ruling his people; it is to deny the headship of Christ:
and likewise to say, that Christ hath not appointed for
his people sufficient means for that end; is to say, that
Christ is not a sufficient means to rule his people; and he
that shall say, Jesus Christ is not a sufficient means, he
do's deny the headship of Christ. Now to set up any
inventions of men in the worship of God, to be a means
to carry the heart to God, is to say, that Jesus Christ hath
not appointed sufficient means for that end; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102140:26"/>
he is not a sufficient means of guiding, and saving,
and ruling his people. Nay, this I will adde; let there
be any invention added to the worship of God, that's
meerly the will of man; nothing else, but only this I
would have ye do it; they are such things as do neither
make a man better nor worse, but only use them, and ye
are commanded to use them, and nothing but the will of
man: This is to set up a new Christ, and to pull down
the power of Christ Jesus, to submit herein to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of man, meerly because of the will of man, that there
is nothing seen but his will: There is (it may be) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good nor hurt in it; It is to make that man a God
and Christ; it is peculiar to Christ to do it, and this do's
pull down the Lord Jesus Christ from his throne; when
there is adding to the worship of the Lord. I need not
I suppose speak any thing this way; Only remember to
be watchfull against this; when the Lord doth send ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
this way into Churches, or into any place; be
watchfull against new inventions of men to be added or
made, they are very sinfull; and if ye ask me when we
shall look for such times; I need not go far from my

            <p>It is said, that <hi>Rehoboam and all the people walked in the
worship of the Lord three years;</hi> but in one year, <hi>Rehoboam</hi>
and all the people fell off from the worship of the Lord.
O therefore take heed of this, when the tentation comes:
1. When the Lord bows the hearts of those in authority,
men of eminency to fall this way, then multitudes follow;
as, <hi>vers. 1. Rehoboam</hi> sinned and <hi>Israel</hi> with him. 2. When
persecution ariseth for the truth, <hi>Gal. 5. 12. They must be
circumcised to avoid persecution,</hi> 3. When mens hearts are
surfetted with the Ordinances of God, and weary of them;
when the Ordinances of the Lord Jesus Christ, men find
no benefit by them, the heart of man will then be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out after some thing of its own; then we must look
for Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists, and this curiosity,
and the other nicity; then a conceit and imaginary picture
of a mans own, is more beautifull than all Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
besides, and all Religion is placed there; it may be in
extending too far any Ordinance it self, though it may
seem little at first; yet when it is thus, then look for evil
times.</p>
            <p>3. When as a people seek to abolish and destroy any
Ordinance of Christ, but especially if on this ground;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102140:27"/>
either because of some outward evill they bring with
them, in the fruition of them, or hope of some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
good they shall receive by casting them off, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of no good they reap by the enjoyment of them:
Whensoever ye see this, that they are cast off on this
ground, then look for bondage; for it will come on
whole Countreys in generall, and on particular persons:
For Jesus Christ is in his Ordinances, and his Throne
is not only in Heaven among the Angels; but, <hi>Isa.
9. 7, 8, 9. He sits on the throne of David,</hi> among his
Church and People; and pull these down, you pull
down Christs throne, <hi>the Prince of peace;</hi> when ye pull
down his Ordinances. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 19. there were many
that did seem to be for Christ, and yet against Christ,
this is one sign by which he notes them; <hi>They went out
from us, for they were not of us: that it might be made
manifest they were not of us.</hi> Now I say, when men
shall pull down the Ordinances of Christ, and withdraw
themselves from the communion of Saints; and when it
is for one of these ends, in regard of some outward evill
that the Ordinances do bring with them, or some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
good they shall get by casting them off; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
look for bondage. As a Prince that hath one near
him, he may attempt change of things in State; but
when he is set a work by a forein State, and is a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner
to the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Spaniard:</hi> Now he is reall to root
out the Prince; and this provokes.</p>
            <p>So here many times a Christian, he may in conscience
speak against some of the wayes of the Lord, and this
may be the condition of the Saints and people of God,
and they may speak it in conscience; and this may be
tolerated, when it is for want of light; nay, they may

when now it is for this reason, though he hath indeed
his colours for it; you shall, saith Satan, have this gain,
and this ease, and these conveniences; and what do you
do with Ordinances? and now a man begins to find out
arguments; and saith, Satan, If ye attend to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ordinances, here be these miseries, therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with some of Gods Ordinances at least. Oh, brethren,
when it is thus, that there is this secret pension from the
world, that now had the Lord Jesus, the honours of the
world attending on them, then they could make much of
them; but because they come with poverty, therefore they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102140:27"/>
can plot and speak against them, and in time come to cast
off the Ordinances of the Lord Jesus; It is certain the
Lord hath bondage for such soules, and you will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find this true one day. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14, 15. The people,
they say; <hi>What profit is it that we have served the Lord,
and that we have walked mournfully before him?</hi> and hence,
they forsook the Lord; Hence, <hi>Chap.</hi>

            <p>The Ordinances of the Lord were too costly for you.
<hi>Mark 12. 9. 8. The Lord hath his Vine-yard, he lets it out

Here is this gain to be without them, and therefore to
cast off Christ: <hi>What will the Lord do to these husband-men?
he will take away his Vine-yard frrom them, &amp;c.</hi>

               </gap>sse; and he tels them, <hi>If they

because he came not with pomp, but only with his crosse,
this is the great reason, why to this day the Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Crosse came with Christ, that's the cause of it: So
when men shall look for great things from the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Christ, and when they come to enjoy them, they
meet with nothing else but Christ and his Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

disappointments, and desertions; when they meet with

King, and <hi>Cesar</hi> is our King: and if we take this man to
be our King; the <hi>Romanes</hi> will ruine us.</p>
            <p>I know it is a hard trial for a man to be put to such a
strait; for the Lord to advance the price of his Ordinances
at that high rate, that all must be parted with for the
enjoyment of them. But yet notwithstanding, he is for
ever unworthy to have the Lord Jesus to rule him,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102140:28"/>
that shall therefore make him a King as they did, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.
He was their Cook, therefore they made him King.
Therefore this I say, take heed of disputing against, or
denying, or nullifying, not only outwardly, but in thy
very heart secretly, any of Gods Ordinances: for that
the Lord complains of his people, that <hi>their hearts went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their wickednesse.</hi> Oh take heed of doing thus against
any one of Gods Ordinances, because straits do attend on
them: It was the speech of <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 119. <hi>Thy law is
pure, therefore thy servant loveth it.</hi> Suppose thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
never get any good by any of Gods Ordinances; yet
<hi>thy law is pure,</hi> the fault is in thy own heart; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Lord he will remember, as there he speaketh,
<hi>Ierem. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. I remember the love of thine espousals, when
thou didst follow me in a land of barrennesse, in a land where
there was no water.</hi> Thy life shall be precious to the
Lord, that shall follow the Lord in all afflictions; yet thy
heatt doth cleave to the Lord, and follow the Lord in all
his Ordinances; therefore this is that I would say, there
are many wants now in the countrey; But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
let the people of God get neer to Christ; <hi>speak
often one to another,</hi> and find out wayes and means to
pay your debts, and lye down at the feet of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and be content if the Lord will have it so, to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
be content thus; and though thou dost not find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
benefit from the Ordinance of the Lord as yet, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
loath thy own heart, but love them; yet
seek after the Lord, and look to the Lord in them.
And this is certain, the Lord hath blessings for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
not only in this life, but as he there speaketh to his
Disciples, when they say to him, <hi>Lord, what shall we have?</hi>
saith the Lord to them; <hi>You that have followed me, you
shall sit on thrones.</hi> But take heed of this, if once ye come
to slight Ordinances, and cast off Ordinances, because of
these straits and wants, and so forth: And what are your
Ordinances, &amp;c? and a generation of men risen up (I
think Christians should send forth their gronings to the
Lord, that the terrour of the Lord may fall upon them)
they deny all the Ordinances of the Lord, and the Spirit
must teach us only. 'Tis true, the Spirit must
do it, but will ye therefore take away the means?
and hence, the very Scripture is made an Alphabet for
children, and so they do destroy the Ordinances of the
Lord. Beloved, if it be from this principle, take heed of
it; for if it be, ye will certainly find bondage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:102140:28"/>
4. When men do not thus pull down the Ordinances,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
the throne of Christ; but drive the Lord Jesus away out
of his Ordinances, (though they have his Ordinances
with them) by their secret defilings, pollutions, spiritual
pollutions of the glorious Ordinances of Christ; this the
Lord frequently complaineth of in <hi>Ierem.</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> The
very great reason why the Lord did leave his Temple,
where their fathers did praise the Lord: they had pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and defiled it, that was the reason of it: They had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Lord away from his throne, and this doth pull
down the princely power of the Lord in his Churches. I
know, there be many sins and defilements; and the sons
of men have hidden wayes of polluting the Ordinances
of the Lord, that a man shall sit undet all the Ordinances
of the Lord; and as it is said of Mount <hi>Gilboah,</hi> not any
dew fall upon him; never see good, when good comes;
the Lord is not dear, that is the reason of it. Oh, thy
secret defilements of the Ordinances of the Lord, have
driven the Lord far from you. There are many, I shall
only name three principally, that there may be a little
heed taken of them.</p>
            <p>First. When there is a secret contempt grown upon a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
mans spirit of the Ordinances of Christ, attended with a
secret wearinesse of them: this doth now pollute the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of the Lord, and this doth drive the Lord from
his Ordinances: <hi>Mal. 1. 7. Ye have offered polluted bread;
wherein have we done it,</hi> say they? this was the cause of it;
<hi>Ye say, that the Table of the Lord is contemptible;</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, you do despise my Table and Ordinances, and so
now do despise me too, and so ye do vilifie and contemne
the Ordinances of the Lord: Therefore saith the Lord,
in the conclusion of that <hi>Chapter, vers. 11. From the rising
of the Sun, my name it shall be known.</hi> As if he should say,
I am uot bound to you, I can have a people, among whom
my name shall be great; For, saith the Lord, <hi>I am a great
King.</hi> If one should have asked men in those dayes what
good is in your sacrifices? what great glory can ye see in
them? the Saints can see a great deal of glory in mean
outsides: Now when this is wanting, the name of the
Lord is polluted, and so the Lord driven from his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
<hi>Heb. 12. 15. Take heed, lest there be in any of you
an evil root of bitternesse springing up, and many thereby be
defiled.</hi> When men do live in secret lusts, or open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e;
a man that hath a profane heart, such a heart as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102140:29"/>
doth contemne the portion of mercy the Lord doth offer
to him; who like <hi>Esau</hi> did sell his birth-right for a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse
of pottage.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Unbrokennesse of heart in the enjoyment of
Ordinances, when men live not in a daily sense of the
extreme need they stand in of mercy, <hi>Isa. 66. 1. 2.
Heaven is my throne, and the Earth is my foot-stool;</hi>
Now observe what the Lord doth there speak, <hi>To him
will I look that is poor in spirit &amp; contrite;</hi> such a poor
soul, saith the Lord, will I look to; and to these are
opposed, such as have not such hearts, but do look on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Ordinances of the Lord: Now, saith the Lord
to such; <hi>He that offereth a lamb; is as if he cut off a
dogs neck; and he that offereth incense, as he that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
an Idol.</hi> These were a people that did plead for the
Temple of the Lord, and had the Ordinances of the Lord
according to his command; but here was their wound,
they were not broken under the Ordinances of the Lord:
This you shall find, the Saints have many sins and
wants under the Ordinances of the Lord: but little
does the world know their gronings before the Lord,
and the Lord hath mercy for such soules as are sensible
of their need they stand in of the Ordinances of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>But now when men have found the Lord in an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
subduing some particular sin: there are other
sins remaining in their hearts, and they stand unremove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in their hearts; and hence, are the strongest and
dearest of all the rest: Now, I say, when men having
these sins, and knowing these sins in their hearts and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
when as, because I cannot subdue these sins; and
they have attended on the Lord in the use of meanes,
and the Lord helps them not; and because, they hope to
be saved at last for all these: Hence they come to a truce
with their sin, and never go mourning to the Lord; nor
say, the Lord hath begun to subdue some of these lusts:
Now Lord, go on, but the soul is at truce with his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nnes.
Beloved, if there be any pollution of the Ordinances of
the Lord, here it is; that men come with unbroken hearts
to the Ordinances of the Lord; that never feel your
need of them, &amp; wounds and sores that are in your hearts,
that men do stand with those very sins, that they think
they cannot subdue; and because, they cannot ease them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of them, therefore they give way to them. When
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102140:29"/>
men keep these sins with unsensible hearts of them, ye
do resist the holy Ghost, ye feel not your need of the
Lord; therefore ye keep your sins, and your woes you
shall have for them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Where there is a spirit of unbelief, that there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
is not a seeking to Christ Jesus, to wash away the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his heart and life, in his attending upon the Lord
in his Ordinances. <hi>Tit. 1. 15. To the unbelieving
nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.
Exod.</hi> 30. 29. It is said, <hi>Every thing that touched
the Altar, was clean;</hi> and hence, without this, all is
unclean: When a poor soul shall come to the Lords Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and prepare himself before he come; and in all,
it hath many weaknesses, yet it doth leave it self
with Jesus Christ; every thing that doth touch this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
is sanctified, and is not polluted. But now when men
shall enjoy Ordinances, and make no great matter of sins
in Ordinances; especially if secret: such is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
nature of sin, it doth defile the earth a man doth
tread on: Now when men shall have these sins, and know
them, and yet never leave themselves with Christ, and
lay themselves on this blessed Altar by faith; they do
pollute the Ordinances of the Lord,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When the soul doth not so openly, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
drive away the Lord; but when men shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome to
the Ordinances, and never come to the Lord Jesus in
them; now the Lord is cast off. A great Prince that
comes to a mans house, though he be not driven out of
doors; yet if not attended on, he accounts himself cast
off. The Lord Jesus Christ is in his Ordinances, <hi>Ezek.
48. 35. The Lord is there;</hi> the Saints, they come to
God in them and are carried to him by them: Therefore,
'tis said, <hi>Acts 10. 33, 34. Now therefore, we are all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
before God, to hear all things that are commanded
thee of God,</hi> and Psal. 84. 7. <hi>Every one of them in</hi> Sion
<hi>appeareth before God.</hi> Now the Saints and people of
God, when they do thus come to the Lord, they find
many difficulties to break through, <hi>a vally of Baca.</hi>
Sometimes their heart is turned from the Lord, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
God is turned from them: so that now, the Saints
when they do come to the Lord in his Ordinances;
<hi>They go through the vallie of Baca,</hi> that they may see God
in <hi>Sion.</hi> But now, when men do never break through dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
but give way to a sluggish heart; when it is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102140:30"/>
thus with a people, it is certain the Lord is now cast off;
and ye do as good now as live without Christ in the
world. <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 21. faith the Lord, <hi>I hate your new
Moons, and Sabbaths; For these forty years ye never sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to me,</hi> vers. 25. Did they not sacrifice those forty
years to the Lord in the wildernesse? It was the very
thing they came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> for, that they might sacrifice
to the Lord: Yet saith the Lord, ye did not sacrifice to
me; truly here was the thing, they did sacrifice, but to
enjoy communion with a God, that they did not; the
Lord he saw none of that, and this is the frame of many a
man, ye never heard a Sermon; ye never broke through
your difficulties to come to a God in Ordinances: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in truth, though you had them, yet it is as if you
never had them; because, ye never did enjoy the Lord
in them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, this is that I would say: Oh, Brethren, let
the Saints, let it be the care of all the faithfull and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God; the first thing that ye do, before ye come to
hear a Sermon, or receive a Sacrament, or to any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
communion, or other Ordinance of God: Before
thou do'st come, indeavour it at least to bring thy soul to
a God, to Christ, above all Ordinances, and break
through the difficulties; heart is dead, and minde is blind,
and God is gone; but yet break through difficulties,
and wrestle with the Lord in Prayer, and then ye wil
find the blessing of the Lord. The great reason why we
enjoy not that mighty presence of the Lord in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
it is this; Men come to Ordinances, and
would enjoy Ordinances, but they never broke through
difficulties, to come to a God: When men shall come to
Ordinances only, (&amp; blessed be God we have the temple
of the Lord;) truly this wil do you no good in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Degree of casting off the supreme power of
Christ in his Ordinances; many times when the soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come to Christ, the Lord comes to it: Now then the
supreme power of Christ is cast off, when the soul is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
or carelesse, to receive the stroke of the Eternall
power of the life of Jesus into his heart; but contents
himself with some beginnings, some sips and tastes, and
doth not lye under the stroke of the eternall Spirit of the
life of Christ.</p>
            <p>Look as it is with a company of Subjects, they are in
some great Town, that stands it out against a Prince; If
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102140:30"/>
the Prince send to them, and they parlie with him, and
they are thankfull for his gifts, and glad of his parly; but
yet notwithstanding, they are unwilling to receive the
Prince, with all his power to come into the Town; if
they be unwilling to do that, and are loath to joyn sides
against the other party, they cast him off from being King:
So it is here, when men come to the Lord in Ordinances,
the Lord he parlies with them, the Lord he sends promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and they are marvellous precious things; and they
have some taste of what the Lord do's send, and it is
sweet to them; But now, because they have lusts in their
hearts; the Lord saith, make warre against thy lust, and
open the gates that I may come in: If so be, a man now
out of secret love to his sin, he content himself with the
promises of Christ; but the life of Christ, he cares not for
that, he uses not all means that he may find that, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
power of the Lord Jesus is now cast off, and I
know no difference between such a people and <hi>Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi>
they did enjoy the Gospell of God, but now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the Lord Jesus in his spirituall power, this they
were loath to come to; therefore, saith the Lord, <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to
thee Capernaum;</hi> the mighty work of Jesus Christ in their
hearts, this they never cared for, Saith the Apostle,
2 <hi>Cor. 10. 5. The weapons of our warfare, they are mighty
through God.</hi> As poor things as you think the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Lord to be, they are mighty through the Lord:
When Christians shall not be willing to receive this
mighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ truly, now the
Kingdome of Christ is cast off. <hi>Iohn 6. 49. Your fathers
ate Manna in the Wildernesse, and are dead,</hi> that was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Manna; but he that eateth me, shall live for ever.</p>
            <p>In one word thus; this is certain, a man never gets
good by any Ordinance, nor the Lord Jesus doth never
attain his end in any Ordinance, till there be an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
power and life of Christ Jesus communicated by the
Ordinance.<note place="margin">Psal. 133. ult.</note> 
               <hi>There,</hi> saith he, <hi>God commandeth his blessing,
life for evermore;</hi> mercy, for ever comforting; and light,
for ever teaching; and humbling, for ever continuing:
and a man will never think he doth receive any good till
he doth it. For if a man be healed of his blindnesse,
and be blind presently again; what is he the better? So,
if a man hath some flash of light in the Ordinance, blesse
the Lord for it. The Lord quickens up the heart to
walk with the Lord, Blessed be the Lord for it: Ay,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102140:31"/>
but when the heart now shall lose that life, and strength
which it had, (not but that a Christian do's lose to his
feeling, but it will return again.) When he is a hearing,
some affection, but he goes away dead as hee came:
no, but when the Lord comes by his everlasting power
and mercy, and life in any Ordinance; now Christ comes
in his power, and now ye receive the King in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Christ attains his end in the Ordinance. This
is all that I would say, I do beseech you brethren, in
the Lord Jesus Christ: Oh seek for this blessed life,
everlasting life Lord, everlasting power Lord; beg
for that, and seek for that, and pray for that, and weep
for that; do not content thy self with sippings and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings,
look for everlasting life and power to come with
the Ordinance; though means be weak in themselves,
do not therefore vilifie them: Look upon the brazen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
what a poor thing was that to heal the people that
were stung? yet the institution of Christ did put
vertue into it: So do thou attend on the Ordinances, and
never be content, till thou dost find the Lord,
and feel the Lord, and say as some have said; though I
feel not the Lord now as I have done, yet I think I
shall for ever blesse the Lord. Never be content till
ye find the Lord bringing your heart to this passe, and
then the King of glory, the Prince of peace is come;
though ye find not the same power at all times, yet if ye
finde that power which do's inure your heart for ever
to blesse the Lord, here is everlasting power. Jesus is
now come to thy soul; Ay, but when ye content your
selves with some movings and beginnings; and sin and
Satan as strong again as ever, and ye find not your sin
wasting and consuming; in truth the Lord Jesus is cast
off, and ye have not the end for which ye come to the
Ordinances of the Lord. But then, ye are blessed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
when ye find this.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. There is a derivative power of Christ to the Church,
joyntly considered together. <hi>Mat. 18. 17. Go and tell the
Church,</hi> is the highest tribunal Christ hath on earth in the
Kingdome of Saints. 'Tis Christs high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
beyond which there is no appeal to any higher
power than the Church; and it cannot be meant of the
Officers of the Church (which is the fairest interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.)
For the case may be that there is but one Officer,
and is he the Church? as also that he may sin, and not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102140:31"/>
hear of his sin, and must they leave him to himself, at
least to judge of his sin? They power of Keys was given
to <hi>Peter, quia fidelis,</hi> and the power to bind and loose to
<hi>two or three gathered together in Christs name, Mat.</hi> 18. but
these things are known.</p>
            <p>For the clearing up of this, know that there is a
three-fold derivative power, which the Lord hath given
to the Church joyntly, and not to Elders only: Which
may be miserably abused, and so provoke the Lord
to take it away from their hands till they know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
how to use it; yet when 'tis used according to Christ,
now not to be under the power of it, which is Christ,
power delegated to it, is to cast off Christs Government.
And I am confident, the bondage of all the Churches in
Christendome, if ye examine the Churches, is continued,
because the Lord sees hearts unwilling to submit to him
in the government of Churches; and will continue it till
Churches know how to use it, and men lye down to the
power of it.</p>
            <p>1. They have a power given them from Christ, of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
opening and shutting the doors of the Church, the
Kingdome of God on earth: <hi>i. e.</hi> of letting in, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
out any according to Christ; into, or out of
their communion: and this I conceive to be one part of
the power of the Keys, committed to the Church:
The chief office of which, is to open and shut; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in, and keep out according to Christ; and hence
the three thousand were added to the Church, though
the Apostles were guides therein: and <hi>Acts 9. 26. Paul</hi>
would have joyned himself, but they would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of him; because, they were afraid of him. No
body naturall or politick, but they have power to receive
to them the usefull, &amp; keep from them the hurtfull; so,
much more Christs spirituall body. And hence, the
Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is commended, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 2. together
with their Angel, <hi>for trying those that seemed good, and
were not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now 'tis true, this power may be miserably abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in opening doores too wide, or locking them up too
long, or too fast; and in many sad disorders this way,
yet there is this power. Now when men shall refuse
Church-tryall, and so communion with the Church; and
that not from sense of their unfitnesse and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or some other reason, which is in the fight of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102140:32"/>
God of great weight; but from a carelesse contempt of
Gods Ordinances, or Gods people; a man sayes, What
care I for the one? and what are the other? and from a
resolution never to grow better; they know they are not
like to be accepted of them, and they are resolved they
will grow no better; they think themselves as good as
they, and from a secret unwillingnesse to come to the
light, they know things are amisse, and will not be
known of it; they appear better than they are, and hence
they are loath to be seen and jodged as they are: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
this is to casts Christs power; and if continued in,
the salvation of your soules is also cast off: <hi>Acts 2. ult. The
Lord added to the Church daily, such as should be saved.</hi> To
the Church. <hi>i. e.</hi> not the universal Church, but visible
Church, where it may be had; <hi>such as should be saved.</hi> Isa.
60. 14, 15. <hi>For the Nation and Kingdome that will not
serve thee, shall perish; yea, those Nations shall utterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish:</hi>
Lamentable is the condition of many; not so much
for not joyning themselves to the Church, as not seeking
of the Lord for that mercy; that they may be first joyned
to the Lord, and so to his people for the Lords sake.</p>
            <p>There are great heaps of people amongst the Churches
here that do stand guilty of this, the Lord humble us for
it; that content themselves to stand <hi>Aliens from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of</hi> Israel, <hi>Eph. 2. 12. Strangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Promise; having no hope, and without God in the
world.</hi> The Lord is slow to wrath; but there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
bondage. 1. Of sin and Satan. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14, 15.
<hi>Let him that is filthy, be filthy still;</hi> Nay, though there be
some beginnings, yet apt to fall back; because, not <hi>planted
in the courts of the Lord.</hi> And hence, <hi>Col. 2. 5. Ioying,
and beholding your order, and the sted fastnesse of your faith
in Christ,</hi> order and stedfastnesse are joyned together. 2. Of
misery, <hi>Zach. 14. 17. And it shall be, that whosoever will
not come up of all the families of the Earth unto</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>to
worship the King, the Lord of Hosts; even upon them shall be
no rain.</hi> 3. Sadnesse, hence, <hi>Isa. 56. 7. Even them I will
bring to my holy Mountain, and make them joyfull in my House
of Prayer.</hi> To be joyfull in the house of Prayer, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to such as joyn themselves to Gods Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. They have a power given them of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
By admonition of any one, that being received in,
shall sin against their communion, and the Lord in it;
thereby to defile the whole body, and to provoke the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102140:32"/>
wrath of the Lord against the same; and this is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 4. and
this is given to them, to use against whatever sinner or
offender it be; be he great or small, Prince or Peer; if
he be a brother, he is to lye down here: An admonition
is an arrest and message from God, from Christ Jesus the
King of Kings; <hi>Eglon</hi> must come down from his throne,
when this is brought.</p>
            <p>Now I grant again, this power may be abused misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
as to admonish without conviction, or without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
and love, but in heat and passion, &amp;c. Yet this
is part of Christs binding power in his Church; which
when 'tis done, 'tis bound in heaven.</p>
            <p>Now when men come to that passe, that they do not
only sin (for that the Lord pardons) but are grown to
that height, that they cast off all reproofs, and Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
admonitions for sin: steept it may be in many tears
and prayers before they came, and sweetned with the
Spirit of mercy and terror of Christ Jesus in the mouths
of his servants, this brings under bondage. 'Tis not sin
so much, for this will be; but when they cannot abide
reproofs, they are iron morsels, cannot be digested; and
hence, sometime hide it, and twenty shifts, and half as
many lies; or if it be found out, defend it, and fall a fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and thrusting, and try it out to the last, or extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
it twenty wayes, that a beam is a more; and which is
worse, their hearts rise and swell, and they bear a privy
grudge against them, as if they were their enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they tell them the truth; when they should say;
<hi>Let the righteous smite me. Exod. 2. 14. Who made thee a
Prince and Iudge over us?</hi> When <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer
was raised up, he thereupon departs, and they
lye under heavy bondage, when they cast off his reproof.
It's true, a Saint may not for a time submit; but yet it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
a height of spirit for the present, unfit for communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God, and the Lord will bring them off, and

            <p>Now, when these are not used, or not with a spirit
of meeknesse improved, that a man never blesseth
God for these; the Lord Jesus is pulled down from
his throne, when not done according to the ability, time
and place that the Lord affords. And this I wish, the
Churches mourn not for another day: For my own part,
I do adjudge my self before God and men, as most
guilty of this, that I enjoy many sweet Ordinances, and
we improve them not; and hence, the glory of the Lord
fils not his Tabernacle, abides not on his Churches, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to draw others to them, or to make others abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
blesse God for them.</p>
            <p>Now here I will shew you the causes of this.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>Not gaining much in private duties,</hi> in Prayer, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
Reading, and daily Examination of a mans
own heart: And hence they cannot do good, because
they receive none, or very little themselves; they have
not a treasure within, hence they can spend little, have
no heart or ability to exhort, instruct, comfort: He
that keeps not his shop, his shop will never keep him. As
<hi>Psal 41. 6. His heart gathereth iniquity to it self, when he
goeth abroad, he telleth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>A low spirit,</hi> which makes a man to have low
thoughts, and endeavours, I mean not an humble, but
a narrow spirit, not inlarged to hold much, or to do
much, hence it doth little. As take a plain Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he neither seeks or regards the affaires of the State
in publick, because his spirit and condition is low; but
Princes do mind and attend to the affaires of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to advance it; because their condition is high,
and they know it. Moses, <hi>he suffered reproach with the
people of God,</hi> losse of all the honour and pleasure of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out; feared not <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> nor losse of life for
their sakes: For, <hi>he saw that God which is invisible;</hi> like
<hi>Saul,</hi> when once a Ringdome comes to be in his eye, he
leaves off to seek the Asses.</p>

businesses, occasions, and objections; when as if
once he were resolved to break thorough them, then
the work would go on: Like a man, when he is in his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102140:35"/>
warm bed, he is loth to rise; but when he is up, he
would not be in his bed again, if he might be hired again
to put off his clothes: I shall get no good; saith one,
nor do none, saith another; and when these businesses
are past, and occasions over; and at another time, I will
seek God, and go about Gods work; and thus a slothfull
spirit hinders.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Want of Faith.</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 13. <hi>We believe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

Heb. 10. 25. Whereas, if men were on their death-bed,
they would wish, Oh, that I had walked more blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly,

            <p>There are two causes why they receive no good.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>From a mean esteem of the Saints;</hi> looking on them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
as men, and not as an Ordinance of Christ; their
persons, prayers, and speeches. And this is a rule;
Men never gain any good by that Ordinance which they
despise: if all were Scholars, Ministers, or Saints glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
they could then esteem them. Hence, <hi>Eph</hi> 4. 16.
Edifying is by love; <hi>Making increase of the body, edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self in love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>From want of being poor in spirit,</hi> and sensible of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
their extream need of Christ, continually in all means:
Beggers will pick up crums, and watch for a word of
encouragement. <hi>Isa. 11. 6. A little childe shall lead

hath humbled the heart of a man. Oh, when a Christian
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102140:36"/>
thinks none so poor and shallow, and heartlesse as I, and
every one is better than I, however I need more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
This soul will be glad to suck the brest; and the
Lord will fill others with light and life, and his own
bowels, to do such a one good. Whereas, else they are
shut up, and they find no good conveyed to them by any
of the Ordinances of the Lord, nor any presence of God
in them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. There is a Ministeriall power, committed from
Christ by the Church to the ruling Officers thereof. I say,
by the Church, for all power in the Church, is properly
Christs, yet he nextly communicates it ordinarily to his
Church, or multitude of Beleevers, to whom is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the supreme power of the Keyes in his word, and a
binding and loosing, as hath been shewen; and by this
Church, this power hath been by Christs appointment,
and still is, to be communicated to those that are chosen
out of themselves, to be Officers and Rulers over them in
the Lord, to exercise the power of Christ over them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will. Hence the very power of binding
and loosing, opening and shutting, given to the Church, is
also given to <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, and the
successors of Christs Apostles in Doctrine, sent of Christ,
<hi>Iohn 20. 23. Whosoevers sins ye remit, they are remitted;
&amp;c.</hi> Because, though the power of Communication of
it is in the Churches hand, yet the power of usuall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of it is in their hand; whiles they exercise it
according to Christ, yet by the Church. And hence
<hi>Paul</hi> puts a difference between this extraordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
as Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leship, and ordinary. <hi>Gal. 1. 1. An Apostle
not of men, not by the will of men, but by Christ;</hi> for the
Church, not by it: Now this I say, is by the Church
from Christ. Hence, <hi>Acts 20. 28. The holy Ghost haoh
made them overseers;</hi> so that 'tis no invention of man, or
act of man, or the power of man; but of Christ, and
hence refuse to be under this power; men cast off the
yoke and power of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>For though the estate of the Church be <hi>Democraticall</hi>
and <hi>Popular;</hi> and hence no publick administrations or
Ordinances are to be administrated publickly, without
notice and consent of the Church; Yet the government
of it under Christ, the Mediator and Monarch of his
Church; tis <hi>Aristocraticall,</hi> and by some chief, gifted by
Christ, chosen by the people to rule them in the name of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102140:36"/>
Christ, who are unable, and unfit to be all Rulers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and to cast off these, or not to be ruled by these;
is to cast off Christ. <hi>Luke 10. 16. He that rejecteth you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth

               <hi>Negatively:</hi> 1. It is not any Lordly pompous
power, to bear the bell of great smoakie titles, to govern
in worldly pomp; or by worldly rewards, and civill
punishments. 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 4. The weapons of our warfare
are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of

               </gap>ate, so must you be one
to another. And hence, 1 <hi>Peter 5. 4. Not being Lords over
Gods heritage:</hi> Christ never gave his Ministers power of
opening and shutting the doors of New-gate, and <hi>Bonners</hi>
Cole-house if they would not sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

mens opinions with their own lawes, and bind consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
with chaines of Iron, or to promote his servants by
spirituall livings. Christ himself refused to be a Judge in
civill causes; hence some of our Divines, when they
would grant that <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>Christs</hi> successor, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome Peters</hi> and <hi>Christs</hi> Vicar; yet as Christ being
on earth, exercised no civill power, so much less may
these.</p>

have power over many Churches (for thats the main spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Antichristian externall power) and the Ministers
thereof; for we read in Scripture of many Elders and
Bishops in the same Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. but never of
any one ordinary Minister, or Officer over many Churches;
either to govern, or to baptize, as the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> would
among them, as many godly plead for now in the misty
confusion of <hi>England.</hi> And look as we cry out of one
Minister non-resident, that shall have six or ten livings,
though he give never so good a stipend; not only because
of his pride and covetousnesse, but because of his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionablenesse,
&amp;c. So here much more of one man Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer

scandall by the mouthes of two or three witnesses who
being Members of the whole Church, and under it,
and being sinfull Members; may, if the case need it, be
proceeded against by the whole. Neither have they any
power to act any publick Ordinance which concerns the
whole Church, and where 'tis bound by Christ to judge,
without the privity and consent of the Church, as to
elect Officers, admit Members, cast out offenders in the

given by Christ, over any one particular Church,
but mediate by that Church where they are; their gifts
of teaching and ruling are immediately from Christ;
but their actuall power to exercise it over this or that
particular Congregation, is by that Church only. Hence
Deacons that were only to take care for the outward
estate of the Church. <hi>Act</hi> 6. 3, 4. they were ordained

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They have a power given them of ruling
and governing from Christ by the people; hence they
are called Rulers, and such as rule, and are over Gods
Church; hence they have strict charge and command
from the Lord to do it. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> When

means they are not only single Members or Officers;
but Pastor, and Teacher, and Elder and all. This

That look as Common-wealths are under greatest bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,

would be a most simple ridiculous thing, if there
should be Election, Ordination, many Prayers, much
triall of men, for to rule, and guide, and govern,
separation from the rest, and yet not to have any more
power than one private Member. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

the thing: Hence say they, they are to watch; so are
private Members: they are to admonish; so is every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

they are over the whole Church. Their persons indeed
ase under them, in case they sin, and sin in the execution
of their office, they are to be subject, not only to the

the sin be not only suspected, or reported, or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

the Lords power, which they are to answer for another
day. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. they are called Governours. Now
as a Ruler of a Ship is to order it, though a King be in
it, over him in that respect, and the King is to be guided
by him, whiles he guides it right; but if not, the King
hath power over him, to command others to take the
place, or cast him over board.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, they are but servants to the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are by the Church, for the Church, and to
help the Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. and are subject to them if
they sin; but yet they are servants unto Christ, and in
exercising his power according to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> above the Church.
2 <hi>Cor. 4, 5. We preach Christ, and our selves your servants
for Christ;</hi> yet therein above them: Hence being their
servants; if they sin, they are under the censure of the
Church, and the Church may cast them by. So being
Christs servants; if not submitted to, the Lord doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
himself cast off.</p>
            <p>1. Because their power thus rightly executed, is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
power of Christ Jesus: Hence refuse it, you refuse to be
subject to him; If men wil not be ruled by Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
but will rule Ordinances, they go about to tule Christ.</p>
            <p>2. Because, if there shall be no subjection here, 'tis <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
profest licentiousnesse, and not liberty in Churches; You
have liberty, but what liberty? to be subject to Christs
power in pure liberty, and that in his servants. Now
when men will not, and shall refuse, without shewing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or convicting Elders of sin; this is to cast off the
Government of Christ.</p>
            <p>3. Elders are helpers of people, and there is no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
but will stand in need of such helps, if humble, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

may be comforted in the work of Christ; though there
be no sin break out, not they come to them, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.
5, 6. The Apostle enquired into their faith, charity,

And this <hi>Paul</hi> doth not as an extraordinary man, but
leaves his example as a president to the Elders of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;</hi>
to go from house to house, and enquire, to teach
and exhort, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. for Elders are to prevent scandals
as well as to remove them, left when they come they
say, Oh that I had known this before, especially where
they see need. Now hence it is that men cast off the
government of Christ, when they will not have their
spirituall condition searched into, the Elders foot is now
too great for his shoe, I am to give an account to God;
so are they also of thee; now thou canst not give it if
thou enquirest not how thy condition stands, neither
can they with comfort unlesse thou tellest them how it
stands with thee. 'Tis true there are many secret
things they can never find out yet they are to attend their
duty.</p>
            <p>The Ministers charge is to cast the seed, the Elders
duty is to enquire after the fruit in the husbandry of
Christ; it is a sad condition when a man hath such a
wound that he will not go to the Lord for help,
because hee loves it; and will not have man to
know it, at because hee is ashamed of it; But you shall
know it, the last day that the Lord would have
healed you, and you would not, but can quarrell
and snap at the Elders when they come to enquire
of your condition? and why do ye inquire; you take too

and contrary to covenant, and Elders would never have
undertook the care of the Church without it; and it sads
their hearts that they do their work feebly.</p>
            <p>3. Hence to propose a doubtfull question to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Church, which may trouble, or bring an offenders
sin to the Church without counsell of the Elders,
who may encourage them if of God, and ripen it for
the Church, or discourage it if not of God. Christ when
he writes to the Churches, he superscribes his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to the Angels; and if one man may propose a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
opinion, another may, and a third, and one may
side with another, and so much confusion will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>4. Hence when men shall not take warning of evils <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
to come upon evident grounds, it's casting off the Lords
yoke; and when they come on thee, thou mayest
say it is because I have refused to hearken to my
watchers, they warned me of this, and it may be you
will find else such evils which the Seripture notes, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

            <p>5. They have power of publick reproof of any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

are part of the power peculiar to the governours

and stop their mouths. <hi>Exod. 2. Who made thee

               <hi>Answ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> There is a double Power in the Kingdoms
of the world, which I suppose, when they become
Christs Kingdomes, they will retain.</p>
            <p>First, There is some supreme or higher power; in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
chief Magistrates, Ptinces, or chief Court of Justice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is some inferiour power, by some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
superiour power, set over particular Persons, Cities, and
Towns, for the well ordering of them. The ground of
this is, that naturall necessity which <hi>Iethro</hi> propounded
from God to <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 18. 17, 18. '<hi>Tis not good for
thee to be alone, but thou wilt both wear out thy self, and thy
people.</hi> Publick authority must have many eyes, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102140:41"/>
many hands; and like a River that is to water a Countrey,
it must have many streams: And hence they had in the
Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> which was for God, in every
City Judges, and in Towns, such as were over fifties and
tens, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 25. which it seemes continued long, till
all fit men for government were taken away; and then
<hi>Isaiah</hi> 3. 3. their condition is lamented.</p>
            <p>Now the form of this government is not in all Common-wealths
alike; the Lord not binding to any; and hence
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an ordinance of men. Hence it
is a foolish vanity to ask a warrant in Scripture for such a
form of Government; for humane wisdome may teach
this, though not in Church-government. Yet this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and inferiour Government hath been in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. to both which subjection is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
to refuse to give it, is to cast off the Lords Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;

place to prove this.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>Do it for the Lords sake,</hi> for the name of Christ; and
that honour and majesty of Christ stamped on them, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
hence cast them off, you cast by respect unto; nay,
the name of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Because they are in the room of the Lord, to do the
work of the Lord; <hi>In punishing evil doers, and for the praise
of them that do well.</hi> It's true, they may abuse their
power otherwise; but yet their power is one thing, and
their abuse of it another.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Because, <hi>this is the will of Christ, and you do well in
it; and so you shall stop the mouthes of foolishmen, apt to
speak against you for sin.</hi>

            <p>

and their liberty to exempt themselves from the
power of lawfull authority, was but <hi>a cloak of it.</hi> For
so it seems in those dayes, some held it part of their
Christian liberty to be free from all bonds; and said, that
Christ had made them Kings on Earth, &amp;c. So that if
they did cast off subjection, they did cast of the name of
Christ, power of Christ, will of Christ, liberty of Christ
Jesus. Even under heathen Magistrates; what then do

cause of speaking than I do, and only point out two or
three particulars to prevent such sins as stand next to the

            <p>1. When men cast off secretly dread, and fear, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>
of the Majesty, Dominion and Sovereignty that God
stamps upon authority; and so come to have low, mean
thoughts of them, and contempt of them. It's true, none
should be elected, but such as men can honour for some
eminency or other, and that of God, seen in them. <hi>Able

                  </gap>ses;</hi> but when they be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
now to despise them, and hence not to bow
the knee, or stir the hat, and speak rudely before
them; it's casting off, not only their power in sight of
God; but the very root of it, which is honour: And hence
in the fifth Commandment, all duties to them are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under the word <hi>Honour.</hi> And who sees not
but this is a sin, which is apt to attend the spirits of men
in a place of liberty, and in our weak beginnings, and
<hi>day of small things?</hi> Reports are abroad, that no men of
worth are respected; and hence the Countrey is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
I cannot say so after many thoughts; for I am
perswaded no place in <hi>Europe</hi> more ready to honour men
of publick spirits, and of eminency in piety, and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
without the seeing of which, no Countrey more apt
to vilisie; because grace is the glory in the eye of a
Countrey led by Religion: But take heed, lest such a
spirit be all us; lest the Lord put out our Lamps, <hi>and cast
our Crown down to the ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. When men seek to pluck the sword of revenge for sin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
hurting the Commonwealth, out of their hands; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

all the doubts about this matter, 1. What prudence
should be used in making lawes? 2. How farre those hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
lawes and Town-orders bind conscience? But I
cannot attend these; only six things I would here say.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. The will and Law of God only hath Supreme ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and sovereign power to bind conscience (<hi>i. e.</hi> to
urge it or constrain either to excuse for doing well, or to
accuse for sin; for conscience is at liberty without this)
this is a truth urged by all orthodox Protestant Divines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Papists; so that no law can immediately bind
conscience but Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Because he only is Lord of conscience; because he
made it, and governs it, and only knows it; and hence he
only is fit to prescribe rules for it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Because he only can save or destroy the soul; hath
only power to make lawes for the soul to bind conscience.
<hi>Iames 4. 12. There is one Law-giver, who is able to save
or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to a duty that the breach of it is a sin, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God: we know that the least sin of it self destroyes
the soul, binds it over to death, but none have power to
destroy it but the Lord himself.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Because the Law is sufficient to guide the whole
man, in its whole course, in all the actions or occasions it
meddles with, or takes in hand, even in civill as well as
in Religious matters. <hi>Prov. 2. 9. wisdom teacheth every
good path.</hi> Psal. 119. 11. <hi>I have hid thy word, that I might
not sin.</hi> Whatever one doth without a rule from the
word, is not of faith. Hence the word descends to the
most petty occasions of our lives, it teacheth men how to
look, <hi>Psal.</hi> 131. 1. how to speak, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 36. it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
to the plaiting of the hair, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. moving of
the feet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 16. and what is of Christian liberty hath
its freedome from the word: a man must give an account
at the last day of every stirring of heart, thoughts, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and secret words; and if so, then it must be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rule of the word: and hence the word only
hath absolute power to bind Masters, Servants, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
how they govern, and people how they subject; and
this the Lord hath done to make men take counsell from
him, and walk in fear before him, and approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to him, especially Townsmen in their places not to
consult without God.</p>

            <p>2. Because either men have rules to walk by, or their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
own wills and apprehensions are to be rules; but not so,
because mens wills are not only corrupt, but it's a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar

The reason or wisdome which makes a rule, binds; which
if it be right, is part of the law writ in the heart, which is

these; and what is deducted from the word, is Gods

hereby, and against men in place, and so against more

Ordinance of God, i. e.</hi> when they command thee according

the power is (as in Towns) the more terrible will the

            <p>'Tis true, if they be not thus according to the word, but
rather against the generall rules of it: though men in
Towns and places are not to be obeyed, yet subjection
is their due even then; <hi>i. e.</hi> not to refuse obedience

such things, as really advance or tend to promote the

            <p>This I adde to answer that great question in many scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
minds. I cannot see (so ignorant) when an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is collected from the generall rules of the word;

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w this conclusion answers that doubt: For look
as the main work of men in place, is to promote publick
good; (and hence publick spirited men are to be chosen
for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) so the principall rule is that which God and his

to the advancement of that; Publish that, record that, and
execute that, <hi>Rom. 13. 4. He is Gods M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as private persons are to attend their work, so publick

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Hence, if the law be made only for the private
good of themselves, or any particular person, and hurts
the publick, that's not according to God. Admirable
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102140:45"/>
was <hi>Ioshuas</hi> spirit herein, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 19. 49, 50.</p>
            <p>3. If laws be only in appearance and pretence for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good, and not really, they bind not; none must do
evill, much lesse make a law of it, for publick good. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more usuall than to make civill lawes and orders,
crossing Gods law, and to pretend publick good; which
ever prove the publick pests and plagues, and cankers of
that place, as <hi>Ieroboams</hi> command for Religion. Some
things are forbidden plainly, they make not for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good, but hurt, <hi>the statues of Omri.</hi> Other things
are indifferent in their nature, as swine to go abroad,
or to be shut up; but inconvenient in their use, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and scandalous, and that really to the generall. They
are not for publick good, whatever is pretended.
Somethings are plainly commanded, they are for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good circumstantiated; some things are indifferent in
their nature, but convenient and comfortable in their
use, those are indeed according to God. And such
things may be discerned, they are so obvious and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
of such necessity and such profit, when duly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by persons not blinded with their private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests.</p>
            <p>4. Hence things indifferent, which may as well be left <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
undone as done, and so publick good no way advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
are not of God that any should restrain them:
For the liberty which Christ hath purchased by his blood,
and which Gods law gives; no law of man can abolish,
or take away. It's the cry of the claw-backs of Princes,
that they have power in things indifferent, <hi>i. e.</hi> such
things which make as much for publick good, not to use,
as use; the truth is, he hath least power here; because they
are idle and Idol-lawes, no hurt, nor is there good in
them: And hence, some of the most rigid Schoolmen
maintain such lawes bind not conscience; we are not to
seek our private only; now all human lawes are helps to
seek publick.</p>
            <p>5. That lawes made for and according to God for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
good, if they do not destroy some mens particular;
only for some time pinch and presse hard upon his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
good; or their particular good, men are bound
in conscience here to submit. True, 1. If it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
all lawes for publick good, should hurt no
particular man, and Townsmen, if they can; should
help those that are hurt; yet because no lawes, but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102140:46"/>
usually they will presse on some mans particular; the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest
end of a staffe that is to be born, must fall on some
mans shoulder, and such lawes must be made. Hence a
man is to bear and submit cheerfully, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the rule of
love, which will abate of particular for the generall
good; love that more than mine own. 2. The law of
justice, a man is to do as he would be done by; there is
no man, but if his good was advanced by the generall,
but would be conteut that some particular should be pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
3. The law of nature: The stomack is content
to be sick, and body weak, to heal the whole body. Hence
Christians should not think that Tow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is sufficient for the satisfaction of the offence, or trespasse;

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, A Penall law is about things of small moment,</p>

proviso than a law.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It is in the mind of the law, make satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
if the penalty be payed, though the law be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
because the publick good in the mind of the
Law-maker is known to be set forward that way as by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the law. In these cases penalty is enough;
but if the law be mixt, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is a command it shall
de done; and Law-giver is sad, though penalty being
paid, as being about a matter of weight; it may be the
livelyhood and comfort of men, as keeping hogs out of
corn, and peace in a Town, that there be no complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
here the penalty will not satisfie, because this is no
penall law, but a law indeed deducted from rules of the
word of God; as it is in theft, he that steals, shall pay
fourfold; or that brawles, shall be duckt in the water:
Suppose one should say, I will suffer my servant to steal or
revile; I hope 'tis no offence if he suffer the penalty. Yes,
but it is, beeause it is not a meer penall law; the thing is
of weight, peace between neighbours, so peace in a Town.
It's a flat charge not to break it, and thou knowst such is
the honesty and justice of a Magistrate, that he will say, I
would rather you would never do thus, than offer those
to do. Hence in Gods law Christ must suffer, and do
also, because Gods law is not meerly penal; but doing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102140:46"/>
the thing, gives more content than the punishment.</p>
            <p>3. When servants cast off all subjection to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Families being the members and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Towns,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 9, 10.</note> and so of Common-wealths. When they

and worse for chiding, and find fault with their wages,
and victuals, and lodging; weary, and vex out the heart
of Master and Mistresse, and make them weary of their
lives, and their God also almost sometimes; and that by
such professing Religion, and all that they might be from
under the yoke.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but set a mark upon servants broke
loose from their Masters, and got out of their time, that
are under no Family nor Church-government; nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 18.</note>
of it, or preparing for it;<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 9, 10.</note> but their reigns are on
their necks. I confesse,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 5</note> if under heathen Masters, then
desire liberty rather; but when men will live as they list,
without any over them, and unfit to rule themselves; I
much doubt, whether this be according to God.</p>
            <p>1. Hence they come to live idly, and work when they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
list.</p>
            <p>2. Hence men of publick use, can have little use but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
when they please of them.</p>
            <p>3. When they be with them, they have no power to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
correct or examine, and call them to account, in regard
of spirituall matters.</p>
            <p>4. Hence they lye in wait to oppresse men that must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
have help from them, and so will do what they list.</p>
            <p>5, Hence they break out to drunkenness, whoring,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

            <p>6. Hence they make other servants unruly, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>

setting him up as chief. Are we under the Kingdome of

and have been some pangs of resistance against persons
and against Ordinances; so as 'tis thy liberty to be subject

'tis by Christs blood and cost, that (as I am perswaded)
our liberties have cost Saints their blood. The tears,
prayers and blood of men are much; but of Christ much
more, and are they not worth thanks that are of this
price? The great reason why unthankfulnesse comes in,
is; because they cost so much, as losse of estate, of wife,
or of childe by sea; dost thou repent now? Christ doth
not repent that his blood hath been paid for them; and
if they be of so little value, as there 'tis said, <hi>He repented

hearts failing for fear, this you should see some-where.
A mote or a thorn is a little thing, but no man would
have it alwayes vexing for all the estate he hath, if he
hath any eye or tendernesse in it; so those small matters
for which the Saints have suffered, and for which God is
provoked, and under which some have roared, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have been loaded one after another; 'tis worth a
world; oh, blesse God for it: but consider those that be
under the dominion of sin and Satan, so strong and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
sin so dear, that there is not so much as a sigh
under that; be thankfull for that.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Labour to maintain in the heart a holy fear of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
liberties, every one in his place; for what makes
them despised, but principally the abuse of them; in such
a Congregation there was such contention, such affront
to the Elders, there is that degenerating of spirit, and
back sliding from God, that men grow worse under
means than ever, I and so must be if men grow not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 10, 12. The Lord exhorts them, that when
they be at liberty, they would not then forget the Lord,
but then fear. 'Tis <hi>Luthers</hi> note on the place: <hi>When in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102140:48"/>
trouble, you rejoyce; but when in peace, you fear.</hi> I'le only
name the sins of liberty.</p>
            <p>1. Take heed of a Prayerlesse spirit, and that that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
lamp go not out. Men under some pressures cry,
and 'tis long before they do cry under them, and under
their sin; but then at last they do, and when the Lord
gives liberty, though they have the guilt of the same sins,
and more sins lie on them, yet then like Marriners,
when the storms are over, fall asleep. Its strange that
<hi>Israel</hi> under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> cried, and under Gods afflicting
hand in denying them water murmured. True thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
will help to prize what liberty affords.</p>
            <p>2. An unloving spirit to the Saints. It's that I have oft <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
said; souldiers when they are set against a common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
are all one, but when at liberty, then they fling jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins
at one anothers heads, differ in opinion, and in heart
and affection, &amp; 'tis not death so to do. Take heed of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid,
censorious, unloving spirit.</p>
            <p>3. Extreme ignorance how to use our liberties; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
hence running to extremes. As we say of Christ, There
is good enough in him, but men know not how to fetch
and improve it: so there is great advantage in liberties;
but men misse of it through their ignorance and abuse.
Hence many times more hurt done by an Admonition
than by the sin, when administred in passion, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
compassion. Hence under pretence of liberty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
licentiousnesse.</p>
            <p>4. Imperiousnesse of spirit, arising from a frothy empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
and an overweening opinion, and conceitednesse
of their own abilities and wisdom above others: and hence
will not be led, (being at liberty) by the Counsell and
Advice of others. It's naturall for man to affect sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,
and when the time comes of liberty, then it hath
a vent: <hi>Who made thee a Lord and Iudge over us?</hi> though
in bondage, much more in liberty; they think Wills Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
is in their heads chiefly, and hence will not
be ruled by Gods ordinances; and hence if once taken
with an opinion, hardly ever removed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5. Resting with liberties and in liberties. <hi>We were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
never in bondage,</hi> John 8. 33. <hi>yet servants to sin. We be</hi>
Abrahams <hi>seed,</hi> better than all the world; yet under all
the power of sin and Satan, and must not be told of their
wayes, but hate them that censure them for their sins.
Men in bondage are like sick men, that will cry if they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102140:49"/>
were in another bed, oh then they should be well; but
they must first be cured of their disease.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Make use of liberties. He that hath them, but sees
not so much glory in them, or gets not much good from
them; he will be no more thankfull than one that hath
large grounds may walk at liberty, but the trees for want
of manuring bear no fruit, nor ground corn through sloth;
such a man will starve there. Look as they, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 5,
10, 11. they were <hi>to bring the first fruits, and present them
before the Lord, and rejoyce in all:</hi> so should you if ever
you be thankfull for them, bring the first fruits to the
Lord, and think there is more behind, and more in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

his ordinances and liberties because of wants, you would
despise himself if he were present. But you will reply
and say, What if we can have both? If that can be, and
Christ cals to take both, refuse not his love. But it may
be an heavy indictment against some at the last day, in
that they forsake Christ, because he is poor and naked;
for they are therefore called to cloath him: and this will

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. They that are not recompenced for their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of liberties, by the spirituall refreshings which the
Lord gives, shewing them more of their own hearts; the
Lord proclaims liberty to them to depart. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Lament rather your own vilenesse, who in the midst
of all mercy, know not how to use, but abuse our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and hence the Lord forsakes us, as <hi>Ezza</hi> 9. 8, 10,

hast consumed us?</hi> Psal. 81. 13, 16. <hi>Oh that my People had
heard my voice, I would have subdued their enemies.</hi> God
would not be wanting unto us, if we were not to him.</p>
            <p>Take therefore that example to imitate, in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31,
<hi>Having rest, they were edified:</hi> if we be not so, truly, as
none have the like liberties; so no bondage so sad, no
where such poverty, no where such anguish of conscience,
no where such spirit and power of sin, no where such
sad anger; if in practice we be unthankfull, or can

and when you see <hi>Indians</hi> rise, <hi>Brambles, Abimelechs</hi> and

sin or Satan, or outward miseries; 'tis full of rigour, force
and cruelty. <hi>Ezek. 34. 4. With force and cruelty have ye
ruled them.</hi> But Christs Government is there shewen
to be in mercy, and full of mercy; though sometimes lost,
he will fetch thee in again; though sick and weak, he
will heal thee again. <hi>vers. 16. Deut.</hi> 4. 6. 'Tis <hi>for thy good</hi>
the Lord hath no need of thy service, &amp;c. True it is, the
Lord may shew his people hard things, and give them
sid miseries; but these wounds do not kill them, only
make way for healing the distempers of their hearts, that
are in his poor weak ones; and his end is to bring them
to himself.</p>
            <p>2. Their government is in it self hard and bitter. To <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
serve a lust now, 'tis a torment, sometimes to conscience, if

yet more distinctly. There be two great commands or
charges of Christ, that lye upon all mens consciences to
whom the Gospell comes, and therein lyes our service of
him generally: Which two <hi>I</hi> name, because there we
think we are free, or do not know our liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, The command of Christ is, that every one to
whom the Gospell comes, and is preached, do believe,
<hi>i. e.</hi> receive Christ Jesus in all his fulnesse in the Gospel.
<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. For that is to believe; in which command
lies Gods offer. 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 23. This is his commandment,
that ye believe,</hi> John 6. 25, 37, 38. <hi>This is the work of
God, that ye believe.</hi> Now here men think they are free.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102140:50"/>
1. They say they are unworthy; and hence they say, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from me, Lord, I am a sinfull man; as if Gods grace
was built on mans worthinesse. 2. Because unhumbled,
whereas Gods grace calls in men unhumbled. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 17,
18. For Gods call and offer is generall though none but
the humble will hearken to it. But there are none, but
it may be said to them; If they can believe, let them.
3. Because Christ is not theirs, &amp; are they bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he is? Whereas the first act of faith, is not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Christ is mine, then men were bound to believe a
lie. But to receive Christ as a woman her husband, that
he may be mine by saith; and so a man may know and
say, he is mine. The Gospell doth no where say
to any man, Christ is thine; but if thou receive him, he
is thine, and consequently the Spirit speaks so also. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot believe, unlesse they should presume;
as if the Gospell bound the conscience of none to believe,
but them that were able to believe it, and receive Christ
in it: yet 'tis otherwise: for it binds all to receive Christ
Jesus; to go up and possesse him, to feed, eat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>The serious consideration of which one truth, is enough

            <p>1. They think the Gospell concerns not them; what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
doth the Lord say to me, come so vile, and sinfull? yes,
that he doth; if there was no such law, there could be no

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The Lord layes his chain on the most tender place

salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. 'Tis a chain, not of bondage, but of liberty, and
mercy, and love: Come and receive, not a Kingdome;
but Christ, Peace, pardon, and grace freely; which may
draw the heart, as it will at the great and last day. <hi>Come
ye blessed, take a Kingdome;</hi> take a Christ prepared for
you from before the foundation of the world. Oh that
this might sound in your eares: This is the first and
chiefest; without this, all your obedience is hypocrisie,

obedience shall please.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Love unto the whole will of Christ; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to that part of it, to love those that be the members of
Christ. Some Christians they believe, and feeling a heart
so crosse to Christ, and the will of God; think they are
from under the government of God and Christ, &amp; so from
under the grace of Christ, (and the argument is strong,
if true;) but why not under his government? because
they find daily a spirit so crosse to the will of Christ; and
hence under continuall fears of condemnation. Oh but
consider, hast thou no love to the will of Christ and law
of God? (for if any believe, this is found in him) if so,
then under Christs Government. <hi>Rom. 8. 2. The Law of
the spirit of life hath made me free.</hi> What is that Law?
See <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 23, 24. Spirit of <hi>delight in the Law in the
inner man,</hi> and mourning for contrary captivity. Know
therefore, though you cannot do all; yet love the whole
will of God, and mourn where you do not; and then say.
Now no condemnation. Do not say, 'Tis impossible,
Oh, here is mens wo, and tryall of subjection to Christs
will! How do you love it, love his Sabbaths and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
because of his love to you? How do's this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
you?</p>
            <p>In particular; Love the people of God, that is, his
speciall commandment, 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 23. Iohn</hi> 13. 34. But now
the want hereof, or the contrary hereto: As when a

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102140:51"/>
3. A Censurer, and whisperer. 4. A Sooffer. 5. If met on
a Bridge, an opposer of the Truths or servants of God.
This is that which kindles wrath, and wherein the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
venome of hypocrisie appears. There's many duties
neglected, and not that spirit of prayer, and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
amongst Christians; yet do you keep love to
them; that what you cannot do your selves, yet you
love others that can do it, and account it your blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to be like them, and daily mourn under your
neglects; that in every thing, the Gospel is not adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by you: &amp; on the other side, although you have many
duties, Sabbaths, and good acts; yet if not love, all is
vile. I fear 'tis not mens joy, sweetnesse, delight to hear
the least good word that falls from a good mans lips, but
rather the truths and things of God despised; if so, then

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the 31. <hi>Vers.</hi> to the end of this
<hi>Chapter,</hi> Our Saviour proves that he
was the <hi>Messiah</hi> to come, from four
testimonies.</p>
            <p>1. From the testimony of <hi>Iohn;</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the first, yet the least, yet very strong
and full, <hi>vers.</hi> 32, 33.</p>
            <p>2. From the testimony of his works, greater than that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of <hi>Iohn, vers.</hi> 36.</p>
            <p>3. From the testimony of the Father, by his voice from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
heaven, <hi>vers.</hi> 37.</p>
            <p>4. From the voice of the Scriptures, the highest of all,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
and surer than a voice from heaven, (2 <hi>Pet. 1. 19.) vers.</hi>
39, 46.</p>
            <p>Now these words are annexed to the third testimony,
which I told you is the voyce of God from heaven, set
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102140:53"/>
down, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. For this Testimony of the Father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
not the inward testimony of the Spirit only; Because
Christ speaks of publick, and evident testimonies in this
place; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is it meant of the testimony of the Father
in the Scripture; for that is a distinct testimony: and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ough the Father doth testifie of Christ in the Scriptures;
yet 'tis not as his testimony, no more than the testimony
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of his works, whereby the Father did te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
also: Nor is it probable that our Saviour would at
this time, omit that famous testimony of the Father
at his Baptism; which if it be not here, is no where
in this <hi>Chapter.</hi> Beside, how is this testimony the Fathers
more than the Spirits; but then, being called his Son, he
did evidently declare himself to be the Father that
spake. Lastly, the Spirits testimony is spoken of, as the
testimony of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Vers. 46, 47. For
had ye believed</hi> Moses, <hi>ye would have believed me, for he
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ote of me,</hi> vers. 47. <hi>For if ye beleeve not his writings how,
shall ye believe my words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now our Saviour in these words answers an <hi>Objection</hi>
which the Jewes (ever conceited of their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
might make. We know the Father as well as you;
and yet we know no such testimony that he gives. Christ
answers, You do not know him; for the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of a thing, is either by seeing or hearing; now you
never saw him nor heard him; you have therefore no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him.</p>
            <p>So that the words contain 1. Christs fearfull accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Jews to be ignorant of God, 2. The aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and extent of it, at no time, <hi>i. e.</hi> not only at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
but at no other time, in any Ministery, or in any
Scripture, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Quest. 1.<note place="margin">Quest. 1.</note> What is it not to see his shape nor hear his
voice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Some think they are metaphorical speeches, to
expresse their ignorance of God; Now though this be the
scope, and the general truth, yet I conceive, the Lord
speaking particularly, and knowing what he spake, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
something particularly: and it is a rule, never to flie
to metaphors, where there can be a plain sense given.
There is therefore two degrees of true knowledge of God
in this life, or 'tis attained unto by a double means.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. By hearing of him, for hence our faith comes by
the Word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102140:53"/>
2. By hearing thus from him, the mind also comes to have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
a true <hi>Idea</hi> of God, as he reveals himself in the Word
and Means by the Spirit, <hi>Iob 42. 5. I have heard of thee by
the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee;</hi> and this
is the <hi>shape</hi> here spoken of, not bodily and carnall. Now
Christ doth professe that they did want both. Carnal and
unregenerate hearts, neither hear Gods voyce, nor have
a right <hi>Idea</hi> of God in their minds, but become vain
in their minds, though they have means of knowing,
and their foolish hearts are darkned; the wiser they
be, the more foolish they grow.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>At no time, i. e.</hi> neither at baptism, nor else in any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
mans Ministery, nor in any of the Scriptures which you
read, and where the Lord speaks.</p>
            <p>3. But did they not hear the voice of God at Christs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
baptism, and at the Mount when Christ preach't, when
the Scriptures were opened every Lords day, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times amongst them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> No, they never heard it. It's a strange thing,
that such men that read, heard, preach'd, remembred the
Scriptures, and could tell you mysteries in titles, never
heard the voice of God; and yet it is most true.</p>
            <p>Observat.<note place="margin">Observ.</note> That many men may a long time together know
and hear the Word of God written and spoken, yet never hear
the Lord speaking that Word, no not so much as one word,
tittle or syllable; no not so much at once, at any time. <hi>This
was the estate of the Jews, and this is the estate of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
men. Hence Christ,</hi> Luke 19. 41. <hi>laments
and weeps over</hi> Ierusalem, <hi>saying,</hi> Oh that thou hadst
known in this thy day, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. Quest.<note place="margin">Quest. 1.</note> How did the Iewes hear, and yet not hear God
speaking?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> There is a twofold word, or rather a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
declaration of the same word. 1. There is Gods exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
or outward word, containing letters and syllables,
and this is his externall voice. 2. There is God internal
word and voice, which secretly speaks to the heart, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the externall word, when that only speaks to the
ear. The first the Jewes did hear, at Christs Baptism, in
Christs Ministery, and in reading the Scriptures, and when
they did hear it, it was Gods word they heard, full of
glory, and so they heard the word spoken, but only
man speaking it: the other comes to few, who hear not
only the word spoken, but God speaking the word,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102140:54"/>
               <hi>Rom. 10. 18, 19. Israel did hear,</hi> but <hi>Israel did not know.</hi>
Christ speaks in parables; Hence <hi>in seeing they did not see,</hi>
Luke 8. 10. And this is one way, how 'tis true that
Christ sayes, <hi>They never heard his voice.</hi> As 'tis with a
painted Sun on the wall, you see the Sun and Stars, but
there is a difference between seeing this and the Sun and
Starres themselves, wherein is an admirable glory: go to
a painted Sun, it gives you no heat, nor cherisheth you
not; so it is here, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. This inward word is double. 1. Ineffectuall,
(though inward.) 2. Effectual. 1. Ineffectuall, is that
which hath some inward operation upon the heart, but it
attains not Gods end to bring a man into a state of life;
and thus, <hi>Heb. 6. 2, 5. Many tasted of the good word of
God, yet fell away.</hi> And such a heart is compared to a
field which a man plowes and sowes, and rain falls on it,
and yet the end is not attained, <hi>it brings forth thistles;</hi>
and this many Jewes did hear, and hence had some kind
of faith in Christ. 2. Effectual, is that which hath such
an inward efficacy upon mens hearts, as that God attains
his end thereby, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 11. and brings men to a state of
life, of which Christ speaks, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 45. and this voice
none but the Elect hear; and of this Christ speaks here,
as appears, <hi>v. 38. Him whom he sent, ye beleeve not.</hi> Hence
it is you have heard God at no time. Hence he speaks of
such a hearing &amp; knowing, such a hearing outwardly, as is
accompanied with such a hearing inwardly, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 17. so
that many men may hear the word spoken outwardly, but
never inwardly: they may hear it inwardly, but never ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
translating them from state to state, from death
to life, from life to life and glory. No sense of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
of God speaking, nor effectuall hearing of the word
spoken. When the Sun is down the Moon may arise, but
yet a man is cold and dark; but when the Sun ariseth, oh
it warms, nourisheth and cherisheth, &amp;c. <hi>nothing is hid
from it;</hi> so it is here, when the Lord speaks inwardly
and effectually to the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> From that great distance and infinite separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mens souls from God, that though God cals, yet
they can't hear no more than men a 1000 mile off. <hi>Eph.
2. 1. men are dead in sin.</hi> Now what is spirituall death,
but separation of the soul from God, and God from it. A
dead man cannot hear one word at no one time, he was
not dead if he could. Mens minds are far from God, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102140:54"/>
hearts also, that they are neither stricken with the sight
of his glory, nor sense and savour of his goodnesse, but
must be vain, and have worldly hearts in the Church, nay
adulterous eyes, or if they listen, God is gone from them,
and from his Word also, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Reason. 2.</note> From the mighty and wonderfull strange
power of Satan, which blinds their eyes they cannot
see nor hear, 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 4. 4. never such clear light,
never such an effectuall Word, as that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
yet it was <hi>hid;</hi> why? <hi>The God of this world
blinded them,</hi> either he will keep such a noise and lumber
in their heads, that they cannot hear God speaking for the
noise, or else turn himself into an Angel of light, and
speak, and by their light will blind them, that the light
in them shall be darknesse. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22. When men with
naturall light began to be most wise, then they became
the greatest fools: so 'tis with other knowledge of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and things they hear. Happy were it for many a
man if he had never heard nor seen; for that which he
hath heard and seen keeps him from hearing.<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Tyre</hi> and

               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> From the righteous judgement of God, in
leaving men to be blinded and made deaf, from and by
the means whereby they should hear and know; that as
it is with the Saints, all evill things are for their
good, so all good things are for their hurt, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6:
10. the meriting cause is unbelief and sin, but the deep
and hidden rise of all is Gods eternal dereliction of them,
God never intended love, speciall love to them; hence
he never speaks one word to them; 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3. Iohn</hi> 6. 65.
<hi>Many were offended at his words and forsook him.</hi> Now to
take off this offence, I said, <hi>None can come to me, except it
be given him of the Father,</hi> what is that? see <hi>v. 45. and</hi> 37.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> Hence see the reason, why the Word is so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
ineffectual to the souls of many men, that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
stirs them, that it's a strange thing to them; it's, <hi>Heb.</hi>
12. 19. like the law, <hi>a voice of words,</hi> a sound of words,
so they hear men speak, but understand no more than if
they spake in a strange language, or if they do, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
not them; or if it stirs, 'tis but as the blowing of the
wind upon a rock, which blusters for a time; but when
the wind is down they are still. Truly they hear the
word spoken, but they do not hear God speaking. They
heard <hi>Latimer</hi> speak, but not God speaking, they hear a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102140:55"/>
sound, which every one sayes, and they think is the word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
but they hear not God speaking it.</p>
            <p>One would wonder that those Jews that heard <hi>Iohn</hi>
and his Disciples, <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, nay Gods
voice from heaven, saying, <hi>This is my Sonne,</hi> that
they should not hear this, and receive him with all their
hearts, but they did not hear his voice. One would
wonder to see, that such things which a gracious heart
thinks, this would draw every heart, yet main not
stirr'd, things which the devils tremble at, and others
which Angels wonder at, yet they hear not. Oh they
hear not God speak, they are dead in their graves farre
from God; and there they are kept by the mighty power
of Satan, like one in a deep dark cave, kept by fiery dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
under the ground, and the tombit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne is laid upon
them. If Christ spake he would make the dead to hear,
and the blind to see.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> Hence see why the Saints find such changes
and alterations in themselves when they come to hear;
sometimes their hearts are quickned, fed and cherished
healed and comforted, relieved and visited; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
again dead and senselesse, heavy and hardned. <hi>Mark
8. 17, 18, 21. How is it ye do not understand?</hi> Nay which
is more, that the same truth which they hear at one time,
should affect them, and at another time doth not; the same
thing which they have heard a hundred times, and never
stirr'd them, at last should. The reason is, they heard
the Word of God spoken at one time, but not God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and they heard the Lord speaking that same
Word at another time; the Lord is in his Word at
one time, the Word goes alone at another time; as in
<hi>Eliah,</hi> the Lord was not in the whirlwind, but he spake
in the <hi>still voice</hi> and hence there he was to <hi>Elijah,
Luke 24. 25. with</hi> 32. not that you are to lay blame on
the Lord; for he blows where he listeth; but to make us
see 'tis not in outward means, nor 'tis not in our own
spirits to quicken our selves; and to make us ashamed
of our own darknesse, that when he speaks, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hear, there is so much power of spiritual death and
Satan yet within us, only out of his pitty he speaks some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
not that you should despise the outward word;
No, no, the Lord is there shining in Perfection of glory,
and that which doth thee no good, the Lord makes
powerfull to some others. But prize the Spirit of God
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102140:55"/>
in that Word, which alone can speak to thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> Of dread and terrour to all unregenerate
men. Hence see the heavy wrath of God against them: they
have indeed the Scriptures, and the precious Word of
God dispensed to them; but the Lord never speakes
one word unto them. If any one from whom we expect
and look for love, passe by us and never speak; What
not speak a word? and we call to him and he will
not speak, we conclude he is angry and displeased with us.
You look for love, do you not? you that hear every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
and come to Lectures, and you must out; tis
well, yes, you will say, <hi>His love is better than life,</hi> &amp; frowns
more bitter than death; Love? wo to me if the Lord do
not love me, better never been born. I hope he loves
me. Happy I if the mountains might fall on me, to crush
me in pieces if he loves me not, &amp;c. but consider if he loves
he will then speak peace unspeakable to thy conscience
when humbled, life to thy heart, joy in the Holy Ghost,
<hi>Isa. 57. 19. Iohn 6. 63. 1 Thes.</hi> 1. 6. but look upon
thy soul, and see this day in the sight of God, whether
ever the Lordspake one word to thee: outwardly indeed
he hath, but not inwardly; inwardly also, but not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<hi>to turn them from darknesse to light, and the power
of Satan to God, &amp;c.</hi> The voyce of God is full of Majesty,
it shakes the heart; 'tis full of life, it quickens the dead,
and light, and peace, and gives wisdom to the simple. <hi>Ps.
119. Opening of thy word gives light to the eyes.</hi> How
many women, ever learning and never knowing, and
many men learning and knowing what is said, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hear God speak? Then know the wrath of the Lord,
see and go home mourning under it. There is a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
wrath in this.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis the Lords sore wrath and displeasure, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 2.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
with <hi>vers.</hi> 4. If one should expect love from another to do
much for him, and he did not, it may be he would not
take it as a signe of displeasure: but if he will not do a
small thing, not speak a word to him, oh this is bitter;
what will not the Lord speak a word, not one word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
especially when thy life lies on it, thy soul lies on it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
lies on it, especially the Lord that is so mercifull
and and pittifull? this is a sign of sore anger.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis a token of Gods old displeasure, eternall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
displeasure; I know you cannot hear; hence though
God speaks, you hear him not: but why doth not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102140:56"/>
the Lord remove that deafnesse? you old hearers, that
have ears fat with hearing, but heavy, he never intended
love, else he would speak, there would be some time of
love. <hi>Rom. 11. 7, 8. The Elect have had it, others are
blinded, as 'tis written, God hath given them the spirit of
slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should
not hear to this day.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. 'Tis the Lords present displeasure. When a man
looks for love and speech, and he doth not speak at those
times he is not wont to speak; one may take it as no sign
of anger: but when the Lord shall speak usually, and
then he speaks not, this is a sad sign. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 6, 15.
He cries out of this, <hi>He answors me not by</hi> Urim <hi>nor dreams,</hi>
nor thee by the Gospel nor Law, neither where he useth
to answer. If this anger were to come, it were some
comfort: but when 'tis now upon thee, even that very
Sermon and Word whereby he speaks to others, but not
a word to thee.</p>

ear ever go together; for you will say, I feel no hurt
in this, I have heard and been never the better, but yet
that hath made me never the worse. Oh poor creature!
'tis because you feel it not; but when the time of misery
shall come, you will say, This is wo and load enough,
for the Lord to give no answer. <hi>Psal. 71. 9. We see not
our Prophets, nor any to tell us how long:</hi> so you that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise

               <hi>Vse</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> Hence examine whether ever you heard the
Lords voice or no: not only outwardly (for that you know
you have often done) but inwardly; and not only so, for
so ye may do, and yet your eares heavy; but effectually,
that if it be not so, you may be humble, and say, Lord
how have I spent my time in vain? and if it be so, you
may be thankfull, and say, Lord, what am I that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
God should speak to me?</p>
            <p>There is great need of trial of this, for a man may read,
hear and understand externally, what ever another may;
and yet the whole Scripture a sealed Book.</p>
            <p>There are therefore these three degrees, by which
you shall discern the effectuall voice of God, you must
take them joyntly.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. The voice of God singles a man out, and (though it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102140:56"/>
be generally written or spoken) speaks particularly to the
very heart of a man, with a marvellous kind of Majesty
and glory of God stamp't upon it; and shining in it.</p>
            <p>When a man hears things generally delivered, the
blessed estate of the Saints, the cursed estate of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
consolations to the one, curses to the other, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to faith and obedience, to both, and a man sits
by, and never thinks the Lord is now speaking, and
means me. Or if it doth so, yet thinks he intends me no
more than others, he hears not the Lord speaking; for
when he speaks, he speaks particularly to the very heart
of a man: he doth so fit the word to him, whether it be
the Word of the law to humble him, or of Gospel to
comfort, or of command to guide, as if the Lord meant
none but them.</p>
            <p>The word is like an exact picture, it looks every man
in the face that looks on it, if God speaks in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12,
13. <hi>It searcheth the heart, vers.</hi> 12. but <hi>vers.</hi> 13. he
speaks of God, how comes that in? because God, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of God comes with it when God speaks it; <hi>With
whom we have to do,</hi> why is that put in? because when the
Lord speaks, a man thinks now I have to do with God, if
I resist I oppose a God. Before this a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is one man is wrought on in a Sermon, another not.
GOd hath singled out one, not the other that day. Hence
take a man unhumbled, he hears many things, and it

speaks what they have been thinking may be true, that
they think this is the Lord, this is to me. <hi>Hosea 2. 14. I'le

but it goes further; it comes not only with an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power, but with a certain everlasting efficacy and
power on the soul. Thus 'tis here, <hi>vers. 38. Ye have not
his word in you,</hi> they had it out of them; and not only in
you, but abiding in you, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 23. born of incorruptible
seed,</hi> the Apostle seems to speak of a kind of birth by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
seed, and such are like goodly flowers which

of the four grounds three of them fall away. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 16.
Their fruit does not remain: they have some living affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at the present, but they go away and it dies. Look
but upon particulars, doth the Lord once speak by the
Word, and humble the heart? it never lists up its head
more; doth he reveal the glory of Christ? that light ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
goes out more. <hi>Isa. 60. 19. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 4, 5. As at the
first Creation, there was light, and so continues to this
day; so doth he give life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 26. You shall never
die more; doth he give peace and joy? no man shall take
their joy from them. <hi>Isa. 32. 17. Fruit of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and Peace, and assurance for ever.</hi> Doth he give the
Spirit of all these, which <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. comes by hearing of
faith? it shall abide for ever, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 17.</p>
            <p>That look as Gods love is everlasting, so his words
have an everlasting excellency and efficacy in them, and
goodness in them, the sweetest token of his love: and as
Christs purchase is only of eternall good things; so the
application of this purchase by the Word, 'tis of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
worth: peace, but peace eternal; life, light, favour,
joy, but joy eternal; like Mustard seed, though very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
yet mighty in increase, and never subdued again; so
that though it be but little, yet 'tis eternal; and hence
observe where God hath spoken effectually, the longer
the man lives, the more he grows in the vertue and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the word; another though wonderfully ravished for
a time, yet dies, most commonly outwardly in externall
Profession, but ever in inward savour; so that when you
hear the word, and it moves you, affects you, and <hi>Iohn
is a burning light, and you rejoyce therein, but 'tis but for a
season.</hi> The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>3. The voyce of the Lord comes not only thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and with eternal efficacy, but with such effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
as carries unto, and centers in Christ; so 'tis here: <hi>For
him whom God hath sent, you believe not. Iohn 6. 41.
They shall be taught of God:</hi> wherein doth that appear?
<hi>they shall hear, and learn so as to come to me;</hi> if the law
humbles them, it's such a humbling as drives them unto
Christ, poor and undon, <hi>Rom</hi> 10. 4. if the word gives peace
to them, 'tis such a peace, which at the last they find in
Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 17, 18. with 14. i it live holily, it lives unto
Christ, not meerly as to God, and to quiet conscience, unto

15. <hi>We judge that if we were dead, and Christ dyed for us,
we should then live unto him;</hi> if they grow up by the word,

yet it is strange to see, let the word speak what it will,

grace; Oh the love of Christ! oh the blood of Christ! com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
oh that I may live to honour Christ, and wrong
him no more! Duties; Oh the easie yoke of Christ! They
look upon the whole word rightly dispensed as the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms
voice, and truly his words are sweet.</p>
            <p>For a man may have some such fear, reformation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
as may continue, but never carry him out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto Christ. The Pharisees knew the law, were very
exact even till their death, profited as <hi>Paul</hi> said he did; yet
they had not the word abiding in them; because not
driven out of themselves to Christ, to rest there.</p>
            <p>Hence when men shall hear many things, but to what
end do you hear, or what vertue have the things you
hear? Do they only please fancy for a time? or do you
hear to increase your knowledge &amp; parts; or do you hear
for custome and company, and to quiet conscience? or are
you affected and sunk, but not driven by all to lay thy
head on Christ? the Lord never spake yet to thee; when
the word hath laid you on this foundation, truly it's office

            <p>Oh try your selves here, have you heard, but never

thought the man hath spoken to you, your hearts have
then swollen against him? or have you thus heard, but all

have you had some powerfull stroke which remains, but
it forceth you not out of your selves to Christ, there to

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. There may be an eternal efficacy of the Word, and
yet lye hid, and not felt for a time. The Word is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
you know, to seed, and that in this respect; the
seed it is cast under the clod in the winter-time, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
hath a vertue in it to grow; but it is hid, and comes not to
blade, of a good while, and when it doth blade,
yet it bears not fruit of a long time: So here, the Lord
may cast the seed of his Word into the heart; but
it is hidden for a time, it is not felt as yet, but there it is;
a word of threatning, a word of promise, a word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
a man may cast it by, and say, It belongs not to
me; a man may slight the command for a time: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
the Lord having cast his seed into the heart;
it shall spring up. As many a child, the father speaks to
it, and applies the word home to it, when it is of some
years, the child regards it not: But now stay some time,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102140:58"/>
till the Lord do bring it into some sad affliction; now a
man begins to think, I remember what my Father spake
to me once, and I regarded it not then: Now this seed
which was cast when the child was young, it shall spring
up twenty years after. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 22. Christ had said, <hi>He
would destroy the Temple, and raise it again in three dayes:</hi>
Now <hi>when he was risen from the dead, his disciples remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that which he had spoken to them,</hi> but they regarded
it not before; <hi>These things,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>have I spoken to
you whiles I was with you; but when the comforter is come,
he shall bring all these words to your remembrance that I have
said unto you.</hi> One sentence it may be that hath discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a mans sin, it lies hid; but when the time of ripening
draws near, you shall see the word will have marvelous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;
and that sin it may be will bring to mind twenty
sins; and that promise of God which gives but a little
consolation, consider'd in it self, it shall give marvelous
consolation. One would wonder to see what one word
will do, when the Lords time of blessing it is come.</p>
            <p>2. After that a Christian hath had the feeling of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
efficacy of the word, he may lose the feeling of it again,
and yet the being of it may remain; and the reason is this,
partly because there is not alwayes need of feeling the
like efficacy in the word. A man may have by the word
a marvelous deal of assurance of Gods love, and sense of
mercy and joy in the holy Ghost, he may have this in
the feeling of it: This word, it did lye hid for a time;
afterward it springs up and gives him peace. But he loses
his peace again, his Sun do's set, and it is midnight with
with him within twenty four hours, and he is as much
in the dark as before; Now the being of this peace is
there, but he hath no need of the feeling of it at all times;
the Lord he will reserve that till some time of tentation,
that he shall meet withall. As <hi>Paul,</hi> he had marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Revelations; but <hi>Paul</hi> had more need of humiliation,
than exaltation; and there was not that use of <hi>Pauls</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
those glorious manifestations to him; I <hi>will glory in
my infirmities:</hi> There was need for <hi>Paul</hi> to know the
evils of his heart, that he might walk humbly; and it did
not make so much for the glory of the Lord, as this, that
<hi>Paul</hi> should say, I have this misery and darkness, and sins,
and yet Jesus Christ he will take away all: There was
not need for <hi>Paul</hi> to have those joyes at all times, that he
had at one time. So the Lord he gives a Christian joy
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102140:59"/>
and peace, now there is no need for a Christian to have
it alwayes. <hi>I will pour floods of water on dry ground.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
if there should be nothing but rain, rain eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day and night, the ground would be glutted with rain,
and so turned into a puddle, but when the land is dry and
thirsty, now the ground hath need of rain: Let the
Earth make use of that rain it hath: and when it is dry
and thirsty, I will give more, saith the Lord. So
the Lord he gives the soul joy and peace; Now, if it should
continue, the very peace and joy of God, would not be
pleasant to the soul; or at least, not so pleasant as it
will be, when the Lord takes it away, and gives it the
soul again. A Christians comes to the meeting-house, and
the Lord fills the sailes of a poor soul, that he wonders
the Lord should meet him, and speak so suitably to him:
But as soon as he is gone out again, this is the complaint of
the soul, all is lost again; now the soul it sals a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
again. It is not for the glory of God to give the
soul such peace out of his Ordinances, as he doth in them;
the soul it would not prize the Ordinances of the Lord
so much; yet there it is; and when they come again,
the Lord, he either gives them the same refreshings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
or else there is a new spring.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The eternall efficacy of the word and voyce of God;
it may be preserved in an internall spirit of prayer, for
the continuance of it while he hath it, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of it when it is lost. <hi>Psalm. 119. 4, 5. Thou hast
commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. David</hi> he knew
his own weakness; yet he intimates with what power it
came on his heart: <hi>Oh that my soul were directed to keep thy
statutes;</hi> When the soul sees the bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty of a command,
and the good will of God, how sweet it is, and how ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
the way and work of God is: <hi>Oh that my heart were
directed to keep thy statutes.</hi> And so when it is gone, <hi>Psal.
63. 3. My soul thirsteth after thee, Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David, that
I may see thy glory and power, as I have seen thee in thy
sanctuary.</hi> He doth not say, that I may see thy glory
and power in thy sanctuary, though that might be too; no,
but <hi>that I may see thy glory and power, as I have seen thee
in the sanctuary. David</hi> he did find a want of seeing him
as he had done; yet the vertue of it did remain in a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of thirsting, and desire: <hi>My soul thirrsteth for thee,
as in a dry land where no water is, that I may see thee.</hi> A
Christian may have at some time such a glimpse (in hearing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102140:59"/>
the word) of Gods grace, of the exceeding riches of
Gods grace, and the love of God to him, that he may
be in a little heaven at that time; ravished in the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that mercy, that ever God should look to him. It
is so, and the word sayes so, and the soul is ravished
with wonderment at it; yet God is gone again, and the
soul loses it. Now the soul thinks, I have lost the efficacy
of Gods word, but it is not so; for thus it may be
preserved. Oh that I may see this God as I have done:
And all his life-time the soul may find the want of this,
&amp; yet it may be preserved in a spirit of prayer. For whem
the Lord hath given once a glimpse of his glory; the
soul it cannot be at rest, but it breatheth for more of that
mercy and presence; a Christian may find his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
marvellously refreshed at the word, he may taste
how good the Lord is, and he may lose it again: but this
may be preserved in a spirit of longing after this God, and
presence again. And I will say this, Brethren, A
Christian may find no good by the word to his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension;
he sees the admirable blessed estate of the Saints,
and exceeding riches of God in Christ, sees the sweetness of
the waies of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goes home &amp; thinks within himself, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
they that are in this condition: Blessed are they that
can walk thus with God; But I cannot, saith the soul. I
say it may find it thus, when he cannot find the reall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of the word as he would do; he may receive the
benefit of that word, if the Lord do but only give him a
heart to desire it. Oh that the Lord would but thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
himself to me; the soul may go away poor and
hungry from the word, and the Lord may yet reserve a
spirit of thirsting after that good which a man desires to
find; and there is the efficacy of the word there.</p>
            <p>As now there are two golden vessels; one a man fills,
and it is every day dropping, and he preserves it; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vessel he do's not fill, but with something that he hath,
He is every day widening of it. So some Christians,
the Lord he's a filling of them; others, the Lord he do's
not fill them with such peace and joy; ay, but though the
Lord is not filling of them, he is a widening of them:
there is such a vertue that the Lord do's enlarge the heart
with secret desires and longings after more of Gods grace,
and Christs: The Lord he saith, I intend to make this
man a vessell of glory; and I intend he shall have a great
deal of glory and peace at the last. The Lord he leaves
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102140:60"/>
such an impression of the word upon him, as that thereby
he enlargeth the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Open thy mouth wide, &amp; I will fill it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. A Christian may have the everlasting efficacy of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the word and voice of God preserved in a spirit of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
and love to the Lord, for those joys, and good
that it finds by the word sometimes. When it feels that
the sweet and savour of the word is gone, a spirit of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
and love to the word that doth remain; The
Lord he preserves the efficacy of the word in this way.
<hi>Psal. 119. 7. I</hi> shall, <hi>saith David, then praise thee with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse
of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous
judgements.</hi> The Lord he may teach his people his
righteous judgements; and the savour and feeling, and
strength of them to their feeling may be gone, and yet it
is preserved in a spirit of thankfulnesse and praise, that
ever the Lord should shew it such mercy. When the
Spirit is gone, the spirit of love and thankfulnesse remains.
As now a man hath heard the word, the Lord he hath
effectually wrought on him, and changed his heart, and
drawn him to himself; a Christian it may be he may lose
those sorrows and humiliations, and the remembrance of
those things; yet there remaineth to his dying day this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
he blesseth God, and wondereth at God, that ever
he should make the word effectuall; that he should leave
so many thousands in the world, and cast his skirt over
him, and say to him, Live; this do's remain still.</p>
            <p>Brethren, the Lord do's sometimes let light into a mans
mind to discover his sin: now this light it do's not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
overcome the power of sin: But now the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God for that word which hath convinced it; had I
never seen my sin, saith the soul, I should never a sought
for power against it, and pardon of it; and this continues
now, and cannot but continue; here is the efficacy of the
word, the word of Gods grace; though the flower of it
be gone, yet there is an eternal power of the word; that
the soul can say, It hath come to me, and helped me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
these sins; and the soul wonders at the Lord, it
should be so much as it is. So again, a Christian he finds
marvellous refreshings and affection whiles he is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
when he is gone away, he finds not the same, but
he blesseth God for those affections he finds, and there
remains an eternall efficacy of the word.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. The eternall efficacy of the word, it may be and is
preserved, by nourishing, increasing and restoring the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102140:60"/>
new man that is eternall. There is a double efficacy that
the word hath; the first is to beget a Christian to life,
and this new man is eternall. I conceive all the actions
of the new man may be suspended, and the increasings of
the new creature may be decayed, though God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
it again: But this never do's decay, it never dies:
<hi>He that is born of God cannot sin, because he is born of God;
and because the seed of God remains in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There is efficacy in the word when it hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a man to nourish him up; and so the word it is food <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to him, that was seed to him to beget him, which food is
eternall. How is it eternal? Is it in this, that now the
sweetnesse, savour and remembrance of every thing that
doth refresh him, shall last in it self? No, but in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it is eternall, in that it leaveth its secret vertue in
the nourishing of that which is eternall. As now <hi>Adam</hi>
when he was in innocency, and had an immortall body,
his food it should have been an immortall food to him;
but how should that have been? should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e alwayes have
had the same strength, from the same diet, which he ate
long before? No, but in this respect it should have been
an immortall food to him, in that it was to nourish that
which was to be eternal: So it is here, the word of Gods
grace it begets a man, it humbles a man, and draws the
soul to Christ; but afterwards, there are many things
that God speaks to the soul in the word that hath an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
vertue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

souls of his people like watered gardens, in peace, and joy,
and life. Now look as if so be Trees by water or by some
springs that run by it, and slide away, and ye cannot tell,
which it is that makes them to grow; yet ye know this,
there is in all of them joyned together, a secret insensible
vertue; that every one of them addes something to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
flourishing of the Tree: So it is here, the Saints of God,
the word of God it comes to them, and passes by them;
and ye cannot tell whether this part or that part of the
word leave any vertue, but many times a man feels no
vertue; yet it is manifest, here is a flourishing Christian,
here is heart, and life, and peace that it hath with God,
and the soul it remains flourishing; there is a secret ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
all the words that run by and passe by the souls of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102140:61"/>
Gods people, they do leave a marvellous vertue, to make
the soules of Gods people like watered gardens, and to
increase in grace. Note it by the way you that live under
the means of grace, <hi>your souls shall be like watered gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;</hi>
if God have spoken to you first or last, the Lord
speaks many times to you, sometimes affecting, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
warning, sometimes convincing and humbling,
and speaking Peace, and there is a vertue that remaines,
and if ye find it not, know that God hath not spoken to
you.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. The eternall efficacy of the word may be preserved
in a power of Conflict against the power of sin: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Lords power of the Word does principally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in this life, though not in a power of victory, I mean
a compleat victory, yet an imperfect and incompleat victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
there ever is first or last where ever there is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

out, and speaks to his heart, &amp; sets him at variance with
his sin, and with himself for his sin, and he joynes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>re, help therefore, Lord, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and mercy and means, and here he keeps him, and
here he holds. Truly, brethren, here is an eternall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and such a vertue as no hypocrites have, that have
some sting of conscience, and after they have some peace,
they are at truce with their sins. No, there is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
conflict and warfare, and I do assure you there is
an everlasting power gone forth, <hi>Mat. 12. 20. Christ
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102140:61"/>
will not break the bruised reeed, nor quench the smoaking flax,
till judgement come to victory;</hi> Therefore there may be
judgement, but it may not come to victory, there may
be smoak and fire, and it may almost go out, and the
Lord he blowes it up again, and at the last, though it
be weak and little, and he think with himself he shall
never get strength again, yet the Lord will give victory in
his time.</p>
            <p>Only be cautious here; I told you there is an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
victory, the Lord never sets his people at variance
with their sin, but they have victory, but it's an incompleat
victory; Saith the Lord, <hi>I will drive out the Hittites, and
Canaanites, and Perizzites before you, but I will do it by
little and little.</hi> There is many a Christian that findes
within himself a Spirit of warfare against his sin, and did
he examin himself, he should find a Spirit of victory;
but hee thinkes he hath none because his victory is not
compleat. If he had a heart so to believe as never to
doubt more, and such quickning as never to be dead more,
never to depart from God more, now I should think the
Word comes with power; but <hi>I</hi> find that these evils
prevaile against me. There is many a one does scorn the
kindnesse of Christ, because he finds not compleat victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but darknesse remaines still, and sinfull lusts remain
still, therefore the Word doth me no good at all, saith he.
The Lord he hath given thee a Spirit of Conflict, and
hath s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t thee at an everlasting distance with thy sin, and
he doth give thee some victory. Beloved, a Christian may
decay in the power of the grace of Christ, which he hath
received from the Word, and voice of God in the Word,
and he may decay, and grow to a very low estate; yet he
shall find this, the Word of the Lord hath come with
power to him, it will recover his soul again, and so the
efficacy of the Word is eternall. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 72. its said of
Christ, that <hi>his People shall fear him so long as Sun and
Moon shall endure,</hi> that is, continually, all their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.
It may be said, there be many that find decay
of their service and obedience, and lose their fear of
the Lord, and their dread, and their humble walking
before him, <hi>He shall come as the rain on the mowen
grasse:</hi> many times a Christian hath his flourishing time as
the grasse, but when the grasse is mowen, it is as a dry
chip; so the soul it may grow dry, as dry as a chip. Now
where is your sap and savour? but I tell you, if you belong
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102140:62"/>
to the Lord Jesus, the rain it will fall again, the Word of
God set on by the Spirit of Christ, it shall fall upon you as
the rain on the mowen grasse, and you know that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
little by little, and puts on a green coat again.
Here is the eternal love of the Lord Jesus to his People,
and thus the eternal efficacy of the word does continue.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Vse</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> is of exhortation. Oh Brethren and beloved
in the Lord Jesus, may a Christian hear the Word of God
spoken, and yet never hear God speak? may he hear it
externally and not internally? then rest not in externall
hearing, and with some little movings, and affections,
and stirrings of the Word of Gods grace in hearing. Let
not the Word be to you as the sound of many waters, and
a noise, no efficacy of the Word that do remain on your
soules. Brethren and beloved in Christ, <hi>I</hi> lay my finger
on the sore in these times. Oh the contempt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Christ, though I believe it hath its efficacy in the
heart of the Elect: that is the thing that I presse, never
be content with external hearing, though thou mayest
have some affection, and know new things, unlesse thou
find the Lord speaking with an eternall efficacy to thy
soul. I conceive two things are to be done, that the
word may come with an everlasting efficacy; although
something is to be done by Ministers; that is, to preach
truth, and Gospel-truth, fetch't from heaven with many
prayers, &amp; soaked truth with many tears. <hi>Ye shall know the
truth, &amp; that truth shal make you free.</hi> Convicting truth. <hi>We
preach,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>in the demonstration of the Spirit.
The Spirit of God when he commeth, he convinceth the world
of sin.</hi> Let Ministes do so. Preach convincing truth and
Gospel-truth, fetch'd from heaven, and bathed in tears.
Oh brethren, let the fire burn clear, let there not be
more smoak than fire, it will never come with power
then; convincing Gospel-truth, set on by the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit of the Lord, and this will set a Christian
at liberty; there is never such a Sermon that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ones of God preach to you; if it come not with a
power to loosen you and call you home; it comes with a
power to blind you: it is <hi>an ax at the root of the Trees;</hi>
but I leave this. What means ought the people to use,
that the Word of God may come with efficacy?</p>
            <p>Them that are in their unregenerate estate, the Lord
only knows how to work on their hearts; they must
come to the outward means. I speak to the Saints of God,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102140:62"/>
I leave others to the infinite mercy of the Lord; <hi>It is not
in him that willeth or runneth, but in the Lord that sheweth
mercy.</hi> In the use of means.</p>
            <p>1. Means. Do not only see thy infirmities and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
but pray to God to give thee a heart bleeding under
the sense of thy many infirmities. Many times men slight
them, and are not sensible of them; <hi>I</hi> do not say wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
and wilfulnesses, but thy infirmities and weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
get a heart mourning under them, A Christian
is made up of infirmities and weaknesses, a man
would not think there is that in another, which
he knows by himself. Oh brethren, labour for a broken
heart in the sense of your many infirmities and weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
darknesse and enmity, vanity and unsavourinesse, the
Lord will have his time to speak to such a soul. <hi>Break up
the fallow ground of your hearts,—lest my wrath break
out with fire:</hi> the Lord hath promised <hi>to dwell with the
poor and contrite.</hi> Look as it was with our Saviour Christ,
they brought the sick and the lame ones to him, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
went out from Christ to heal them all. Bring thy
sick and blind heart to Christ, and vertue shall go forth
from Christ to heal it.</p>
            <p>2. Draw near to God in the Word, by looking on it as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
God speaking to thee. We are far from God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cannot hear him: draw near to him when you
come to the external Word, when you come to
hear the Word, hear it as the voyce of God;
<hi>You heard the Word as the Word of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 2. 3.</note> which you felt in
you. I do not speak that the soul should take every thing
that Ministers speak as the Word of God, but that which
is the Word of God, take it as God speaking. I am not
able to expresse the infinite unknown sweetnesse, and
mercy, and presence of God, that you shall find thus
comming. I know it is a common truth, but I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to tell you, I have not for many a year under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
this truth, and I see but little of it yet; ye have
heard of it, but ye do not understand what it is to hear
God speaking. When God hath an intent to harden a
mans heart and to damn him, either he shall have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
against the man, or else if he hath not a prejudice
against the man, there is a secret loathing of the truth,
in regard of the commands of it, and that is all, and the
Lord he hardens, and blinds, and prepares for eternall
ruin, all the men in the world by this means, that live
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102140:63"/>
under the means. When the Lord spake to <hi>Samuel, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
heard a voyce, but he heard it not as spoken by
God, but when he took <hi>Elies</hi> counsel, and saw it was the
Lord that spoke; now he listens to the voice of the Lord,
and now the Lord opens all his mind to him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Do not trust to the external word. It is a heaven on
earth to hear the word exalted, a glorious thing to hear
the word of God as Gods word; but trust to the free grace
of God in it, and the Spirit of God in Christ to set on that
Word. When they brought the lame, and blind, and halt
to Christ, they looked for the Word and the Power of it;
<hi>Speak the Word, Lord, and thy servants shall be whole;</hi> so
bring you blind, lame, and halt souls to Christ, and trust
to the free grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>The Work of the
Lord it shall prosper in his hand;</hi> so the Word of the Lord
it shall prosper in his hand also.</p>
            <p>Lastly, so seek the Lord, and so hear the Word, so see
the truth, and so hear the truth, as that you lay up your
happinesse in this world, in closing with the truth and
with the word. Brethren, what is a mans happiness in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but to close with God and Christ? I cannot come to
God now, the most that I can have of God now is in his
word; if it be happiness in heaven to close with God in
Christ, truly then it is a mans happinesse to close with
God in his word on earth; and if it be your happiness, lay
up your happiness in it.<note place="margin">Prov. 3.</note> 
               <hi>My son,</hi> saith Solomon, <hi>if thou wilt
hear my words, let them not depart from thine eies; keep them
in thy middest of thy heart;</hi> place thy happiness in them.<note place="margin">Vers. 22.</note> So
<hi>shall they be life to thy soul.</hi> Neverthelesse Brethren, let a
mans soul be set upon anything in the world, when he
comes to hear, besides the word; if he lay not up
his happinesse in closing with the word; truly, the word
it will be like a song to him. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells
them, <hi>Their hearts were gone after their covetousness:</hi> When
a man comes to hear a Sermon, there is a Sermon
and the Market, there is a Sermon and a friend to speak
withall; and so many young people will go abroad to
hear Sermons; What is the end of it? It is, that yee
may get wives and husbands many of you; but it is not
your blessednesse to close with the Lord in his word. <hi>I</hi>
have known some men that have had a distaste against
the truth of the Lord; and <hi>I</hi> have known them for
many a day, they have not bee able to understand the
truth of the Lord. When it shall be thus with a man,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102140:63"/>
that a mans heart is set on something else besides the
word of the Lord, that it is not my happinesse to close
with the truth of the Lord; such a man shall never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the truth of the Lord. Though the word be sweet
to you sometimes, if your blessednesse do not lye in
this, to enjoy God; Oh this Gospel of God, and these
Commands of God, that your blessednesse do not lye
in cleaving to the Lord in his word; <hi>I</hi> say, it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
truth, you shall be blinded and harned by the word:
For here is a Rule; Whatsoever a mans heart is set on,
as his chiefest good, the presence of that good it
comes with power: So here, the precious Gospell of
Christ, when the presence of it commands the heart, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is good enough for it, and it closeth with it, and
with Christ in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> beseech you therefore, Beloved in Christ, set
upon the use of these meanes, think within your selves,
What if the Lord had left me without the word? <hi>I</hi> will
tell you what ye would have been. Look upon these
poor <hi>Indians,</hi> herds of Beasts; look upon others on their
Ale-benches, enemies to the Lord, such a one thou hadst
been.</p>
            <p>This blessed word and voyce of God, every tittle
of it cost the blood of Christ; written all the lines of it
in the blood of Christ. Oh, make much of it, and it will
make much of you; it will comfort you, and strengthen
you, and revive you; &amp; if the word come not with power,
ye shall be under the power of something else; if not
under the power of the word, then under the power
of some lust. What is the reason that these poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that are come to the tryall for life and death, that
have fallen into such sinnes as were never heard of?
What is the reason that they are under the power of
their lusts? <hi>I</hi> will tell you what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>My son,
if wisdome enter into thy heart, and discretion be pleasant
to thy soul, it shall keep thee from the strange woman,</hi> and
sinful companion. If it be pleasant, here is the reason, the
word of Gods grace it never came with power, or if it
came with power, powerless the word of Gods grace
hath been to them; and because it hath not come with
power, the Lord hee hath given them over to the
power of their lusts, and sinfull distempers. Oh Brethren,
truly <hi>I</hi> cannot see how any man can maintain any
evidence of Gods electing love, that shall hear and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102140:64"/>
hear, and good dayes mend him not, nor bad dayes pair
him: that can commend a Sermon, and speak of it; but
that efficacy is not known to him, neither doth he mourn
for the want of it; but the eternall efficacy thereof is a
stranger to it. 1 <hi>Thes. 1. 5. Knowing,</hi> saith the Apostle,
<hi>your Election of God;</hi> How did he know it? For, saith he,
<hi>Our Gospel came not to you in word, but in power;</hi> ye will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
the hearts of your Ministers, when the word comes
with power. Let me say this, and so I conclude.</p>
            <p>I remember the Lords threatning; <hi>I will take away the
staffe of bread, and ye shall eat, and shall not be satisfied;</hi>
When the Lord shall let men have the word, when the
Lord shall not take away the word, but the staffe of the
word. Suppose you poor Parents, Fathers, and Mothers;
your Families should have good Corn, but when you
come to eat it, no strength at all, but ye dye and wear
away; and others that are about you, they have planted
the same Corn, and eat and are satisfied; What will ye
do in this case? You would set apart a day of fasting and
prayer, and say, Good Lord, what a curse is upon me?
my poor children are dying before me, others have the
staffe of Corn; but my Family have no strength at all. Ye
would mourn if it were thus with your poor Cattell. Oh,
for poor Creatures to have the word, but the efficacy of
it to be taken away; no blessing, no power at all. Oh
poor Creatures, go and say! Oh the curse of God that lies
on me, the wrath of God that lyes on my servants, it is a
heavy plague. But Oh the sweetnesse and excellency of
it, when a Christian shall find everlasting vertue and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
conveyed to him by the word.</p>
            <p>All you that are before the Lord this day, ye shall see
an end of all perfection; but eternall things are not they
worth something? You shall see an end of all delights
and contentments; but this shall comfort you when you
are a dying, that the word which you attended upon the
Lord in, such peace, and such consolations I have found
by it; and the efficacy of that word then remaines with
you; nay, goes to heaven with you. <hi>I commend you
therefore to the word of his grace, which is able to build you
up unto an eternall inheritance amongst them that are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
