            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>GOOD <hi>Poetry</hi> needs no Apology, and Bad deserves no Commendation. I would not have the <hi>Reader</hi> think, I make Mine come under the latter Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, meerly out of Formality, because I would be so complaisant, as to let Others commend it for me: But, I'll assure you, I do it only to let the World know, I am not so unnatural a Parent, as to venture my Issue in the World, without a Word in its behalf. Of all Writers, <hi>Poets</hi> are most Happy; for while Others are puzling their Brains, to find a Reason for their Scribling; the Question was never put to a <hi>Poet,</hi> Why he Wrote? There are some <hi>Je ne scay quoy</hi>'s in the World, we can give no
<pb facs="tcp:58961:3"/>
Reason for: 'Tis as Natural for a <hi>Poet</hi> to write Verse, as 'tis for a <hi>Tory</hi> to talk Non-sense, or for an <hi>Old Sinner</hi> to Die impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The greatest Reason that obliged me to Print these Trifles, was this: I had been so Vnfortunate, as to let them go out of my Hands; and had no other way to procure them, but by promising to Print them. If they advantage the <hi>Bookseller,</hi> I have my Desire. I am sensible enough of my own Failings; and I could heartily beg a Pardon for each Fault; but in so doing, I should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my own Errors; which, perhaps, every one will not find. If I am somewhat Vnfashionable in my Writing, I cannot help it: I never intended to humour a Pedantick Age; nor to turn Bombast, to please Fop's and Fools. I never thought our Language so poor, that it needed to be set off with Words coin'd in the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> Mould; nor did I ever think of Flying, but I thought on <hi>Icarus;</hi> and how soon your soaring Wits dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to Nonsense. I would make This of Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> my Maxim:</p>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:58961:3"/>Tho' <hi>Poets</hi> may of Inspiration boast,</l>
                  <l>Their Rage, ill govern'd, in the Clouds is lost:</l>
                  <l>But who proportion'd Wonders can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close,</l>
                  <l>At once his Judgment, and his Fancy shows.</l>
                  <p>I must confess, I never took that for Wit, which was (to use a New-born word) <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by-any-Fancy-fathomable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>First Part:</hi> The most liable to Censure in it, is the <hi>Translations;</hi> wherein I have taken a large Scope; but yet, I think, I have not injur'd the Sense of the <hi>Author.</hi> Whoever pretends to express the Conceit of a <hi>Latin Poet,</hi> in a Litteral way, must have a more compendious Brain than I. Neither do I want a sufficient Modern Authority, for this Paraphrastical way of Writing. I had Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated the Best of <hi>Horace,</hi> his Art of <hi>Poetry;</hi> but finding it so excellently perform'd by the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Roscommon,</hi> I was unwilling my Weakness should be a Foyl to his Wit; and therefore committed it to the Flames, to save Others the Labour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:58961:4"/>
As for the <hi>Second Part,</hi> the <hi>Pastoral</hi>: I shall only say this, That I meant it for a Piece of <hi>Dramatique</hi>; but I Writ it before I knew any such thing, as an Art in <hi>Poetry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, the main Question will be, Why I could not have chosen more serious Subjects to have Treated on? But let those ask <hi>Youth,</hi> Why it is VVanton? As the <hi>Spring,</hi> Why it produces Buds and Flowers? Ask <hi>Rivers,</hi> Why they flow? And <hi>Fountains,</hi> Why they don't with-hold their Springs? I could, at this Time, have Published a <hi>Poem,</hi> that might have got me more Praise, both as to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Parts of the <hi>Poem,</hi> and the Gravity of the Subject: But it was not my intent to Publish any, especially such as These; but they were meerly ex'orted. Neither shall I think they do, in the least, detract from <hi>Virtue</hi>; since I have Read the <hi>Poems</hi> of <hi>Beza, Hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> our own <hi>Donne,</hi> &amp;c. But, at worst, it may pass for a Pardonable (if not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable) Extravagance, in one of my Years. I wish, all the VVild Oats sown by the Youth of this Age, did produce no worse an Harvest, than This. <hi>Poetry,</hi> tho' it be an useless Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it is an innocent Recreation; and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb facs="tcp:58961:4"/>
that arise from it, are best known to them that exercise it. But those that cry down <hi>Poetry,</hi> in the general, forget that Part of the <hi>Sacred Writings</hi> were delivered in <hi>Verse:</hi> And it's well known, what Vse <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> have made of the <hi>Heathen Poets,</hi> in their Writings.

exercise my Hand again this way, it shall be on some Graver Subject. I hope, here are no Expressions can offend the Tenderest <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>; if there be, I declare I meant nothing less.

                     <head>A DISCOURSE OF LIFE.</head>
                     <p>IT is not my intent to make a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Discourse of Life; neither shall I endeavour to invent a stratagem to prolong it: to a Wise-Man it is not so desirable, and none but a Mad-Man would bestow Cost and Pain in adorning an Inn, in which he must tarry but for a Night. Whether those things Physitians call <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Moisture,</hi> and <hi>Natural Heat</hi> are any thing, or nothing, I know not; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are incapable of solid Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I shall not stand to examine. But of this I am sure, That the Lamp of my Life shall burn as long as it has any matter to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58961:69"/>
work upon; and if a puff of denouncing Fate shall blow it out before its Oyl be quite spent, I have no reason to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; but rather to bless the kind blast, that wafts me to the serenity of Darkness. I shall not fill my Discourse with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable words of <hi>Deseccation, Arefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Alimentation, Bodies tangible,</hi> and <hi>Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,</hi> the Glory of the <hi>Physitians</hi>; words as ridiculous as their Practice is poor; But my intent is only to discourse of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of Life. Though Mortality be writ <hi>on</hi> the Fore-head of all our Enjoyments, and we know that this Garland of Mirth one Sun does produce, another shall wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet how apt are we to bless our selves under the Umbrage of our Verdant Gourd, unmindful of the envious Worm that sculcks at the bottom, and will soon eat down the pleasure of it. Our Life is so uncertain, and the happiness of it so unconstant, that we can only tell that we live; and that there is such a thing as Happiness. Some Pleasure there is, but it is mixed with Misery; we have some Honey but 'tis alloy'd with Gall; some
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58961:69"/>
lucid Intervals, some gentle gales of Mirth and Ease; but soon a black Cloud of Fate does intervene. We are all the Balls of Fortune; some she unfortunately throws into the Hazzard, and others she bandies about at her pleasure: But to a Man of Resolution, all things are alike: He's nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puff'd up with Plenty, nor discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with Want; He values not the praise of Fools, nor the frowns of Knaves; He can despise what the Great call Good; The Vicisicutedes, and changes of Fortune are no more to him than the Change of the Moon: Certainly there is no better Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote against an exorbitant desire of the World, than a generous Contempt of its Pleasures. What wise Man would court the ruined Beauties of an old weather-heaten World? What Symetry or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is there in its Features? What Votary did it ever make Eternally Rich? What Admirers did it ever make happy? I had rather be the Servant of <hi>Aristotle</hi> or <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> than the Heir of <hi>Midas. Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius</hi> his Golden Ass, is the exact Emblem of a great Man. Happiness is no more
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58961:70"/>
consistent with Superfluity, than it is with Penury. Content is a greater stranger to the Palace, than 'tis to the Cottage. Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids and Spires of Steeples are rent by the Thunder-bolt, when the low Houses remain untouch'd. The lofty Hills are cloathed with Barrenness, while the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Valleys rejoyce in their Plenty. If there be any thing Great below, 'tis a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of Mind: If there be any Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, 'tis Virtue: If there be any Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, 'tis Wisdom. Virtue is a Sacred <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulet,</hi> who ever wears it, is secured from the stings of Serpentine Greatness. Figure to your self a Virtuous Man, though Poor; how well he becomes the meanest condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? he looks like a transparent Taper in a gloomy Night; like a Jewel amongst a heap of Rubbish and Stones: Though he chuses his Seat upon the Earth, his Mind is employ'd above the Clouds; like the Poetick Birds, who sing on the tops of Trees, though their Nest be in the Hedge. It shews more of a generous and Heroick temper, to contemn the grandeur of the World, than to desire it. The
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58961:70"/>
greatest Spirits that ever blest the World with their Memory, have done it. A better sight it was to see <hi>Scipio</hi> retired into a Wood, after all his Conquests, than to behold him at the head of his Army. <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> the best Man that ever <hi>Greece</hi> bred, who delivered his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Thebes</hi> from the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, whose Conquests could have lifted him to the highest pitch of Pride and Profit; yet was he such a Contemner of Riches, that when he died, he left not enough behind him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o defray his Funeral Charges. Natural Reason can easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover how much they are mistaken in Happiness, who place it in Wealth, and outward Grandeur. What the chiefest Felicity is, cannot easily be determin'd; but of this we are sure, That it is hard to be obtain'd. We may truly say of Happiness, That Philosophers seek it, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines find it, and only Religious Men enjoy it. The chiefest Felicity, by the excellent <hi>Boethius,</hi> is defined to be <hi>Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

things: A state certainly not attained by any in this Life. All that Men call Good may be reduced to these Three heads, Either the Goods of Fortune; the Goods of the Mind; or the Goods of the Body. But where shall we find one Man that enjoys 'em all? We see we purchase one by the loss of the other. If I am Rich, and great in Fortune, yet I may want a greatness of Mind: If I am Beautiful, Rich, and Learned, yet I may be too Bookish, and want a complaisant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor to render me agreeable. Had <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusalem</hi> lived to this Age, 'tis like he might have acquired these accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but our Age is too short to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of 'em.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58961:71"/>
of knowing what it is before we enjoy it, none would venture on so tedious a Fatigue: Yet do we naturally desire our Lives to be lengthn'd out, though our Misery encrease with it. As a Man is a Creature, he is Mortal; as he is Rational, he is Miserable: For his Reason is but the Usher to introduce his Misery, and the Perspective through which he beholds his trouble. Whoever expects to have an entire Happiness here, may expect to see the Orbes move irregularly; Rivers flow back to their Fountains, and Rivulets command the Ocean. The most we can enjoy, is but a Scene of Bliss; Fate will change the Scene, let down the Curtain, and put an <hi>Exit</hi> to our phancied Joys. Why then should we court a Shadow we cannot hold? and be desirous of a Good that depends only upon the imagination? For certainly there is no other Happiness here, but what is phancied; we sooth our selves with hopes of future Joys, and Paint what the Wise call Vanity and Vexation of Spirit, like the Statue of Pleasure. Well then, if Life does afford
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58961:72"/>
no Happiness that is real, let us expect it at Death; certainly there 'tis to be found, according to that of <hi>Ovid,</hi>

                     <p>Indeed there is no better way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Vanity of Life, than the Contemplation of its contrary, Death: Death, that frees us from the Miseries of Life; that removes us from the distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Noise and Tumult; that delivers us from the Fetters of Diseases, and Lashes of Pain. Sleep, which is the image of Death, how grateful, how refreshing is it to a Natural Body? When I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, I am in the Land of Forgetfulness;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58961:72"/>
happily buried in a pleasing silence; my Soul for that time is, as it were, removed from its troublesome companion, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Oblivion has seiz'd on all my Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; all my Pains and Aches are still and quiet: What a Tranquility then must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Death, which is Sleep in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree, Sleep in its perfection? When I am Dead, I need no pleasing murmurs of Winds in the Trees, nor sleepy groanings of purling Brooks, to lull my Senses asleep: I need no soft melancholy Musick, to charm the Evil-Spirit from my Eye-lids, they close na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally: The Province of Death affords no Noise, Hurry, or Contention; but a lucid Ray of Serenity informs each Breast: <hi>Morpheus</hi> is the only God they adore; and Tranquility the only Pleasure they admire. Death is the beginning of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and the consummation of it. Happiness has not a motion, as other things, by degrees; it has not a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing and Mellowing time, like Fruits; but is born in Perfection. The destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Life is the Generation of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58961:73"/>
And if Happiness be not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able before Death, how diligent ought we to be, to make our Lives as Happy as we can? To counterfeit a Happiness, and please our selves with it on the Ocean of Life, 'till we arrive at the Harbour of Death.</p>
                     <p>To live well, is to be Wise betimes; and Wisdom is attained by so few, that we have reason to doubt, whether <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Rationale</hi> be a good definition of Man in general. Methinks it is a bold saying of the <hi>Sieur de Mountaigne, That were he to live over his Life again, he would live as he had done:</hi> Were the <hi>Sieur</hi> my Equal, I should accuse him of Madness and Folly. For my part, I am but in the <hi>Twenty third</hi> Year of my Age; and have always devoted my Time to the study of Learning and Wisdom; yet were I to Correct the <hi>Errata</hi>'s of my short Life, I would quite alter the Press: Not an Action have I done, but is lyable to the censure of right Reason; and not a Line have I Written; but has need of Correction. Certainly the Life of the best amongst us, is but
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58961:73"/>
one great Blot. We may see Folly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the wisest of Philosophers; when they would perswade us to follow their dictates, at the same time they grow Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and morose; and the Tub of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes</hi> is but the derision of an <hi>Alexander.</hi> Should I speak of those Worthies, that have won the immortal Garland of Honor in the Field, we should find Folly and Rashness always mixed with their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes: Should I speak of <hi>Alexander?</hi> he Slew <hi>Parmenio</hi>: Should I mention <hi>Marcus Antonius?</hi> he lost the World for a <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>; a Woman, a thing in Petticoats: What an odious sight must it be, to see this great Man, this <hi>Anthony,</hi> who not long since appear'd in Iron, and Painted it with Blood, now prostrate at the Feet of a silly Woman? To see Honor and Glory subdu'd by Beauty? Hence we may conclude, That Effeminacy is mixed with the greatest Valour, and Folly with the greatest Wisdom. All our Actions are mark'd with the Character of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Our Humanity supposeth us frail and inconstant. The Decaying Nature
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58961:74"/>
of what we Enjoy, tells us every day, there is no solid Happiness in Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why then should we be so stupid to court this lucid Vapor to remain in our inglorious Houses of Clay? Why should we be so Tyrannous and Cowardly, to desire our Souls to remain in Prison, and keep them unblest from their Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But it is natural to Man to desire Life; and the Wisest and Stoutest Men do it: Therefore <hi>Curtius</hi> gives a good description of a Valiant Man; not to hate Life, but to contemn Death: <hi>i. e.</hi> To have no servile fear of a dissolution, or tremble at grizly Hairs, the Emblems of Death. How vainly do the Old envy the Pleasures, or rather Follies of the Young? An amazing spectacle it is, to see an old grizly Lady applying the black Patches to her Face; tampering of her Fucus, and courting her new-vamp'd Visage in her Glass? though the stench of Death has seiz'd her already, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedes the rankness of her Powders. There is nothing so much incenses a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as to tell her, She is Old: That
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58961:74"/>
unlucky word, <hi>Old,</hi> brings all the Blood in her Body to her Face; and for a time sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the place of artificial Beauty. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the Men free from this Folly; 'tis a contagious Plague, a Gangrene that spreads over the whole Body of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: To see an Old-Man with the mark of Death in his Forehead, buttressed up with a Crutch (like the Pinion-end of an Old-House) spitting and spawling, as if he did intend to drown himself with an inundation of Phlegm: To see him, like a superannuated Ape, acting all his Juvenile Follies over; chewing his Cud upon some delicious <hi>Cavalcade,</hi> perform'd by him in <hi>Whetstones-Park,</hi> or <hi>White-Friers</hi>: To see him pruning of his Head, and pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hairs from his Cloaths; setting up for a Spark, with a Cravat of <hi>Point de Venice,</hi> which the longitude of his Beard will not suffer to be seen: To hear him repeating some of his Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the <hi>Academy:</hi> To hear him talk of his Assignation-Notes, and telling the young Wantons, how many Mistresses he formerly had; how he knew the

                     <p>Were Envy a Vertue, I should exercise it in nothing more than in coveting a Country-Man's life, who has enough of the World to keep him from being behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and burthensome to Friends; enough to make him an ordinary Gentleman, and not enough to advance him to the place of a Justice of the Peace; enough to secure him from Contempt, and not enough to make him Honourable, or Miserable, which you please: For Honour is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Plague, the damn'd Fatigue of Life, the Devil that bewitches Mortals,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58961:75"/>
the <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> that leads Men into Ruine. Were I to lay a Curse upon a Man, a Curse, that should have more than all <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Plagues in it, I would wish him Honourable; I would damn him to a gilt Coach and Six, two cast off Lackqueys al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to attend him; always to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Honors; Complementing and Caressing of Ladies; often to be at Balls, and never to appear but in uncomfortable Grandeur. Indeed, Princes and Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages cannot properly be said to live; they are but the Pageants of the People, the Sign-Posts of Honor; what they count their Glory (the praise of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) is but Air and Wind. It was a noble and resolute act of <hi>Horace,</hi> to chuse the melancholy Dome in the <hi>Tiburtine</hi> Wood, before the place of Secretary to <hi>Augustus.</hi> He was too much a Poet, to be pleased with any kind of Lustre, beside the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Mind; and certainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Man appear'd in more splendor upon that account than he. He was too well acquainted with the folly of Noise and Tumult: He could not be ignorant of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58961:76"/>
pleasure of a Country Retirement, who had all the Muses for his instructors.</p>
                     <p>Solitude is a thing so agreeable with an Ingenuous and Manly Temper, that it seems to be the very Parent of Wit. What greater Pleasure can there be than to live retir'd? Company is the <hi>Remora</hi> of all glorious designs; the spring of Vice; the source of Discord and Disorder. Were it not for Company, Emulation had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a being; Pride had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd in its original Chaos; Thefts, Rapes and Murders had never sill'd the World with their nauseous fame. To live Retired, is to imitate our pristine state of Innocence, e're Rapine and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty had invaded our World. But, Alas! herein is our Misery, we never can attain to the Happy State of our Fore-Father: He lived in a Garden, so may we; but it cannot be an <hi>Eden:</hi> He was retir'd in a glorious obscurity, we may be so too; but here is the fatal consequence, our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, our Lusts, our Inordinate Desires still accompany us: But yet for all this, Solitude is a thing the nearest Happiness
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58961:76"/>
of any; for though we have our Passions always with us, the infamous Retinue, the black Guard of Miserable Bodies; yet in Solitude they are better tamed, there are fewer objects to exercise them on. When I am alone, I can Envy, Hate, Quarrel with none: Indeed Solitude is an Antidote against all the raging Plagues of the Tumultuous World. What En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums are good enough for Noble Solitude?</p>
