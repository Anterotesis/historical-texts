            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Loyal Satyr against Whiggism.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>AS I did lately travel from the Town</l>
               <l>Through distant Roads, and deserts scarcely known,</l>
               <l>From whose dark thickets when I'd made my way,</l>
               <l>A new-found World, as well as new-born day</l>
               <l>I thought appear'd; where Nature rul'd alone,</l>
               <l>No Art, or help, no gawdy pomp was shown,</l>
               <l>But every Plant, each Bush, and spreading Tree</l>
               <l>Did grow without mans Care or Industry.</l>
               <l>There as I stood, and cast my eyes around,</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with the sight of that delightful ground,</l>
               <l>Something from midst the Walks did towards me make,</l>
               <l>Which nearly did resemble humane shape;</l>
               <l>Soon as it nigher came it prov'd to be</l>
               <l>A man of most inviting honesty;</l>
               <l>An Aspect courteous, and a brow serene,</l>
               <l>Of humane nature, and most humble meen,</l>
               <l>His hoary head did Veneration bear,</l>
               <l>And his face spoke his Noble Character.</l>
               <l>Joyful I was in those strange parts to find</l>
               <l>A front that did foretel so brave a mind,</l>
               <l>For asking me Transactions of the Town,</l>
               <l>I told him what disorders late were done;</l>
               <l>What wild distractions and mishapen fears,</l>
               <l>And what a Cloud of Faction round appears,</l>
               <l>What daring Treasons were but now maintain'd</l>
               <l>By <hi>Sh.</hi> and City both in Faction train'd,</l>
               <l>And how the bloudy minded Whigs do aim</l>
               <l>To play again their old King-killing game.</l>
               <l>Which when the good old man heard me relate,</l>
               <l>In flowing tears he mourn'd his Countrys fate,</l>
               <l>And gave me this Advice, Beware my Son</l>
               <l>Lest by the Wiles of Traytors thou'rt undone,</l>
               <l>For I have known th' Experience of those times,</l>
               <l>When Loyalty was thought the worst of Crimes;</l>
               <l>And when Rebellion with a daring eye</l>
               <l>Was cover'd by the Veil of sanctity,</l>
               <l>But thou art young, therefore I'le plainly show</l>
               <l>How thou a Monster Whig mayst surely know,</l>
               <l>It somewhat favours man; so have I seen</l>
               <l>When on a Christmas Evening we have been</l>
               <l>On frolicks bent, a thing of such like note,</l>
               <l>With hairy Chin, diminish'd hanging Coat,</l>
               <l>Broad Hat, stiff Band, and a malicious Eye,</l>
               <l>Which at a distance fully seem'd to be</l>
               <l>The very Villain that sequestred me.</l>
               <l>It rais'd my wonder, but as 't tow'rds us prest</l>
               <l>What should it prove but a Baboon well drest,</l>
               <l>

For so morose are they, and more precise:</l>
               <l>As we're in truth, they're positive in lies;</l>
               <l>What one but says, the other straight will swear,</l>
               <l>Let it be right or wrong, or foul or fair,</l>
               <l>It is all one, since they the Godly are.</l>
               <l>Vile hypocrites, who're only good in show,</l>
               <l>Whose whole Religion lies in seeming so:</l>
               <l>For were their Souls laid open to our view,</l>
               <l>We should not find amongst 'em all one true.</l>
               <l>Therefore beware (again the old man said)</l>
               <l>Lest by their flattering tongues thou art betray'd,</l>
               <l>But if they find you loyal, wise, and brave,</l>
               <l>They'l leer, and smile, and smiling dig your grave;</l>
               <l>Such is their malice, spight, and mortal hate</l>
               <l>'Gainst all that love their Country, Prince, and State.</l>
               <l>Now gentle Youth let any man of wit</l>
               <l>Weigh right their Cause, and well Consider it</l>
               <l>They'l find conceal'd a lurking Jesuit.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Morals and Whigs are Inconsistent things,</l>
               <l>The one still saves, the other still kill's Kings;</l>
               <l>Morality would teach'em to obey,</l>
               <l>And make'em happy under Sovereign sway,</l>
               <l>Make'em speak well of, and do good to all;</l>
               <l>Envious tow'rds none, but love in general.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The very Herds do due submission yield</l>
               <l>To the Imperial Lion of the Field;</l>
               <l>No Mutinies or Factions do they know,</l>
               <l>But pay Allegiance where they ought to do;</l>
               <l>'Tis only Whig, that worser Beast than they,</l>
               <l>That does pretend to Sense, and disobey.</l>
               <l>He that although he hears his Brothers name</l>
               <l>Unjustly wrong'd, won't vindicate his fame,</l>
               <l>But rather blow those ashes into fire</l>
               <l>Which were before just ready to expire.</l>
               <l>Oh! where is then his Justice, does it lie</l>
               <l>In things like these, or Acts of charity?</l>
               <l>There I have known 'em well; ye poor beware,</l>
               <l>Better ye starve than ask for mercy there:</l>
               <l>For stead of helping, they will spurn your grief,</l>
               <l>Contemn your sorrows, and forbid relief.</l>
               <l>Once one of these did my assistance crave</l>
               <l>For certain Sums, which I most frankly gave</l>
               <l>Without the least distrust, his Note, or Bond,</l>
               <l>(For who would think that man could do such wrong)</l>
               <l>Which when I call'd for in, in rage he says,</l>
               <l>Nay vows he never saw me in his days.</l>
               <l>By this I only warn thee to be wise,</l>
               <l>Nere trust 'em, for they're all deceit and lies,</l>
               <l>Whilst still they seem to act on pious grounds,</l>
               <l>Yet cut your throat to gain an hundred pounds.</l>

'Tis Interest alone that they adore,</l>

               <l>Oh that blest time! then, then the Cause did rise,</l>
               <l>And full revenge for Tory Injuries,</l>
               <l>It was not Right, but Faction did prevail,</l>
               <l>A well-grown Whig of Verdicts ne're could fail;</l>
               <l>Oh then ye common Hirelings, Cheats, and Knaves,</l>

               <l>There you may act your Murders with applause,</l>
               <l>Kill but a Tory, and you serve the Laws.</l>

               <l>In a fine od'rous Grotto we sate down,</l>
               <l>And then he thus went on, Think not dear Youth</l>

               <l>For Heaven can tell from such vile thoughts I'm free,</l>
               <l>And all is out of sense of honesty.</l>

               <l>That it is vanish'd in the mist at last;</l>
               <l>He that's reserv'd so long only to be</l>
               <l>A fitter pattern of Hells Cruelty,</l>
               <l>Where with his Faction when he groveling lies,</l>
               <l>They may, too late, cast up repenting eyes,</l>
               <l>And ask forgiveness of that Prince, whose name</l>
               <l>They made it still their business to defame;</l>

Whilst he shall dazle with a Crown so bright,</l>
               <l>Their guilty heads shan't bear that glorious light,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Another Tenet Whig does surely hold,</l>
               <l>Is to rail at these times, and praise the old;</l>
               <l>To cry out on the Nations horrid pride,</l>
               <l>And cast all sins upon the Tory side;</l>
               <l>As if that formal looks and dress precise</l>
               <l>Mayn't hide a heart more proud than ever lies</l>
               <l>In those that wear more handsom Decencies.</l>
               <l>Then Whoring, Drinking, Swearing to our Charge</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Ienny</hi> can tell how well the Tap did run.</l>

               <l>'Tis thus that Faction moves, 'tis these foul ways</l>
               <l>That makes Rebellions, broyls, and threatning days;</l>
               <l>These are the men from whom all trouble springs;</l>
               <l>'Tis they that ruine States, 'tis they that ruine Kings;</l>
               <l>Though he be ne're so gracious, just, and good,</l>
               <l>One that wa'nt pleas'd ev'n with Traytors bloud;</l>
               <l>And though whole Hecatombs could ne'r attone</l>
               <l>For Royal bloud, and an Usurped Throne,</l>
               <l>Yet, like the Almighty, with a giving hand</l>
               <l>Pours favours still on an ungrateful Land;</l>
               <l>And how do they requite him now at last?</l>
               <l>'Tis well, 'tis well, Acts of Oblivion past.</l>

               <l>But they who are not grateful, cannot be</l>
               <l>Ever expected to have honesty.</l>
               <l>The very Beasts do gratitude profess;</l>

               <l>By every sign, and in their Language say,</l>
               <l>Rather than you shall die, we'll be the prey:</l>
               <l>Now to be Whig and grateful ne'r was known,</l>
               <l>It is enough to make their Charter none.</l>
               <l>For if such bounteous graces of their Prince</l>
               <l>Can't raise a grateful, nor a Loyal sense,</l>
               <l>But they who after all, his Pow'r disown,</l>
               <l>His Favours slight, and undermine his Throne,</l>
               <l>First bring him low, to seize at last his Crown.</l>
               <l>Who're so to Kings, oh what will they then be</l>
               <l>To Fellow Creatures of their own Degree?</l>
               <l>How are they fit for Mans Society?</l>
