            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE GREAT
Honour and Advantage
OF THE
East-India TRADE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT cannot but seem
something strange that
it should be thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in this Age of ours,
that pretends to see so
much further than their
Ancestors: for a Man to
give himself any trouble
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30591:5"/>
to Oppose an Assertion,
which in the mildest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
cannot pass for
less than a Paradox. But
since it has been long ago
Remark'd, That there is
scarce an Opinion so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
but has been
defended by some Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
or other; It may
appear the less wonderful,
that there are still People
to be found, <hi>no Philosophers
indeed,</hi> who engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to maintain the most
Palpable Contradiction,
and such a Task in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30591:5"/>
have they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the World, that the
<hi>East-India</hi> Trade is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to the welfare of
the Nation.</p>
            <p>A Trading Genius has
always been found the
most effectual Means to
Inrich a People, prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to all other ways, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wherever it is seen,
it never fails to settle the
most lasting Marks of its
<hi>Advantages.</hi> This is so
very obvious, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of it so Notorious,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30591:6"/>
that it would be a perfect
superfluity to offer any
thing for its Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
The prodigious Rise
of a People our near
Neighbours by this, from
a very small Begining, is
an undeniable Proof of its
almost Miraculous Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and here at Home
likewise it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd,
That our Commerce
and our Riches have both
increas'd together.</p>
            <p>This has been the great
Engine that has wrought
us into that <hi>Fund</hi> of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30591:6"/>
Wealth, which serv'd not
only to Inrich us in Peace,
but has enabl'd us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
our selves thus long,
at so great Expence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Invasion of a
most Powerful Enemy, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Service, I think it
need not be doubted, but
the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade has
contributed, in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as much, if not more,
than any other.</p>
            <p>The inlarging of our
Commerce, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30591:7"/>
were the chief Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of its first Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by that <hi>Great and
Wise Princess Queen</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,
which it has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
effected in both,
by Imploying and Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
the Building of
some of the best Ships in
the World, and by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such store of Useful
and Necessary Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
as make us able to
furnish those very Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in <hi>Europe,</hi> from
whence had they been left
sole Masters of the Trade,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30591:7"/>
we must have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to have receiv'd
them, and should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
'em at second
hand.</p>
            <p>Besides the Example of
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the Benefit of this
Merchandise, that I am
perswaded they would not
Exchange their Intrest in
it, for the best Jewel in
the <hi>English</hi> Crown. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
the late extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
endeavours of our
<hi>Scotch Friends,</hi> who are
generally esteem'd wise
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30591:8"/>
enough for themselves, to
establish a Commerce thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
should make our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
of this Trade con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
whether it is a thing
so damageable as they say
it is. <hi>No Man Courts a
Mischief,</hi> was the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of this Trade to
<hi>India,</hi> so pernicious as
these mistaken People
would perswade us; I
dare Answer for them,
they would be so far from
striving for a share in it;
that they would not give
so much as Thanks for the
whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:30591:8"/>
After all, it is very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that not only the <hi>Dutch</hi>
are, and the <hi>Scotch</hi> promise
themselves to be great Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by this Traffick; but that
we our selves have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
reap'd considerable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
from it to. The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Company; the
Advance of their Actions
to treble their first Value,
not long before the breaking
forth of the Troubles in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
together with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Credit, appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
by their borrowing
what Sum they pleas'd, at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30591:9"/>
4 <hi>per Cent,</hi> when the general
and fix'd Rate was six, were
all indisputable Evidences
at least of their thriving;
and if the Qualities of the
Goods they brought are duly
consider'd, their usefulness,
not only here at home, but
also the great Advantage
they bring us by a second
Transportation: It must be
concluded that the Nation
was so far from loosing, that
they brought a mighty Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
along with 'em.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, if we
were oblig'd to take the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30591:9"/>
of this Affair from
some People, one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
this Trade to be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unprofitable, but redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and that we were as
foolish and extravagant in
our Traffick with these <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
as those other are said to
be with us, who give us
Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Toys and
Trifles: First, they take it
for granted that we carry
thither nothing but Mony.
And what do we receive in
return? Why, nothing but
<hi>China</hi> Beads, <hi>China</hi> Pictures
and Monkey-fac'd Babies,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30591:10"/>
as one lately in Print sadly
complains against them.
These are the Rare Things,
say they, that are so far
fetch'd and bought so dear;
And truly if this be the
Case, I must confess it is
more than time to look after
it. But upon further Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
I question not but
it will appear to be quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</p>
            <p>For the more effectually
carrying on of the Trade to
those Parts, it has been found
absolutely necessary to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
thither, considerable
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30591:10"/>
Sums in Specie, beside <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
to a great value of our
Native Product:</hi> But if the
Account this Mony turns
to, be well reflected on, it will
appear that we are no loosers
by the Bargain. He that
parts with his Mony for a
Commodity that will yeild
him six times as much as it
cost him, never reckons him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
any thing the Poorer,
tho at the present he doth
lay out the Mony: And this
is the very Case of the <hi>East-India</hi>
Traders, who tho they
do Export some Mony, the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30591:11"/>
Commodities they bring for
it, effectually Answer six
times the Value of the prime
Cost, when they are brought
hither.</p>
            <p>I am not unsensible how
much more difficult it is
than ordinary at present, to
perswade People, that Mony
in Specie can be parted with
out of the Kingdom, to any
Advantage: Yet, that I may
not seem to insinuate only,
without affirming any thing
Positive: I will venture to
advance this Assertion, <hi>That
Mony expended in Foreign
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30591:11"/>
Trade, and especially in this
Trade to</hi> India, <hi>does not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
but increase our Treasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make short work of
this, I might alledg the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of <hi>Venice, Florence,
Genoa, Holland,</hi> &amp;c. to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this Position, every one
of which freely allow the
Exportation of Mony, and
have by Experience found it
exceeding Profitable to 'em;
but least none of these
should be thought parellel to
our Case, I shall further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to evince it by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:30591:12"/>
And first, it must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
that there is no
way for us to procure Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but by Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
we having no Mines
of Gold or Silver, to any
purpose here in <hi>England:</hi>
Now, as the Use and Want
of our Commodities occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Vent of them in
Foreign Countries, so from
the want and use of theirs
on our part, there ariseth a
mutual Commerce between
us; and if we export Goods
to greater value upon our
own Ships, than we receive
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30591:12"/>
from them, The Overplus
at the End of the Account
must be paid us in Mony.</p>
            <p>The Ballance being thus
on our side, with respect to
the Exportation of our own
Product and Manufacture,
if by any means we can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our Exportation, the
Nation will thereby become
proportionably the Richer:
And here it will be necessary
to distinguish between the
Profit of the Merchant, and
the Profit of the Kingdom;
they very often falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
very different considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30591:13"/>
for Example, suppose
5000 <hi>l.</hi> sent upon an <hi>English</hi>
Bottom to the <hi>East</hi> Countries
to Buy Corn, which after
some time is carry'd with
much Difficulty and Charge
to be sold again into <hi>Italy</hi> or
elsewhere. Suppose then the
Merchant is forc'd to sell this
Corn for only so much above
the prime Cost, as he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in Charges, it may
be 2000 <hi>l.</hi> in this Case, tho
the Merchant has gain'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
yet it is plain the
Kingdom has increas'd
2000 <hi>l.</hi> by this Trading,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30591:13"/>
from whence it follows, that
the longer and more remote
the Voyage is, the greater
the Profit is to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
For if 10000 <hi>l.</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
to <hi>India</hi> to buy <hi>Muslins,</hi>
the Merchant, upon a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Transportation, by
Reason of the Great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
he is at, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in so tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Voyage, must sell them
again for 70000 pounds, to
be but a moderate gainer.
Though it is apparent again
that the Kingdom has by
this means Seven-fold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
its Treasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:30591:14"/>
If it be Objected, That
this will be Return'd in
Goods, and not in Money,
as it was at first Issu'd out;
I Answer, That this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
because seeing the
Ballance was on our side, and
the Exportation of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
exceeded our
want and use of Foreign
Goods before, it will follow
necessarily, that upon the
Encrease of our Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which we have purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
elsewhere with our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
The Ballance will be
so much the more to our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30591:14"/>
Advantage, and, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
at the end of the
Reckoning, we must receive
the Increase in Treasure.</p>
            <p>And this will serve like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to Answer those who
say, That the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the
<hi>Genoese,</hi> &amp;c. are oblig'd to
Trade with Money, because
they have few Manufact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures
of their own to Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
with. For if the Trade
of our Manufactures be
gainful to us, and the Trade
with Money be gainful to
them, What should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us, that have Means and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30591:15"/>
Opportunity, from joyning
them, and making our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of them both together?</p>
            <p>But it is Objected, That
the Importation of <hi>East-India</hi>
Goods, does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any of these Good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
But hinders the use of
our own <hi>Manufactures,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
depriving a great many
People of their Living. In
Answer to this, I shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what are the <hi>Goods</hi> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought from <hi>India,</hi> of
what use they are to us, and
what Influence they have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our home-made Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30591:15"/>
As to the First, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
being tedious, I shall
onely name such as usually
compose the greatest and
most valuable part of their
Cargo's, which are <hi>Callicoes,
Muslins, Bengalls, Sattins</hi> and
<hi>Taffities. Pepper, Salt-petre,
Raw-silk,</hi> besides <hi>China-ware</hi>
and <hi>Diamonds.</hi> These are
the chief Goods which are
brought hither from <hi>India.</hi>
Let us consider, in the next
place, of what use they are
to us; On which occasion I
might inlarge upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
it is to the Nation to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30591:16"/>
extend its Commerce to such
a Distant part of the World,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I shall rather chuse
to insist upon the real Profit
that is gain'd by them, which
in this particular case is far
greater to us, than the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
from whence we have
those Commodities; for, if
they yield us, upon a Second
Transportation, but four
times the Price they cost in
<hi>India,</hi> it is evident, we, <hi>i. e.</hi> the
Nation, get three times as
much as they can do who sell
them. The Charges of
Freight, Wages, Ensurance,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30591:16"/>
Custom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
our selves, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
lessening of the Treasure
of the Nation. Thus by our
Industry we inrich our selves
by the Manufactures of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as much, nay more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
than by our own.
Besides the Additional Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that we have by the
Exportation of Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Quantities of our own
Product, such as <hi>Cloath, Tin,
Lead,</hi> &amp;c. which are carry'd
thither, towards the Purchase
of those Beneficial Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities;
Beneficial indeed, if
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30591:17"/>
we consider further that they
are in a manner <hi>as good as so
much Money in the Stock of the
Kingdom,</hi> by their aptness for
the Support, Enlarging, and
Furnishing the best of our
other Trades to <hi>Holland,</hi> the
<hi>East Countries, Turky, Italy,</hi>
&amp;c. thereby, as I said before,
increasing our Exportation,
and, by consequence, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Wealth and Strength
of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The very great Damage
we sustain'd <hi>by the Loss of the
Ann, the Seymour, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
East-India Ships,</hi> is an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30591:17"/>
undeniable Instance of the
Consequence of that Trade,
and the Mischief of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption:
<hi>for had those
Ships come safe, we should have
had Goods enough to have
Paid the Army beyond Sea,
without sending a Farthing-worth
of Silver out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
and to have sold for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
three times as much
Mony as was at first sent
out to Buy them.</p>
            <p>As to the Objection, That
the Importation of Made
Goods, such as <hi>Bengalls, Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fities,</hi>
&amp;c. hinder the use and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30591:18"/>
vent of our Manufactures, and
thereby puts a great many
out of their way of getting a
Living; Let it be Suppos'd,
but not Granted, that some
People are put by their usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
course of gaining a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood
by this: yet, if there
are a great number of others
imploy'd by the same means,
This cannot be a reasonable
Objection against it. At this
rate the Brewers may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the Vintners; the
Weavers of Worsted against
the Silk Weavers; <hi>Norwich,</hi>
&amp;c. against <hi>Spittlefields:</hi> each
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30591:18"/>
of which would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imploy many more hands,
should the other Quit their
present Business, and take to
something else.</p>
            <p>But indeed the <hi>Indian-made</hi>
Goods have not that
troublesome effects, but on
the Contrary, another very
convenient and profitable
one, which is, that <hi>they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Importation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of Abundance of such
Foreign Goods as we should
else have bought, and were
wont to buy at much greater
Prices.</hi> Muslins are bought
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30591:19"/>
for ¼ of the Price of either
Chambricks, Lawns, or Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.
Callicoe's a great deal
cheaper than Scotch-cloaths,
or other Linnens; Indian-Sattins
and Damasks, than
French, or Halien; and the
Taffities have so great an
Advantage of Florence Sars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
and French Avignions,
that they have caus'd a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
disuse of them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>India Goods</hi> are so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in their qualities from
the Product of our Country,
and the main of our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30591:19"/>
that it is absolutely
impossible they should ever
do them any Injury, Woolen
Cloaths, Led, Tin, Iron,
Corn, Leather, the Fishery,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> will always be as useful,
and as vendible in Foreign
Countreys, as if we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much as heard of the
<hi>East India's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Made Goods do,
it seems, particularly injure
the Broad Silk-Weavers,
and put them beside the way
of living they were brought
up in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:30591:20"/>
Now, besides what has
been said already to this, that
supposing this were true, yet
that it could not be esteem'd
a Publick Damage, because
if it does take from one
part of the People, it makes
sufficient Recompence, by
the Imployment it gives to
another, <hi>much more to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Nation in General:</hi>
And it may be remembred
likewise, that when this was
urg'd by the Workers in
Worsted, with far greater
Reason, a few years ago, as
an Argument against them,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30591:20"/>
they could, by no means, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it to be a good one.</p>
            <p>Besides this, I say, there
is to be added, <hi>That this
Objection is not true in Fact,
as even Experience has testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd.</hi>
For, would the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
these Men have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade
suffer them to speak Truth,
they would be oblig'd to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that</hi> the late <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi>
and <hi>Dearness</hi> of Indian
<hi>Goods,</hi> has been so far from
bringing them any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that on the contrary,
their Business and Work
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30591:21"/>
was never in so low a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as since there has
been almost none at all.</p>
            <p>For a Plentiful Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these Made Goods is
generally one means to cause
a Considerable Diminution
in the Price of Raw Silk to
the Weaver, which present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sets him at Work upon
several sorts of Silks, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
Different from the
<hi>Indian,</hi> as gives him a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
share in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Trade. VVhereas the
Excessive Dearness of Silk
discourageth him, and puts
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30591:21"/>
the Buyers upon seeking
for something else, that
may supply their use cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>It must be confess'd,
that these People at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
lye under extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hardship, and it were
to be wish'd, that some
Proper Method could be
found to Relieve them. But
why must this be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>East India</hi> Goods
all of a sudden? Since we
all know, that in the Time
of their greatest Plenty,
as I said but just now, they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30591:22"/>
were much better imploy'd;
than since their greatest
Scarcity. That Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
alone may go a
great way to convince both
them and us, That the
<hi>Decrease of their Trade is
owing to some other Causes,</hi>
if not included in the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Decay of the Inland
Trade;</hi> the Natural and
Inevitable <hi>Consequence of the
Interruption of the Forreign;</hi>
and that like all other
Restless People, who don't
know where to fix the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their Misery, they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30591:22"/>
have blindly stumbled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, the next in their
way, to discharge their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness
upon.</p>
            <p>So that upon the VVhole
it cannot reasonably be
thought, that their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
Prejudices can make
any ill Impression upon
this part of the Nations
Trade: A Trade, to sum
up all, that is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
in every Respect,
with so many, and so great
Advantages; A Trade,
which is such an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:30591:23"/>
to our <hi>Honour,</hi> such
an Improvement to our
<hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Shipping,</hi>
such an Enlargement to
our Exportation, and such
a Barr to the Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of other so much dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Forreign Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>In Fine; so every way
Fitted to the General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and Profit of the
NATION, That I am
perswaded, that were it
Encourag'd, as it might
be, it would Equal, if

not Excell, any other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
