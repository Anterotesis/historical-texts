            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF Wit has truly been defin'd a propriety of Thoughts and Words, then
that Definition will extend to all sorts of Poetry; and amongst the rest,
to this present entertainment of an <hi>Opera.</hi> Propriety of thought is
that Fancy which arises naturally from the Subject, or which the Poet
adapts to it. Propriety of Words, is the cloathing of those thoughts with
such Expressions, as are naturally proper to them: and from both these, if
they are judiciously perform'd, the delight of Poetry results. An <hi>Opera</hi> is
a poetical Tale or Fiction, represented by Vocal and Instrumental Musick,
adorn'd with Scenes, Machines and Dancing. The suppos'd Persons of this
musical Drama, are generally supernatural, as Gods and Goddesses, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,
which at least are descended from them, and are in due time, to be
adopted into their Number. The Subject therefore being extended beyond
the Limits of Humane Nature, admits of that sort of marvellous and surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
conduct, which is rejected in other Plays. Humane Impossibilities,
are to be receiv'd, as they are in Faith; because where Gods are introduc'd,
a Supreme Power is to be understood; and second Causes are out of doors.
Yet propriety is to be observ'd even here. The Gods are all to manage their
peculiar Provinces: and what was attributed by the Heathens to one Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
ought not to be perform'd by any other. <hi>Phoebus</hi> must foretel, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
must charm with his <hi>Caduceus,</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi> must reconcile the Quarrels
of the Marriage-bed. To conclude, they must all act according to their
distinct and peculiar Characters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the Persons represented were to speak
upon the Stage, it wou'd follow of necessity, That the Expressions should be
lofty, figurative and majestical: but the nature of an <hi>Opera</hi> denies the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
use of those poetical Ornaments: for Vocal Musick, though it often
admits a loftiness of sound: yet always exacts an harmonious sweetness; or
to distinguish yet more justly, The recitative part of the <hi>Opera</hi> requires a
more masculine Beauty of expression and sound: the other which (for want
of a proper English Word) I must call, <hi>The Songish Part,</hi> must abound
in the softness and variety of Numb<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs: its principal Intention, being to
please the Hearing, rather than to gratify the understanding. It
appears indeed, Preposterous at first sight, That Rhyme, on any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
shou'd take place of Reason. But in order to resolve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme,
this fundamental proposition must be settled, That the first Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of any Art or Science, provided they have brought it to perfection, are,
in reason, to give Laws to it; and according to their Model, all after Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers
are to build. Thus in Epique Poetry, no Man ought to dispute
the Authority of <hi>Homer,</hi> who gave the first being to that Master-piece of
<pb facs="tcp:60035:3"/>
Art, and endued it with that form of Perfection in all its Parts, that nothing
was wanting to its excellency. <hi>Virgil</hi> therefore, and those very few who
have succeeded him, endeavour'd not to introduce or innovate any thing
in a Design already perfected, but imitated the plan of the Inventor: and
are only so far true Heroique Poets, as they have built on the Foundations
of <hi>Homer.</hi> Thus <hi>Pindar,</hi> the Author of those Odes, (which are so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
restor'd by Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> in our Language,) ought for ever to be the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
of them; and we are bound according to the practice of <hi>Horace</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> to Copy him. Now, to apply this Axiom, to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
whosoever undertakes the writing of an <hi>Opera,</hi> (which is a modern
Invention, though built indeed, on the foundations of Ethnique Worship,)
is oblig'd to imitate the Design of the <hi>Italians,</hi> who have not only invented,
but brought to perfection, this sort of Dramatique Musical Entertainment.
I have not been able by any search, to get any light either of the time,
when it began, or of the first Author. But I have probable Reasons, which
induce me to believe, that some <hi>Italians</hi> having curiously observ'd the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Moores at their Zambra's, or Royal Feasts, where Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
Songs and Dancing were in perfection; together with their Machines,
which are usual at their <hi>Sortiia's,</hi> or running at the Ring, and other Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
may possibly have refin'd upon those Moresque Divertisements, and
produc'd this delightful Entertainment, by leaving out the warlike Part of
the Carousels, and forming a poetical Design for the use of the Machines,
the Songs and Dances. But however it began, (for this is only conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,)
we know that for some Centuries, the knowledge of Musick has flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
principally in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Mother of Learning and of Arts; that Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Painting have been there restor'd, and so cultivated by <hi>Italian</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
That all <hi>Europe</hi> has been enrich'd out of their Treasury: and the other
Parts of it in relation to those delightful Arts, are still as much provincial to
<hi>Italy,</hi> as they were in the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Their first <hi>Opera's</hi>
seem to have been intended for the Celebration of the Marriages of their
Princes, or for the magnificence of some general time of Joy. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Expences of them were from the Purse of the Soveraign, or of the
Republick, as they are still practis'd at <hi>Venice, Rome,</hi> and other Places at
their Carnivals. <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> have often us'd them in their Courts, at
the Weddings of their Dukes: And at <hi>Turin</hi> particularly, was perform'd
the <hi>Pastor Fido,</hi> written by the famous <hi>Guarini,</hi> which is a Pastoral <hi>Opera</hi>
made to solemnize the Marriage of a Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The Prologue of it,
has given the Design to all the <hi>French,</hi> which is a Complement to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Power by some God or Goddesses: so that it looks no less than a kind
of Embassy from Heaven to Earth. I said, in the beginning of this Preface,
that the Persons represented in <hi>Opera's,</hi> are generally, Gods, Goddesses and
Heroes descended from them, who are suppos'd to be their peculiar care:
which hinders not, but that meaner Persons, may sometimes gracefully
be introduc'd, especially if they have relation to those first times, which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
call the <hi>Golden Age:</hi> wherein by reason of their Innocence, those happy
Mort<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls, were suppos'd to have had a more familiar intercourse with Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Beings: and therefore Shepherds might reasonably be admitted, as of
all Callings, the most innocent, the most happy, and who by reason of the
spare time they had, in their almost idle Employment, had most leisure to make
Verses, and to be in Love: without somewhat of which Passion, no <hi>Opera</hi>
can possibly subsist.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60035:4"/>
'Tis almost needless to speak any thing of that noble Language, in which
this Musical <hi>Drama,</hi> was first invented and perform'd. All, who are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in the <hi>Italian,</hi> cannot but observe, that it is the softest, the sweetest,
the most harmonious, not only of any modern Tongue, but even beyond
any of the Learned. It seems indeed to have been invented for the sake of
Poetry and Musick: the Vowels are so abounding in all Words, especially
in the Terminations of them, that excepting some few Monosyllables, the
whole Language ends in them. Then the Pronunciation is so manly and
so sonorous, that their very speaking has more of Musick in it, than <hi>Dutch,</hi>
Poetry and Song. It has withal deriv'd so much Copiousness and Eloquence
from the Greek and Latin in the composition of Words, and the formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, that (if after all, we must call it barbarous) 'tis the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and most learned of any Barbarism in Modern Tongues. And we
may, at least, as justly praise it, as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> did the <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline, and
Martial Order, that it was of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> (for so the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd all other
Nations) but had nothing in it of barbarity. This Language has in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
been refin'd and purified from the <hi>Gothick,</hi> ever since the time of <hi>Dantè,</hi>
which is above four hundred Years ago; and the <hi>French,</hi> who now cast a
longing Eye to their Country, are not less ambitious to possess their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
in Poetry and Musick: in both which they labour at Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
'Tis true indeed, they have reform'd their Tongue, and brought both
their Prose and Poetry to a Standard: the Sweetness as well as the Purity
is much improv'd, by throwing off the unnecessary Consonants, which made
their Spelling tedious, and their pronunciation harsh: But after all, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be improv'd beyond its own Species, or farther than its original
Nature will allow: as an ill Voice though never so thoroughly instructed in
the Rules of Musick, can never be brought to sing harmoniously, nor many
an honest Critick, ever arrive to be a good Poet, so neither can the natural
harshness of the <hi>French</hi> or their perpetual ill Accent, be ever refin'd into
perfect Harmony like the <hi>Italian.</hi> The English has yet more natural dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
than the <hi>French;</hi> our original Teutonique consisting most in
Monosyllables, and those incumber'd with Consonants cannot possibly be
freed from those Inconveniences. The rest of our Words, which are deriv'd
from the <hi>Latin</hi> chiefly, and the <hi>French,</hi> with some small sprinklings of
<hi>Greek, Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish,</hi> are some relief in Poetry; and help us to soften
our uncouth Numbers, which together with our <hi>English</hi> Genius, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
beyond the triffling of the <hi>French,</hi> in all the nobler Parts of Verse,
will justly give us the Preheminence<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But, on the other hand, the Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
of our pronunciation, (a defect common to us, and to the <hi>Danes</hi>) and
our scarcity of female Rhymes, have left the advantage of musical compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Songs, though not for recitative, to our neighbors.</p>
            <p>Through these Difficulties, I have made a shift to struggle, in my part of
the performance of this <hi>Opera;</hi> which, as mean as it is, deserves at least a
Pardon, because it has attempted a discovery beyond any former Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of our Nation: only remember, that if there be no North-East Passage
to be found, the fault is in Nature, and not in me. Or as <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi> tells us
in the Alchymist, when Projection had fail'd, and the Glasses were all broken,
there was enough however in the Bottoms of them to cure the Itch; so I
may thus far be positive, That if I have not succeeded, as I desire, yet there
is somewhat still remaining, to satisfy the Curiosity or Itch of Sight and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb facs="tcp:60035:5"/>
so Wise as not to be impos'd upon, and fool'd out of their satisfaction. The
newness of the undertaking is all the hazard: When <hi>Opera's</hi> were first set up
in <hi>France,</hi> they were not follow'd over eagerly; but they gain'd daily upon
their Hearers, till they grew to that heigth of Reputation which they now
enjoy. The <hi>English</hi> I confess, are not altogether so Musical as the <hi>French,</hi>
and yet they have been pleas'd already, with the Tempest, and some pieces
that follow'd, which were neither much better Written, nor so well Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
as this. If it finds encouragement, I dare promise my self to mend
my hand, by making a more pleasing Fable: In the mean time, every
Loyal <hi>English-man,</hi> cannot but be satisfy'd with the Moral of this, which so
plainly represents the double restoration of his Sacred Majesty.</p>

               <p>This Preface being wholly Written before the Death of my late Royal

I have now, lately, review'd it, as supposing I shou'd find many notions in it, that
wou'd require correction on cooler thoughts. After four Months lying by me,
I look'd on it as no longer mine, because I had wholly forgotten it; but, I confess,
with some satisfaction, and perhaps a little vanity, that I found my self enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd

be, that possibly the <hi>Italians</hi> went not so far as <hi>Spain,</hi> for the Invention of their

the Shipwrecks of the <hi>Athenian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Theaters; which we know were

<hi>Opera</hi> it self, it was all compos'd, and was just ready to have been perform'd
when he, in Honor of whom it was principally made, was taken from us.</p>
               <p>He had been pleas'd twice or thrice to command, that it shou'd be practis'd,
before him, especially the first and third Acts of it; and public<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly declar'd more
than once, That the compositio and Chorus'<hi>s,</hi> were more Iust, and more Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
than any he had heard in <hi>England.</hi> How nice an Ear he had in Musick
is sufficiently known; his praise therefore has establish'd the Reputation of it,
above censure, and made it in a manner Sacred. 'Tis therefore humbly and
Religiously dedicated to his Memory.</p>
               <p>It might reasonably have been expected, that his Death must have chang'd
the whole Fabrick of the <hi>Opera;</hi> or at least a great part of it. But the design
of it Originally, was so happy, that it needed no alteration, properly so call'd:
for the addition of twenty or thirty lines, in the Apotheosis of <hi>Albion,</hi> has made
it entirel<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of a Piece. This was the only way which cou'd have been invented,
to save it from a botch'd ending; and it fell luckily into my imagination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As
if there were a kind of fatality, even in the most trivial things concerning the
Succession; a change was made, and not for the worse, without the least confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or disturbance: And those very causes which seem'd to threaten us with troubles,
conspir'd to produce our lasting Happiness.</p>

            <p>THe Curtain rises, and a new Frontispiece is seen, joyn'd to
the great Pylasters, which are on each side of the Stage: On
the flat of each Basis is a Shield, adorn'd with Gold: In
the middle of the Shield on one side, are two Hearts, a small
Scrowl of Gold over 'em, and an Imperial Crown over the Scrowl;
on the other, in the Shield are two Quivers full of Arrows Saltyre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Vpon each Basis stands a Figure bigger than the life; one repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
Peace, with a Palm in one, and an Olive Branch in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

on a Pillar. Behind these Figures are large Columns of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi>
Order adorn'd with Fruit and Flowers: over one of the
Figures on the Trees is the King's Cypher; over the other the
Queens: over the Capitals, on the Cornice sits a Figure on each

in one Hand, and the other on a Harp. Between these Figures,
in the middle of the Sweep of the Arch, is a very large Pannel in
a frame of Gold; in this Pannel is painted on one side a Woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the City of <hi>London,</hi> leaning her Head on her Hand in

            <l>FUll twenty years and more, our lab'ring Stage</l>
            <l>Has lost, on this incorrgible age:</l>
            <l>Our Poets, the <hi>Iohn Ketches</hi> of the Nation,</l>
            <l>Have seem'd to lash yee, ev'n to excoriation:</l>
            <l>But still no sign remains; which plainly notes,</l>
            <l>You bore like Hero's, or you brib'd like <hi>Oates.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>What can we do, when mimicking a Fop,</l>
            <l>Like beating, Nut-trees, makes a larger Crop?</l>
            <l>Faith we'll e'en spare our pains: and to content you,</l>
            <l>Will fairly leave you what your Maker meant you.</l>
            <l>Satyre was once your Physick, Wit your Food;</l>
            <l>One nourisht not, and t'other drew no Blood.</l>
            <l>Wee now prescribe, like Doctors in despair,</l>
            <l>The Diet your weak appetites can bear.</l>
            <l>Since hearty Beef and Mutton will not do,</l>
            <l>Here's Julep dance, Ptisan of Song and show:</l>
            <l>Give you strong Sense, the Liquor is too heady;</l>
            <l>You're come to farce, that's Asses milk, already.</l>
            <l>Some hopeful Youths there are, of callow Wit,</l>
            <l>Who one Day may be Men, if Heav'n think fit;</l>
            <l>Sound may serve such, ere they to Sense are grown;</l>
            <l>Like leading strings, till they can walk alone:</l>
            <l>But yet to keep our Friends in count'nance, know,</l>
            <l>The Wise <hi>Italians</hi> first invented show;</l>
            <l>Thence, into <hi>France</hi> the Noble Pageant past;</l>
            <l>'Tis <hi>England</hi>'s Credit to be cozn'd last.</l>
            <l>Freedom and Zeal have chous'd you o'er and o'er;</l>
            <l>'Pray' give us leave to bubble you once more;</l>
            <l>You never were so cheaply fool'd before.</l>
            <l>Wee bring you change, to humour your Disease;</l>
            <l>Change for the worse has ever us'd to please:</l>
            <l>Then 'tis the mode of <hi>France,</hi> without whose Rules,</l>
            <l>None must presume to set up here for Fools:</l>
            <l>In <hi>France,</hi> the oldest Man is always young,</l>
            <l>Sees <hi>Opera</hi>'s daily, learns the Tunes so long,</l>
            <l>Till Foot, Hand, Head, keep time with ev'ry Song.</l>
            <l>Each sings his part, echoing from Pit and Box,</l>
            <l>With his hoarse Voice, half Harmony, half Pox.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Le plus grand Roy du Monde,</hi> is always ringing;</l>
            <l>They show themselves good Subjects by their singing.</l>
            <l>On that condition, set up every Throat;</l>
            <l>You Whiggs may sing, for you have chang'd your Note.</l>

Cits and Citesses, raise a joyful strain,</l>

            <l>AFter our <hi>AEsop</hi>'s Fable, shown to day,</l>
            <l>I come to give the Moral of the Play.</l>
            <l>Feign'd Zeal, you saw, set out the speedier pace;</l>
            <l>But, the last heat, <hi>Plain Dealing</hi> won the Race:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Plain Dealing</hi> for a Jewel has been known;</l>
            <l>But ne'er till now the Jewel of a Crown.</l>
            <l>When Heav'n made Man, to show the work Divine,</l>
            <l>Truth was his Image, stampt upon the Coin:</l>
            <l>And, when a King is to a God refin'd,</l>
            <l>On all he says and does, he stamps his Mind:</l>
            <l>This proves a Soul without allay, and pure;</l>
            <l>Kings, like their Gold, should every touch endure.</l>
            <l>To dare in Fields is Valour; but how few</l>
            <l>Dare be so throughly Valiant to be true?</l>
            <l>The Name of Great, let other Kings affect:</l>
            <l>He's Great indeed, the Prince that is direct.</l>
            <l>His Subjects know him now, and trust him more,</l>
            <l>Than all their Kings, and all their Laws before.</l>
            <l>What safety could their publick Acts afford?</l>
            <l>Those he can break; but cannot break his Word.</l>
            <l>So great a Trust to him alone was due;</l>
            <l>Well have they trusted whom so well they knew.</l>
            <l>The Saint, who walk'd on Waves, securely trod,</l>
            <l>While he believ'd the beckning of his God;</l>
            <l>But, when his Faith no longer bore him out,</l>
            <l>Began to sink, as he began to doubt.</l>
            <l>Let us our native Character maintain,</l>
            <l>'Tis of our growth, to be sincerely plain.</l>
            <l>T' excel in Truth, we Loyally may strive;</l>
            <l>Set Privilege against Prerogative:</l>
            <l>He Plights his Faith; and we believe him just;</l>
            <l>His Honour is to Promise, ours to Trust.</l>

In the first Scene, part of the Town and part of the Hill:

part of the Castle, beyond the Keep.</p>

in Procession, and the King under a Canopy: Beyond this, the
upper end of St. <hi>George</hi>'s Hall.</p>
