            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> and others, who had entered into a Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

with Colonel <hi>Rumsay, Walcot, West,</hi> and <hi>Ferguson,</hi>
and others who had likewise Conspired the Murder of His Majesties
Sacred Person, and of the Person of His Royal Highness; and
finding that he could not get himself Elected one of the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,

on effectually; and after he had settled a Correspondency here,
he did go up to <hi>London</hi> in one or other of the saids Moneths, with
Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> and Commissar <hi>Monro,</hi> and did then, and there,
Transact with the saids Conspirators, or one or other of them, to
get a sum of Money to the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> a Declaired Traitor,
for bringing home of Men and Arms, for raising a Rebellion against
His Majesty, and invading this his Native Countrey; and so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
was he in the said Design, that he did chide those <hi>English</hi>
Conspirators, for not sending the same timeously, and lamented the
delayes used in it; and perswaded the late Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> and others
in his name to accept of any sum, rather than not to engage: and
amongst the many meetings that he had at <hi>London,</hi> for carrying on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59978:3"/>
the said Traiterous design, there was one at his own Chamber, where
he did meet with the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> and the
<hi>Cessnocks</hi> Elder and Younger, and amongst others, with Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Veatch</hi> a declared Traitor, and there he did treat of the cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on
of the said Rebellion, and of the money to be furnished by
the <hi>English</hi> for <hi>Argyle,</hi> for buying of Armes. And that if the
<hi>Scots</hi> would attempt any thing for their own relief, they would
get assistance of Horse from <hi>England;</hi> and from that meeting, he
or ane, or other of them did send down Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
any rysing, till it should be seasonable for carying on of their
Designs, which Mr. <hi>Robert,</hi> after he came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> did treat
with <hi>Polwart</hi> and others, for carying on of the said Rebellion; by
securing His Majesties Officers of State, His Castles and Forces,
and by putting his Correspondents here, and there Associats, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness,
to assist the late Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and after the said <hi>Mr.
Baillie</hi> had engadged many of his Countrey-men in <hi>England,</hi> and
had assured his Correspondantts here, that the <hi>English</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to seclud his <hi>Royal-Highness</hi> from his due right of Succession,
thereby to encourage them to concur in the said Rebellion, and
Exclusion, he flew to that hight, that he did particularly and clos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
correspond with Mr. <hi>Robert Ferguson,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi>
Collonel <hi>Rumsay,</hi> and <hi>Walcot,</hi> who were accessory to
that horrid part of the Conspiracy, which was designed against the
Sacred Life of His Majesty, and the Life of His Royal-Highness,
and did sit up several nights with them, concerting that bloody
Massacer: at least the said Mr. <hi>Robert Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jerviswood</hi> was,
and is guilty of having correspondence with the late Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>William Veatch</hi> declared Traitors, and of being art and
part of an Conspiracy, for assisting of these who were to rise in
armes against His Sacred Majesty, and for exclusion of His Royal
Brother, and of concealing and not revealing the accession and
proposals of others for that effect. Wherethrow he has committed,
and is guilty of the Crymes of High Treason, Rebellion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
abovespecified, and is art and part of the samine, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>AFter reading of the Inditement, the Lord Justice General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the Pannal to make answer thereto.</p>
            <p>The said Mr. <hi>Robert Baillie</hi> Pannal pleaded not Guilty.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Walter Pringle</hi> Advocat, as Procurator for the said
Mr. <hi>Robert Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jerviswood</hi> Pannal, alleadges that
he ought not to passe to the knowledge of an Assize,
because he had not got a Citation upon fyfteen days, or at
least on a competent time, which is usual, and absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar
in all Actions, and much more in Criminal Pursuits, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
seing, if a competent time be not allowed to the Pannal, he
is precludit of the benefit of ane exculpation, without which he
cannot prove his Objections against Witnesses, or Assyzers, or any
other Legal, or competent Defences; And by the late Act of
Parliament concerning the Justice Court, all Pannalls are allowed
to raise Precepts of Exculpation, and thereupon to cite Witnesses,
for proving the Objections against Witnesses, and Assyzers, which
necessarily pre-supposeth, that a competent time must be allowed
to the Pannal to execut his diligence, or otherwise, how is it possible
he can prove an Defence of <hi>alibi,</hi> or any other just Defence: and
as this is most consonant to that clear Act of Parliament, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59978:4"/>
Justice, and to the Rules of Humanity, so this point has
been already fully and often decided, and lately in the case of one
<hi>Robertson</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1673. The Instance whereof, is given by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Advocat in his Book of Criminals, and Title of Libels, where
the Lords found, that albeit <hi>Robertson</hi> got his Inditement in Prison,
yet he behoved to get it upon fifteen dayes.</p>
            <p>HIs Majesties Advocat oppons the constant Tract of Decisions,
whereby it is found, that a person Incarcerated may be Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon twenty four houres; and the late Act of Parliament is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the case where a Summons or Libel is to be Raised; but here
there is no Libel or Summons, but only an Inditement; nor was
any Exculpation sought in this case, before the Tryal, which is the
case provided for by the Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>THe Lords, Justice-General, Justice-Clerk, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of Justiciary, Repell the Defence, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the Pannal is a Prisoner, and that it has been
the constant Custom of the Court, and that the
Pannal made no former application for an Exculpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> for the Pannal, alleadges (alwayes denying the
Libel, and whole Members, and Qualifications thereof) that
in so far as the Libel is founded upon Harbouring, maintaining, and
Intercommuning with the persons mentioned in the Dittay, the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ought to be assoylzied; because it is <hi>res hactenus judicata,</hi> he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been formerly pursued before the Lords of his Majesties Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Council for the same Crimes, and Fined in an considerable Sum;
and therefore that Crime cannot now be made use of as a ground of
Treason against the Pannal.</p>
            <p>HIs Majesties Advocat answers, That he Restricts his Libel,
to the Pannals entering in a Conspiracy; for raising Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and for procuring Money to be sent to the late Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile,</hi>
for carrying on the said Rebellion; and for concealing, and
not revealing; neither of which is referred to his Oath; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
was not <hi>res judicata,</hi> there being nothing referred to his
Oath; but his Converse and Correspondence with some Ministers,
and others within the Kingdom, and his own Gardiner, and his
Writing Letters to my Lord <hi>Argile;</hi> and oppons the Decreet of
Council it self, and restricts the Libel to all the Crimes not insisted
on in the Decreet.</p>
            <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> Replyes, That as to the Corresponding
with the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> at any time since his Forefaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
was expresly proponed as an Interrogator to the Pannal in
that Pursuit, at His Majesties Advocat's Instance against him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, and that not only
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59978:5"/>
his own Correspondence by himself; but also by Major <hi>Holms,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Carstares, Robert West, Thomas Shepherd, Richard Rumbold,</hi> and
Collonel <hi>Rumsay,</hi> as the Interrogator bears, as appears by a double
of the Act of Council, written by the Clerk of Councils Servant,
and is offered to be proven by my Lord Advocats Oath: And as
to any Correspondency with Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> it is not Relevant, since
he was not Declared Rebel.</p>
            <p>SIr <hi>John Lauder</hi> for His Majesties Interest, answers, That he
oppons the Decreet of Privy Council, where no such Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator
was put to the Pannal, and the Decreet must make more
Faith than any pretended Scroll, and cannot be taken away by
His Majesties Advocats Oath, to His Majesties prejudice; and for
Mr. <hi>William Veitch,</hi> he stands expresly Forefault in <hi>anno</hi> 1667.
and the Doom of Forefaulture, is Ratified in the Parliament
1669.</p>
            <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> oppons the Reply, That as to the Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> it does not appear, that he is the person
mentioned in the Act of Parliament; and albeit he were, as he is
not, he having thereafter come home to <hi>Scoland,</hi> all the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inflicted upon him was Banishment, not to return under the
pain of Death, which did take off any former Punishment; and
it was no Crime in any Person to Intercommune with him, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in another Kingdom; and by the late Act of Council in <hi>anno</hi>
1683. Even the Conversing, and Intercommuning with declared
Traitors, is restricted to an Arbitrary punishment.</p>
            <p>HIs Majesties Advocat oppons the standing Doom of Forefaulture
against <hi>Veitch,</hi> and the Proclamation, or Act of Council it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>elf.</p>
            <p>THe Lords, Justice-General, Justice-Clerk, and Commissioners
of Justiciary, having considered the Libel, pursued by His
Majesties Advocat, against Mr. <hi>Robert Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jerviswood,</hi> with
the Lord Advocats Declaration, whereby he Restricts the same to
the Crimes not insisted on in the Decreet of Council formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunced
against the Pannal. They find the same Relevant as it is
restricted, to infer the pain of Treason, and remits the same to
the knowledge of the Assize, and Repells the remnant Defences pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
for the Pannal, in respect of the Decreet of Council produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
bearing no such thing as is alleadged, and of the answers made
by His Majesties Advocat thereto.</p>

               <p>HIis Majesties Advocat for Probation adduced the Witnesses
and Writs aftermentioned; and first,
<hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Tarras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> Procurator for the Pannal, objects against the
Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> that he cannot be a Witness, because he is <hi>soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
&amp; particeps criminis;</hi> and it is clear by the 34. <hi>Chap. Stat 2. Rob.</hi>
1. Concerning these that are excluded from bearing of Testimony
that <hi>socij &amp; participes ejusdem criminis, vel incarcerati &amp; vinculati,</hi>
cannot bear Testimony: As also, the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
under an Inditement of High Treason, and under the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Fear, and Death, no person in his Circumstances can be
admitted a Witness, as is not only clear from the foresaid Statute,
but from the Common Law.</p>
               <p>HIs Majesties Advocat answers, That it is an exception from
that Rule, both by the Common Law, and ours, that in
the Crime of lese Majestie, and especially, that Branch therof,
which we call a Conspiracy, <hi>socius criminis</hi> may be a witnes, and
which is introduced very reasonably by Lawyers, to secure the
common interest of mankind, which is the chief of all Interests; and
because Conspiracies cannot be otherwayes proved, and not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this manner of Probation, were to allow Treason, since no
man can prove a Plot, but he that is upon it, and how can a man
object against him as a Witness, whom himself trusted with his
Life, his Fortune, and their common Plot, nor is the intenting of
the lybel any stronger qualification, since every man that is <hi>socius cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi>
is under the same impression, and it would rather seem the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59978:6"/>
greater and nearer apprehensions a man has of death, he will be the
more sincere and faithful; Nor has the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> nor did he ever seek
any security, in order to his deponing. And this has been constantly,
and latlie, conform to the common Law, as may be seen in the hundreds
of Citations set down by <hi>Mascard, de probationibus, vol. 4. conclus.</hi>
1318. <hi>num.</hi> 21. and the contrary citations prove only, that regularly
<hi>socius criminis</hi> cannot be a Witnes.</p>
               <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> replyes, that the Statutes of <hi>Robert</hi> the first is
opponed, and <hi>non est distinguendum ubi lex non distinguit,</hi> and not
only was he <hi>socius criminis,</hi> which is acknowledged, but he is <hi>incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceratus,</hi>
and lying under an Indytment of high Treason, and has
thrown himself on the Kings Mercy, and it is not proper he should
be a Wintess, seing he is in the Kings Mercy, who may give him his
life or not, and there was never a Person in these circumstances,
that ever was admitted a Witness.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Walter Pringle</hi> adds, That the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> is not only
in the case of a person who stands Indyted for High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
but must be look'd upon, as a person condemned for the said
Cryme, seing he fully, and amply confest the Cryme: <hi>&amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessus
habetur p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>o convicto,</hi> and never any Lawyer asserted, That
<hi>damnatus criminis lesa Majestatis</hi> could be admitted as a Witnes,
and there is nothing more clear, then that by the common Law,
and the Law of all Nations, this Objection ought to be sustained,
for the Civil Law is clear, <hi>leg. 11. cod<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> de testibus,</hi> and <hi>Matheus</hi> in
his title <hi>de probationibus, cap. de testibus,</hi> doth assert positivlie, that
the Cryme of lese Majestie, Heresie, and generally all these Crymes
<hi>quae sine sociis non possuut facile admitti,</hi> are not excepted. And he
asserts, that the Lawyers, <hi>viz. Gomesius, &amp; Decianus,</hi> who are of
another Opinion, do acknowledge, <hi>nominatum a reo damnandum
non esse,</hi> and that they contravert only, <hi>An nominatio rei sit indicium
sufficiens ad torquendum nominatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SIr <hi>George Lockhart</hi> Repeats, and oppons the Answer, and the
Cryme lybelled, being a Conspiration of Treason, which of it's
own nature is manadged, and caryed on by Secrecie and Contrivance;
and which is only known to the Complices of the Treason, and
which cannot be commited <hi>sine sociis,</hi> the Law of this Kingdom, and
of all Nations, do allow <hi>socios criminis</hi> to be <hi>testes habiles,</hi> and not
only are they admitted in the case of such Conjurations, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<hi>in omnibus criminibus exceptis,</hi> amongst which the Crime of
<hi>Perduellion,</hi> and lese Majestie is the chief, and it is absolutly impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that Plots, and Conspirations of Treason can be otherwayes
proven, then <hi>per socios,</hi> and such as are <hi>participes criminis,</hi> and which
is the common opinion of all Lawyers, as may appear by <hi>Farin.
Quest:</hi> 45. And the Authorities cited by him, and which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
practique of this Kingdom: and as to that pretence, that
the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> is under a Process of Treason, and has submitted
to His Majesties mercy, and that <hi>confessus habetur pro convicto,</hi> it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
nothing, and infers no more then that he is <hi>socius criminis,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59978:6"/>
and is still a habil witnes, as to Conjuration of Treason <hi>socius cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis
hoc ipso,</hi> that it is acknowledged, or proven, being still under
the hazard of Process, or condemnation, which Law regards not in
regard of the secrecie involved in the nature of the Crime, that
either witnesses <hi>neque actu neque habitu,</hi> can be present, so that the
objection amounts to no less then that Conjurations of Treason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
at all be proven: And as to the Law cited from the <hi>Majestie,</hi>
it imports no more then that the Objection <hi>regulariter pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>edit</hi> in
Crimes, which of there own nature are not <hi>perdifficilis probationis,</hi>
and are not <hi>inter crimina excepta</hi> such as the Cryme of Conspiracy
and Treason is<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </p>
               <p>MR. <hi>William Fleteher</hi> Oppons the Objection, and Reply, and
further adds, that albeit <hi>crimen lesae Majestatis</hi> be reckoned
<hi>inter crimina excepta,</hi> and so have some priviledge, as to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Witnesses, yet it cannot be denyed, but there are some
Objections competent against Witness adduced for proving Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,
and Treason, <hi>verbi causa,</hi> that a Witnes is a Capital Enemy,
or that he is <hi>sub potestate accusatoris,</hi> and the Objection new plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
being taken complexlie, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> is not only
<hi>socius criminis,</hi> but also, that he is <hi>publico judicio reus,</hi> upon the
same Crime, and that as means to procure His Majesties favour,
he has submitted himself, and come in His Majesties mercy, by an
acknowledgment of the Cryme, before the Dyet of Citation, he is
obnoxious to a most just Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is <hi>sub pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi>
and by the submissiou, and Confession, his Life and
Estate is now in His <hi>Majesties</hi> hands, so that he is not only in the
case of <hi>a reus confessus,</hi> but in the case of a Witnes, who does
absolutely depend upon His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat the Pursuer; and
as a privat accuser, could not adduce his own Servants to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
because they are <hi>testes domestici,</hi> and depend upon him, so
far less ought a Witnes to be adduced, who not only depends, as
to his Estate, but as to his Life, and the Law gives a very good
reason, and which is mentioned by <hi>Paulus, lib. 1. receptarum sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiarum,

the guilty person will escape. It is answered<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that in this
case, His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat had an easie remedie, for he might
have pursued the Pannal, before he pursued the Witnes, and the
Terror and Apprehension of the event of a Process for Treason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be constructed otherwayes, then to have influence upon the
Deposition of the Witnes; and as to the Citation out of <hi>Farinacius,</hi>
it is only in the case of <hi>socius criminis,</hi> but when he comes to treat
<hi>de teste accusato vel carcerato. Quest. 56. articulo 4to.</hi> He sayes,
<hi>Regula sit in accusato quod is pendente accusatione Ã  testimonio repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litur<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi>
and be the <hi>2d.</hi> Rule of the same Article, He sayes, it is a
principle <hi>quod carceratus testimonium ferre prohibetur,</hi> and he gives
this reason, <hi>quia praesumitur, quod falsum testimonium diceret pro aliquo
qui ei promiserit se liberare a vinculo,</hi> and limits this Rule, that he
must be <hi>carceratus propter crimen.</hi>

SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> adds, that it is a certain principle, that any
person that is guilty <hi>infamia juris,</hi> cannot be a Witness, no
more than a person that is Convict, and Condemned of Treason;
and if he were Convict, and Condemned of Treason, he could
not be a Witness, even in the case of Treason: so neither can the
Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> in this case be received a VVitness, for he being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
a VVitness after he received his Inditement, and confessed
the Crime, is equivalent, as if he had been actually Convict; and
whatever may be pretended, that <hi>testes infames</hi> may be admitted;
yet it was never asserted by any Lawyer, that a person Convict of
Treason can be admitted a VVitness.</p>

and sworn; being Interrogat, if about the time that
Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> and Commissar <hi>Monro</hi> got their Commission from
the <hi>Carolina</hi> Company for <hi>London,</hi> the Pannal Mr. <hi>Robert Baillie</hi> of
<hi>Jerviswood</hi> did not desire the Deponent to speak to Commissar
<hi>Monro,</hi> to try if he could get him the said Pannal added to that
Commission, Depones affirmative. Being Interrogat, if the said
<hi>Jerviswood,</hi> the Pannal, did not tell the Deponent, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to go to <hi>London</hi> however upon his own Expenses, and that
his and their going about the <hi>Carolina</hi> Bussiness, was but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and a blind; but that the true design was, to push fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the people of <hi>England,</hi> who could do nothing but talk, to
go more effectually about their bussiness, Depones affirmative.
Depones that the Pannal did settle a Correspondence with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,
whereby he was to give an account to the Deponent of
what should pass betwixt the Countrey Party in <hi>England,</hi> and
the <hi>Scots</hi> men there: and on the other hand, the Deponent was
to VVrite to him what occurred here; Depones that the Pannal
did say to the Deponent, if the King would suffer the Parliament
of <hi>England</hi> to sit, and pass the Bill of Seclusion, that that was the
only way to secure the Protestant Religion. Depons that the
Pannal said to him, that the King might be induced to do so, if
the Parliament would take sharp, or brisk measures with Him, or
the like. Depones these words were spoke to him by the Pannal,
since the holding of the last Session of this current Parliament; and
before the Pannal and Commissar <hi>Monro</hi> went for <hi>London.</hi> Depons
that after the Pannal went to <hi>London,</hi> he did give the Deponent an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
by Letters, that things were in great Disorder there, and that he
hoped there would be effectual Courses taken to remeid them. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones
that Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> did come to Mr. <hi>Pringle</hi> of <hi>Torwood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
House in <hi>May</hi> 1683. or thereby, and brought a Letter to
the Deponents Lady unsubscribed, but the Deponent knows it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59978:7"/>
was <hi>Jerviswoods</hi> Hand-writing, who was then at <hi>London,</hi> and that
Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> told the Deponent, that things in <hi>England</hi> were in great
disorder, and like to come to a hight, and that the Countrey Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were considering on methods for securing the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And that <hi>Archibald,</hi> sometime Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> was to get
ten thousand pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> whereas thirty thousand pounds <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
was sought by the <hi>Scots-men</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> which was to be sent
over to <hi>Holland</hi> to provide Arms; and that the late Earl of <hi>Argile</hi>
was to Land with these Armes in the <hi>West-Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and that the Deponents Friend <hi>Jerviswood</hi> the Pannal, was to be
sent over with the Money. Depones that <hi>Philiphaugh</hi> and he went
to <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> House, where they met with <hi>Polwort</hi> and <hi>Gallowshiels,</hi>
and that it was talked amongst them there, that in case those in
<hi>England</hi> should rise in Arms, that it was necessary in that case, that
so many as could be got on the Borders should be in readiness to
deal with Straglers and seize upon Horses, and that thereafter they
should joyn with those that were in Arms on the Borders of <hi>England.</hi>
Depons, That in the case foresaid, it was said, it was convenient
the Castle of <hi>Stirling, Berwick,</hi> and some other Strengths should
be seiz'd upon; and it was likewise spoke amongst them, that some
persons should be employed to inquire what Arms was in that
Countrey. Depons, That it was spoke then, that the best time for
<hi>Argyle</hi> was to land in the West when there was a stur in <hi>England,</hi>
or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or words to that purpose. Depons, That every one
desired another to speak to such particular persons as they could
trust, by letting a word fall indirectly upon supposition, in case of
the Rising in <hi>England</hi> concerning the Affair for preparing of them:
And that he was told by <hi>Philiphaugh</hi> thereafter, that there was a
Word and Sign to be used amongst them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sign was by
loosing a Button on the Breast, and that the Word was Harmony.
Depons, the Pannal spoke to the Deponent to advertise <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi>
that he might acquaint Mr. <hi>William Veitch</hi> a forfault Traitor, who
was in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that he might keep himself close, and be on
his guard, lest he should be catch'd; which was since the Pannal
was Prisoner in the Tolbooth of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> And this is the truth,
as he shall answer to God. <hi>Sic subscribitur,</hi>

the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> proposed to the Deponent, that <hi>Jerviswood</hi> might
be made one of the Commissioners for the Affair of <hi>Carolina,</hi> for that
he could not safely stay at Home; and that the Deponents answer
was, that he had no interest in the Affair, and so could not be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner.

way he heard him regrate his own hazard and others, because of
<hi>Blackwoods</hi> Sentence; and that he heard him regrate the hazard our

at <hi>London</hi> for getting of Money from the <hi>English</hi> to be sent to the

Chamber in <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Veitch</hi> a forfault Traitor was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and that Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> did at that Meeting expressly speak
of Money to be sent to <hi>Argile</hi> for bringing home Arms for invading
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> And that at another occasion he heard
some of them say, that there would be twenty Thousand Men in
<hi>Scotland</hi> who would assist the Rebellion, and that he heard Sir
<hi>John Cochran</hi> and <hi>Jerviswood</hi> speaking of it, but cannot be positive
which of the two said it. Depons, that at that Meeting he heard
<hi>Jerviswood</hi> speak, but did not hear him oppose that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

People of <hi>Scotland</hi> would do for their own safety: And that it was

be a rising in <hi>England,</hi> and that the Commission was granted to
Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> by all the persons present, whereof <hi>Jerviswood</hi>

Cochran, Cessnocks</hi> elder and younger, Mr. <hi>William Carstares,</hi> Mr.
<hi>William Veitch, Jerviswood,</hi> and the Deponent; and depons they
did contribute Money for Mr. <hi>Martins</hi> Journey: Depons, that at his

in that condition in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the Countrey was in such a

                           <p> Upon the day of <hi>May,</hi> 1683. Upon a
letter from Mr. <hi>Pringle</hi> of <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> I came to his house in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and he presently led me to a Chamber, where I found Mr. <hi>Robert
Martin,</hi> who was lately come from <hi>London,</hi> with whom we stayed
a little, and discoursed of the news<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and about the present conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and temper of <hi>England,</hi> and in particular of <hi>London,</hi> which
Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> said, was much irritated through some attempts upon
their Priviledges, either as to the concern of the Sheriffs, or their
Charter, but that all honest men were of good heart<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and very
brisk, and after some general discourses to this purpose, <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi>
and I left him, and walked out a little, and he told me, he was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> presently, for he had sent to him; and Mr. <hi>Martin</hi>
had a Letter to him from <hi>Jerviswood,</hi> then he told me that there
were great matters in agitation at <hi>London,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> had
come down with a Commission from our friends there, (I do not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59978:8"/>
remember he named any) but that I behoved not to expect, he
would impart his Instructions to me, for he was to communicat them
only to <hi>Polwart</hi> and himself, (at least for these Shyres) and they
were to pitch on such as they thought fit to intrust with the affair,
whereupon he assured me, that he had great confidence in me, and
his kindness to me oblidged him to send for me, to acquaint me,
that matters were now come to a <hi>crisis,</hi> and that he had reason to
think <hi>England</hi> would shortly draw to Arms, and stand by them,
till they were satisfied anent the Bill of Exclusion, and what other
security they could propose for the protestant Religion, and their
Liberties, and that it was no project of any inconsiderable party
but a design through the Kingdom, and that many of the finest men,
and of the greatest interest and credit there, had adjusted almost
every thing necessar for the purpose, and had concerted matters
with our Friends there, in order to concurrence from this, and had
agreed to advance Money for furnishing Armes here, (I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
he told me more particulars at this time) but said, <hi>Polwart</hi>
would be at <hi>Gallow-shiels</hi> that night, and it would be necessar that the
E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and I should confer with him fully, on the business, about
this time the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> lighted, and <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> having left us for a
little time, being gone to bring Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> asked me,
what news, I told him of Mr. <hi>Martins</hi> being there, but that he had given
me no account of the design of his down-coming, which perhaps he
would acquaint him with, but by what I had heard from <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi>
I understood it to be, to engadge us to rise in Arms shortly, whereat the
E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> hummed, and said, he would look ere he leapt, such a leap,
or some such expressions, presently Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> came, and the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi>
and he retired a little, after the reading An Letter, he gave him, the
Contents whereof was (as the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> informed me) only an order
from <hi>Jerviswood,</hi> to deliver some Money to the bearer, which he had
left with him, and the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> called for his Servant, and bad him
bring up the Money; in the mean time, <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> asked me, if I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> with what he spoke to me, and I told him, I
had let something of it fall to him, but it was not to be thought, that
persons of sense &amp; quality would engadge in such designs at random;
so <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> said, that (though Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> would not commune
with us upon his Commission directly) yet he thought it would be
fit, we conferred, and without taking notice of his Commission,
discoursed of things upon suppositions, and as our own privat
notions, abstract from any prospect of a present design, so after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
we four went to a Chamber, and after some general discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
of the discontents of both Kingdoms, these suppositions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were discoursed (and as I remember) Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> started them
all, or the most part) <hi>viz.</hi> What if the countrey party in <hi>England</hi>
should have thoughts of going to Arms (whereof he knew nothing
but only supposed such a thing, for discoursing a little freely, and to
know our sentiments, what we thought could be expected here in
such a case) would it not be expedient to have a settled Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
betwixt that Party there and here, and might not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
be so adjusted, that both Kingdoms should draw out in one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59978:9"/>
day, and might not as many be expected to undertake in these
Shires, and about <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as would serve to surprize, and
seize our Rulers (I do not remember any named, but the then
Chancellour and Thesaurer) and some to joyn with these on the
<hi>English</hi> borders, to assist them to surprize <hi>Berwick;</hi> and if for that
effect, any Horse, or Dragoons, that should be in the bounds
might not be surprized, that their Horse and Arms might be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to furnish the Countrey people, and <hi>Stirling</hi> Castle; and if
<hi>Argile</hi> should at the same time Land in the West, and raise that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
would not these Measures contribute much to the advancement
and security of the Interest of that Party here, since thereby the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
would be disordered, and such steps would encourage
all that had an inclination to the Countrey Party, to draw to them
frankly, and scar many of the other side to act against them, and
so they might have leasure to joyn from all places; and might it
not be expected, there would be as many in this Kingdom, as would
be able to deal with the Forces here, at least divert them from troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>England.</hi> This is the sum, as I remember, of what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and discourst of, though I cannot distinctly say, it was in
this method, and expression, nor was all moved at once, but drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
now and then, as the Discourse seem'd to give rise to it; and
though I cannot fully Re-count all that was spoke on these Heads,
and tell distinctly, what this and that man said; yet I remember
these following Answers were giving, and (as I judged) acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esced
to by the whole Company; and they were certainly the E. of
<hi>Tarras,</hi> his sentiments and mine, and every one that spoke, used this or
some such Precaution, that if they were concerned, or to give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
in any such case, as they were not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 1. As to the settling
a Correspondence, it was confest to be very convenient for those
of a common Interest; but the present circumstances of Affairs
were such (as was thought,) that none could be found here who was
sit to mannage it, and would undertake it. 2. As to the trysting at the
same time, it could not be done without the devulging the Design
to all Ranks of people, which none would undertake, except these
already in desperat Circumstances, and they could not have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
much influence. 3. The thing was not at all adviseable for
this Kingdom, since if any of <hi>Englands</hi> own measures miscarried,
they would not stur for any such Trust; and the spring of their
motions being always at <hi>London,</hi> there might happen an interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
near the appointment, whereof these here could have no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
notice, and so might keep Tryst, whereby they would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
a prey; and if they should subsist any time, or prevail (which
was hardly possible) the multitude that must be imployed, are
tainted with such wild and unruly Principles, that if once they got
the Sword in their Hands, they would never be brought to Order
without a greater force to over-awe them; neither would any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of <hi>Argiles</hi> Landing, be a just ground for such a Tryst,
considering the uncertainty of Sea-Voyages; and if <hi>Argile</hi> were to
be the Head, undoubtedly many people would conclude that he
were to be suspected of private designs, and that restoring him, might
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59978:9"/>
lay him aside: As also, that dispair might blind his usual prudence,
and prompt him to unsolid, and undigested Methods; and so it
was to be expected, that few of the Gentry (except such as he
had special influence on, or such as were under hard Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
could embarque with him. 4. As to the surprising Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was inveigh'd against, as an Action not to be thought
of amongst Protestants (especially when the very design of it was
pretended, to secure that Religion, which taught its Professors
to abhor and detest such Principles as Popish, yea un-christian)
since it could not be effectuat without Blood-shed of people, secure
in Peace, which being by all approven, Divines and Casuists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as unlawful, and meer Assassination; it was not to be
doubted, that as such a practice would cast a blot upon the whole
Affair, and quite take off any pretence of Defensive Arms, so it
would scar many from joyning. These things were reasoned again
and again: But I do not remember there was any formal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
made, but the Discourse was let fall; and Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
told us, if any of us had a mind for a suit of Armour, he could
provide as many as we pleased, from one who had made a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
lately, to honest men at <hi>London,</hi> of a new fashion, very light,
and at an easie Rate; so <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> and I gave him our measures,
E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> told he had a suit already; Then <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> said to the
E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and me, we would meet <hi>Polwort</hi> at <hi>Gallowsheils,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
we might Commun with him, anent what we had been Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing,
so we hasted away, that if possible, we might both get
home that Night, it being <hi>Saturnday,</hi> and we unfurnished, for stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad, and <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> whispered me just as I was
mounting (as I think) that he was not clear we should commun
before <hi>Gallowshiels,</hi> for he was sometimes too much Good-fellow,
or the like; so the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and I Rod away together, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the way we were both of Opinion, that the Suppositions we
had discoursed of, were in effect Propositions, and resolv'd, if
they were insisted on by <hi>Polwort,</hi> as we suspected, we would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the former Answer, and would undertake nothing in these
methods; When we came to <hi>Gallowsheils,</hi> the Laird was abroad,
and <hi>Polwort</hi> was not come, so we had thoughts to go away, being
both damped with what had passed, and inclining to be free of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
medling; but the Lady would by no means hear of our going
till her Husband came; who, she assured us, was about the
Doors, and she having sent to call him, he would be in presently;
yet it was so late ere he came, that the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> could hardly
have day enough to go home with; so <hi>Gallowsheils</hi> would not let
him go, and he would not stay, unless I stay'd, so we both stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and not being resolv'd to Discourse with <hi>Gallowsheils</hi> on what
passed, we went to the Tavern, on pretence I might call the Bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and seek Horses for Lime, and stay'd there till <hi>Polwort</hi> came
(which seemed unknown to <hi>Gallowsheils</hi>) then we returned to
<hi>Gallowsheils</hi> House, and after Supper <hi>Polwort</hi> whispered the E. of
<hi>Tarras</hi> and me, and enquired if we had seen Mr. <hi>Martin;</hi> and
we having told him we had, he enquired, if we were free to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mun
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59978:10"/>
on the Affair before <hi>Gallowsheils,</hi> we told, as he thought fit,
for we could trust him; Then he whispered <hi>Gallowsheils,</hi> and (as
I understood afterwards) asked if he was free to commune on
matters of great Secrecy and importance with that Company, to
which he assented, then we sat down closs together, and as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
<hi>Polwort</hi> began the Discourse; But since I am not able to
follow exactly the method of our Conference, or keep the very
expressions used, or repeat all that was spoke, or to tell distinctly
what was every mans part of the Discourse; I shall set down the
Heads, and most remarkable Passages thereof, that I remember in
some Articles following; 1. <hi>Polwort</hi> signified that he was credib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informed (but I do not remember he named his Informer) that
the Countrey party in <hi>England</hi> would draw to the Fields shortly,
as he heard before <hi>Lambass,</hi> wherewith <hi>Gallowsheils</hi> seem'd visibly
surprized; and being asked, if his Heart fail'd him already, he said
he did love it better truly to be walking in his own Parks in
Peace, and quiet, than to be medling in such matters; however
he assured the Company, that if there came any troublesome world,
he would joyn with them firmly; and the F. of <hi>Tarras</hi> said, he
wondred to hear of any such Resolution in <hi>England,</hi> for he took it
for a Principle amongst that Party there, that they should make no
stir in the Kings Life (which the whole Company owned to be
their Opinion and desire) because that might strengthen the Dukes
interest; and he suspected it was the project of the Common-wealths
men, with whom he believed, few <hi>Scots</hi> Gentlemen would joyn; and he
was almost perswaded the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would not concur in any
rising during the Kings Life, To which it was answered by <hi>Polwort,</hi>
that he had indeed heard that principle had been generally agreed to,
but it seem'd they found, they behoved either to do their business
now, or lay aside hopes of doing it hereafter, which might be,
that if the Charter of <hi>London</hi> were let fall, they would not
only lose all safe opportunity of digesting Matters; but a
great part of their strength, and he heard all things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
mutually, betwixt <hi>Monmouths</hi> Friends and the Heads of
the Commonwealth Party; and tho he heard <hi>Monmouth</hi> was shy on
that account, yet it was hop'd he would engage, for otherways he
would be deserted by that Party. 2. <hi>Polwart</hi> told us the suppositions
above-written as overtures concerted betwixt our friends at <hi>London,</hi>
and the principal men of that Party there; so the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and
I renewed our former answers also above-written, and maintained
them with all our vigour, wherein <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> joyned forwardly
with us; and <hi>Polwart</hi> asserted, we went on very good grounds,
and he was fully of our opinion, if things were entire, but referr'd
it to be considered, whether it were better to comply with some of
these methods, tho not so proper and justifiable as were to be wish'd,
then to disappoint the business totally, which might be of the
best consequence to all the Party, yet we did not condescend as I
remember to undertake any of these methods. And there was a
further argument adduced against the trysting above-written, <hi>viz.</hi>
That is was talked there was a day appointed in <hi>England</hi> lately in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59978:10"/>
                              <hi>Shaftsherry</hi>'s time, which did not hold, so they were not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
upon. 3. It was proposed to be considered what methods
were most proper in the Companies opinion for <hi>Scotland</hi> to follow
in case of <hi>Englands</hi> rising, whereanent it was said, that all that
could be expected or desired from <hi>Scotland,</hi> was, that upon the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
News of <hi>Englands</hi> being in the Fields, those in the Southern
Shires who would own that Party, should presently rise, and (how
soon they could get as many conveen'd as would be able to deal
with stragling Parties, or any sudden rising in the Countrey) march
to joyn them, and that it would be fit these in the Northern Shires
of <hi>England</hi> waited near the Borders for such, and that they had Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
trysted there to command, and that then it would be season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for <hi>Argile</hi> to land in the West, and these Parties on the Borders
might divert the Forces til he had time to put himself in a posture. These
things seem'd to be the sentiments of the whole Company, but were
not finally determined till the opinion of others who were to be
communed with by <hi>Polwart</hi> were knowen: And it was represented,
there behoved not to be any wilful and obstinate adhering to our
own thoughts of things, (but an mutual condescendance to others
concerned,) otherwise it were not possible to bring a publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to any good issue. 4. All the Company seem'd to agree, that
they should undertake nothing or move in that Affair, till they had
a full and certain account what <hi>England</hi> proposed, what methods
they resolved to follow there, who were to be their Heads, and that
if they design'd any attempt on the Kings Person, or overturning
Monarchy, they would not be forward or clear to joyn: And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here insinuated, that the most they could do (at least for which
there could be any plausible pretence to justifie) was to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and without any act of Hostility, send Addresses to His
Majesty for redress of the present abuses of the Government, and
for obtaining sufficient security against the hazard they apprehended
to their Religion and Liberties. It was said by <hi>Polwart</hi> that he was
apt to think, that was their very design, for he had heard it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
believed by that Party in <hi>England,</hi> that if once they were
in a Body, the King would be prevailed with to quite the Duke, to
be tryed for Popery, correspondence with <hi>France,</hi> and accession
to the Popish Plot, and then if the King were once free from the
influence of the Dukes Counsels, they were confident he might be
moved to reform their Abuses, and secure their Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for the future to their contentment. 5. It was resolved, that
till we got the foresaid account from <hi>England,</hi> and were satisfied
thereanent, and knew others here (who were to be communed
with) their Sentiments of what methods were most proper for us,
in case we should undertake, we should not meddle further; only it
was left to the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> and me, if we thought fit to acquaint
Sir <hi>William Scot</hi> younger with some of the matter of this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
overly, without taking notice of our Informers<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or such an
Conference; and it was recommended to all to be enquiring (at such
as they had some trust in) indirectly about the affection of our
Neighbours, and what Arms there was amongst them; that if we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59978:11"/>
should get an satisfying account, and resolve to joyn, we might know
where to seek Men and Arms suddenly; here it was said by <hi>Polwart,</hi>
as I think, that if the E. of <hi>Tarras, Torwoodlie, Gallow-shiels,</hi> and I
once took Horse, he thought the most part of the West end of
of <hi>Tiviotdale</hi> and <hi>Selkirk</hi> Shire would soon come to us, especially,
when they heard <hi>England</hi> was risen, then we trysted to meet there
against <hi>Mid-summer</hi> Fair, betwixt and which the forsaid account
was expected, but in case it came to any of our hands sooner, we
promised to advertise the rest, that we might meet presently, if the
case required; this is the substance and sum of what passed at the
forsaid conference, that I can now rememeber; but I remember, I
was likewise told these following particulars in privat<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> by <hi>Polwart,</hi>
or <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> (which of them, I cannot distinctly tell) the day of
the forsaid conference, or within a short time after. 1. That
<hi>Polwart</hi> keeped the correspondence with our friends at <hi>London,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
not positively of any of them that was named, to be on the
entrigue there, except my Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cochran, Jervis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
and Commissar <hi>Monro</hi> (for I hardly knew any of the rest)
and as I think, Commissar <hi>Monro</hi> was call'd his correspondent there.
2. That the Money to be advanced by the <hi>English</hi> partie to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was ready, when Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> came from <hi>London,</hi> and it was
expected, that within few days after, it would be dispatched with
some confident to <hi>Holland,</hi> (whither by Bills, or in Cash, I cannot
say) it was call'd ten thousand pound Sterlin, and was to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
(as I was told) by that confident, at <hi>Argyles</hi> sight, for
buying Arms, providing Ships to transport them with <hi>Argyle,</hi> to the
West here, and such other Charges. 3. That how soon our friends
at <hi>London</hi> got notice of the safe arrival, of the confident forsaid,
and all other things were finally concluded there (which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
would be about the midle of <hi>June,</hi> as I remember) they
would come home, and as they passed, would give them, or one
of them, an particular account of all resolutions taken, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat
to the rest, that it was not to be expected by Letters, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to be under figures, and dark expressions, and as I remember,
they were written as it were about the <hi>Carolina</hi> business, or some
houshold Furniture, as I was told, for I never remember, I saw any
Letter, either direct to <hi>London,</hi> or sent from it on that head. 4. I
was told there was a Sign, and a Word agreed on by that party, so
that men might know with whom they might use freedom, the Word,
as I remember was <hi>Harmony,</hi> and the Sign, the opening two Buttons
in the breast coat and shutting them presently; this I communicate to
the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> but does not mind I ever saw it used, except
when I visited <hi>Park-Hay</hi> here in Town, about the end of <hi>June;</hi>
we discoursing a little freely, he asked if I had the Word and Sign
of the <hi>Carolina</hi> men, and I having given them, he said something to
this purpose, that he was afraid that the <hi>Carolina</hi> business did not
go well, for there had been some of the Managers expected here (as I
think he named <hi>Jerviswood</hi> or Commissar <hi>Monro</hi>) these eight days past,
but there was none come, nor could he learn that any of their Friends
had heard from them for several Posts. <hi>Polwart, Torwoodlie,</hi> and I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59978:11"/>
met at <hi>Gallowshiels,</hi> on Midsummer Fair, but I mind nothing passed
but private whisperings. </p>

that if the <hi>English</hi> would rise in Arms, their Friends in the South
Shires should rise with them; and that they should seize the Horses

of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Stirling:</hi> And likewise it was there
discoursed anent the late Earl of <hi>Argiles</hi> coming to invade <hi>Scotland,</hi>
but because of the uncertainty of Sea Voyages, there was not much
stress laid upon it. Depons, It was also proposed, that some of the
South Countrey whom they trusted in should be acquainted with it,
and that endeavours should be used to learn what Arms was in the
Countrey. Depons, There was some such discourse there, as that
the Earl of <hi>Tarras, Philiphaugh, Torwoodlie, Polwart,</hi> and some others
should draw to Horse with the first when the rising should be in
readiness, that it might be expected that the South parts of <hi>Teviot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>

being Call'd and Examin'd upon Oath, Depons,
that in the Moneth of <hi>May</hi> 1683. The E. of <hi>Tarras, Hume</hi> of <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wert</hi>
Elder, and Laird of <hi>Philiphaugh,</hi> came to the Deponents House,
himself being absent, at his coming home, they were speaking of
the Security of the Protestant Religion; and of a Party in <hi>England,</hi>
who would secure, or seize the King or Duke, and that if any
should rise in Arms to Defend them, or to rescue the King and
Duke: There was another Party who would rise in Arms against
them, it was proposed, that some Countrey men should be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to, to try their Resolutions, and that the Resolutions of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
should be told them, to see if they would concur. But the
Deponent does not remember that this proposition was approven,
or undertaken to be done by any present; nor does he remember
who mannag'd the Discourse. It was likewise propos'd, to seize
the Officers of State, especially the Chancellour and Thesaurer, and
they said, Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> was to come to the West from <hi>England,</hi>
for advancement of the Design; and that the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> was to
Land in the West-Highlands, and to raise that Countrey. Of these
matters, all these who were present Discoursed, as of an Affair that
they were agitating, and wherein themselves were particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
though at that time they did not conclude what their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
should be; The reason why the Deponent cannot be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
is, because he was sometimes going out, and sometimes
walking up and down the Room; and though the Deponent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be positive of the very words; yet he is positive they were
either these Words, or Words to that purpose. <hi>Sic subscribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>

1682. <hi>James Stuart,</hi> Brother to the Laird of
<hi>Cultness,</hi> wrot a Letter to him from <hi>Holland,</hi> importing, that if
any considerable sum of Money could be procur'd from <hi>England,</hi>
                              <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59978:13"/>
that something of importance might be done in <hi>Scotland:</hi> The which
Letter, the Deponent had an inclination to inform <hi>Shepherd</hi> in <hi>Abb-Church-lane,</hi>
Merchant in <hi>London</hi> of; but before he could do it, he
wrot to Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> above-nam'd to know from him, if he might do
it; and Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> having consented, he communicat the said Letter
to Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> who told the Deponent that he would communicat the
Contents of it to some persons in <hi>England;</hi> but did at that time name
no body, as the Deponent thinks: Sometime thereafter, Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi>
told the Deponent, that he had communicat the Contents of the Letter
above-named, to Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> and that Colonel <hi>Dunvers</hi> was present,
and told the Deponent, that Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> was averse from imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> or medling with him, judging him a man too
much affected to the Royal Family, and inclin'd to the present
Church-Government; yet Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> being put upon it by the
Deponent, still urg'd, that one might be sent to the Earl of <hi>Argile;</hi>
but as Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> told him, he was suspected upon the account of
his urging so much; yet afterwards he press'd, without the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
knowledge, that the Deponent being to go to <hi>Holland</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
might have some Commission to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> which
he having inform'd the Deponent of, the Deponent told him, that
he himself would not be concern'd, but if they would send ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he would introduce him; but nothing of this was done:
upon which the Deponent went over, without any Commission
from any body, to <hi>Holland,</hi> never meeting with <hi>James Stuart</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-nam'd:
He was introduc'd to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> with whom
he had never before convers'd; and did there Discourse what had
past betwixt Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> and him; and particularly, about remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Money to the said Earl from <hi>England;</hi> of which the said
Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> had written to the Deponent, namely of 30000 pounds
<hi>Sterling;</hi> and of the raising of 1000 Horse and Dragoons; and
the securing the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as a matter of the greatest
importance: The method of doing this was propos'd by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,
to be one hour, or thereby, after the relieving of the
Guards: But the Earl did not relish this Proposition, as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
and that the Castles would fall of consequence, after the
Work abroad was done. <hi>James Stuart</hi> was of the Deponents Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for seizing the Castle; because it would secure <hi>Edinburgh;</hi>
the Magazins and Arms, as to the 1000 Horse and Dragoons. My
Lord <hi>Argile</hi> was of Opinion, that without them nothing was to be
done; and that if that number were rais'd in <hi>England</hi> to the said
Earl, he would come into <hi>Scotland</hi> with them; and that there
being so few Horse and Dragoons to meet them, he judg'd he might
get the Countrey without trouble, having such a standing Body for
their Friends to Rendezvous to; and the said Earl said he could
show the Deponent the conventient places for Landing, if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
and as the Deponent remembers, where the Ships could
attend. The Deponent remembers not the names of the places. The
Deponent spoke to the Lord <hi>Stairs;</hi> but cannot be positive that he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59978:13"/>
nam'd the Affair to him, but found him shy: but the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi>
told him, he thought <hi>Stairs</hi> might be gain'd to them: And that the
Earl of <hi>Lowdoun</hi> being a man of good Reason, and disobliged, would
have great influence upon the Countrey, and recommended the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
to Major <hi>Holms</hi> with whom the Deponent had some acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
before, and had brought over a Letter from him to the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle;</hi>
but the Deponent had not then communicate any thing to the said
<hi>Holms. James Steuart</hi> laid down a way of correspondence by Cyphers
and false Names, and sent them over to <hi>Holms,</hi> and the Deponent,
for their use (which Cyphers and Names, are now in the hands of
His <hi>Majesties</hi> Officers, as the Deponent supposes,) and did desire
the Deponent earnestly to propose the 30000. pound <hi>Sterling</hi> above-named
to the party in <hi>England,</hi> and did not propose any less; for
as the Earl told the Deponent, he had particularly calculate the
Expence for Arms, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>James Steuart</hi> said, that
if some less could be had, the Earl would content himself, if better
might not be; but the Earl always said, that there was nothing to
be done without the body of Horse and Dragoons above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
During the time of the Deponent his abode in <hi>Holland,</hi>
tho he had several Letters from <hi>Shepard,</hi> yet there was no satisfactory
account, till some time after the Deponent parted from the Earl of
<hi>Argyle,</hi> and was making for a Ship at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to transport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to <hi>England. James Steuart</hi> wrot to him that there was hopes of
the Money. The next day after the Deponent came to <hi>England,</hi>
he met with Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> who, with Commissar <hi>Monro,</hi> and
<hi>Jerviswood,</hi> was at <hi>London</hi> before he came over; and depons, that
he knows not the account of their coming, more then for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the Transaction about <hi>Carolina:</hi> and having acquainted
Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> with the Earls demands of the 30000 pound
<hi>Sterling</hi> and the 1000. Horse and Dragoons, Sir <hi>John</hi> carried
him to the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> to whom the Deponent proposed the affair,
but being an absolute Stranger to the Deponent, had no return
from him at that time; but afterwards having met him accidently
at Mr. <hi>Shepards</hi> house, where he the Lord <hi>Bussel</hi> had come to speak
to <hi>Shepard</hi> about the Money abovenamed, as Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> told the
Deponent. The Deponent (when they were done speaking) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to speak to the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> did, and
having reiterate the former Proposition for the 30000. pound <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
and the 1000. Horse and Dragoons, he the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> told
the Deponent, they could not get so much raised at the time, but if
they had 10000. pound to begin, that would draw People in, and
when they were once in, they would soon be brought to more;
but as for the 1000. Horse and Dragoons, he could say nothing at the
present, for that behoved to be concerted upon the Borders.
The Deponent made the same proposal to Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> who was
much concerned in the Affair, and zealous for the promoving of it.
This Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> had in <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November</hi> before, as the Deponent
remembers in a Conversation with the Deponent in <hi>Cheap-fide,</hi> or the
Street somewhere thereabout, said, that for the saving of innocent
Blood, it would be necessary to cut off a few, insinuating the King
and Duke, but cannot be positive whether he named them or not,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59978:14"/>
to which the Deponent said, that's work for our wild People in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> my Conscience does not serve me for such things; after
which the Deponent had never any particular discourse with <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
as to that matter; but as to the other Affair, <hi>Ferguson</hi> told the
Deponent that he was doing what he could to get it effectuate, as
particularly that he spoke to one Major <hi>Wildman</hi> who is not of the
Deponent his acquaintance. <hi>Ferguson</hi> blamed always <hi>Sidney,</hi> as
driving designs of his own. The Deponent met twice or thrice
with the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cochran, Jerviswood,</hi> Commissar
<hi>Monro,</hi> the two <hi>Cessnocks, Mongomery</hi> of <hi>Langshaw,</hi> and one Mr.
<hi>Veitch,</hi> where they discoursed of Money to be sent to <hi>Argyle,</hi> in
order to the carrying on the Affair, and tho he cannot be positive
the Affair was named, yet it was understood by himself, and as he
conceives by all present, to be for rising in Arms, for rectifying
the Government. Commissary <hi>Monro,</hi> Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> and the two
<hi>Cessnocks</hi> were against medling with the <hi>English,</hi> because they judged
them men that would talk, and would not do, but were more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to do something by themselves, if it could be done. The
Lord <hi>Melvil</hi> thought every thing hazardous, and therefore the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
cannot say he was positive in any thing, but was most inclined
to have the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to head them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which
no particular method was laid down. <hi>Jerviswood,</hi> the Deponent,
and Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> were for taking Money at one of these Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
It was resolved, that Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> late Clerk to the Justice
Court should be sent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to desire their Friends to hinder
the Countrey from Rising, or taking rash Resolutions upon the
account of the Council, till they should see how matters went
in <hi>England.</hi> The said <hi>Martin</hi> did go at the Charges of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the Meeting, and was directed to the Laird of <hi>Polwart</hi>
and <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> who sent back word that it would not be found
so easie a matter to get the Gentrie of <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in a Letter to Commissar <hi>Monro, Polwart</hi> wrot that the
Countrey was readier to concur than they had imagined, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to that purpose. The Deponent, as above-said, having
brought over a Key from <hi>Holland,</hi> to serve himself and Major
<hi>Holms:</hi> he remembers not that ever he had an exact Copy of it,
but that sometimes the one, sometimes the other keeped It, and
so it chanced to be in his custody when a Letter from the Earl of
<hi>Argyle</hi> came to Major <hi>Holms,</hi> intimating, that he would joyn with
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and follow his measures, or obey his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This Mr. <hi>Veitch</hi> thought fit to communicate to the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth,</hi> and for the Understanding of it was brought to the
Deponent, and he gave the Key to Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> who as the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
was informed, was to give it and the Letter to Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi>
and he to shew it to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> but what was done
in it, the Deponent knows not. The Deponent heard the Design of
Killing the King and Duke, from Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> who told the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
some were full upon it. The Deponent heard that <hi>Aron
Smith</hi> was sent by those in <hi>England</hi> to call Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> on
the account of <hi>Carolina,</hi> but that he does not know <hi>Aron Smith,</hi>
                              <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59978:14"/>
or any more of that matter, not being concerned in it. <hi>Shepard</hi>
named young <hi>Hamden</hi> frequently as concerned in these Matters.</p>

House, at <hi>London-wall;</hi> sometimes with one Widow <hi>Hardcastle</hi> in
<hi>More-fields.</hi> The Deponent did Communicate the Design on foot to
Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Griffil,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Meed,</hi> at <hi>Stepney,</hi> who all concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the promoting of it, and were desirous it should take effect;
and to one Mr. <hi>Freth</hi> in the Temple, Councellor at Law, who said that
he would see what he could do in reference to the Money, but there
having gone a Report, that there was no Money to be raised, he did
nothing in it; nor does the Deponent think him any more concerned
in the Affair. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> frequently spoke to the Deponent of the Money
to be sent to <hi>Argyle,</hi> whether it was got or not, but the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
used no freedom with him in the Affair. <hi>Goodenough</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate
once, that the Lords were not inclined to the thing, and that
before, they would see what they could do in the City. The
Deponent saw Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rumsay,</hi> lurking after the
Plot broke out, before the Proclamation, having gone to <hi>Ferguson,</hi>
in the back of <hi>Bishopsgate-street,</hi> at some new Building, whether he
was directed by <hi>Jerviswood,</hi> who was desirous to know how things
went. <hi>Rumsay</hi> was not of the Deponent his acquaintance before,
but they knew as little of the matter as the Deponent. This is
what the Deponent remembers, and if any thing come to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
he is to deliver it in betwixt<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and the first of <hi>October.</hi> And
this is the truth, as he shall answer to God.</p>

                           <p>THe Deponent saith, That <hi>Ferguson</hi> told him on, or about
the Moneth of <hi>April</hi> last, that an Insurrection was intended
both in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that for the settling that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair

Sir <hi>George Campbels;</hi> that Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> told the Deponent, that the
Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> demanded Thirty Thousand Pounds of the <hi>English</hi>
to capacitat him to begin the business effectually in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
that he the said <hi>Baillie</hi> likewise told the Deponent, that having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
things with the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> and others, he the said <hi>Baillie</hi>
found an impossibility of raising that Sum; After which the said
<hi>Baillie</hi> had acquainted the Deponent, that they were certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
Ten Thousand Pounds, which Sum was agreed to be payed
into the Deponents hands, in order to be remitted into <hi>Holland,</hi> for
the providing of Arms; and that the said <hi>Baillie</hi> told the Deponent
at divers times, that the said Sum, or at least one half of it would
be payed such a day, and such a day; and sometimes asked the
Deponent, if he had received any part of the said Money, to which
the Deponent replyed that he had not, and that he the Deponent
scarce thought any would be payed.</p>
                           <p>And the Deponent also saith, that having had some little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> he remembers well, that both of
them did sometimes lament the delays in not paying in the Money,
and said, that although the said Ten thousand Pounds were pay'd
in, they, the said Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> and Mr. <hi>Monro,</hi> fear'd it would
be too little; and this Deponent further sayeth not, as to any

                           <p>YOu have now a Conspiracy against His <hi>Majesties</hi> Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Royal Government, so fully discover'd, that
they must want Reason as well as Loyalty, who do not believe the
Discovery; and they must be enemies to sincerity, as well as to
the King, who do not acknowledge it. Beside, that the Councils
of all the three Nations, thought the proof sufficient, for Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59978:16"/>
a General Thanksgiving through all these Nations; and that the
Judges of <hi>England</hi> thought the same strong enough to infer Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulture
of Life and Estate, against some of all Ranks there; you
have a Discovery made here from the late E. of <hi>Argiles</hi> own Letters,
and the Confession of his own Emissaries, the two surest proofs that
Law ever invented, or the nature of Humane Affairs can allow;
and I am this day to add to all this, a new Sett of Proofs in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
that I now lead against this Pannal, from the Confessions of
Noblemen and Gentlemen, who have been engaged in this wicked
Conspiracy; and who from a sense of their Guilt, are content free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Depose against their nearest Relation, and their most inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Friend, in which having thus cleared to you, that there was
really such a Conspiracy, I shall, in the next place, proceed to
prove this Pannals Accession to it.</p>
                           <p>It cannot be imagined, that we would willingly involve our
Countrey men in it, without a Conviction stronger then our kindness
to <hi>Scotland;</hi> nor did His <hi>Majesties</hi> Servants accuse this Pannal,
without the opinion of the ablest Lawyers of the Kingdom, who
did<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with them concur, to think that there was not the least occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of doubting left, to the most indifferent Inqueist of his guilt,
after they had seriously, and with reflection, read over, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the probation now laid before you:</p>
                           <p>The Person accused of accession to this Cryme is the Ring-leader
of all those, who in this Kingdom concurr'd with the <hi>English</hi> Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
as you may see by the Testimonies of all who have Deposed; and
it was indeed sit and just to begin with the most guilty, so that if he
be not convicted, there should no man be punished for this Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie;
all the noise we have heard of it, is but a Cheat, the Kings
Judges have been Murderers, all the Witnesses have been Knaves,
and such as dyed for it have been Martyrs.</p>
                           <p>The Accession charged on this Pannal, is not an accidental escape,
nor is it proved by Witnesses, who can be suspected of unkindnes to
his Person, or his Cause, for it is a long tract of a continued design,
gone about with the greatest deliberation and concern imaginable,
and proved by his nearest Relations, and persons so deeply engadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that Cause, (for which he Suffers,) that they were content with
him to venture their Lives and Fortunes in that quarrel. He is not
accused of a Crime that can amount only to a single Murder, though
that be a dreadful Cryme, but a Rebellion, which was to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us a Civil War, that Murder of Murders, in which hundreths of
thousands were to fall; and to Crown all, he was to begin, and to
be the chief promoter of a Rebellion, in which one of the first
steps was to kill His Sacred <hi>Majestie,</hi> and his Royal Brother; and
one of the chief Witnesses which I have led against him, is <hi>Bourn,</hi>
which <hi>Bourn</hi> confessed that he was to kill the King, and who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
the Pannal sat up several nights with <hi>Ferguson,</hi> the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver
of the Kings Murder, and so familiar was he with him, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59978:16"/>
                              <hi>Bourn</hi> depons, that the said Pannal had been with <hi>Ferguson<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                              </hi> at the
drawing of the <hi>manifesto,</hi> whereby he was not only to be an Actor,
but to be the Justifier of that horrid Villanie: and therefore <hi>Bourns</hi>
depons, that <hi>Ferguson,</hi> (the best Judge in that case) looked upon
him as the chief man, next to <hi>Argyle;</hi> But because no man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to go to such a hight, without previous inclination and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
I shall to convince you, that this Gentleman was very capable
of all that was lybelled against him, remember you, that he is Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
and Son in Law to the late <hi>War<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>â€¢</desc>
                                 </gap>stoun,</hi> bred up in his Family
and under his Tutory; about the time of this Plot it was undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
known, and is now sufficiently proved, by two present Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> and Commissar <hi>Monro,</hi> that he thought
himself desperat, knowing himself to be guilty of Treason by <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi>
Case; and as it's presumable, that a man that's guilty of one
point of Treason, will commit another; so when a man is desperat
as to his Life and Fortune, he is capable of any thing; he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
animated to commit this Cryme, by the intelligence he had that
there was a Plot in <hi>England,</hi> carryed on by men of so great Parts,
Fortune and Influence, and by the too probable hopes, that they
would get all the Western Shires to joyn with them here, because of
the common guilt, in which they had engadged themselves, by
their late extravagances, they made and account of an assistance of
twenty thousand men; and by <hi>Philiphaughs</hi> Deposition, that these
Gentlemen expected the concurse of the Southern-Shires; and thus,
I am to prove to you a Cryme, which is in it self, so probable and
liklie, that it should need little probation, tho I have adduced
for your conviction sufficient evidences, albeit the Cryme were in
it self very unliklie.</p>
                           <p>The Crymes which I hope I have proved, are, That <hi>Jerviswood</hi> the
Pannal transacted for Money to the late Earl of <hi>Argyl,</hi> a declared Traitor.
2. That he designed to raise a Rebellion. 3. That he intercommun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> and Mr. <hi>Veitch</hi> declared Traitors. 4.
That he was present, where it was treated, either that <hi>Argyle</hi> should
have Money from the <hi>English</hi> and assistance from <hi>Scotland,</hi> or that
a Rebellion should be raised, and that he did not reveal the samine;
and all these being found relevant <hi>separatim,</hi> it is sufficient for me to
have proved any one of them. And if a Gentleman was lately found
guilty of High-Treason, by the opinion of all the Lords of Session, for
not revealing, that Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> sought fifty pound <hi>Sterling</hi>
from him, though he refused the same, and tho he believed, it was
sought for a charitable subsistance to preserve him from starving;
what deserves this Pannal, who sought thirty thousand pound <hi>ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
to buy him Arms, to invade his Native Countrey?</p>
                           <p>That <hi>Jerviswood</hi> was designing to carry on a Rebellion, or at
least was accessory, or (as our Law terms it) was <hi>Art and Part</hi>
thereof, is clearly prov'd; but that in this occult and hidden
Crime, which uses not to be prov'd by clear witnesses; I may
lead you thorow all the steps of the Probation, which like the links
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59978:17"/>
of a Chain, hang upon one another. You will be pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that 1. It is proved that he desired a blind Commission to
go to <hi>England,</hi> not to manage the affairs of the <hi>Carolina</hi> Company,
as he confess'd, <hi>but to push the People of</hi> England <hi>to do something
for themselves, because they did only talk and not do;</hi> and what he
would have them to do, appears too clearly, because he tells the
Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> it was probable, <hi>that if the King were briskly put
to it by the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>he would consent to exclude
the Duke from the Succession:</hi> here is not only a Treasonable Design,
(though a design be sufficient in Treason) but here are express acts
of Treason proved, <hi>viz.</hi> The treating with the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> upon
this Design, the settling a Correspondence with him for the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it, and the writing Letters from <hi>London</hi> to him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and the sending down Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> to compleat it by a general
Rising: As he design'd to push on the <hi>English,</hi> so he prosecutes close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this Design upon all occasions. On the Road he complains cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
and bitterly, that our Lives, Laws and Liberties, and the
Protestant Religion were in danger, the stile and method of all
such as design to Rebel; after he arrives at <hi>London,</hi> he engages the
Conspirators there to assist the late Earl of <hi>Argile<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                              </hi> a declar'd Traitor,
with Money to buy Arms; this was indeed to push the <hi>English</hi> to
do the most dangerous things by the most dangerous man<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and in the
most dangerous methods. He enters also in a strict Correspondence
with <hi>Ferguson</hi> the Contriver<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with <hi>Shepard</hi> the Thesaurer, and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stares</hi>
the Chaplain of the Conspiracy.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Alexander Monro</hi> another present Witness, proves that he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
with him, that it was necessary to give <hi>Argile</hi> Money ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
for carrying on the Rebellion, and that they did meet at
<hi>Jerviswoods</hi> Chamber where this was spoke of, and from which
Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> was sent to their Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> to know
what they would do; and though the silly caution was, that they
sent him to prevent their rising, yet a man must renounce common
sense, not to see that the design was to incite them to Rebellion,
and to prevent only their doing any thing in this rebellious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
by which they might lose themselves in a too early and abortive
Insurrection here, till things were ready in <hi>England.</hi> For, 1. This
Comission was given him in a place, and by a Company who had been
themselves treating immediatly before of sending Money to the late
E. of <hi>Argile</hi> to buy Arms, and certainly those Arms were to be bought
for Men, and not for a Magazine. 2. They were treating how
many Men could be raised in <hi>Scotland. 3. Carstares</hi> Deposition
bears, that <hi>Martin</hi> was sent to hinder rash Resolutions, till they saw
how Matters went in <hi>England,</hi> and the return to their Embassy bore,
that it would not be an easie matter to get the Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> to
concur; but afterwards better hopes of their rising was given, which
could not have been, if the true Commission had not been to raise
<hi>Scotland.</hi> 4. That Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> made a Speech to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
is expressly prov'd, and that <hi>Jerviswood</hi> spoke to the same
purpose, is prov'd by a necessary consequence; for since it's prov'd
that he spoke, and that he did not speak against it, it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follow that he spoke for it, though the Witness is so cautious,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59978:17"/>
that he cannot condescend upon the words now after so long a time;
and it is against Sense to think, that <hi>Jerviswood</hi> who in privat press'd
the same so much upon Commissar <hi>Monro,</hi> and who was the Deacon-Conveener
here, and who, as Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> their Envoy declared, was
the person who was to be sent for the Arms, should not himself have
been the most forward man in that Design, but above all <hi>exitus acta
probat,</hi> this Commissioner, (who being a meer Servant, durst not have
proposed any thing from himself, being a mean Person, and being one,
who, as the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> deposes, would say nothing, but
what was in his Paper:) does expresly declare, that he came from
<hi>Jerviswood</hi> and others; and in the meeting with him, a Rebellion
is actually formed, and it is resolved, they should seize the King's
Officers of State, Garisons, and Forces, and that they should joyn
with the late E. of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and put their own Forces in a condition to
joyn with these Forces that were to come from <hi>England,</hi> and they
gave a Sign, and a Word, which uses only to be done in actual
War; So here is Treason clearly prov'd, by two present Witnesses,
from the first Design to it's last perfection.</p>
                           <p>Nor can it be objected, that they are not concurring Witnesses,
but <hi>testes singulares</hi> upon separat Acts, for in reiterable Crimes,
Witnesses deposing upon different Acts; do prove if the deeds tend
to the same end; as for instance, if one Witnes should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that they saw a Traitor sit in a Council of War, in one
place, and in another place, they saw him in Arms, or that
one saw him assist at a Proclamation in one place, and saw
him in Arms in another; or that one saw him writ a Treasonable
Paper, and another saw him use it; These Witnesses are still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as contestes, or concurring Witnesses, and ten or twelve In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queists
have so found, and upon their Verdict, Rebells have been
lately hang'd. The learn'd Judges of <hi>England</hi> being all met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
did expresly find, that one Witnes proving, that A. B. said,
that he was going to buy a Knife to kill the King, and another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
that he saw him buy a Knife, without telling for what, that
these two Witnesses were contestes, and prov'd sufficiently the Cryme
of Treason, yet there the one Witnes, prov'd only a remote Design,
and the other an Act, which was indifferent of it's own nature,
and became only Treasonable by the Connexion; But no VVitnesses
ever Deposed upon things so coherent, and so connected together,
as these do, for they depose still upon the same person, carrying on
the same Design of a Rebellion; as to which, in one place, he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
his own Nephew, and telling him his Resolutions, and settling
a Correspondence with him, at another time, he presses Commissar
<hi>Monro</hi> to the same Rebellion. At a third, He holds a meeting at
his own Chamber, and speaks concerning it, and from that meeting,
he sends a Trusty, who formes the Rebellion. Besides all this, tho
two VVitnesses be sufficient, I have adduced Mr. <hi>William Carstares</hi>
Chief Conspirator, and who choos'd rather to suffer violent
Torture, than to disclose it, he likewise Deposes upon all these steps,
and connects them together, and this his Deposition is twice reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
upon Oath, after much premeditation. And I likewise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
two Depositions taken upon Oath, by Sir <hi>Leolin Jenkins,</hi> who
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59978:18"/>
was impower'd by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and at the command of the
King, and the Council of <hi>England,</hi> upon a Letter from His <hi>Majesties</hi>
Officers of State here, In which Deposition, <hi>Shepard,</hi> one of the
VVitnesses, deposes, that <hi>Baillie</hi> came frequently to him, and desired
him to advance the Money, <hi>and lamented the delays,</hi> and that
there was so little to be advanced; and who should be better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
then one who was his own Trustie, and a Person who was
able to advance so great a Sum; <hi>Bourn,</hi> another of the VVitnesses,
Deposes, that <hi>Ferguson</hi> told him, that the Pannal spoke frequently
to him concerning the same Money, and that he sat up several nights
with <hi>Ferguson</hi> upon the said Conspiracy; and who should be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
believed then <hi>Fergusons</hi> confident, and one who was so far trusted
in the whole affair, that he was to take away that Sacred Life,
which Heaven has preserv'd by so many Miracls.</p>
                           <p>Against these three Depositions, you have heard it objected,
that <hi>non testimonia sed testes probant,</hi> especially by our Law, in
which, by an express Act of Parliament, no Probation is to be led,
but in presence of the Assise and Pannal. To which it is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that these Depositions are not meer Testimonies; for I call
a Testimony, a voluntar Declaration, emitted without an
Oath, and a Judge; but these Depositions are taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the awe of an Oath, and by the direction of a Judge.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>
                              </gap> 
                              <hi>Shepard</hi> was confronted with the Pannal himself, and he had
nothing to say against him; whereas the great thing that can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against Testimonies (and by our Statute especially) is, that
if the Party who emits the Testimony had been confronted with the
Pannal; the impression of seeing a person that was to die, by his
Deposition, would have made him afraid to Depose laxly; and
the Pannal likewise might, by proposing Interrogators and Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
have cleared himself, and satisfi'd the Judges in many things
Depos'd against him: But so it is that Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> having been
confronted with the Pannal, before the King Himself, who is as
far above other Judges, in His Reason and Justice, as He is in
His Power and Authority; He Deposes that the Pannal was the
chief Mannager of this Conspiracy, next to <hi>Argile,</hi> and that he
was so passionat to have this Money to buy Arms, that he lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the delays; and can it be imagined that Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>
whom he trusted with his Life and his Fortune, and whom all their
Party trusted with their Cash, would have Depos'd any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him that was not true, especially when he knew that what
he was to Depose, was to take away his Life and his Fortune; or
that if the Pannal had been innocent, he would not when he was
confronted with Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> before the King Himself, have roar'd
against Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> if he had not been conscious to his own
Guilt. There is a surprise in innocence, which makes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
exclaim, and it inspires men with a courage, which enables
them to confound those who Depose falsly against them; and in
what occasion could either of these have appear'd, more than in
this, wherein this Gentleman was charg'd to have Conspir'd with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59978:18"/>
the greatest of Rascals, against the best of Princes; and that too
in presence of the Prince himself, against whom he had Conspir'd,
but Guilt stupifies indeed, and it did never more than in this
Gentlemans Case, whose silence was a more convincing Witness
than Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> could be Mr. <hi>Carstares</hi> likewise knew when he was
to Depone, that his Deposition was to be used against <hi>Jerviswood,</hi> and
he stood more in awe of his love to his Friend, than of the fear of
the Torture, and hazarded rather to die for <hi>Jerviswood,</hi> than
that <hi>Jerviswood</hi> should die by him: How can it then be imagin'd,
that if this man had seen <hi>Jerviswood</hi> in his Tryal, it would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
his Deposition; or that this kindness, which we all admir'd
in him, would have suffer'd him to forget any thing in his Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
which might have been advantageous in the least to his
Friend: And they understand ill this hight of Friendship, who
think that it would not have been more nice and careful, than
any Advocat could have been: and if <hi>Carstares</hi> had forgot at one
time, would he not have supplyed it at another; but especially at
this last time, when he knew his Friend was already brought upon his
Tryal: and that this renew'd Testimony was yet a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of what was said against him; and albeit the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
were forced to engage, that <hi>Carstares</hi> himself should not be
made use of as a Witness against <hi>Jerviswood;</hi> yet I think this kind
scrupulosity in <hi>Carstares</hi> for <hi>Jerviswood,</hi> should convince you more
than twenty suspect, nay than even indifferent Witnesses; nor can it
be imagined, that the one of these Witnesses would not have been
as much afraid of God, and his Oath at <hi>London,</hi> as at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi>
and the other in the Council-Chamber in the Forenoon, as in the
Justice-Court in the Afternoon.</p>
                           <p>3. The Statute founded on, does not discharge the producing
of Testimonies otherways than after the Jury is inclos'd; for then
indeed they might be dangerous, because the party could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
against them: But since the Statute only discharges to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Writ, or Witnesses, after the Jury is inclos'd; it seems clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to insinuat, that they ought to prove when they are produc'd
in presence of the Party himself, as now they are. And though the
Civil Law did not allow their Judges to believe Testimonies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were confin'd to observe strict Law; yet it does not from
that follow, that our Juries, whom the Law allows to be a Law to
themselves, and to be confin'd by no Rule, but their Conscience, may
not trust intirely to the Depositions of Witnesses, though not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before themselves, when they know that the Witnesses, by
whom, and the Judges, before whom these Depositions were emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are persons beyond all suspition, as in our case. But yet for all
this, I produce these Testimonies, as Adminicles here only to connect
the Depositions of the present Witnesses, and not to be equivalent to
Witnesses in this legal Process; albeit, as to the conviction of mankind,
they are stronger than any ordinary Witnesses.</p>
                           <p>When you, my Lords and Gentlemen, remember that it is
not the revenge of a privat party, that accuses in this case; and
that even in privat Crimes, such as Forgery, or the murder of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59978:19"/>
Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many Juries here have proceeded upon meer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions,
and that even <hi>Solomon</hi> himself, founded his illustrious
Decision, approv'd by God Almighty, upon the presum'd asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Mother; I hope ye will think two Friends Deposing, as
present Witnesses, adminiculated and connected by the Depositions
of others, though absent; should beget in you an intire belief,
especially against a Pannal, who has been alwayes known to incline
this way, and who, though he was desired in the Tolbooth to
vindicat himself from those Crimes, would not say any thing in his
own defence, and though he offers to clear himself of his accession
to the Kings Murder, yet sayes nothing to clear himself from the
Conspiracy entered into with the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> for invading his
Native Countrey, which is all that I here Charge upon him, and
which he inclines to Justifie, as a necessary mean for redressing
Grievances; I must therefore remember you, that an Inquest of
very worthy Genlemen did find <hi>Rathillet</hi> guilty, tho there was
but one Witness led against him, because when he was put to it,
he did not deny his accession: And two Rogues were found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the late Circuit at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> for having murdered a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Guard, though no man saw them kill him; but the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
having been pursued, they run to the place out of which
the Pannals then accused were taken, none having seen the face of
the Run-aways; and the Pannals being accus'd, and press'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the accession, shun'd to disown the Guilt, but desired it might
he proved against them. This may convince you that there are
Proofs which are stronger then Witnesses; and I am sure that there
were never more proving Witnesses then in this case, nor were
the Depositions of Witnesses ever more strongly adminiculated.
Remember the danger likewise of emboldening Conspiracies against
the Kings Sacred Life, and of encouraging a Civil War, wherein
your selves and your Posterity may bleed, by making the least dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to find a man Guilty by the strongest Proofs that ever were
adduced in so latent a Crime as a Conspiracy is. And I do justly
conclude, that whoever denys that a Conspiracy can be thus prov'd,
does let all the World see that he inclines that Conspiracies should
be encouraged and allow'd. Our Age is so far from needing
such Encouragements, that on the other hand<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in this, as in all other
Crimes, because the Guilt grows frequent and dangerous, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
should therefore be made the more easie, tho in this Case
the King needs as little desire your Favour, as fear your Justice.
And I have insisted so much upon this Probation, rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the World of the Conspiracy, than you that this Conspirator
is Guilty.</p>
