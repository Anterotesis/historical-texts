            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>troversies, though in their issues and superstructures
they rise to a marvelous height, yet in the beginning and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
ground, the difference is not great. So in this, though the
differences and contests, not so much of principles, as of spirits
and persons; partly through inward corruptions and prejudices,
together with the secret wrath of God for them; and probably
also, through Iesuitical bellows, blowing these unhappy flames, are now grown
to a woful heîght, to desperate distunces and heart burnings; yet the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is in this seemingly slight Logical question, <hi>an Ecclesia instituta sit genus an
integrum?</hi> Reverend and Learned M. <hi>Hudson</hi> conceives it to be <hi>totum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrale;</hi>
M. <hi>Hooker</hi> to be <hi>totum universale.</hi> That this is the bottom que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
hence appears, that the other contrary apprehensions in Church discipline,
are mostly the contrary consequences and deductions flowing from these two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
principles.</p>
            <p>Nor is it strange that so great a question in Divinity should border so neer
upon the principles of Logick; for all the Arts are nothing else but the beams
and rays of the Wisdom of the <hi>first Being</hi> in the Creatures, shining, and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thence, upon the glass of man's understanding; and as from <hi>Him</hi> they come,
so to him they tend: the circle of Arts is a <hi>Deo ad Deum.</hi> Hence there is
an affinity and kindred of Arts (<hi>omnes Artes vinculo &amp; cognatione quadam
inter se continentur;</hi> Cicer. pro Arch. Poet.) which is according to the refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and subordination of their particular ends, to the utmost and last end:
One makes use of another, one serves to another, till they all reach and return
to <hi>Him,</hi> as Rivers to the Sea, whence they flow.</p>
            <p>Now Logick is of most general use. Divinity. <hi>ratione finis;</hi> for it is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
end of all: <hi>physica ratione</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; for every art riseth here: but
Logick <hi>ratione</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; is most general; there is no art but useth the help of
Logick; nothing can shew it self to the eye of the mind of man, but in this
light. Hence mistakes in Logick are not unusual in Writers upon this subject.
A man cannot apprehend M. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s double consideration of the Church, as
<hi>totum essentiale &amp; organicum;</hi> nor why as <hi>totum essentiale</hi> it is <hi>Ecclesia pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
if he do not know <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>integrum</hi> and <hi>argumentum primum</hi> and
<hi>ortum</hi> in Logick; nor judge his method to be other then leaping, if he do not
<pb facs="tcp:52213:3"/>
know the method of the first part of Logick. Nor will his proving that Christ
gave the Keys to a Visible Church, entitle the Church of <hi>Boston,</hi> or any other
Church to them, unless it be also proved, that the visible Church is a <hi>genus,</hi>
and that every individual Church, as that of <hi>Boston,</hi> is a <hi>species</hi> or part of this
<hi>genus:</hi> Nor will it ever appear whether the visible Church be <hi>genus</hi> or <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum,</hi>
till it appear what <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>integrum</hi> be.</p>
            <p>Hence the first part of this Discourse is taken up in clearing the nature of
these and other Logical Notions: which cannot but be needful in this question,
<hi>Review,</hi> c. for M. <hi>Cawdry</hi> was long troubled before he could find out M. 2. <hi>pag. 64. Hooker</hi>'s meaning, when he saith <hi>totum essentiale,</hi> not explaining it;
though upon serious observation he found it. The Reader needs not be puzzled
hereafter in that kinde, the explication is here done to his hand.</p>
            <p>And here by the way I am to advertise the Reader that the publishing of
this discourse may perhaps be <hi>a supersedias</hi> to any further labours, in answer
to that reverend Divine. His review glanceth at some passages, not alwaies
at the main and most material; when he shall strike at M. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s whole
frame and principles, he may receive an answer <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: mean while this
may suffice, meeting (though in pursuance of M. <hi>Hudson</hi>) with what seemes
most material in the review.</p>
            <p>The second part of this discourse iuproving and applying the grounds laid in
the former to M. <hi>Hudson</hi>'s discourse, would be wel attended by the Reader.
Thou canst not judge aright till thou hast read the whole.</p>
            <p>If any shall attempt a reply, let me desire him to imitate this, which may
be a patterne for all discourses of this nature in clearness, and succinctness,
and close pursuing the point in hand, without distastful reflections and diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from things to men. Many polemical writers are so filled with oddpangs of
their spirits, as causeth a secret kind of disrelishment and offence to the Readers.</p>
            <p>The Author hereof is one who sees about him, understands the Principles
and grounds he goes upon, and therefore knowes what he saith. His relation
to M. <hi>Hooker</hi> (being Teacher of the same church) together with his person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
abilities, caused many to judge him most meet to do this office of love to
him and truth, but the fulness of his imployments, in his constant preaching, and
other ways, was a sufficient plea of excuse in his judgement in his not rendring
an answer to M. <hi>Hudson</hi>'s book; yet upon the earnest desire of a friend (who
was then engaged for a Voyage to <hi>England</hi>) to have a few lines from him
touching tho nature of a Catholike Visible Church (that being the first and
main question betwixth M. <hi>Hooker</hi> and M. <hi>Hudson; viz.</hi> what <hi>totum</hi> the
Visible Catholike Church is) he was induced to promise, that if he might but
have a fortnight free from other service, he would (to satisfie the desire of his
<pb facs="tcp:52213:3"/>
Friend) send after him some Notes upon that subject; which accordingly was
performed by him, and is done accurately and strongly, though briefly, as the
streights of time allotted him would permit. It was in his thoughts to have
given some larger explication concerning the nature and distinction of the
Church, in such Propositions as these.</p>
            <p>PROP. I. The church considered as the subject of Application, (where
it is first to be attended) is the seed of Christ. As the seed of <hi>Adam</hi> is the
subject of propagation, to whom his transgression is extended; so the seed of
the second <hi>Adam</hi> are the proper subject of redemption, to whom it is applyed
by his Spirit, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. The church is either Militant or Tryumphant.</p>
            <p>PROP. III. The militant church is the number of those to whom Christ
is applyed but in part, which is therefore wrestling with her spiritual enemies.</p>
            <p>PROP. IV. The militant church is mingled with Tares, <hi>i. e.</hi> with such
who only seem to be the seed of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 24. to 31. and <hi>vers.</hi> 37.</p>
            <p>PROP. V. The militant church mingled with Tares, is distinguished into
congregations, and is therefore accomodated with the rule of Ecclesiastical
policie, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>PROP. VI. The word church used in the new Testament, suits most
exactly with a congregational political visible church.</p>
            <p>PROP. VII. The political visible church is distinguished in respect of the
times thereof. It was first in a family, then in a nation, lastly among al nations.</p>
            <p>PROP. VIII. The political visible church among all Nations, is
properly called a catholike visible church.</p>
            <p>It was also in his purpose, had there been time, to have given some reasons
of his dissent from M. <hi>Hudson</hi>'s apprehension, concerning the visible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eadship
of Christ. It is most true, that Christ is head of the Church as God-man:
It is also true, that Christ is visible according to his humane nature; but that
is not conceived sufficient to render him the <hi>visible head of the visible church.</hi>
Christ is head of the invisible church as God-man; Christ God-man is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of the world. But he is not the visible head of the invisible church,
nor the visible monarch of the world. Christ hath a more special influence into
his church by his spirit, but his spirit is invisible. Every invisible member of
Christ in the world, is not a visible member, yet every invisible member is a
visible man.</p>
            <p>I am sorry to stay thee any longer in the porch; only there are three sad
hindrances of light in these points 1. Pride. 2. Wisdom. 3. Prejudice. Let
me therefore leave upon thy heart three words of advice, if ever thou wouldst
see the beauty of the Lord in his Temple, and the way of his house, or get the
blessing and good of this, or any other good help for that end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52213:4"/>
1. To be much in humiliation. It is a most remarkable passage of <hi>Ezekiel
43. 10. If they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the
house, the fashion and forms thereof, all the ordinances and laws thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
Oh take heed there be not some unmortified unlamented secret lust to darken
thine eyes from seeing these blessed truths of God. <hi>Dues ineffabili lege spargit
poenales caecitates super illicitas cupiditates (August. Confess.)</hi> It would make
one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>remble to see how dreadful the revenges of God whether for personal
pollutions or for sinful compliances with the former devices and ways of men
in the things of his house, or for secret contempt of the simplicity and power of
the Gospsl, are gone forth in penal blindnesses and other blasting strokes upon
the souls of some in these times: They that will not see the visions of their own
hearts, and of the secret distempers, and sins, and plagues there, mourning
also for them; God will not let them see the visions of himself, and of his
power and glory in his Sanctuary; <hi>They shall ask the way to Sion weeping,
Jer. 50. 4, 5. going, and weeping as they go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Be not over wise, plainly thus; Seek not to accomodate the government
of the Church to the wisdom and policy of Civil Governments amongst men.
We see that crookning the Gospel to the unpurged relicks of the wisdom of
Nature, hath been the ancient plague and seduction of <hi>Arminians;</hi> Let not
the same distemper pervert thy tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghts in this matter. To conceive there
are some reserved cases for Christ himself to come in almightily by his owne
especial guidance, to over-rule in particular Congregations, as he hath done in
that way of advice; why is not this as safe, as to place the help in appeals
and classical subordinations, where the same objection returns at last as strong
as ever: For if the National or General Councel wrong a man, as they have
often done, there is no relief for him upon earth. That that's useful in Civil
Courts and Iudicatories, as Appeals may be, is ever hurtful and pernicious in

<hi>Genus</hi> is a whole, which may be predicated or affirmed of more
things differing in special kind, in the question, what is it? It is said to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
in <hi>quid,</hi> because when the question is, what is the <hi>species?</hi> the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
then must be predicated of it, in answer to it: As when the question is,
<pb facs="tcp:52213:6"/>
What is <hi>homo?</hi> what is man? the answer must be, <hi>Animal,</hi> a living Creature.</p>
               <p>This last definition is not exact;</p>
               <p>First, Because <hi>Genus</hi> containeth not the whole quiddity of the thing: for
when this answer is given, Man is a living creature; there is yet no difference
appearing between him and a beast; a beast is a living creature: and the
question yet remaineth what living creature he is.</p>

               <p>We shall speak somwhat briefly, tending to open the true definition of

                  <hi>Genus</hi>] the kind or general. The word firstly and properly signifieth a

               </p>

                  </hi> of Man and Beast; because the essence of living creature is
common to both.</p>
               <p>The word is translated from Families hither, by reason of similitude; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as Parents are causes of their children, so <hi>genus</hi> is of his <hi>species.</hi> And
because those that are born in the same Family, and are of the same house,
stock or kindred, have all things in common between themselves, as names,
sirnames, priviledges, &amp;c. so in like manner <hi>species</hi> have a like nature in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
between them; as <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Definition is</p>
               <p>Est totum partibus essentiale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Genus est] Genus</hi> is; that is, it exists <hi>extra Intellectum,</hi> without the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
There are universals as well as singulars, and common nature
as well as special. There is a generality, universality, and community, and
common nature of things, <hi>me non cogitante.</hi> Our understanding doth not give
being to <hi>genus,</hi> but it is extant, and in print <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> whether we
observe it or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Totum]</hi> a whole. This is the general nature of it, wherein it agreeth
with <hi>Integrum.</hi> It is <hi>totum,</hi> a whole, because it is distributed into parts, and
is the container of the parts. It is true, that there is more in the <hi>species</hi> then
<pb facs="tcp:52213:6"/>
in the <hi>genus;</hi> yet the <hi>genus</hi> holds them together: All the parts are held
together in the whole, as in the common head to which they are reduced.
They all agree and meet together in the <hi>genus,</hi> in one common matter, and a
common form, as in one point or center.</p>
               <p>As Animality is a common <hi>Vinculum</hi> and Bond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> containing and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
man and beast; they cannot but agree in that common nature, and so
far they must needs agree one with another; that bond will bind them and
hold them together while they have any existence or being in the world.
There will be kindred and community of nature between <hi>homo</hi> and <hi>brutum,</hi>
while the world stands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Essentiale</hi>] It is a <hi>totum</hi> which gives essence: herein it is opposed to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrum,</hi>
for there the parts did give essence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> matter, and form to the <hi>Integrum.</hi>
We must not conceive that <hi>genus</hi> gives his community, generality, or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality
to his <hi>species;</hi> nor that it gives to the <hi>species</hi> all that they have: there
is more in the <hi>species</hi> then is in the <hi>genus;</hi> therefore the whole essence of the
<hi>species</hi> is not in the <hi>genus. Homo</hi> hath a special form, which <hi>Animal</hi> hath
not; <hi>Homo est Animal rationale:</hi> here is somthing in man besides his ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
which is added to it. It is true in this respect, <hi>plus est in specie quàm
in genere; yet genus is totum essentiale;</hi> because it symbolically containeth
the causes of the <hi>species,</hi> and <hi>species</hi> answerably the effects of the <hi>genus.
Genus</hi> is <hi>not a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um commnnium;</hi> and imitates exactly the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of those causes: as an essential cause argueth his effect, so <hi>genus</hi> argueth
his <hi>species.</hi> Hence.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Genus</hi> gives <hi>esse</hi> to his <hi>species,</hi> as every cause to his effect: the <hi>species</hi>
had never been, if it had not been for <hi>genus: Sublato genere, tollitur species,</hi>
take away <hi>animal,</hi> and <hi>homo</hi> will not be; there will be no man in the world.
<hi>Homo</hi> gives being to <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> will not be, cannot be without
<hi>homo:</hi> and as <hi>Rachel</hi> said, <hi>give me children, or else I dy;</hi> so <hi>genus</hi> saith,
give me <hi>species,</hi> or else I dy. <hi>Posito genere, necessariò ponitur aliqua species.</hi>
If <hi>homo</hi> be in the world, there will be <hi>Iohn, Thomas,</hi> or some other Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
or <hi>species</hi> of that kind.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>genus</hi> communicates matter and form to his parts; as the parts
did give matter and form to the <hi>Integrum</hi> so the <hi>genus</hi> gives matter and form
to the <hi>species;</hi> because it is a note of the common essential causes, which are
matter and form; it therefore gives matter and common form to the <hi>species.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The <hi>genus</hi> communicates his whole essence to his <hi>species,</hi> his whole
matter and form: Though it doth not bestow upon the <hi>species</hi> all which they
have, yet it is so free-hearted, that it bestoweth his whole essence and nature,
and all that it hath within it self, upon the <hi>species:</hi> Hence the whole essence
of the <hi>genus</hi> is in the <hi>species,</hi> his whole matter and form; as whole animality
<pb facs="tcp:52213:7"/>
the whole matter and form of living creature is <hi>in homine &amp; Bruto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in man
and beast. There is nothing in the <hi>genus</hi> (besides his universality) which is
not in the <hi>species.</hi> Humanity with his whole matter and form is in <hi>Socrates</hi>
and <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The <hi>genus</hi> communicates the same essence to all his <hi>species.</hi> It is a note
of the common essential causes, and therefore imparts it self impartially and
equally to every one of his <hi>species,</hi> is common to all, all have one and the
same common nature in them. The same common humane nature is in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but containeth all, as being equal to them.</p>
               <p>There is no <hi>totum</hi> consisting of one part; though the entire nature of the

               <p>The <hi>Species</hi> is subalterne, or most special,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genus</hi> is distributed into two kinds; most general, and subordinate:
the <hi>species</hi> is also divided into two kinds; intermediate, or most special. God
hath ranked things in order, that there is a subordination of things one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and one under another. There must be extreams on either side, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
highest, somthing lowest; a most general, and a most special; and some
between both. The subalterne <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> as they stand in respect to
their superiours, they are <hi>Species;</hi> as they respect their inferiours, they are
kinds, or generalls: that is, they receive their essence from their superiours,
and communicate it to their inferiours. As man receiveth his essence from
<hi>Animal,</hi> a living creature, and therefore is said to be his <hi>Species:</hi> and
again he communicates his essence with singular men; whence he is called
their <hi>Genus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The highest <hi>Genus</hi> is most general; the lowest <hi>Species</hi> is most special; the
intermediate kinds, which come between these, are the <hi>Genus</hi> of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours

all kinds of things in this inferiour world are mutable Those kinds of things
that live a springing life are corruptible; and so are those kindes of beings

Scholler is admitted into a Colledge and University, he is admitted into a new
kind of society, where he is nourished and edified in good literature: when
he is expelled from thence, he is cast out of that kind of society. The reason is,
because there is no individual integral corporation or society, but is of some

                  <p>There is a reciprocation between the whole and the parts. Although the

whole contains just as much as the parts, and the definition as the definite:
<hi>&amp; contrà partes simul sumptae,</hi> are equal to the whole, neither more nor less;
they will reach as far as the whole, and no farther; and the whole will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it self as far as all the parts, and no farther. They are like vessels hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same measure, of equal latitude and extent, one as large as the other;

the parts you have the whole. <hi>Omnis divisio debet exhaurire totum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visum.</hi>
But one part alone is narrower, and reacheth not so far as the whole:
this reciprocation is <hi>partium omnium cum toto;</hi> not of any one. For if one
part alone were equal to the whole, all the parts together were greater then
the whole. But that is a clear standing everlasting rule, that the whole is
<pb facs="tcp:52213:10"/>
greater then the part; that is, then any one part. And this being a property

                     <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Integrum</hi> are both existing, and measurable by time and place.
I find M. <hi>Hudson</hi> clearly and fully expressing his judgement, that <hi>Genus</hi>
doth not exist, and that it is not measurable by time and place: I shall
present some of his expressions concerning this business, to the Reader; <hi>viz.</hi>
in <hi>page</hi> 78. he saith, <hi>Universality is of another Nature, being an abstract se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Notion.</hi> And again in the same page he hath these words; <hi>Genus
being a second Notion, existeth not; but</hi> in intellectu nostro: habet funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
in rebus, non existentiam; <hi>for as it doth exist, it is an integral, and
loseth his abstract nature, wherein the Universality doth consist.</hi> And again
in page 88. <hi>Genus is a notion not existing.</hi> I shall name but one place more,
in page 81. where he expresseth himself in these words; <hi>That</hi> Totum <hi>which
is measured by time and place, is an</hi> Integral; <hi>for</hi> Genus <hi>which is a notion,
is capable of neither of them.</hi> By which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it appears, that M. <hi>Hudson</hi>
apprehends that this is one main difference between <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>integrum:</hi>
that <hi>genus</hi> is a notion not existing, nor measurable by time and place; but
<hi>integrum</hi> exists, and is measured by time and place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I conceive and affirm, that both of them (<hi>genus</hi> as well as <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum</hi>)
are existing things, measured by time and place; and that both of
them shew their faces in <hi>rerum Naturâ;</hi> and that the Understanding finds
neither of them lurking or lying hid in the bottomless pit of non existence.
The existence of <hi>integrum</hi> is so palpable and plain, that M. <hi>Hudson</hi> hath no
scruple about it, suspects it not in the least measure, but gives in his clear Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
concerning the existence of it; that he hath seen it standing out from
all his causes, and that time and place have taken measure of it, or at least
are able to do it; he affirms that it is measurable by both. Only I conceive
that he offers some wrong and indignity to <hi>genus,</hi> to deny it the same privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
We shall therefore plead, (so far as the laws of Logick, and ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statutes
of reason will give in evidence for us) and labour to demonstrate,
that existence is a priviledge duly belonging to <hi>genus;</hi> and that he cannot be

                  <p>Second Notions are as real as first Notions: <hi>Argumenta orta</hi> are as real

first Arguments from whence they arise; and have as real a Being and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity

as himself: So those Arguments which arise and spring from the first, as
their Ancestors or Predecessors, are real Things or Beings, as well as their
Parents, from which they descend. Those which some call Nominal (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

not meer fictions; but here the force of Arguing lieth in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Definition is not a first Argument, but is beholding to the first
Arguments for his Birth, Nativity, and Breeding; and hath derived his
whole Existence and Being from them; and yet is not a meer Notion, crept
into the Understanding of man, before it was duely entred and enrolled into
the Artificial Fabrick of Reason; which is one of those <hi>Vestigia</hi> and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
which the first Being hath left behind him. Those who read in
the great book of the world, and turn over those leaves and volumes, may
find the explication of the quiddity, and being of things, or the bounds of
their being unfolded; which is nothing else, but their definition. E. Gr. <hi>homo
est animal rationale,</hi> a man is a reasonable creature: this is the definition of
man. Men and angels could never make this to be the definition of man, but
find it made before their eyes; they gather it up with the hands of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings;
which they could never have gathered, if there had been no
such fruit growing in the garden of nature, or in <hi>artificio rei. Totum inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grale</hi>
is listed in the number of arising arguments, being a symbol of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
and yet is never so much as charged or accused by M. <hi>Hudson,</hi> or any
other (that I have heard) for non-reality or non-existence. We have gained
thus much already in pleading the cause of <hi>genus,</hi> that his ortive or derivative
nature is no prejudice at all to his real being, and existence. We cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but that the impressions of other second notions, have been extant many
thousands, of years; and what reason have we (if we desire to deal imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
to say, that <hi>genus</hi> is not extant, because it is a second notion? For my
part, I cannot deny but that it is come abroad in the world, as the impression

at the matter. This abstraction is common to all Arts, there is the impression
of all Arts in the things; and one may abstract the workmanship of one Art
from the workmanship of another Art. As suppose seven Artificers have bin at
work in building a Ship; the Carpenter, Smith, Glasier, &amp;c. a man by his
understanding may sever the work of the Glasier, or the work of the Smith,
from the work of the Carpenter, &amp;c. The first being (having all arts in
himself) hath left an impression of them in the frame and building of the
world; and here a man by his understanding may sever the fabrick of one Art
from another. When a man looks upon a Tree, by the eye of Logick, he may
abstract, and draw away the <hi>artificium logicum</hi> from it; he looks upon it as
bringing forth fruit; and in that respect he sees a cause and effect there; as it
is of such a colour or quantity, he sees a subject there; as it is placed in such
an Orchard, he sees it as an adjunct; as it containes root, body, and branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
he finds <hi>integrum</hi> and <hi>membra</hi> there; as it is a Vine, Fig-tree &amp;c. He finds
<hi>genus</hi> and <hi>species</hi> there, &amp;c. The Phylosopher looks at the <hi>artificum physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum:</hi>
the Grammarian looks at the word, &amp;c. The Arichmetician at the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
&amp;c. This abstraction is nothing but severing the work and artifice of one
art from that of another, in my understanding; not considering the other
frames that are there growing together with it.</p>
                  <p>As there is an abstraction of the work of one Art from the work of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so there is also an abstraction of some part or piece of the work of one
Art, from other parts and pieces of the work of the same Art growing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with it in the same frame. One may abstract the workmanship of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
appearing in the frame of the windowes made by him, and look upon
that piece of his art, without consideration of the rest of the building, or any
other part of it. So here I can abstract the consenting, arguments from the
rest in my consideration, or I can leave them, and consider the arising argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments;
as the <hi>genus,</hi> definition, &amp;c. And this abstraction is not a real se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of those arguments and affections from the things, but only a mental
separation, whereby a man sees a thing distinct from another, and looks upon
it alone distinctly. I can consider the nature of a thing in the abstract, that
never subsists by it self but in the concrete. As I can take colour from a
body coloured (although no colour can subsist alone by it self) and consider
<pb facs="tcp:52213:12"/>
that quality alone by it self in its own nature, without consideration of the
subject, in which this quality is inherent. So likewise we may abstract moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
from the ayre, and consider it only in its own nature, as a quality where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a thing is ready to flow out of its own bounds, and to take the figure
of another thing. Lastly, thus we may abstract humanity from <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi>
&amp;c. and conceive the <hi>idea</hi> of it in our minds, without the consideration of

and therefore I discerne them. I know not the reason why Mr <hi>Hudson</hi>
should call the nature of things, their abstract nature: for the nature of
things is the same, when they are not abstracted and discerned, and when they
are taken into consideration by our understanding. Colours are the same
seen or unseen: our apprehension cannot change the nature and property of
things. I cannot assent to that notion of Mr <hi>Hudson p.</hi> 78. that as the <hi>genus</hi>
exists, it loseth his abstract nature; for by that reason, nothing existing could
be abstracted. I can consider the nature and definition of <hi>integrum,</hi> without
the consideration of this or that integral; and yet Mr <hi>Hudson</hi> confesseth, that
<hi>integrum</hi> is always existing.</p>

as <hi>animal</hi> in <hi>homine &amp; bruto;</hi> and <hi>homo</hi> in <hi>Socrates, Alexander, Cicero, &amp;c.</hi>
And we must look for <hi>genus</hi> in <hi>individuis,</hi> and there we shall find it; It is
where individuals are. But this doth not argue and demonstrate, that it hath
no real existence. Quantity and quality have no subsistence, but in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
subjects; and yet there are such things really extant in the world. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
savour and odour, have no subsistence, but in mixt bodies; and yet are
real things. There is such a thing as paternity existing in the world; and yet
cannot subsist without Filiation; <hi>integrum</hi> is a real thing, and yet never sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
without his members. And as <hi>integrum</hi> hath his subsistence in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
so <hi>genus</hi> in his individuals. As <hi>integrum</hi> is, where the members are; so <hi>genus</hi> is, where the indviduals are. A flock is, where the sheep are,
which are the members of that body. There cannot be the whole body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the head, hands, feet, or members of which it is made. So it is with <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This seemeth rather to be an Argument, and demonstration of the real
existence of universals: for how could they be in singulars, if they were not
really existing? If quantity and quality are in their proper subjects; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that there are such things in the world. So likewise, if universals are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting

                  <p>2. There is a duration of the matter and forme of individuals. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

no kind of inconstant natures in the world, <hi>viz.</hi> the sust 12. hours, when

by degrees, came into the world in their order, successively one after
another, all the kinds have continued in the world for many 1000 years. The
existence of all these kinds is measured by time.</p>
                  <p>All these kinds also are measured by place; for where the individuals are,
there are the kinds. All the individuals of every kind are in some place or
other; and therefore it may be truly affirmed, that all kinds of things were
seated in some place or other. The stars, the whole kind of them remain in
the element of fire to this day. I conclude this proposition; The <hi>genus</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in individuals, which are in time and place, in that respct is it self also
in time and place.</p>
                  <p>Having premised these things, we shall now state the question, and give
some arguments for the confirmation of the truth.</p>
                  <p>That which is to be demonstrated, is, that <hi>genus</hi> is not a notion (as Mr
<hi>Hudson p.</hi> 81. calls it) that is, a meer notion: we shall labour to prove that
<hi>genus</hi> is not a meer notion floting only in the brain; it is not a meere fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasme
or fantastical thing, existing only in <hi>intellectu nostro,</hi> and no where
else: but a real thing. <hi>Universalia non sunt intentionalia, sed realia;</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
things are real things, existing in nature, and <hi>rebus ipsis.</hi> That <hi>genus</hi> is exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>rerum naturâ,</hi> may appear by these reasons.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Reason,</hi> Every artificial argument is in <hi>rerum naturâ,</hi> existing really in
nature:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Genus</hi> is an artificial argument;</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>genus</hi> is in <hi>rerum naturâ</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> or first proposition is evident, for that is an artificial argument,
which is in <hi>artificio rei:</hi> in the frame, fabrick, and nature of the thing imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is also clear, that <hi>genus</hi> is an artificial argument: for it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an artificial argument, or a testimony; but it is not a testimony: <hi>ergo.</hi>
It argues not by an as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Therefore <hi>genus</hi> is in <hi>rerum naturâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Invenire est in rem venire,</hi> to invent is to come in upon a thing: and it is
impossible to finde a thing in nature, that is not there to be found. A man

grew: nor mines of gold, in places where the Sun never made any.

                     <hi>Genus</hi> may be abstracted form the things.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>genus</hi> is in <hi>rerum naturâ.</hi>

                  <p>That <hi>genus</hi> may be abstracted, is granted by Mr <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and drawn away it could not be, if it were never existing in the things. Men
cannot gather grapes of thorns, or figges of thistles, where they never grew.
If <hi>genus</hi> were not growing and springing up in the garden of nature, it could
never be abstracted and drawn from thence by the consideration of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings.
To abstract (as we have heard) is to see a thing distinct from
another, that grows together with it in the frame. If magnitude were not
really existing in a body, and adjoyned to it, it could never be abstracted
from it by Geometry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason,</hi> 4. Every <hi>totum</hi> whose parts are real things, really existing in nature,
is it self in <hi>rerum naturâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Genus</hi> is a <hi>totum,</hi> whose parts are real things, really existing in nature;</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>genus</hi> it self is in <hi>rerum naturâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first proposition is fair and rational; for there is a reciprocation of all
the parts with the whole. The whole contanies just as much as the pars;
and it cannot contain so much as the parts, if the parts be full of entity and
reality; and the whole be a vain thing, having no reality, or real entity, and
being in it. If <hi>genus</hi> be a meer fantastical thing, and notion, which men have
got in their crowns, it is an empty vessel, and holds no real entity at all; and
then the parts must be empty. A vessel full of ayre or wind is empty, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of that which is filled with water or precious liquor. If the <hi>species</hi>
are real things, and the <hi>genus</hi> an empty notion, an empty vessel, how can it
hold as much as the <hi>species?</hi> If that be an empty thing it pours out nothing
but emptiness into the <hi>species;</hi> and they receive nothing but emptiness from
it. <hi>Animal</hi> is as real a thing as <hi>homo</hi> and <hi>brutum:</hi> And <hi>Homo</hi> as real, as
<hi>Socrates,</hi> or <hi>Plato.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is most true, that <hi>species,</hi> especially the individual <hi>species,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
things. Mr <hi>Hudson</hi> will not deny, that <hi>Peter, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> &amp;c.
are real things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason,</hi> 5. That which gives and communicates real essence and being to

                  <p>Therefore <hi>genus</hi> it self is in <hi>rerum naturâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is a meer fanta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie or fantastical thing, can give no essence.
<pb facs="tcp:52213:14"/>
How can that which is onely in the brain give essence? If it were onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
it could not give being; <hi>Nihil dat, quod non habet.</hi> It is a strange thing
to conceive that a notion should sit in a mans understanding, and brood so
many real things: all the <hi>species</hi> of things should then have a mighty depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon mens understanding: For upon this account, if there were no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creatures, having understanding to catch and hold this bird; it
would imediately make use of its wings, and flee as an Eagle out of the
world, and the compass of beings, and vanish into just nothing. All univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls
would betake themselves to their flight, they would all take their leave.
But if there should be but one rational creature produced in the world, they
would come flocking in thick and threefold, and build their nests in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
and being well seated there, would out of their emptiness pour
out themselves as freely upon their <hi>species,</hi> and make them as real beings as
ever they were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Genus</hi> gives and communicates being to other things, <hi>i. e.</hi> to his <hi>species:</hi>
for <hi>genus est totum partibus essentiale.</hi> The essential causes, which constitute
the essence, are comprehended in the <hi>genus,</hi> and the forme. <hi>Homo est animal
rationale: Animal,</hi> a living creature is essential to man: It containes part of
the essence of man. For the definition layeth out all the essentiall causes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason,</hi> 6. If there be a community of nature and kindred between be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and general kinds of things in <hi>rerum naturâ, genus</hi> is in <hi>rerum naturâ,</hi>
But there is community of nature; and kindred between beings,
and general kinds of things in <hi>rerum natura;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>genus</hi> is in <hi>rerum naturâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shut up diverse arguments in one, and conclude this question. I know
no exception against either of the propositions. I see no ground to question the
first: for what is in the <hi>genus</hi> but community of nature, and kindred between
beings from the first? If therefore some special things have the same nature in
common one with another; and if there be such neer affinity and kindred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
beings; there <hi>is genus in rerum naturâ.</hi> If there be general kinds of
things, <hi>varia genera rerum,</hi> there must be <hi>genus;</hi> for what is <hi>genus,</hi> but the
general kinde?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>minor,</hi> or second proposition may easily appear. What is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
then this, that there is community of nature, a kindred between beings,
and general kinds of things in nature? Constant natures, as Angels, have the
same Angelical nature in common one with another, divided between them.
The Elements have one common nature, being a kin, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the same gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

made of them. All living things are of a kindred. Things that live the life of

entire nature of man is in <hi>Socrate,</hi> &amp;c. the evidence which Mr <hi>Hudson</hi>

                  <p>Therefore <hi>genus</hi> is capable of operations.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>major</hi> is clear; because <hi>operatio sequitur esse,</hi> the operation of a thing
followeth the being of it. <hi>Omne ens agit;</hi> because it is <hi>propter finem:</hi> that
which is for an end, workes or can worke for that end: but every being is
for an end: <hi>ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>minor,</hi> that <hi>genus</hi> is a real being hath been prov'd before.</p>

                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. A second reason that <hi>genus</hi> is capable of operations, is taken
from his properties, and qualities; we have proved that <hi>genus</hi> is not empty
of such things as those are.</p>
                  <p>That which hath proper qualities and principles, whereby it is able to
work, is capable of operations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Genus</hi> hath proper qualities, and principles, whereby he is able to worke.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>genus</hi> is capable of operations.</p>
                  <p>We have made it evident, that <hi>genus</hi> hath properties, and proper qualities:
And <hi>frustrà fit potentia, quae nunquam reducitur in actum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. A third reason is from the sad consequence which followes upon
this position.</p>
                  <p>If no <hi>genus,</hi> no kind of things is capable of operations, all kind of
things are made in vaine:</p>
                  <p>But all kind of things are not made in vaine;</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>genus</hi> is capable of operations,</p>
                  <p>For it is certain, that no kind of thing can attaine his end without operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
where there is no <gap reason="foreign">

which is the end of every kind of being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. If there be operations proper to every kind, <hi>genus</hi> is capable of
operations.</p>
                  <p>There are operations proper to every kind.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>genus</hi> is capable of operations.</p>

the integral in order of nature, for that is made up of the members; and
therefore cannot be before them. A house cannot be before the foundation

Mr <hi>Hooker p.</hi> 255. in his rational discourse about the nature of <hi>integrum,</hi>
made it appear as clear as the Sun, that the members which make up, and
constitute the whole, are in order of nature before it. Yet Mr <hi>Hudson p.</hi>
219. seemeth to plead for the priority of an integral; affirming, <hi>that the
nature of the Church Catholike, visible in respect of the particulars, is like to
the priority of a Kingdom, to the parts of it; or of a corporation, in respect of
the parts of it Which is not meant</hi> (saith Mr <hi>Hudson) in a mathematical or
techtonical consideration: for so the particular buildings are</hi> prima, <hi>and the
whole city</hi> Orta. <hi>Yet,</hi> (saith he) <hi>so M.</hi> Hooker <hi>understands me.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> speaks not of a city only in respect of the artificial
buildings: but he speaketh of a civil body or corporation, and a politicial
Kingdom: which bodies politick, and corporations hold correspondence
with a city, having many houses and buildings in it; which houses and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are in nature before the whole city; which is the effect arising from
those causes: So likewise the members of every body politick, are in nature
before the entire body it self, which is made up of those causes. A city in a
techtonical consideration may be first in intention, perfection and dignity, as
well as a civil, or ecclesiastical corporation.</p>
                  <p>Mr <hi>Hudson</hi> speaks, as if a city attended in a techtonical consideration,
could not be first intended. For Mr <hi>Hudson</hi> opposeth these; <hi>which is not

and the <hi>integrum</hi> receives essence from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being a symbol of the effect.
And how is it possible to conceive that that should be first in essence, that is
last in essence, receiving his essence from the essence of the parts?</p>
                  <p>Neither can any <hi>integrum</hi> be first <hi>cognitione distinctâ &amp; noscibilitate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectâ:</hi>
it may be <hi>notius nobis</hi> analytically, but not <hi>notius naturâ</hi> genetically.
When we analyse the frame and workmanship of god, we meet with the
effects, and go from them to the causes, which we perceive by their effects:
but the causes are better knowne by nature: because as <hi>Res sese habent in
esse, ita in cognosci,</hi> the intelligibility and Cognoscibility of things, followeth
their Entity and being.</p>
                  <p>Mr <hi>Hudson p.</hi> 278 speaks well and truly, <hi>cognitio sequitur ordinem natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae
in se,</hi> But how the Kingdom of England can be known without or before
the knowledge of the distinct parts, I am not able to conceive. A man
may indeed know the Policy, Laws, and Priviledges; and not know all the
severall Towns: but the Towns are not the members of the Laws and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.
A man cannot know the body of Laws distinctly, before he knows
any of the particular Laws; For it is certain, that as the essence of a thing
consists in his causes, so the knowledge of the essence of a thing consists in
the knowledge of the Causes. The common place of causes, is the fountain
of all Science; <hi>Scirique demum creditur, cujus Causa teneatur: ut merito dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

But there is but small happiness to see the outside of the thing, not understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the essentiall Causes, and ingredients into the essence, and being of it:
A man may as well know the nature and essence of a thing distinctly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <p>The numericall difference between <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> is an Argument of
their specificall distinction: it includeth and implieth an essentiall difference
between things, being distinguished by their proper individuall essentiall
forms. It is true, that our intellectualls are so wounded by the Apostacy of
the first man, that it is exceeding hard for us to find out the forms of things:
we are forced many times to describe the forms of things by their accidents;
as we are constrained to describe the Elements by their proper qualities ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from their forms: yet every one of them hath a proper forme. The exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of every thing is from all the causes: nothing can exist and be that
which it is, without its proper form. And the difference of the proper form is
no less then the difference of the common form, but rather greater. Look how
much greater the similitude and agreement is between Singulars in regard of
their common forms, so much greater is the difference of their proper forme.
The difference and opposition of contraries is the greatest and strongest; and
yet they communicate in the same <hi>genus:</hi> these are more opposite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then things that are not under the same <hi>genus:</hi> white and black are more
opposite, then white and bitter, &amp;c. <hi>Gravia bella fratrum.</hi> To differ so
numerically is to differ formally; to differ in number, is to differ in forme: for
number is an affection or proper adjunct following the essence. <hi>Socrates</hi> and
<hi>Plato</hi> have two distinct forms: hence they differ in essence; hence they have
two distinct essences and beings; hence they are two: one cannot be the
other, they cannot be both one and the same: hence they differ numerically
one from the other. Where there is one humanity and essential forme of man,
there is one essence of man, and one man: and where there are two humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and essentiall, proper, individuall forms of man, there are two men: hence
they differ numerically, and one is not the other, or the same with the
other. <hi>Socrates</hi> is not <hi>Plato,</hi> but is numerically different from him <hi>Socrates</hi> is
one, and <hi>Plato</hi> is another: As <hi>London</hi> is one city, and <hi>York</hi> another. The
difference of number is nothing but the difference of the proper and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall
forme, and to differ in number, is to differ in forme: two men have two
different forms, two Lyons have two different formes. If <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi>
or any other individuall men differing in number, should not differ in essence
and forme, they should differ only accidentally one from the other; as one
man differs from himself, or as <hi>Socrates</hi> in his old age, differs from <hi>Socrates</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:52213:19"/>
in his youth; being the same man, and differing onely in accidents, not in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
<hi>Socrates</hi> should be <hi>Plato;</hi> and <hi>Plato, Socrates.</hi> And when <hi>Alexander</hi>
rides <hi>Bucephalus, Aristotle</hi> sits in the same saddle: and it were impossible
not to set the saddle upon the right horse; for every horse is the same essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially;
and he that stealeth one horse, he stealeth all the horses in the world;
because the essence of the one is the same with the essence of the other. There
is a difference indeed in accidents, but none in essence; there being (according
to this accompt) no essentiall or substantiall difference between them. Lastly,
Hence there is (upon the same accompt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> no essential and substantial man in
the world but only Ideal: for all generals subsist in individuals, and individuals
onely subsist in themselves. If therefore individualls differ not essentiall one
from another but only accidentally; there is no substantiall or essentiall man
subsisting by himself: because individuall men only subsist in themselves. If
therefore no individuall, proper, essential, humane forme, there is no indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall
essentiall man subsisting; and therefore no individuall substantiall man
in the world. Every individuall man is an accidentall man, having no proper,
substantial, individual form or essence. He that hath no substantial proper form
hath no substantial proper essence; and therefore cannot be a substantial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
man. And hence there is no substantial individual man in the world,
but only ideal and common: and <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> should differ essentially
no more one from another then Doctor <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Genus</hi> is <hi>totum partibus essentiale;</hi> and <hi>Homo</hi> is <hi>totum partibus essentiale,</hi>

Church is an entire, Ecclesiasticall body politick; Therefore <hi>Boston</hi> Church
containeth officers and members. This Argumentation is <hi>a genere ad speciem:</hi>
An entire Ecclesiastical body politick is the <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>Boston</hi> Church the
<hi>species.</hi> This may serve to answer that Argument which Mr <hi>Hudson p.</hi> 84. 85,
86. useth, to prove that the Church Catholike is an integral, taken from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
appellations which are given to the Church Catholike in scripture. <hi>It is
called a body, a kingdom, a tabernacle, a city, an army, a sheepfold, a wheat field,
a barn-floor, a drag-net, a loaf of bread. Now all these</hi> (saith M. <hi>Hudson p.</hi> 86.)
<hi>and many more appellations have no analogie to a</hi> genus, <hi>but to an</hi> Integrum.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that those and such appellations are firstly and properly appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of an <hi>integrum,</hi> having <hi>Analogie</hi> to <hi>Totum integrale.</hi> But this <hi>totum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrale</hi>
is <hi>species specialissima;</hi> or every individuall Church being <hi>species spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialissima,</hi>
is also an <hi>integrum,</hi> and containeth members: and the <hi>genus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
all his <hi>species</hi> under him, it comprehends the individualls with all
their members under it, or within it self. Hence those appellations which are
given to an individual Church, are given to the Church in General. <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid

                  <p>Individual Christians, which are not members of any particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
are not formally politicall Church members. Visible saints are the
matter of a visible Church; and in that respect may be said to be members
<hi>Materialiter,</hi> but not <hi>formaliter;</hi> because they are not confederate. The
woman of Canaan was a visible saint and beleever, yet was not formally a
member of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church: A proselyte was called <hi>filius foederis,</hi> a son of
the covenant.</p>
                  <p>A regenerate man excommunicated, is no Political Church member. The
Apostles were members of the Church at Jerusalem, <hi>Acts I. vers.</hi> 2, 3, 13,
14, &amp;c. The Apostles had an extraordinary commission and influence into
all Churches: But this is not sufficient to demonstrate that all Churches
made one integral. This may serve to answer Mr <hi>Hudsons</hi> third Argument

                  <p>The Church covenant is not onely a covenant between man and man, but
also between God and man. We read of <hi>two staves, Zach. 11. 7, 10, 14.
Beautie</hi> and <hi>Bands:</hi> there was not onely a covenant between man and man,
signifyed by <hi>bands;</hi> but also a covenant, which God made with his people,

rejoyce over thee.</hi> Here is implyed a covenant between God and his people.
And <hi>as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee.</hi> There
is implyed a covenant between man and man. When we enter into Church
covenant, we binde our selves to God, and to our Bretheren, to walke with
God and one with another, according to the rules of divine politie. We
make not the Covenant between man and man the forme of the Church.
Here Mr <hi>Hudson</hi> is mistaken: who affirmes, <hi>that the covenant of particular
congregations is a covenant between man and man: And this (saith</hi>
Mr <hi>Hudson) we make the form of particular congregations.</hi> See Mr <hi>Hudson

                  <p>Baptisme is an adjunct priviledge of a political Church member, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was a priviledge of the members of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church; <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.
Those <hi>Acts</hi> 2, were admitted into the Church, and then Baptized. they are
said to <hi>be Baptised in the name of the Lord Iesus;</hi> not because the Apostles
could alter the forme of <hi>Baptisme prescribed</hi> by Christ (they were to Baptise
all <hi>in the name of the Father, &amp; in the name of the Son, &amp; of the holy Ghost.
Math.</hi> 28. 19.) but because they submitted to the power of Christ in his
Church and ordinances, and owned him for their Lord, and politicall head,
and then were Baptised. The same expression also we find <hi>Acts.</hi> 10. 48.
The Eunuch was a proselyte, a member of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church. Obsignation
with the initiall seale of Baptisme implyeth confoederation, and admission into
the Church. Suppose a Master of Artes in one University, takes the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in another University, without repetition of his former degree, which is
included in the second; this is no Argument that all Universities are members,
and that there is one integral Universitys consisting of them all. A man that
hath been Baptized in one Church, and received the Lords supper there,
if he remove to another church and receive the Lords supper there,
without repetition of his Baptisme (for that must not be repeated) this is no
evidence, that there is one integral Church of which all Churches are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
This may serve to Answer that which Mr <hi>Hudson</hi> writes <hi>pag.</hi> 90. his
apprehension is, <hi>that a man who is no member of any particular congregation,
may be Baptized.</hi>

forme, which is but a part of the <hi>species,</hi> yet, because the proper forme
is another part, and joyned to it, the <hi>genus</hi> may be said to contain the <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi>
As <hi>Homo</hi> holdeth <hi>Socrates</hi> by his common forme of humanity, to

and so may be said to contain individual men, which are his <hi>species.</hi>
This may answer that which Mr <hi>Hudson</hi> propounds <hi>pag. 95. Totum essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiale
sive Genericum</hi> doth not comprise the forme of the <hi>species</hi> in it self,
but giveth the matter or common nature to the <hi>species.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot but dissent from Mr <hi>Hudson</hi> his judgement concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Catholicke Church, expressed in the next following words of
the same <hi>pag. viz. p.</hi> 95. The Church Catholike is made up of the matter
and forme of the particular Churches conjoyned; as a whole house of the
particular rooms in it. For Mr <hi>Hudson</hi> saith that the Catholicke Church
is first in essence: but a whole house is not first in essence, before the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
roomes of which it is made up. I never heard of a house consisting of
several rooms, that was first made up of all the rooms in it, having the
rooms made afterwards. One room may be made before a whole house
consisting of several rooms; but it is impossible (I conceive) that the whole
house containing all those rooms, should be made up before the several
rooms are made.</p>

33. these are the materials of this glorious Temple. Saints are men separated
from the world, dedicated unto God. This is the glory of a congregation to be
of such glorious materials. It is a pleasant sight to see churches filled with such
men; with men that know God, and love God, having derived a principle of
life from Christ by faith. All church members must be visible saints, having a
competent measure of knowledge, and blameless life: <hi>Mat. 5. 19. Rev.</hi> 22. 14.</p>
                  <p>I. There is also a confaederation, either explicite or implicite; whereby
church members stand bound to walk with God, and one with another in
the wayes of the worship of Christ, according to the rules of divine policie.
An explicite covenant is not essential to a church, because explicitness is but
an adjunct of the covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and because Christ hath had visible churches in all
ages since the primitive church, and yet an explicite covenant cannot be found
in all ages; yet it is to be desir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

meete therefore, that a mans finger, not being a man, should want the name
