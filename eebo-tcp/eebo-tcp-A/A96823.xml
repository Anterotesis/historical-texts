         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO ALL PRESBITERIAN MINISTERS, Who own themſelves to be <hi>MINISTERS</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>GOSPEL,</hi> and ſay they Suffer Perſecution for his Names ſake, to Read and Conſider in this day, in which they may ſee themſelves with the Light within, and alſo meaſure themſelves with their own Rule the Scriptures, <bibl>1 Cor. 9 14, 16.</bibl> 
               <q>
                  <hi>For neceſſity is laid upon me, yea, woe is me if I Preach not the Goſpel.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT <hi>is in my Heart, and that in pure Love to your Souls, and to all theirs that have long heard you, to ask you a few plain honeſt Queſtions, concerning your Miniſterial Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether your <hi>Miniſtry</hi> hath been received of Man, and by Man upheld, or from God and his pure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted Spirit, and by him upheld? If you ſay of God, and the Goſpel ye have Preached all this while be not of Man, nor in man's Will and Time received; then I query, Whether ye ought not to obey God rather than Man, and follow his unlimitted Spirit in Preaching the Goſpel of him received, rather than to leave Preaching as ye do, when commanded by the Powers of the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> If your Commiſſion were received of God or Chriſt, as the true Prophets and Miniſters was of Old; then, Whether the ſame mind would not be in you as was in Chriſt Jeſus, and his true Miniſters and Prophets; who when being beaten, and after that ſtraitly Charged and Commanded to <hi>Preach no more in the Name of Jeſus, Act.</hi> 4, &amp; <hi>Acts</hi> 5. went ſtraight-way and ſpake boldly in the ſame Name, <hi>even all the Words of that Life?</hi> And now, whether all that do obſerve your fearful and unbelieving Hearts, in being obedient to thoſe Commands and Precepts of men, even thoſe Commands which you your ſelves ſay are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and do oppoſe the Work of the Goſpel of Chriſt, have not juſt cauſe to believe that ye have not received your Power from on High, nor been with Jeſus as they had before mentioned; whoſe Boldneſs in the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the confidence of the Brethren, which had believed their report, who had no Arm of Fleſh to truſt in (but only the Name and Arm of the Lord) as ye have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had, when in your Zeal which was not good, ye cauſed the Innocent Lambs and true Miniſters of Chriſt, to be ſhut up in Priſons until Death? This I charge not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all but upon ſome, yet let all conſider the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord, who rendereth unto every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Deeds?</p>
            <p>And now even all that fear God in any meaſure, are ready almoſt to queſtion the truth of your Miniſtry it ſelf, ſeeing your Practiſes are ſo contrary to the true Miniſters, and alſo to the Scriptures which ye ſay is your Rule; read it and ſee your ſelves, and meaſure your ſelves therewith, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 17, 18, 20. to the end, alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 25. to the 41. And ſeeing almoſt all have turned from their own Faith and Principle, for fear of Man that muſt die, or for love of ſomething that muſt periſh or come to nought; and this doth ſtagger many to ſee ſuch tall Cedars as you, now fallen ſo low, even you that ſeemed to be Pillars in the Church, to bear ſo ſmall a Teſtimony in a day wherein Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity doth ſo abound; many ſay you ought not to put your Candle under a Buſhel, if lighted by the Lord; and if that which ye have preached all this while, had been ſeen and learned of Him, ye could not but ſpeak it forth now; and alſo, that if for well doing they ſhould put you into Priſon, it would be a Witneſs againſt them, and a Teſtimony in their Hearts that you have wrought for God, and not for your ſelves all this while; and then would you be no wayes guilty of ſilencing your ſelves, as now they judge you are; and then you would make it manifeſt that ye live of the Goſpel and its Maintenance, as the true Prophets and Miniſters of Chriſt did when all carnal Props and Helps were taken away.</p>
            <p>Again I ask you, Whether it be the Way, or ever was of the true Miniſters and Keepers of Chriſt's Flock, when they ſee the Woolf come to devour the ſheep and tear the Lambs, then to go into a corner and be ſilent there as ye are, for fear of him? Or, whether this be not rather the Way of the true Shepherds and Miniſters of Chriſt, to lay down their Lives for the Sheep, not with carnal Weapons, as too many have done of late; but in appearing moſt eminently for them with the Spiritual Weapons and Sword that proceedeth out of the Lamb's Mouth, when eminent Danger doth neareſt approach them? and whether Chriſts Words, <hi>John</hi> 10, to the 14. be not fulfilled by you, <hi>He that cometh not in by the Door, is a Thief and a Robber, and careth not for the Sheep?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Whether this be not a good and ſuitable day for you to ſearch and try your ſelves in, and alſo the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, of which, thouſands with you have taken part? Whether ye were ſent out in your own Time, or in the Times and Wills of ſome other Men like your ſelves, or in the Time and Will of God, which is contrary to Man's Will and Time? and if ye ſay in the time and will of God, then how is it that your time to Preach and to be ſilent alſo, is in man's time and will, as your actions make manifeſt to be?</p>
            <p>And laſtly, If your Time be in the Father's hand, as the true Miniſters was, and your Speaking as the unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit gives you utterance, as theirs was, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. &amp; 4. Then whether the Spirit of the Father in any, whom he ſends to miniſter it, was ever ſubject to the Worlds Spirit in any of its Precepts and Commands, contrary unto good Conſcience, though in high Places and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallities of this World, yea or nay?</p>
