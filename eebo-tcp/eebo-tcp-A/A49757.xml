            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

be the chief of the Inhabitants of my Pariſh: for although I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Wiſdom and Will of God, as the cauſe of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſtinction among men; and therefore do heartily give you the honour which belongs to you upon this account; yet I muſt confeſs, that this is not the cauſe of this publick acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But the reaſon is, that whereas many great perſons are a great curſe to their Countrey, which they fill with their own ſins, and Gods Judgments; God hath made you the bleſſing of your Age, in endeavouring to fill your place with the Name, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Will of Jeſus Chriſt; and that in the great changes of our daies, you have not, as many, <hi>ſerved the times, and your ſins, but ſerved the Lord, and your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:</hi> And alſo becauſe of your great honour, and love to the godly, able, and Orthodox Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb facs="tcp:38419:3"/>
of Chriſt, and to his holy, humble, ſober, and peaceable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which have been loathſome to others, <hi>as the ſink of the world</hi>; but ſavoury to you, <hi>as the ſalt of the earth:</hi> for which although you have joyfully ſuffered reproach from ſome; yet you have had the honour, like that gracious couple, <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia, to be of note among the Apoſtles:</hi> And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that you were of the firſt that called me to exerciſe my Miniſtry in this place, wherein I have by your conſtant favour and countenance received much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and encouragemet: The ſenſe of all which, together with my great joy in you, by my hopes of your being of the bleſſed number of thoſe who are really joyned to Jeſus Chriſt, and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with his righteouſneſs, and who bring forth fruit in him, (which alone can make of you a ſweet ſavour to God, and for that
<pb facs="tcp:38419:4"/>
reaſon precious, and acceptable to his Saints) hath cauſed me to ſignifie my ſincere honour, and love, and thankfulneſs to you, by this Dedication. Now although I hope I write this in the ſingleneſs of my heart, as believing that God will cut off all flattering lips, and that a lying tongue is but for a moment; yet I confeſs it fills me with ſerious thoughts, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that this <hi>when I am dead, will be yet ſpeaking:</hi> And that hereby I ſpeak to you, as it were, in the hearing of the world; and that ſome whom we are bound in Chriſtian wiſdom and charity to judge as upright Saints, yet the heart-ſearching God may juſtly judge as Hypocrites; and that many who have made a greater profeſſion of godlineſs then any of us, have proved fearful Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, when they have been tryed by Errors, Perſecutions, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments: I ſhall therefore, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:38419:4"/>
upon my ſelf and you as juſt in our very fall into Eternity, and as preſently going to Judgment, and with the greateſt belief and thoughts that I can get of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell upon my heart, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly beſeech you (according to the intent of this enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe) to examine your ſelves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if you were to die in the reading of this) you have a true Scripture-right to go to heaven; that ſo you may find the Witneſs of God by the word in your own conſciences, agreeing with this publick teſtimony of your poor Miniſter: for it is but a poor thing for a man of ſo little credit, and leſs worth, <hi>to confeſs you before men</hi>; but this will be an honour indeed, to have Jeſus Chriſt <hi>to confeſs you before his Father in Heaven, on the great day of the manifeſtation of the Sons of God.</hi> And continue to live as diſcerning the great difference betwixt a
<pb facs="tcp:38419:5"/>
godly and ungodly man, that you may ſtill be known by this chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, to be perſons <hi>in whoſe eyes a vile perſon</hi> (though never ſo great in the world) <hi>is contemned; but to honour them</hi> (though never ſo poor) <hi>that fear the Lord.</hi> This difference muſt needs be great, when I dare be bold to ſay, that it is beyond the tongues of men and Angels fully to expreſs the excellency and glory of the one, and the vileneſs and miſery of the other: And certainly the further inſight you have in the Scriptures, in God and Chriſt, Men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, Sin and Grace, Heaven and Hell, the more clearly you will know this difference. Do but look on the Godly, and Wicked, as they appear in ſickneſs and death, and in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; theſe put an eternal period to all other diſtinctions: there will be then no ſuch difference as Prince and Subject, Landlord and
<pb facs="tcp:38419:5"/>
Tenant, Rich and Poor, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Godly and Ungodly; ſee the difference now, as it will appear, when, <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>Go ye curſed:</hi> and the right hand and left hand of Chriſt hath diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and parted the world.</p>
            <p>Be reſolved to cleave to Chriſt, his truth and people, through all the ſufferings and ſtumbling-blocks which you meet with in your way to heaven: ſufferings will be harder to you, then to many others: the greater your names and eſtates are, the greater muſt your graces be to enable you to part with them; you have a greater ſelf to deny, and a greater croſs to take up: great riches, and great preferments, make many great Perſecutors, and great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates, but few great Martyrs: you muſt <hi>buy the truth,</hi> whatever it coſt you: and the more you <hi>give for it,</hi> the more you will <hi>gain by it:</hi> if you ſell all for Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:38419:6"/>
you ſhall never complain of a dear purchaſe. Look with the deareſt affections upon your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and believe that you will never have ſuch an opportunity to make them happy, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail the bleſſings of God upon them, as when you are called to ſuffer for the ſake of Chriſt: you may be called to make a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; either to part with your lives and eſtates, and to keep Chriſt, and heaven; or to part with Chriſt, heaven, and your ſouls, to keep the world: if ever ſuch a day come, look to the poor ſoul; above all keeping, keep your poor ſouls: remembring that of our Saviour, <hi>What ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> Be pleaſed to accept this poor thing, which I humbly offer to you: give it a little room in your Study and Cloſet, and let the truths therein have a great place in your hearts. <hi>Now bleſſed of the Lord be you,
<pb facs="tcp:38419:6"/>
and your hopeful poſterity, for the precious things of the earth, and the fulneſs thereof, and eſpecially for the good will of him that dwelt in the buſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOw for the reſt of you, <hi>my dearly beloved, my joy, and my longed for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is now thirteen years ſince upon your free choice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I was ſetled to be your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; I mourn that I have done you no better ſervice; yet I bleſs God, that I have done you no worſe: Some of you are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>of my joy,</hi> others are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>of my hopes,</hi> but (God knows) you are all the people <hi>of my love:</hi> poſſibly you may not enjoy my Miniſtry long; though if any thing but death part us, it is like for your ſakes to be one of the ſaddeſt days of my age. Some know I might have had better places both
<pb facs="tcp:38419:7"/>
before, and ſince I knew you; but I never thought my ſelf too good for you: the Lord make me better whilſt I ſtay, and give you a better when I am gone. You will wonder to ſee me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you thus publick; my late viſitation, whereby I was <hi>brought down to the gates of the grave, and brought up again,</hi> was the occaſion of my preaching theſe Sermons; and the unanimous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of four godly, reverend, and learned Miniſters, all known to you, cauſed their printing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which my own private thoughts of them had never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to have them licenſed for the Preſs. I have devoted this little plain Treatiſe to the Will of God, knowing that if he put power and ſavour in it, it will proſper: I expect <hi>to be ſcorned by ſome</hi>; but if God ſay, <hi>Well done,</hi> I care not who findes fault; I had rather bear the reproaches
<pb facs="tcp:38419:7"/>
of thouſands, then that one poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oul ſhould loſe the leaſt ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and ſaving good, which I may be a means to help him unto. I leave it with you as a teſtimony of my ſincere love to you, not ſo much that you may remember me, but that you may remember your ſelves, your ſins, and your ſouls; and that you may remember God, Chriſt, Heaven, Hell, Death and Judgement, which are always preſent before you. Brethren, I muſt needs witneſs that moſt of you have been conſtant hearers of the Word, and that you have many hundred Sermons to anſwer for; but you muſt be <hi>doers,</hi> as well as <hi>hearers of the word:</hi> the ſins of men, and the terrors of the Lord, make me afraid that there is a ſtorm riſing, and I doubt there will be <hi>a great fall of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſſors</hi>; and if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Saviour, you ſhall finde that thoſe onely are <hi>built on a
<pb facs="tcp:38419:8"/>
rock,</hi> and ſhall certainly ſtand, who are both <hi>the hearers and doers of the word</hi>; I refer you to his own words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.24, 25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you let not the world and ſin come between your hearts and Chriſt; let nothing keep you from heaven, which cannot keep you from hell. <hi>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepherd of the ſheep, through the bloud of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be glory for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

And yet, to the ſhame
<pb facs="tcp:38419:9"/>
of corrupted humane nature, we muſt ſpeak it, thouſands that are uncertain to live an hour, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be loſt for ever, if death ſurprize them in the ſtate which they are in, are as mindleſs of a ſerious preparation, and of the change which ſhould go before that change, as if it were no part of their concernment: Methinks it is a very doleful ſpectacle to ſee men unprepared to dye, as buſily taken up with impertinent diverſions, as if their work were done already: One drinking, and prating, and ſinging in an Alehouſe or Tavern, though unprepared to dye: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imployed in feaſting, and complement, and ſuch company and diſcourſe as will leaſt trouble him with ſuch thoughts, while yet he is unprepared to dye: another ſcraping for deceitful riches, or gaping and ſcrambling for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while yet he is unprepared to dye: another quieting his carnal

heart with meer hypocritical out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides and lip-ſervice, as if he could charm an unprepared ſoul into Heaven, by ſaying or hearing a few words: and few will know feelingly what an important work Preparation is, till the terrors of approaching death be upon them.</p>
            <p>One of Gods means for mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, is, to give his Miniſters a ſpecial fitneſs to aſſiſt them in the work. As Chriſt took part with the children that were partakers of fleſh and bloud, <hi>Heb. 2.14.</hi> and in all things must be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-prieſt, and in that he himſelf hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted, <hi>v. 17, 18.</hi> ſo that we have not an High-prieſt that cannot be touched with the feeling our of infirmities, <hi>Heb. 4.15.</hi> Even ſo his Miniſters muſt be mortals, frail, and ſubject to like paſſions as other men,

               <hi>James 5.17.</hi> and the treaſure of the ſpirit muſt be in earthen veſſels, <hi>2 Cor. 4 7.</hi> They muſt be ſick, that they may the better teach you to prepare for ſickneſs; and they muſt be exerciſed in preparing for death themſelves, that they may be the fitter to teach you to prepare. The God of Comfort comforteth them in all their tribulations, that they may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the Comfort whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE mighty Hand of God, which hath of late come upon me, whereby (I muſt bear him witneſs that) he hath in his Fatherly Wiſdom, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Faithfulneſs <hi>viſited</hi> me, hath cauſed me to wink a little at the <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>bravery</hi> of this world, and to ſet before my eyes the ghaſtly ſight of thoſe many Beds of Sickneſs, wherein the poor children of men lie languiſhing: I have ſeriouſly thought what a poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Man is, when he lies gaſping under the power and torture of a diſeaſe; and withall have conſidered how little a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38419:12"/>
or a Fever, or the Small Pocks, or any other diſeaſe, cares for the ſtrength, or wealth, or youth, or beauty of a man. I have ſeen the great changes which theſe make in Nations, and Cities, and Families, and Perſons where they are ſent. I have endeavoured to ſtand at the Door of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, looking on theſe Meſſengers, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multitudes before me out of this into the other world. The Grave, <hi>that Houſe of Darkneſs</hi> tells me, Theſe bring my <hi>ghaſtly Inhabitants</hi> to lodge in me; the Worms ſay, Theſe bring our <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Siſters</hi> unto us; Hell from beneath cryes, Theſe have turned multitudes of <hi>damned Souls</hi> into me; and Heaven from above cryes, Theſe have brought many <hi>bleſſed Spirits</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe, and other conſiderations, I have deſired for my own, and others good, to ſee clearly out of whoſe hands all <hi>ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> and <hi>diſeaſes</hi> come, that I may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelf, and aſſert and teſtifie unto others, the abſolute Command and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God and Jeſus Chriſt have over all theſe things; the true knowledge and improvement whereof, may have a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence upon us in our <hi>health,</hi> to make us daily look and prepare for <hi>ſickneſs</hi>; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38419:13"/>
in our <hi>ſickneſs</hi> to make us fit to <hi>live,</hi> or fit to <hi>die:</hi> and when we are reſtored to <hi>health,</hi> to teach us to whoſe <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> we ſhould live; and to make us ready for <hi>ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> when they return; and by all, to cauſe us to haſten into that <hi>bleſſed ſtate,</hi> and to live in that gracious <hi>frame,</hi> that both in life and health, ſickneſs and death, we may have always a plain paſſage, and a clear and ſafe entrance into that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom of Glory, which is alway ſet open before us. For theſe ends I have choſen this Text, which is full of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that all ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, are under the Command of Jeſus Chriſt. This Scripture is recorded by two Evangeliſts; by <hi>Matthew</hi> in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, and by <hi>Luke, Cap.</hi> 7. from <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to <hi>ver.</hi> 11. they differ chiefly in two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Luke</hi> makes a more prolix and large relation then <hi>Matthew</hi>; and therefore we read ſome things there, not mentioned here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks as if the Centurion came, and ſpake to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Perſon,</hi> v. 5, 6. but <hi>Luke</hi> tells us expreſly, that he ſent unto him the <hi>Elders of the Jews,</hi> v. 3. and after ſent other <hi>friends</hi> to meet him, v. 6. This
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38419:13"/>
difference hath made ſome conceive, that they are diſtinct Relations of two diſtinct Miracles; but without ground: for it is ordinary to ſpeak of that which a man doth by others, as if he did it by himſelf; as the words which <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſpake by his Diſciples, are mentioned as if he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.2, 3.</p>
            <p>So the Evangeliſt here reports, that the Centurion came to Chriſt, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; meaning, not that he came in perſon, but that he came and ſpake by his meſſengers, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> explains it: and thus the two Evangeliſts are reconciled. Now why the Centurion came not to Chriſt in perſon; whether it was, becauſe he thought he had no right to come for ſuch a mercy, being a Gentile; or whether the ſenſe of his unworthineſs made him afraid or aſhamed to come; or what other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there was, becauſe it cannot certainly be known, therefore it is not wiſdom too curiouſly to enquire.</p>
            <p>The Text is a Narration of Chriſts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous healing the Centurions ſervant of a deadly diſeaſe, upon the faith and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his good Maſter. There are three main things which make up the ſubject of this Narration.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:38419:14"/>1. The Servants mortal diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Maſters miraculous Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſts Miraculous Cure.</p>
            <p>In the whole, obſerve theſe four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is the Centurions ſervant lying diſeaſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Lord, my ſervant lies at home ſick of the Palſie, grievouſly tormented. Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.2. <hi>He was ſick, ready to die.</hi> The perſon thus viſited, was a ſervant: in <hi>Matthew,</hi> the Centurion is ſaid to call him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which may be tranſlated, <hi>my child</hi>; for the word is ambiguous, ſignifying either a child, or a ſervant: but in <hi>Luke</hi> he is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a <hi>ſervant</hi>; yet it is ſaid, a ſervant who was dear to him: and it ſeems, by conſidering both together, that he was a good, faithful, and obedient ſervant, and therefore as dear to his Maſter as his child.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take occaſion from hence to call upon ſervants to do the Will of God in their Relation: Servants, labour in all faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and diligence, to honour your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; keep up their Authority in your Souls, and let your whole carriage ſavour of a heart that willingly, chearfully, and humbly yields up it ſelf in obedient ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereunto: 1 Pet. 2.18. <hi>Servants, be ſubject to your Maſters with all fear.</hi> 1 Tim.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38419:14"/>
6.1. <hi>Let ſervants count their own Maſters worthy of all honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider the Family where thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is Jeſus Chriſts; he is the Great Maſter of every Family; and he hath given Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the Maſter of the Family where thou dwelleſt to be his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> therein, and to bear his Image and Authority, and to rule in his ſtead: therefore as thou art a Chriſtian, and ſo to honour Chriſt by believing in him, and by rejoycing in him, and by doing his Will; ſo the honour thou oweſt to Jeſus Chriſt, as thou art a ſervant, is to honour, and ſerve, and obey thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in him: The Apoſtle requires the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of ſervants to their Maſters for this very reaſon, Col. 3.23, 24. <hi>And whatſoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men. — For ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Servants, believe that you are threſhing for Chriſt, and plowing for Chriſt, and ſpinning for Chriſt; this will make you do your ſervice heartily, when you conſider that you are therein ſerving the Lord Chriſt; and this will make you afraid of diſobeying, and deſpiſing your Maſters, when you conſider that you do thereby, as much as in you lies, depoſe the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt from ruling and governing in the Family.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:38419:15"/>2. Conſider, that you do hereby adorn the Goſpel of Chriſt: This is the Apoſtles argument, Tit. 2.10. <hi>That they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi> What Doctrine this is, appears by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, the Doctrine of the <hi>Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation.</hi> Oh how ſhould this prevail with you, to conſider, that when in conſcience to God you are faithful, diligent, quiet, and obedient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, you are a precious Ornament to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt! The Goſpel is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, not only by Miniſters when they preach the Goſpel, and by Martyrs when they die for the Goſpel; but alſo by poor ſervants, when they live in their ſervice, as thoſe who are ruled by the Goſpel: therefore believe the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt, as it is revealed, and appears in the Goſpel; and then own and honour the Face, and Image, and Authority of the ſame Chriſt, as it ſhines in thy Maſter, whom he hath placed to bear his Authority over thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, that faithful ſervants are exceeding precious to Jeſus Chriſt: Thou thinkeſt it a ſad caſe, that thou muſt ſpend all thy daies to toil and drudge like a poor ſervant; but conſider the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 7.21. <hi>Art thou called being a ſervant? care
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38419:15"/>
not for it:</hi> never let that trouble thee, that thou art a ſervant: And the Apoſtle gives this reaſon for thy comfort, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>For he that is called in the Lord, being a ſervant, is the Lords free-man.</hi> When many a gallant Lord and Lady is a ſervant to ſin, and a ſlave to the Devil, and ſtands bound to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the wrath of God for ever; thou that art but a poor godly ſervant, and art bound to men; yet thou art ſet free from Sin, and Satan, and Hell, and haſt a ſure right to all the priviledges of Believers; though thou art in this mean relation of a ſervant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, yet thou ſtandeſt in all the glorious relations to Jeſus Chriſt: a poor ſervant, and a King and Prieſt to God: a poor ſervant, and a Wife and Brother of Jeſus Chriſt: a poor ſervant, and a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heir of the Kingdom of Heaven. I tell thee, though thou art but a poor ſervant, yet godlineſs will put ſuch a <hi>grace</hi> upon thee, as to make thee a glory to Chriſt, a crown and joy to thy Miniſter, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to Gods people, a terrour to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wicked man about thee, and a very tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Devil of Hell.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, conſider, that this is thy particular way, wherein thou art called to pleaſe and honour God, and to work out thy own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38419:16"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.23. <hi>The ſteps of a good man</hi> (be he never ſo poor) <hi>are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his way.</hi> It was an high and holy ſaying of one, That a poor Milkmaid walking in obedience to God in her calling, doth bring more glory to God then heaven and earth. There is no duty which thou art bound unto, as a man, or as a Chriſtian, which hinders thee in thy duty to God and man, as thou art a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: for Gods commandments do not croſs and interrupt one another; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin againſt Gods Will, whilſt we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Will; and true Grace will make thee a gracious ſervant, as well as a gracious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: the ſame faith and love which cauſes thee to believe in, and to cleave unto Jeſus Chriſt, will cauſe thee to ſee, and to love, and to obey his will and authority in thy Maſter: So that when thou art moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and diligent, and obedient in thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, thou wilt finde moſt freedom and ſweetneſs in Prayer, in Sermons, in ſinging Pſalms, and in feeding upon the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The Apoſtle requires all ſervants to be filled with this principle, in their walking obediently to their Maſters: <hi>Knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the reward of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> Col. 3.24. teaching all ſervants
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38419:16"/>
to walk in their Callings ſo, as thoſe that know, that this is their way to heaven: Ah poor ſervants, rejoyce in your <hi>work,</hi> for heaven is your <hi>wages</hi>; and let me tell you, that you are never like to ſee a fairer way to heaven, then you have now you are ſervants: you will finde, if ever you come to be huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and wives, and parents, and rulers of families, that it is harder to <hi>rule</hi> then to <hi>obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are amongſt many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, theſe three things, which ſervants pretend, to excuſe their irreverence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to their Maſters, which I ſhall briefly anſwer, and then proceed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſervant will plead that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is a poor man; if he were as rich and great a man, as ſome other Maſters are, then I would honour him; but he is poor, and I am come of as good friends as he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though thy Maſter be poor and mean, yet he ſtands in the place, and bears the authority of the great and glorious God: and if thou ſeeſt reaſon to obey a Maſter becauſe he is rich, and ſeeſt no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the authority of God upon him, and in the command of God upon thee to obey a poor Maſter, it is a ſad ſigne that thou doſt honour riches more then God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:38419:17"/>Secondly, but my Maſter is a wicked man, and then how can I honour him and obey him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thy Maſter indeed cannot binde thee to ſin againſt God: for it can in no caſe be a mans duty to hate God, and to damn his own ſoul; yet when thou diſobeyeſt his ſinful commands, let it appear, that this is not to <hi>croſs</hi> thy Maſter, but to <hi>pleaſe</hi> God: and though he be wicked, yet ſtill honour and obey him in the Lord, and own the image and authority of Chriſt upon him, which is holy and good.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, my Maſter is ſo friendly, that he looks for no ſuch reverence: he allows me to be bold, and to be fellow-like with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is thy Maſters ſin, who is bound to keep up that order, which God in wiſdom hath appointed; and he cannot give away the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, nor looſe thee from thy duty, whereby God hath bound thee to honour, and reverence, and obey him.</p>
            <p>So much for the firſt Particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the Centurions ſervant lyes diſeaſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the care of the good Maſter over his faithful ſervant; the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant lyes gaſping at the door of death, and the Maſter lyes praying for him at the door
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38419:17"/>
of mercy, ver. 5, 6. <hi>He came beſeeching him, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here is an example for all Maſters, to teach them to be tender, and careful of, and to uſe all good means for the healing of their ſick ſervants; as the good Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion doth here, whoſe fatherly care and love towards his dear dying ſervant, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He keeps him at home.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is full of compaſſion towards him, being ſenſible of his grief; therefore (ſaith he) <hi>he lies grievouſly tormented</hi>; his bowels earned towards him, and he uſeth words to move the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He uſeth the beſt means in the world for his cure; he ſeeks help of Jeſus Chriſt, and exerciſeth all the might of his Soul, in praying for, and believing a Miracle for the healing of his poor ſervant. You that are Maſters, learn here your duty; conſider you have men and women to your ſervants, made after the ſame Image of God with your ſelves; let not then ſuch a workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God periſh by your cruelty, covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or negligence. They are Chriſtian ſervants; Chriſt paid as dear for ſervants, as for Maſters; they are all bought with the ſame price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:38419:18"/>Your poor ſervants have need of further ſeaſon for repentance, and to work out their ſalvation; therefore let not them by your negligence be haſtned into eternity: your ſervants ſickneſs is an affliction from God upon you; he lays this burden on your family; therefore ſubmit to him, and wait upon him in the uſe of means to remove it; and eaſe not thy ſelf by thy ſin, to bring a worſe burden upon thy conſcience. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der further, your eſtate is Gods, and you uſe it for him in a relieving a ſick ſervant; and I dare ſay, neither you, nor your children, ſhall be the poorer, by exerciſing ſuch charity. To conclude, conſider that of the Apoſtle, Col. 4.1. <hi>Maſters, give unto your ſervants that which is juſt and equal, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ye alſo have a Maſter in Heaven.</hi> Now this is one thing, which by the Law of God, and the Law of Humanity and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is juſt and equal, that Maſters uſe all good means in their power, for the health, and eaſe, and life of a ſick ſervant; and this you muſt do, as <hi>knowing that you have a Maſter in Heaven,</hi> to whom all the wrong, and injuſtice, and unmercifulneſs which you ſhew to your ſervants, will cry for vengeance againſt you; therefore think with thy ſelf, as <hi>Job</hi> did in the like caſe,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38419:18"/>
Chap. 31.14. <hi>What then ſhall I do when God riſeth up? and when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is one thing more for all ſervants to learn; that is, to chuſe to live in families where God is worſhipt: What a mercy was it to this ſick ſervant, that he had a Maſter that prayed for him! Certainly it would much promote Family-worſhip, if ſervants would not chuſe to live in a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-leſs family. I know it's a diſhonour to God, a reproach to Religion, and a wrong to ſervants, that in many families there is uſed ſuch unſeaſonable times for family-worſhip: I do therefore ſeriouſly adviſe all Maſters of Families, into whoſe hands this ſhall come, to order your buſineſs ſo, as to make that your ordinary ſet time to worſhip God, when you are like to be in the beſt frame; and I am perſwaded you will finde, when once you have wiſely ſet your ſeaſon for morning and evening wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and diligently obſerved it, that in a ſhort time your buſineſs will ordinarily fall ſo, as at thoſe times to leave room for thoſe duties; however, chuſe your <hi>own time</hi> for family-worſhip, and not your <hi>ſervants time</hi>; rather when your ſervants ſhould <hi>work,</hi> then when they ſhould <hi>ſleep</hi>; and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38419:19"/>
let all ſervants make it their choice to dwell in ſuch families, where they are moſt like to be helped forward in their way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. Chriſts anſwer to the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions prayer for his ſick ſervant, ver. 7. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid, I will come and heal him:</hi> He offers his preſence to come, and his power and mercy to heal him; he grants more then the Centurion begs. Obſerve, <hi>God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten gives more, but never leſs then believers ſincerely ask</hi>; Eph. 3.20. <hi>He is able</hi> (and willing) <hi>to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think:</hi> for the power and goodneſs of God, is infinitely above the higheſt Faith of the greateſt Believer; we can pray but like men, but he gives like an Infinite God. Now Chriſt offers to come to his houſe, as it appears, to ſet awork the Centurions faith: for this paſſage, <hi>I will come,</hi> gives occaſion for the following words, wherein he pleads two things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſts coming to his houſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His own unworthineſs, ver. 8. <hi>I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt come under my roof.</hi> Wherein we may ſee the gracious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of this great Believer: when he hath the higheſt thoughts of God, he hath the loweſt thoughts of himſelf; this is <hi>Fidei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genium,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:38419:19"/>
as one calls it, <hi>the ingenious property of Faith:</hi> by it, when a Believer doth moſt exalt God, he doth moſt abaſe himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He pleads, that it was unneceſſary for Chriſt to trouble himſelf to come to his houſe, for he could heal him by ſpeaking a word: <hi>Speak the word only, and my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhall be healed.</hi> Herein he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe peculiar Prerogative it is to ſpeak creating words, Pſal. 33.9. <hi>He ſpake, and it was done; he commanded, and it ſtood faſt:</hi> And this truth, that Jeſus Chriſt could by ſpeaking a word, command and create the cure, he proves by an argument taken from the leſs to the greater, ver. 9. <hi>For I am a man under Authority, having Souldiers under me,</hi> &amp;c. You may eaſily ſee the ſtrength of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in this plain Paraphraſe; <hi>I am but a man,</hi> and thou art the true God; <hi>I am under Authority,</hi> but all the power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in Earth, is thine; <hi>I have Souldiers and ſervants under me,</hi> and thou haſt all things under thee. Now (ſaith he) if I bid my Souldier go and march to ſuch a place, he goes: and if I command another to come from quartering in ſuch a place, he comes: and if I ſay to my ſervant, Do ſuch a buſineſs, he doth it. Thus all ſickneſſes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38419:20"/>
and diſeaſes are under thy command: if thou ſayſt to a Fever, Go and turn the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of ſuch a one into the drought in Summer, it goes; and to the Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Go and rot the Lungs, and eat up the fleſh of ſuch a one, it goes; and to the Palſie, Go and torment ſuch a one, it goes; and if thou commandeſt back a diſeaſe, and ſayeſt, Come away, and ſpare the life of ſuch a one, it preſently comes. And again, if thou biddeſt any diſeaſe Do this, make ſuch a Father Childleſs, ſuch a Wife a Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, ſuch Children Fatherleſs, it preſently doth it. And thus he wiſely and ſtrongly pleads, that all diſeaſes are at the Will of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that a word from him makes them <hi>go and come, and do what he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. Chriſts carriage after the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions ſpeech, ver. 10. <hi>When Jeſus heard it, he marvelled:</hi> That muſt needs be a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Faith, which makes Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to marvel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He highly commends the Centurions Faith: <hi>I have not found ſo great Faith, no not in Iſrael.</hi> There are three things which ſpeak the greatneſs of his Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was the Faith of a Gentile; and this Chriſt ſeems to intend, by comparing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38419:20"/>
it with, and preferring it before the Faith of his <hi>Iſrael</hi>; ſaying, <hi>I have not found ſo great Faith, no not in Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe he did believe a great truth: this is a great truth, worthy of thy ſtrongeſt faith to be exerciſed in, that Jeſus Chriſt is that God who commands and rules all the diſeaſes and ſickneſſes of men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe of the great power and life which appeared in the grace it ſelf: now the might and ſtrength of his faith is ſeen, both becauſe by it he ſaw the ſubſtance of the truth with ſo much evidence, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and certainty, as he did: he did as plainly ſee, that Chriſt had the command of diſeaſes, as that he himſelf had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Souldiers and ſervants. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the ſtronger faith is, the more plain and piercing inſight it hath into its object; and the great power of his faith appeared in believing this truth at ſuch a time, when the infinite power and Eternal Godhead of Chriſt was ſo little known and believed in the world. And laſtly, by the ſtrong plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his heart, grounded upon this truth, whereby he draws virtue and power from Chriſt to heal his dying ſervant: So that you ſee great reaſon why our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the greatneſs of the Centurions faith.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:38419:21"/>3. Our Saviour from hence takes occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to teach the Doctrine of the Converſion of the Jews, and Rejection of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. and Chriſt makes this ſeaſonable digreſſion into this Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at this time a poor Gentile excels ever a Jew of his age in believing the power of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Chriſt commands the ſick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants cure; he ſpeaks ſuch a word as the Centurion did pray that he would, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he could ſpeak, ver. 13. <hi>And Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid unto the Centurion, Go thy way, and as thou haſt believed, ſo be it done unto thee: and his ſervant was healed in the ſelf-ſame hour.</hi> And thus Chriſt is honoured for his Miracle, the Centurion is honoured for his Faith, and the poor dying ſervant hath the comfort of both.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now paſs by all other Obſervations that may be made out of this Text, and only inſiſt upon this one Doctrine, which I have choſen to be the ſubject of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:38419:21"/>Doct. <hi>THat all ſickneſſes and diſeaſes are at the will, and under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and government of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that he bids them go and come, and do what he will to the children of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine is grounded upon the Centurions pleading with Chriſt, that all diſeaſes were under his command and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as the Centurions ſouldiers were under him; and alſo upon this, that Chriſt teſtifies the truth of this, in commending the Centurion for the greatneſs of his faith in believing this truth, and improving it as he did.</p>
               <p>To prevent the miſunderſtanding of this Doctrine, I ſhall premiſe theſe three Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That I do not hereby deny the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and influence that inferiour cauſes may have in bringing diſeaſes upon us; for I know that many ſickneſſes come from God through the hands of Angels and Devils; and that other men, and alſo our ſelves, and that unwholeſome dyet, the ſeaſons of the years, and divers other things, may be the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38419:22"/>
inſtruments and means of diſeaſes unto us; but yet God is the firſt and chiefeſt cauſe of all diſeaſes; for it is not in the power of any creature to ſuſpend or with-hold that Divine Power and influence which cauſeth our health; but this is continued, or deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us, according to the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God: and no creature can cauſe our trouble without God; for without him a creature can neither be, nor work, but falls to nothing, and ſo cannot do good or evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I do not exclude the Art of Phyſitians, nor deny the virtue that is in any medicines for the healing of diſeaſes; knowing that the ſame God who had ordained food for our health, hath alſo ordained phyſick for us in our ſickneſs: but ſtill the firſt and chief of all is Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I do not exclude the power of God the Father, or of God the holy Ghoſt: but becauſe I finde that by diſeaſes God doth execute great judgements in the world, and that he is pleaſed to make great uſe of theſe in his government, both of his Church, and of his enemies; and that <hi>the Father hath committed all judgement to the Son,</hi> Joh. 5.22. and becauſe this command and government is aſcribed to Chriſt in the Text, therefore I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38419:22"/>
ſhall frequently mention the name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Jeſus Chriſt, God Redeemer, in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Now in the handling of the Doctrine, I ſhall follow this familiar method.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I ſhall explain the terms.</item>
                  <item>2. I ſhall ſhew for what ends Jeſus Chriſt doth thus cauſe and command diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Laſtly, I ſhall make Uſe and Application.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: In the explication, I ſhall tell you what I mean by ſickneſſes; and then explain the exerciſe of Chriſts govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and command of diſeaſes, in thoſe acts of it which are mentioned in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> his commanding diſeaſes <hi>to go and come, and do this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By ſickneſſes I mean all thoſe evils which are ſent by Chriſt to diſeaſe the bodies of living men and women: The author of diſeaſes is Jeſus Chriſt; the formal nature of them is their diſeaſing the bodies of men, depriving them of health, ſtrength, eaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and afflicting them with pain and grief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſubjects of theſe ſickneſſes are the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of living men and women: hereby they are diſtinguiſhed from the wounds and troubles of the ſoul ſo far as they are onely ſpiritual; but thoſe bodily diſeaſes which are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38419:23"/>
the effects of the wounds and waſtings of the ſoul, are alſo comprehended herein; they are hereby diſtinguiſhed alſo from that corruption which corrupts the body after death; and herein are implyed all manner of bodily diſeaſes, as wounds, hurts, ſores, breaking of bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak of theſe under this formal conſideration, as Jeſus Chriſt is the cauſe, and ruler, and healer of them, and ſo they come within the ſubject of Divinity, and not of Medicine or Chyrurgery.</p>
               <p>I now come to explain the exerciſe of Chriſts government of diſeaſes in thoſe three particulars mentioned in the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt bids diſeaſes <hi>go, and they go.</hi> Take the meaning of this,
<list>
                     <item>1. In general,</item>
                     <item>2. In ſome particulars.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in general: theſe words, <hi>Go, and they go,</hi> are words whereby God works what he ſpeaks; he immediately creates what he commands, like thoſe words at the creation: <hi>Let there be light, and there was light:</hi> thus <hi>he ſpake, and it was done,</hi> Pſal. 33.9. and ſo the meaning is, that it is the will and power of God, which cauſeth all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes to come upon us. Hence <hi>David</hi> calls the peoples falling into the Peſtilence, a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>into the hand of God,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.14. <hi>Let
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38419:23"/>
us fall into the hand of the Lord:</hi> and in his own viſitation he cryes out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.2. <hi>Thy hand preſſeth me ſore.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.10. <hi>I am conſumed by the blow of thy hand.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, God hath a heavy hand, he gives <hi>a great blow</hi>; what is the greateſt man in the world, when God can ſtrike him to hell at a blow? So ſickneſſes are called Gods ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. <hi>The arrows of the Almighty are within me.</hi> Pſal. 38.2. <hi>Thy arrows ſtick faſt in me.</hi> God hath his Quiver full of theſe Arrows, full of the Peſtilence, of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and Dropſies, and Conſumptions, and all manner of Diſeaſes; and he ſhoots theſe Arrows into our Families, Friends and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and none but himſelf can pull them out: as the Keeper ſhoots his barbed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row into the Deer, and he runs, and leaps, and lyes down, but the Arrow ſticks ſtill: ſo God ſhoots, ſuppoſe a Conſumption into the lungs of a man, or the Gout into the limbs of a man; and the poor man walks, and eats, and ſleeps, but the Arrow ſticks ſtill: Friends pull, and Phyſicians pull; but he may ſay with <hi>David, Thy arrows ſtick faſt in me.</hi> Thus, beloved, all diſeaſes are ſubject to the will of God, ſo as to go upon any man at his appointment. Sinner, if thou wilt not do the Will of God thy ſelf, God
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38419:24"/>
hath the Stone, Gout, Strangury, and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Diſeaſes more, to do his will upon thee: for as it's obſervable that there is a paſſive obediential power in every creature, to yeild to the will and power of God to be what he will, as a ſtone to be turned into a childe of <hi>Abraham:</hi> So there is an active obediential power in every creature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is ready to be an inſtrument of Gods power to do what he will: if he ſay to the earth, Open thy mouth, and ſwallow up ſuch a company; it preſently opens, and becomes a great grave to bury them all alive, as in that dreadful judgement mentioned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. So if God ſay to the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, Smite ſuch a perſon, he is preſently ſhattered in pieces; and in the ſame caſes the heavens, ſeas, winds, fire, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures obey him: ſo that if God ſet on a flie, a ſpider, an hair of the head againſt a man, all the care and power in the world cannot ſave him. So, my Brethren, if God command the Peſtilence, Fever, ſmall-Pox, to go into ſuch a City, or ſuch a Family, or upon ſuch a perſon, they preſently faſten upon them, though all the world be againſt it.</p>
               <p>More particularly in Gods bidding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes go, and they go, there is implyed theſe five things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:38419:24"/>Firſt, He commands <hi>whatſoever</hi> diſeaſes he will to go, and they go; the Centurion hath his hundred of Souldiers and he ſends whom he will, and he goes: ſo our Lord of hoſts hath as many ſickneſſes as he himſelf will make at his command, and whichſoever he appoints to go, it preſently goes: Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, many cry out of their diſeaſes, as the Church of her ſorrows, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Is there any ſorrow like my ſorrow!</hi> is there any ſickneſs like my ſickneſs! we are too apt to complain with the Iſraelites, that <hi>the way of the Lord is not equal,</hi> Ezek. 18.25. We are forward to judge the beſt of our ſelves, and the worſt of our afflictions: but we muſt know, that God doth in great juſtice and wiſdom chooſe and ſingle out what diſeaſes he will viſit us with; he <hi>corrects with judgement,</hi> Jer. 10.24. and therefore God checks the impatience of <hi>Job</hi> thus, <hi>Job</hi> 40.8. <hi>Will thou diſanul my judgement?</hi> wilt thou make nothing of my judgement, which in wiſdom and counſel I exerciſe in all my viſitations? So that whatever diſeaſe comes upon us, our hearts and wills ſhould agree with the Will of God therein: for the difference betwixt thy affliction and others, is made by the Wiſdom and Will of Chriſt; he hath choſen and appointed this,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38419:25"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

as the fitteſt diſeaſe for thee; and it is a ſigne thou wilt be diſcontent with another affliction, if thou quarrel with this: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour to be ſo filled with the Will of Chriſt in thy viſitation, as to conclude that this is the beſt ſickneſs for thee, and the fitteſt diſeaſe for thee; and this is the good ſervant, which Chriſt in wiſdom hath ſent to do him ſervice upon thee, and to bring him glory from thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>whomſoever</hi> Chriſt bids diſeaſes <hi>go, they go</hi>; as when the Centurion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his ſervant <hi>to go,</hi> it is implied that he appoints him whither <hi>to go.</hi> So (my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) as God doth pick and chooſe which arrows he will ſhoot, ſo he doth not, like the man in the <hi>Syrian</hi> Camp, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.34. draw his bow <hi>at a venture,</hi> but in great wiſdom marks, and ſingles out the perſons in whom he will ſtrike theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.7. <hi>A thouſand ſhall fall at thy ſide, and ten thouſands at thy right hand: but it ſhall not come nigh unto thee</hi>; whereby it appears that God directs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the Peſtilence to whom it ſhall go, and the ſame power he hath over all other diſeaſes; which are the inſtruments of his power to do his Will: and this is clear; for every inſtrument is over-ruled, and limited

by the will and power of him who works with it; ſo that although there be an equal aptneſs in the inſtrument to do one thing as well as another, yet it is determined in its work, according to the pleaſure of him that guides it: as if a man go with an ax into the wood to fell his trees, there is an equal aptneſs in the ax to cut down one tree as well as another; but it is at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and in the power of him that works with it, to determine which tree ſhall ſtand, and which ſhall fall. So (my Brethren ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are the inſtruments of Gods power to do his will, and are equally apt to diſeaſe one as well as another; but they being all in his hands, and over-ruled and guided by him, they onely go and afflict thoſe to whom he ſends and appoints them: God ſends the Peſtilence into a City; now the hand of God carries it into what ſtreet, or family, or perſon he will: It is obſervable, that God makes great uſe of diſeaſes to do his Will, and to ſerve his deſigne in the ruine of his enemies, and ſalvation of his people; and therefore they muſt needs be ordered by God, where they may work moſt for his glory; as for example, God ſees how <hi>men of the earth</hi> (as great worldlings are called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi>) fill a Nation or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

upon a beautiful perſon; and ſees him, as it were, turning his own Phanſie into a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, wherein he is always looking, and admiring, and pleaſing himſelf with his beauty: Well (ſaith God) to a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, Go, and wither yonder pretty flower; and it goes,<note place="margin">Pſa. 39.11.</note>

So ſometimes a Miniſter hath but one or two malicious enemies in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; and God commands a diſeaſe to fetch away them: and what welcome ſuch have in eternity, they are like to know beſt, that have a minde to try it.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a Miniſter hath a gracious man or woman in a Pariſh, which are to him as that gracious couple, <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> were to <hi>Paul,</hi> his <hi>helpers in the Lord,</hi> Rom. 16.3. and when many a maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Atheiſt lives, it is the good will of God that they dye.</p>

there is but one Life in a Living, and a diſeaſe comes by the appointment of Chriſt, and ſpares all the reſt of the Family, and takes away that; but one good <hi>Abijah</hi> in a houſe, and God calls away him: Thus all diſeaſes go to whomſoever they are ſent and appointed by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whenſoever</hi> Chriſt commands a diſeaſe <hi>to go, it goes:</hi> This is alſo plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the Centurions ſpeech; for if he have authority to bid his ſouldiers go, it muſt be at his own pleaſure, when he will bid them go: now it is clear that Jeſus Chriſt hath this authority over all diſeaſes; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a free agent, and therefore works when he will upon his creatures; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every thing whoſe acting depends on the power and pleaſure of another, works onely then when it is his pleaſure to work with it: as an arrow onely flies then when the archer will ſhoot it; ſo diſeaſes, which as you have heard are Gods arrows, can onely hit us, and hurt us, when it is Gods will to ſhoot them into our bodies. Beloved, God is the Lord of our times: the belief of which comforted <hi>David,</hi> when his enemies were conſpiring his death, Pſal. 31.13, 14, 15. <hi>I truſted in the Lord, I ſaid, Thou art my God, my times are in thy

Sometimes God ſmites a childe in the womb, and the poor mother carries <hi>a dead corpſe</hi> inſtead of a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving childe:</hi> And thus the body and ſoul are no ſooner united, but preſently parted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and ſo multitudes flie from the womb into heaven and hell.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>die in their full ſtrength,</hi> Job 21.23. We ſee many when they were moſt like to live, they preſently dye; and like the ſtrings

of an inſtrument, break when they are beſt in tune.</p>
               <p>Sometimes when men ſtand upon the <hi>foot of pride,</hi> Pſal. 36.11. <hi>they are ſuddenly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their pride,</hi> Pſal. 59.11. and ſo fall ſuddenly from the top of pride to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of hell.

               <p>Sometimes a Father is too fond of a childe, and the very might and ſtrength of his heart, which might be better exerciſed in the love and ſervice of God and Jeſus Chriſt, is vainly waſted and ſpent in the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate love and delight which he takes in his childe: then God bids a diſeaſe go, and it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently leaves a fatherleſs childe, or a childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs father.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, when godly men are ripe for glory, ſo that with <hi>Paul</hi> they have <hi>finiſhed their courſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7. then God doth fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their time, and ſends a ſickneſs as a meſſenger to fetch them home, as a <hi>ſhock of corn in its ſeaſon,</hi> Job 5.26.

of other ſeaſons, wherein God chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to viſit his people; which conſiderate Chriſtians may obſerve, and dilate, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie upon in their own thoughts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>How often ſoever</hi> Chriſt commands diſeaſes <hi>to go, they go:</hi> this we may alſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Centurions ſpeech: for by vertue of the ſame authority by which he bids his ſouldiers go once, he bids them go as oft as he ſees reaſon to command them. So by the ſame power that Jeſus Chriſt cauſeth diſeaſes at any time, he can cauſe them as often as he will: for his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being unchangeable, is not ſpent in any work; but it is the ſame after as before, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever:</hi> and his power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinite, there is never any thing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but he can do what he will.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38419:30"/>
with one breach after another. Beloved, when God begins to trouble us, we are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually like Mariners on the ſeas, one wave of affliction comes rolling after another: Perhaps God firſt ſmites us in a beaſt, then in a childe, then in our ſelves. <hi>David</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly deſcribes this, Pſal. 42.7. <hi>Deep calleth unto deep, at the noiſe of thy water-ſpouts: all thy waves and billows are gone over me:</hi> As at the noiſe of thunder or rain from the clouds, which are Gods <hi>water-ſpouts,</hi> the Brooks, as it were, call on the Clouds, Come and fill us; and the Rivers call unto the Brooks, Come ye and raiſe us: Or, as in a terrible ſtorm at Sea, one wave calls to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Come and roll after me; and that to another, Come and follow me: ſo one deep affliction calls to another to follow it; the Ague cries to the Fever, Follow me; and the Fever to the Conſumption, Follow me; and the Conſumption to Death, Follow me. And thus <hi>all Gods waves and billows go over us</hi>; ſo that a man may ſay with <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88.7. <hi>Thou haſt afflicted me with all thy waves.</hi> And thus the day of our life is like a ſtormy day, wherein are ſome ſhining gleams, and then ſtorms follow one another all the day; and therefore as ſouldiers in a garriſon, when they have gallantly beaten back one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38419:30"/>
ſtorm of the enemy, do not preſently throw down their arms, and diſmantle the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; but they make up their breaches, and keep up their Guards and Centinels, to be ready for a more deſperate aſſault: So when one affliction is paſt, when one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is healed, let us be prepared for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till we have accompliſhed our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. I refer you for more of this, to the Application.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>How long ſoever</hi> God appoints a diſeaſe to ſtay, it will continue upon us: this is alſo implied in the Centurions ſpeech. For by the ſame Authority that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a Souldier to go to a place, he can appoint him to ſtay till he give order for his return: So Jeſus Chriſt can as long as he will, continue the exerciſe of the ſame power which firſt cauſed the diſeaſe, upon the exerciſe of which muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the continuance of the diſeaſe: and therefore we often ſee, that ſome man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in a ſickly and dying condition for many years together, ſo that their <hi>lives hang in doubt,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.66. they live, as it were, between the two Worlds, being neither <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and ready to dye from my youth up:</hi> Thus <hi>Job</hi> tells us, <hi>cap.</hi> 7.3. <hi>I am made to poſſeſs months of vanity, and weariſome nights are appointed to me</hi>; whilſt ſome are in their ſweet and refreſhing ſleep, they little dream what weariſome nights others ſpend on their beds of languſhing, crying out with <hi>Job</hi> in the next verſe, <hi>When I lye down, I ſay, When ſhall I ariſe, and the night be gone? and I am full of toſſing to and fro, unto the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day:</hi> Many may cry out in their long and tedious ſickneſs with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38.12. <hi>I am cut off with pining ſickneſs, from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me:</hi> This is the ſad caſe or many, they eat, and drink, and ſleep, and walk abroad; but they carry about them perhaps a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick, or Flux, or Conſumption, whereby God is <hi>from day even to night making an end of them:</hi> Oh look about thee man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, What haſt thou to take too, when the hand of God hath made an end of thee! when thou findeſt thy heart bleſſing thy ſelf in thy wealth, friends, and other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, go alone a while, and tell thy ſoul, This is but a poor portion: when (as to my enjoyment of it) I am ſpitting it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and sweating it away, and it goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the very filth and excrements of my
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38419:31"/>
body every day. Beloved, it hath coſt me ſome ſerious thoughts, to ſee an irreſiſtible diſeaſe feeding upon a neer and dear friend: Friends provide the wholeſomeſt Dyet, Phyſitians preſcribe the fitteſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; many Cloſets, and Families, and Congregations are full of fervent prayers for their health; but ſtill God bids the diſeaſe ſtay, and waſte, and eat up the life of the friend: and as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>He is in one minde, and who can turn him?</hi> Job 23.13. and he taketh away, and who can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him? <hi>Job</hi> 9.12.</p>
               <p>So much for the explication of the firſt particular: God commands diſeaſes <hi>to go, and they go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He commands diſeaſes to <hi>come, and they come:</hi> As the Centurion bids his ſouldier <hi>come, and he comes:</hi> ſo Chriſt can call away a diſeaſe from a ſick perſon when he will: and this is clear, for God can at his pleaſure ſuſpend the exerciſe of his power, which was the cauſe of our ſickneſs, and ſo the diſeaſe muſt needs ceaſe: and all the creature-cauſes of diſeaſes muſt ceaſe to be, when God denies the work of his power, which cauſed their being: and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work to diſeaſe and trouble us, if God will not work with them: and beſides, he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38419:32"/>
can at his pleaſure exerciſe that power which cauſeth our health, and can work with Angels, Phyſitians, Medicines, Food, or any other things, which he ſhall pleaſe to uſe as the inſtruments and means of health to us: and therefore he tells his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Exod. 15.26. <hi>I am the God that healeth thee.</hi> And this is acknowledged by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and practiſed by Chriſt, Mat. 8.2, 3. <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean,</hi> (ſaith the Leper) <hi>Chriſt anſwers, I will, be thou clean.</hi> Beloved, God hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances from ſickneſs, as well as from all other afflictions, at command, Pſal. 44.4. <hi>Thou art my King, O Lord, command delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances for</hi> Jacob: So (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) when the Water-ſpouts of affliction came pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon him: <hi>The Lord will command his loving kindneſs in the day-time:</hi> This power of God appears by that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 68.20. <hi>To God the Lord belong the iſſues from death:</hi> all the iſſues and means to eſcape death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God: when a man falls into a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſickneſs, he falls into the hands of death, he ſticks as it were in the very jaws of death; as it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah, Iſa.</hi> 38.1. He was ſick unto death. Now in this caſe there is no viſible iſſue, or eſcape out of the ſnares of death: the man himſelf
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38419:32"/>
ſtrives, friends ſtrive, Phyſitians ſtrive, but there appears <hi>no diſcharge in that war,</hi> Eccl. 8.8. But now God comes in the greatneſs of his Power, and he makes an iſſue from death; and <hi>by theſe things men live,</hi> Iſa. 38.16. For God ſaith to the Fever, to the Small Pocks, to the Conſumption, <hi>&amp;c. Come away</hi>; let the Miniſter live with his People; let the Father live with his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; let the Children live with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; let the Wife live with her Husband: and thus he commands them away, and they are preſently gone; as it is ſaid of the waters, Pſal. 104.7. <hi>At his rebuke they fled, and at his voice they haſted away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for the ſecond particular.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whatſoever Chriſt commands diſeaſes to do, they do it; they are herein like the Centurions ſervant, when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter bids <hi>do this, and he doth it:</hi> the meaning of this is, that Jeſus Chriſt by all ſickneſſes fulfils his own will; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the power of Chriſt that works in all diſeaſes: Now Chriſt works by his power according to his will, Eph. 1.11. <hi>He worketh all things according to the counſel of his will.</hi> Beloved, where-ever a diſeaſe comes, it hath always ſome work to do. 1. Sometimes Chriſt commands it to fill a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38419:33"/>
man with grievous pain and torment; ſo the Centurions ſervant here was grievouſly tormented: and we read, Job 33.19. <hi>He is chaſtened with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong pain.</hi> This did ſo torture <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>he roared for the very diſquietneſs of his heart,</hi> Pſal. 38.8. And <hi>Jobs</hi> pain was ſo great, that he ſaith, Job 16.12. <hi>God hath taken me by my neck, and ſhaken me to pieces.</hi> And Sirs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though now we ſit, and walk, and eat, and ſleep at our eaſe, yet our bodies may be breeding thoſe diſeaſes, which may ſhortly cauſe torturing pain and anguiſh to come upon us, as Travel upon a Woman with child.</p>
               <p>Sometimes God bids a diſeaſe to waſte and wither a man in the prime and flower of his age, and he doth it: Many that are now <hi>incloſed in their own fat,</hi> Pſal. 17.10. and <hi>cover their faces with fatneſs, and make collops of fat on their flanks,</hi> Job 15.27. yet when ſickneſs comes, they are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altered; then <hi>their fleſh is conſumed that it cannot be ſeen, and their bones that were not ſeen, ſtick out,</hi> Job 33.21. Then ſuch a man may cry out with <hi>David, I may tell all my bones.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſa. 22.17.</note> Oh what a ſad caſe is this man in! he looks on his ſilver and gold,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38419:33"/>
and they ſhine upon him; and upon his precious jewels, and they ſparkle and twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle upon him; and upon his pleaſant pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and green meadows, and fruitful fields, and they ſmile upon him: but he looks upon himſelf, and his own body, and there he ſees a ghaſtly ſpectacle. Oh now if the face of a reconciled God in Chriſt do not ſhine, what a fearful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth the poor man lie in?</p>
               <p>Again, ſometimes God commands a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe to take away a mans appetite and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack to his meat, and it doth it, ſo that <hi>his life abhors bread, and his ſoul dainty meat,</hi> Job 33.20. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107.18. and this is the ſad caſe of many a man, who hath with <hi>Dives fared ſumptuouſly every day, Luke</hi> 16.19. But now poor wretch, he hath money enough to buy meat; but all the world cannot purchaſe him a ſtomack.</p>
               <p>Sometimes men are juſt finiſhing their deſign of hurting Gods people, and Chriſt commands a diſeaſe to ſtop them. Thus <hi>Jeroboams</hi> hand was ſtretched out againſt the Prophet, and God withered it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the good Prophet was delivered. See 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, ſometimes God bids a diſeaſe tumble ſuch a ſoul into hell, and it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38419:34"/>
doth it; and the poor friends are <hi>winding up the Chriſtleſs body,</hi> when the Devils are <hi>worrying the damned ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes he commands a ſickneſs to looſe a Saint out of the earth into heaven, and it doth it; and here lies the <hi>ghaſtly jewel, the redeemed body,</hi> but thither <hi>flies the bleſſed and glorified ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I now come to ſhew you divers of the main Ends of Chriſts exerciſing this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſeaſes, in commanding them <hi>to go and come, and do what he will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall mention theſe ſeventeen Ends.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To convince us of the great evil of ſin, which is the meritorious cauſe of diſeaſes. I conceive that the underſtanding of a man cannot comprehend the evil of ſin; that is, he cannot know it <hi>quantum eſt cognoſcibile,</hi> ſo far as it may be known, or <hi>ſo far as nothing of the evil of it is unknown:</hi> I think none can know it ſo but God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man cannot know all the holineſs and goodneſs of God, which ſin is againſt, nor all the wrath of God, which ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves: yet a man may by the power and light of Gods Spirit be ſo far convinced of the evil of ſin, as to judge it the greateſt evil in the world, and therefore to loath it, and abhor it moſt, and to deſire more to be

ſaved from it, then from any evil: And this is one great uſe of all afflictions, thus to convince us of the evil of ſin, Jer. 2.19. <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee; know therefore, and ſee, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God.</hi> And this God intends by viſiting us with ſickneſſes, Job 33.27. <hi>He looketh upon men</hi> (meaning in their ſickneſs; for this was the caſe mentioned in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes) <hi>and if any ſay, I have ſinned, and it profited me not, &amp;c.</hi> Beloved, God ſtands looking and hearkening at your ſick beds, to ſee and hear, if upon deep convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and by ſincere confeſſion, any of you ſay, <hi>I have ſinned:</hi> this God looks for in his Viſitations upon us: We find this to be the effect of <hi>Davids</hi> ſickneſs, Pſal. 38.3, 4. <hi>There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh, becauſe of thy anger; neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin: For mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are gone over my head as an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; they are too heavy for me.</hi> Beloved, people would not be ſo fond of their ſins, if they ſaw the diſeaſes and dangers which they bring upon them, as a man would not be greedy of the daintieſt meat, if he knew it were mixt with Rats-bane; nor be proud of the fineſt cloaths, if he knew they were
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38419:35"/>
infected with the Peſtilence: So if people ſaw the Plague, Pocks, Dropſie, Fever, and the Conſumption, in their pride, and oaths, and lyes, and drunkenneſs, and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it would make them afraid of ſin, as well as of ſickneſs: and therefore look not upon ſin as it appears in your honours, profits and pleaſures, as it appears at an Ale-houſe, May-pole, or Maurice-dance, or Cock-pit, or Bear-bait, or Stage-play; for there thou canſt not ſee ſin for its pleaſures; but look upon thy ſelf on a bed of languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and there ſee thy ſins ſtanding in order before thee; and then tell me what fruit thou haſt in theſe things: Look upon thy ſelf as hanging over the lake of brimſtone, and then call thy drunken Companions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee, and bid them pour out their flagons, and quaff off their cups, and ſee whether all theſe can make thee merry: when the flames of hell begin to catch and kindle in thy guilty ſoul, call in thy lyes, and injuſtice, to bring thee thy treaſures of wickedneſs, and lay them under thy pillow, and ſee whether they can bring thee eaſe, when Death, and Hell, and the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtand preſent before thee.</p>
               <p>And (my Brethren) it is obſerveable, that when we ſin in our ſickneſs, we ſhould ſee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38419:35"/>
far more evil in it then as it is the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of that diſeaſe: as we ſhould look further into a ſickneſs, then as it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth preſent aches and pains in the body, we ſhould ſee that Death and Eternity which comes after; ſo we ſhould ſee more evil and danger in ſin, then as it brings ſuch a diſeaſe; for the evil of it is not ſpent in that: therefore we ſhould look upon it as provoking God to puniſh us with diſeaſes, and with death, and hell, which diſeaſes are looſing us into.</p>
               <p>The ſecond End, to convince us of the <hi>vanity</hi> of the creature: now we are truly convinced of the <hi>vanity</hi> of the creature, when <hi>we judge it to be empty of that good which muſt free a ſinful man from miſery, and fill him with true happineſs:</hi> It muſt needs be a vanity, when a man may be miſerable with it, and happy without it. Now Chriſt appoints diſeaſes as means to convince us of this vanity of the creature: for, as one ſaith wittily, the world is the Devils Cheſs-board, wherein a man can neither move forward nor backward, but the Devil attaches him with ſome creature or other: and indeed we are ſo full of the <hi>ſpirit of the world,</hi> as it's called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. which doth ſo fill our hearts with the world, that God, and Chriſt,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38419:36"/>
and Heaven, and Salvation, are nothing to us; and therefore this ſin is called, <hi>a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God that is above, Job</hi> 31.24, 25, 28. and <hi>Agur</hi> tells us, that when a man is full of the world, he is apt to <hi>deny God, and to ſay, Who is the Lord? Prov.</hi> 30.9. Oh what poor ſcornful thoughts a covetous, proud, ſecure worldling hath of God, and Chriſt, and Saints, and Ordinances, and Salvation! Now this is one great uſe of ſickneſſes, to convince a man of the vanity of the world: and this is a moſt convincing argument; for I dare challenge all the worldlings which the world it ſelf can own, to name me that earthly creature, and tell me what I ſhall call it, which can heal the wounds of a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſcience, or can take out the ſting of death; or of which a man can truly ſay, Here is a treaſure which a lump of phlegm cannot take from me: If thou canſt not ſay this of the creature, I grant thou mayſt uſe it for thy good; but be ruled by a friend, <hi>never chooſe it for thy portion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But more particularly, we may hereby be convinced of the vanity of theſe five things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of the vanity of our ſelves: Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs moved <hi>David</hi> to beg wiſdom of God, to know <hi>how frail he was, Pſal.</hi> 39.4. and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38419:36"/>
this made <hi>Job</hi> compare himſelf to a <hi>leaf,</hi> and to the <hi>dry ſtubble,</hi> and to a <hi>flower</hi> and <hi>ſhadow, Job</hi> 13.25. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.2. and we read, that this is the uſe of ſickneſs, <hi>to hide pride from man, Job</hi> 33.17. that is, to take it quite away, to be ſeen no more: and if we did look on every thing which we are uſually proud of, as it will prove on a ſick bed, or death-bed, it would be an effectual means to abaſe us, and to hide pride from us. Beloved, it is a moſt precious thing for a man to be fill'd with the knowledge and ſenſe of his own emptineſs and vanity: The Kingdom of heaven is unchangeably entail'd upon all ſuch, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Hereby a man is ſweetly qualified for every duty: Faith never acts with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and ſtrength, then when it acts from the belief of a mans own emptineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when <hi>ſelf is moſt denied, Chriſt is moſt acknowledged and believed</hi>; then doth a man moſt heartily and ſtrongly receive and reſt upon Chriſt to juſtifie and to ſave him, when he ſees what a guilty, condemned, loſt wretch he is in himſelf; and when he ſees what a weak helpleſs creature he is, then doth he moſt truſt to the infinite power of Jeſus Chriſt: and this alſo doth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:38419:37"/>
endear his heart in love to God, when he ſees that God is ſo good, and ſo full of grace, and love, and mercy, as to chuſe, and call, and pardon, and ſave ſuch a vile and loathſome creature as he; then repentance is moſt inward and ſpiritual, when a man with <hi>Job, abhors himſelf, and repents in duſt and aſhes, Job</hi> 42.6. and this fills the heart with prayer; for prayer begs of God what a man wants in himſelf: therefore when a man ſees himſelf poor, and empty of all good, and knows that he cannot be ſupplied from himſelf, then doth he pray to be <hi>fill'd with the fulneſs of God.</hi> Now, I ſay, ſickneſs is a ſpecial means to convince a man of his emptineſs and vanity; for hereby a man is left bare and empty of all thoſe creature-comforts which ſeemed to fill him before, and now he ſees that nothing will fill him but grace and glory; and that there is nothing in him to make up this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To convince us of the <hi>vanity</hi> of great men. Oh what is a Prince, or a Noble-man, or Gentleman, when the Pox, or the Fever, or the Conſumption will inſult over him, and ſcorn him, and make nothing of him; and there is nothing in him to reſiſt or remove theſe, becauſe the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible

The places of the world are called <hi>ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery places, Pſal.</hi> 73.18. and they that know what God is, and what ſin, and what the creature is, know by the cauſes the <hi>ſlipperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of them, and ſee you ſliding down as faſt as you are riſing up. And tell me,<note place="margin">Pſalm 10.18.</note> you great men of the earth, where is the place which you can name and ſay, Here I can ſtand, and cannot <hi>ſlip</hi> into hell! I tell you, there are ſtanders by can ſee your magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent buildings ſcituated on the borders of hell, your beds made at the very mouth of hell, your tables ſpread over the pit of hell, your horſes prancing with you, and Coaches ratling with you at the very edge and brink of hell: Ah <hi>great vanities!</hi> where-ever you are, the mouth of hell is gaping upon you, and there are thouſands of diſeaſes and deaths to looſe you in: We may hence then conclude with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 62.9. <hi>That men of high degree are a lye and vanity</hi>; and if we weigh <hi>nothing</hi> in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with them, <hi>they will prove lighter then nothing, and vanity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:38419:38"/>Thirdly, The <hi>vanity</hi> of ſtrong men: <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.29. <hi>The glory of young men is their ſtrength:</hi> and men are apt to be very proud of their ſtrength, that they can leap, and lift, and run, and wreſtle, and fight, and excel others in bodily exerciſes: But what is all this ſtrength, when God comes upon thee by ſickneſs, and <hi>with his ſtrong hand oppoſeth himſelf againſt thee? Job</hi> 30 21. Thy bones are now full of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſtrength; but when a diſeaſe comes, <hi>thy ſtrength will be dried up like a Potſheard,</hi> or pitcher baked and burnt in the fire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.15. therefore when thy heart is lifted up in the ſenſe of thy bodily ſtrength, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God?</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, of the <hi>vanity</hi> of wealth and riches: Oh how bare will ſickneſſes and death make a man! Sirs, a dead corpſe is but a poor thing: How poor doth a rich man go out of the world, when ſickneſs and death hath ſtript him of all his enjoyments! and then as <hi>he came naked out of his mothers womb, ſo naked muſt he return: Job</hi> 1.21. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. look on the world with your hearts filled with the thoughts of ſickneſs and death, and then you will ſee the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it; look on thy ſelf as ſtretcht on a bed of languiſhing, ſee thy ſelf lying in a Coffin, or in a Grave, or ſtanding before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt; and then ſee how all the riches of the world appear before thee: If a man look on his ſtately houſe and buildings, what a pleaſant dream is he in to ſee a ſweet ſcituation, wholeſome air, convenient rooms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but let him ſee <hi>death coming up into the windows</hi>;<note place="margin">Jer. 9.21.</note> and then, <hi>what pleaſure hath he in his houſe after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midſt?</hi>

               <p>So when men are proud of their Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and take pleaſure in reckoning up their Kindred, and telling of their Families; let them take in theſe with the reſt of their Relations, <hi>ſaying to corruption, Thou art our father, and to the worms, You are our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters,</hi> Job 17.14. and this will ſhew all to be but <hi>noble duſt,</hi> and <hi>rich earth,</hi> and <hi>great vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for the ſecond End of Chriſts vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting men with ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>End 3. To fill our hearts with the ſence of death: Sickneſſes are fit means for this purpoſe, for ſickneſs it ſelf is a kinde of death: for death is a privation of life, a ſeparation from that which is our life: And now we know we have, as it were, a life in food, friends and eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſickneſs parts and ſeparates us from theſe; it ſtops the paſſage betwixt theſe and a man, ſo that the pleaſure and comfort of theſe cannot come to the man for his diſeaſe; but the man ſtands, as it were, betweeen the <hi>two worlds,</hi> at the end of this world, and at the beginning of the other, and all creature
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38419:40"/>
enjoyments are ſhut up from him; and the great things of eternity ſtand open before him: So that what the Apoſtle ſpeaks of perſecution, is for the ſame reaſon true of ſickneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Death worketh in us:</hi> when ſickneſs comes, death works apace; it works away your health, it works away your eaſe, it works away your ſtomachs, it works away your ſtrength, and at laſt works you into your graves. Hence we finde that the godly in Scripture were full of the thoughts of death in the time of their ſickneſs. <hi>David</hi> prays on his ſick bed that his viſitation may be ſanctified; to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.4. <hi>Lord make me to know my end</hi> —and this improvement made <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of his ſickneſs, when the wounds of his ſoul cauſed waſtings and diſeaſes in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.3, 4, 5. <hi>For my ſoul is full of troubles, and my life draws nigh unto the grave</hi> — and this was good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his frame in his ſickneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.10, 11, 12. <hi>I ſaid in the cutting off my days, I ſhall go to the gates of the grave; I am deprived of the reſidue of my years: I ſaid, I ſhall not ſee the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living: I ſhall behold man no more with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth. Mine age is departed, and is removed from me, as a ſhepherds tent:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38419:40"/>
I have cut off like a weaver my life. He will cut me off with pining ſickneſs; from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</hi> So when <hi>Job</hi> was almoſt throtled with a diſeaſe; for, ſaith he, <hi>Job</hi> 30.8. <hi>It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat:</hi> He makes this gracious uſe of his Viſitation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the houſe appointed for all living.</hi> So that by all we ſee, that ſickneſs is a ſpecial means to fill our hearts with the thoughts of death.</p>
               <p>End 4. To fill the heart with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſenſe of God. Beloved, our hearts are apt to be ſenſeleſs of God as he appears in the ordinary courſe of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and mercy; therefore God often manifeſts himſelf in the croſſes and changes of our life, which makes us more apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the cauſe of ſuch alterations: as when corn grows in its ordinary courſe, firſt the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear, few obſerve the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God herein; but when God by froſt, hail or blaſting, deſtroys the fruits of the field, ſo that it neither yeilds bread to the eater, nor ſeed to the ſower, hereby his hand is more remarkably ſeen and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: ſo whilſt God continues men in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38419:41"/>
health, and eaſe, and ſtrength, few are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his goodneſs herein: but when he fills their bodies with aches, pains and diſeaſes, then his power and providence is more obſerved in ſuch viſitations. Hence ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> cap. 10.17. <hi>Thou reneweſt thy witneſſes againſt me:</hi> as Gods mercies are called his witneſſes, <hi>his doing good, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rain, and fruitful ſeaſons,</hi> Act. 14.17. ſo ſickneſſes, and other judgements, are fitly called Gods <hi>witneſſes,</hi> the uſe of which is to declare and teſtifie of God to us: Oh, ſaith the Peſtilence, He is a terrible God that ſent me; and ſaith the Fever, He is a mighty God that ſent me; and ſaith the Conſumption, He is a juſt God that ſent me: If you will not receive the teſtimony of Gods Miniſters, and of his Mercies, will you receive the teſtimony of your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! certainly every ſickneſs, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be awakened, will teſtifie the ſame things of God and Chriſt, which Miniſters preach to you. Conſider further, I pray you, that there is a more ſpecial aptneſs in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes to convince the heart of man, then in divers other things which yet will leave us inexcuſable: as it is the uſe of outward mercies to commend the power, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and care, and goodneſs of God to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38419:41"/>
ours heart; and a man may improve every mercy ſo, as out of it to fill his heart with God; but there are ſnares and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in theſe to ſteal the heart from God, and therefore men are apt to loſe God, and to forget him, when they are moſt full of theſe mercies: So in injuries form men, we ſhould ſee the hand of God. <hi>From men, which are thy hand, O Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 17.14. but we are uſually ſo fill'd with anger and revenge towards men, that we forget the hand of God.</p>
               <p>But now in a ſickneſs, the name of God and the hand of God is more clearly known and ſeen, ſo that there is no ſuch proviſion for luſt in a ſickneſs, as in the mercies: here is no profit, nor credit, nor pleaſure for luſt to feed upon; and here is no inſtrument to quarrel with: will a man be angry with a Fever, or be revenged on a Conſumption? No, we muſt own the Power and Will of God, who is the cauſe of the viſitation.</p>
               <p>End 5. Chriſt ſends diſeaſes to turn men from ſin and the world, unto himſelf. Hence God complains of the want of this, as a great diſappointment, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.10. <hi>I have ſent among you the Peſtilence</hi> (to cauſe you turn to me) <hi>yet have ye not returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38419:42"/>
to me, ſaith the Lord:</hi> and therefore it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that in a ſickneſs God doth blaſt that which makes the ſnare to hold our hearts from God: as we know, much of the life and ſtrength of pride, and covetouſneſs and other luſts is in the profits, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and preferments of the world; now what are all theſe to a ſick man? his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth, as it were, block up all proviſion from the fleſh; and now he may ſee that none but God and Jeſus Chriſt can anſwer the neceſſity of his ſoul: and therefore let me ask you, What is the beſt thing which you would propound to a friend on a ſick bed, who is juſt upon his flight into eternity? will you provide him a ſumptuous feaſt, or a rich ſuit of cloaths, or offer him ſome place of preferment? No, no, ſhew him a God and Chriſt to ſave his poor ſoul; ſhew him a happineſs which will make him bleſſed, when he is turned out of all which ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death can take from him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it appears that ſickneſs is appointed by God as a means for our converſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this and every affliction calls us to do that which the word calls us unto: <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 94.12.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, and teacheſt him out of thy law.</hi> This makes a man a bleſſed man, when in his chaſtenings
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38419:42"/>
he is full of the teaching of the Law. Hence we are commanded to <hi>hear the rod, and who hath appointed it,</hi> Micah 6.9. Beloved, the rod ſpeaks as well as ſtrikes; and we ſhould hear the rod, as well as feel the rod: now what doth the rod ſpeak? I anſwer, The rod ſpeaks the minde and will of God, who ſmites with it: the rod and the word ſpeak the ſame language; therefore we ſhould ſee our ſickneſs full of Scripture. Oh, ſaith the Dropſie, Turn to the God that ſent me; and ſaith the Ague, Make your peace with God that ſent me: And this is the voice of every diſeaſe which comes upon us: And therefore conſider, that God doth often ſo bleſs and ſanctifie a ſickneſs to us, that it is a means to turn the heart to God, and cauſeth us to bring forth the fruit of many other diſpenſations: as for example, God ſends to allure us by his mercies, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, with the bands of love</hi>; there are ſecret cords and bands in all our mercies, to draw and to bind our hearts to God; and when we finde our ſelves nouriſht with meat, and refreſht with ſleep, we ſhould finde a ſecret vertue in theſe mercies to joyn our hearts to God; but God uſeth this means with many one, but the ſoul yet abides in his ſins: then God

ſendeth another ſervant; he ſends a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter to call him to himſelf, and a faithful friend to perſwade him to come; but yet the poor ſinner will not come: Well, ſaith God, I will yet try another meſſenger; Go Fever, Go Ague, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now theſe are often ſo bleſſed, that all the former diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations work afreſh: Now he remembers his mercies, and Sermons, and counſels, and they all work ſo effectually, that the poor ſinner is ſavingly converted unto God.</p>

Beloved, Gods Miniſters are the ſtrength of King and Kingdom, the very Militia of the Land: <hi>The charets of Iſraels, and the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thereof,</hi> 2 Kin. 2.12. The Apoſtle ſhews how we ſhould eſteem godly Miniſters, 1 Cor.4.1. <hi>Let a man ſo account of us, as the Miniſters of Chriſt:</hi> If we eſteem Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters aright, we ſhould prize them as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, prize them for that which makes them differ, and wherein they are ſeparated from other men; as if you would truely prize the Lords day, and call it <hi>a delight and honourable,</hi> as the Scripture requires, you muſt eſteem it as ſanctified and ſeparated from other days, and thereby you ſhall ſee it a more holy and bleſſed day: ſo if you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38419:43"/>
would prize the Lords Supper, you muſt eſteem the bread and wine as ſeparated from other bread and wine, and as conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and ſanctified to ſuch a uſe: ſo if you would honour an Embaſſadour from a great King, you do not ſo much look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his perſonal worth, but he is honoured and received as he is ſent from the King, and ſtands in his ſtead. So, my Brethren, if we would prize a Miniſter aright, look upon him as ſeparated to the Goſpel, as cloathed with authority to preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments, as one through whoſe hands God hath in wiſdom choſen to tranſmit the treaſures of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to you, and as one who ſtands in the ſtead of Jeſus Chriſt, who is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge all the affronts that are offered unto him. Now, my Brethren, there are no ſorts of men ſo much abhorred by the world, as godly Miniſters; theſe whom our Saviour calls the <hi>ſalt of the earth,</hi> Matth. 5.13. as if the world of men would be but as a piece of ſtinking carrion, if it were not for godly Miniſters and godly people. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, they <hi>are unto God a ſweet ſavour in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.15. yet they are hated, as if they were the loathſomeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements in the world. This <hi>Paul</hi> elegantly

                  <hi>End</hi> 7. Chriſt by ſickneſſes doth further and promote the Salvation of his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (as the following particulars do more fully evince) and the reaſon of this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Jeſus Chriſt doth every thing to his people as their Saviour, and therefore there is a ſaving Power and Vertue works from Chriſt in and through all his diſpenſations towards them; as whether a father feed or whip his childe, he doth it with the heart of a father, for the good of his childe: ſo if Chriſt afflict his childe, he doth it with the heart of a Saviour, to ſave his childe; and therefore all Gods people may ſay of their ſickneſs, as <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. <hi>I know that this ſhall turn to my ſalvation.</hi> We have full proof of this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>When we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord,</hi> (meaning by thoſe ſickneſſes and weakneſſes mentioned in <hi>verſ.</hi> 30.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaking of Gods fatherly love in correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people, hath this pathetical paſſage, <hi>O ſervum illum beatum, cujus emendationi Dominus inſtat, cui dignatur iraſci! de pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiâ,</hi> cap. 11. <hi>O bleſſed is that ſervant, for whoſe correction or amendment the Lord is ſo earneſt, with whom he vouchſafes to be</hi> (ſo lovingly) <hi>angry.</hi> Beloved, it is obſervable, that God doth not diſtinguiſh his people from the wicked, by making them Lords and Ladies, or by filling them with the treaſures of the earth: theſe are not the effects of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing grace; for a wicked man may have his <hi>belly full</hi> of theſe things: <hi>Whoſe bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou filleſt with thy hid treaſures:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 17.14.</note> And therefore <hi>Job</hi> tells us of thoſe that <hi>provoke God,</hi> that <hi>into their hands God brings abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly</hi> of worldly things, <hi>Job</hi> 12.6. he brings a whole Empire of the world into the hands of a <hi>Nero,</hi> or a <hi>Turk.</hi> But God diſtinguiſheth his people from the world by making them <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>happy:</hi> and therefore though the common mercie of God, which brings riches, and honours, and health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not ſo much abound to the godly, yet the diſtinguiſhing <hi>grace of God, which brings ſalvation,</hi> Tit. 2.11. never fails;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:38419:45"/>
and therefore when they have many things which hinder their eſtates, and liberty, and health; yet nothing ſhall hinder their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but ſtill the infinite power of Chriſt is working and prevailing to bring them to heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>End</hi> 8. Chriſt by ſickneſs doth change his people more and more into his own likeneſs: So that as the fire melts and ſoftens the gold, and thereby fits it for the ſtamp; ſo theſe ſickneſſes ſoften the hearts of the godly, and thereby fit them to receive the ſtamp of Gods Image. Hence many a Saint comes more full of God from a ſick bed, then he did from a Sermon, or Sacrament, for many a day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To this purpoſe agrees the ſaying of learned and holy <hi>Rolloc</hi> on his ſick bed, <hi>I am not aſhamed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to profeſs, that I never attained to ſuch a great meaſure of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, as I have gained by this ſickneſs.</hi> The Apoſtle aſſures us, that this is Gods end in all our corrections, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>He chaſteneth us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſs.</hi> If we loſe by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections one way, as in our health, liberty, or eſtates; <hi>profit</hi> comes in another way, in holineſs, in graces, and in comforts. There is a fit proof of this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Though
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38419:46"/>
the outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</hi> In <hi>v.</hi> 12. (as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before) he tells us, that <hi>death work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them:</hi> Death was buſily <hi>working</hi> to take away their lives: Well, ſaith he, but <hi>though the outward man periſh,</hi> that is, though the body and bodily things periſh and decay, yet <hi>the inward man,</hi> that is, the new man, the ſpiritual man, <hi>is renewed day by day.</hi> To apply this to our particular caſe, we often ſee, that whilſt ſickneſs is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and waſting the body, the outward man, there comes a newneſs of life and ſpirit from Jeſus Chriſt, to quicken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the inward man: So that although the outward man be feeble, ſpeech weak, and hands weak, and limbs weak, yet look in the inward man, and you ſhall ſee every thing in its prime; faith ſtrong, and love ſtrong, and patience ſtrong, and comfort ſtrong: ſo that as the outward man is waſting and falling towards the earth, the inward man is riſing and ripening towards heaven.</p>

                  <hi>End</hi> 9. Chriſt viſits his people with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>to try</hi> whether they will cleave to him notwithſtanding he thus viſit them. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, you often hear and read of the tryals of Gods people; I ſhall therefore acquaint you what this tryal is, whereby you will
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:38419:46"/>
more clearly underſtand this end of Gods Viſitation. <hi>A tryal is that whereby God puts his people to give a proof and experiment of their graces.</hi> As for example, there was a queſtion between God and Satan, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the integrity of <hi>Job:</hi> God teſtifies of <hi>Job,</hi> c. 1.8. <hi>That he was a perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man, one that feared God, and eſchewed evil.</hi> Satan denies this, and undertakes to prove <hi>Job</hi> to be an Hypocrite, and a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler, verſ. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Doth Job fear God for nought?</hi> No marvel if he fear thee; thou payeſt him well for it; <hi>thou haſt made a hedge about him,</hi> that no body muſt hurt him: but he makes but a Trade of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; do but throw down the hedge about him, and he will quickly throw down his ſervice and obedience; <hi>he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> Now upon this, <hi>Job</hi> is put to the tryal: but though in a few hours he is changed from a man of great riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to a poor <hi>Job</hi>; yet ſtill he holds faſt his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, as God witneſſeth of him, <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. Afterwards ariſeth another queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Job</hi> will prove a hypocrite if God viſit him with ſickneſs; for, ſa;ith Satan, <hi>Job</hi> 2.5. <hi>Touch his bone, and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> Upon this, <hi>Job</hi> is put to another tryal, he is ſorely and ſadly diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38419:47"/>
from top to toe, <hi>v.</hi> 7. yet his heart proves ſound ſtill, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>In all this did not Job ſin with his lips.</hi> And if we obſerve him in the whole courſe of his tryal, though the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of a man appeared in him, yet he would never be baffled out of his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and at laſt he comes <hi>out of the furnace like gold,</hi> Job 23.13. And thus God often viſits his people, to try their graces. I ſhall leave this particular; only I ſhall direct you how to prove ſound in all the tryals which can befal you; as thus: Make that a ground of your Religion, which no tryal can ever take away: if thou wilt be Religious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it brings thee credit or profit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then if a tryal comes, and <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon</hi> claſh, and thou muſt be either a Martyr or an Apoſtate, thy Religion is then gone and loſt, becauſe the ground and reaſon of it is gone: but if thou truſt God, and love God, becauſe he commands thee, and becauſe he is a faithful and good God, here is a cauſe and ground and reaſon for thy Religion, which nothing can take away; and ſo thy holineſs and godlineſs is everlaſting, becauſe it is built and grounded upon an everlaſting foundation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>End</hi> 10. To try his people whether they will leave this world, and come to him in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38419:47"/>
the other world. Beloved, we ſhould live in this world ſo, as to be always ready at an hours warning to leave all, and to go into Eternity. Now when God ſends a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we ſhould look upon it as a Call into Eternity, and be ready to give a willing and obedient anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Job</hi> 14.1, <hi>Thou ſhalt call,</hi> that is (ſaith <hi>Lavater</hi>) call me out of this life, and I will come, <hi>I will anſwer thee.</hi> And thus in a Fever, or Conſumption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God ſtands as it were by the ſick bed, and calls, Come away Husband from thy Wife, come away Wife from thy Husband, come away Father from thy Children: now we ſhould be ready to leave all, and to come home to God; for this is one choice part of our obedience, to yield up our lives to God as his right and due, when he calls for them. Hence, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.6. <hi>I am now ready to be offered.</hi> Every believer ſhould look upon his life as a ſacrifice ſanctified and ſet apart for God, and to be always ready to be offered to him at his will and pleaſure. It is obſerveable of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 32.48, 49<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 50. God there appoints <hi>Moſes to go up to Mount Nebo, and die:</hi> and did not <hi>Moſes</hi> (think ye) go up with a heavy heart? No, he chearfully and obediently ſubmits, and thither he goes up, and there he dies,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:38419:48"/>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. So if God ſay to thee by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Go into a Fever and die, or go into a Dropſie and die, go upon thy ſick-bed and die, thou muſt yield, thou muſt go at the pleaſure of God. And certainly if Believers did but clearly ſee whither ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death would bring them, it would be a thouſand times harder duty to be content to live, then to be willing to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>End</hi> 11. To try his people, if they will reſigne their friends to God when he calls for them by ſickneſs: a friend is a choice treaſure, he is <hi>alter ego, another ſelf</hi>; but we muſt obediently give up our friends to the will of God: I ſhall tell you what this is, thus quietly to reſign our friends to God; It is that whereby we ſolemnly worſhip God, acknowledging and praiſing his Name, and ſubjecting our hearts to his will, as he is a God of this diſpenſation. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, God ſmites a Husband with a diſeaſe; now ſaith God by this Providence to the Wife, What if I make thee a Widdow, and thy Children Fatherleſs? Why! Lord (ſaith the Wife) thou art herein a wiſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and good God; and I will ſtill own, and truſt, and love, and rejoyce in thee. Thus the heart muſt worſhip and praiſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:38419:48"/>
God as he appears in this ſad Providence; and ſo the heart agrees with the Will of God, as it is ſignified by this diſpenſation. Now if there appear any riſing of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, we muſt quiet all ſuch tumults with the Will of God, as <hi>Eli</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth good in his ſight.</hi> We have an excellent pattern of this in <hi>Job, Cap.</hi> 1.20, 21. when amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſad Providences, he heard of the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death of his ſons, <hi>he fell down and worſhipt God</hi> (whom he ſaw in the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) ſaying, <hi>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> Thus he worſhippeth and praiſeth God, as it appeared, in taking away his Children. And thus when any friends are diſeaſed, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get thy heart into this frame; this will make the mercy more ſweet if they live, and the affliction leſs bitter if they die. I know your thoughts will now be full of the goodneſs of your friends; Oh ſuch a wiſe, faithful, loving Husband, ſuch a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, meek, loving Wife! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them at the very beſt, and as ſuch offer them up to God: offer to God the beſt of thy flock, the beſt of thy friends; the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are, the better is thy patience and obedience in parting with them: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38419:49"/>
all remember, that if God will have thy friends to Eternity, there is <hi>no ranſome to be taken for them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.7.</note> but they muſt be gone: Thou mayſt cry after them, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did by <hi>Elijah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 2 Kings 2.12. <hi>My Father, my Father</hi>; but <hi>Elijah</hi> never ſtops to anſwer him: So thou mayſt cry, My Husband, my Husband; my Wife, my Wife; my Childe, my Childe! but to Eternity they will go, and never ſtay to anſwer thee; <hi>for God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 9.17.</note> 
                  <hi>and who can hinder him? or who can ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi> We cannot hinder him, and we muſt not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but reſigne all to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>End</hi> 12. Chriſt viſits his people with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to fill their hearts with prayer: <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight.</hi> For a Believer being in Chriſt, and found in his Righteouſneſs at the Throne of Grace, there ariſeth ſuch a ſweet ſmell and ſavour to God, which makes the Believer and his prayers pleaſant and delightful to him: and therefore God often ſends ſickneſs to ſtir up a ſpirit of prayer in the hearts of his people. Hence we read of that ſick man, <hi>Job</hi> 33.26. <hi>He ſhall pray unto God, and he will be favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto him, and he ſhall ſee his face with joy.</hi> So when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſick, <hi>he turned
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:38419:49"/>
his face to the wall</hi> (as he lay in bed) <hi>and wept, and prayed unto the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 38.2, 14. So <hi>David,</hi> as appears by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30, and 38, and 39. when his body was full of ſickneſs, his heart was full of prayer. See further, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>That was a ſavoury ſpeech of a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Divine in his ſickneſs to his friends: <hi>Sinite me Pſittaci inſtar cum Domino meo balbutire: Suffer me to ſtammer like a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret with my Lord by prayer.</hi>
               </p>

This is the bleſſed priviledge of a Believer, that in the moſt ſad and deplorate condition in the world, he hath always acceſs with boldneſs into the preſence of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Through Chriſt we have acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father,</hi> Hebr. 10.19. <hi>Having boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> into heaven) <hi>by the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> Thou mayſt by faith and prayer ſtep out of thy ſick bed into heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:38419:50"/>
Spirit of Prayer is a Royal Spirit, whereby a Believer goes with a Princely boldneſs and confidence unto God. Now indeed ſickneſs is a moſt ſpecial ſeaſon for prayer, becauſe of our preſent need of thoſe things which we are bound to pray for, not only in regard of our need of eaſe, and health, and life, though the want of theſe is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of prayer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.14. <hi>I am oppreſſed</hi> (with pain and trouble) <hi>undertake for me.</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.13. <hi>O ſpare me, that I may recover ſtrength before I go hence, and be ſeen no more.</hi> But now our preſent need of ſoul-ſaving mercies ſhould ſet awork our hearts in prayer: now a man is perhaps juſt in his <hi>fall</hi> into Eternity, and is like to finde within a few hours, whether Heaven or Hell be his portion: This man hath need to pray earneſtly for ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſaving faith, and pardon of ſin, and everlaſting ſalvation.</p>

To fill the hearts of the godly with ſympathy to one another: as a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in a toe or finger, afflicts all the reſt of the members; ſo when one member of Chriſt is viſited, all the members about him are called to ſympathize and condole with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. <hi>If one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it.</hi> Hence we finde,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:38419:50"/>
that when a Chriſtian is diſeaſed, there is a ſpirit of prayer poured out in his behalf from all the Chriſtians about him. When <hi>Melancthon</hi> was ſick, it's reported, that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theri <hi>&amp;</hi> Crucigeri <hi>precibus non tam convaluit, quàm revixit: By the prayers of</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Cruciger, <hi>he was not only reſtored from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to health, but as it were from death to life.</hi> Melch. Adam. in vita Melancth. So when <hi>Myconius</hi> was ſick, <hi>Luther</hi> affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately prays, <hi>Peto ut loco tuo me faciat Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus aegrotum: I pray that the Lord would make me ſick in thy ſtead.</hi> Melch. Adam. in vita Mycon. <hi>David</hi> had this charity for his enemies in their ſickneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.13. <hi>But as for me, when they were ſick my clothing was ſackcloth: I humbled my ſoul with faſting, and my prayer returned into my own boſom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I behaved my ſelf as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourned for his Mother.</hi> Shall <hi>David</hi> thus faſt and pray for his ſick ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſhall not we for our ſick friends? <hi>Job</hi> profeſſeth what his carriage ſhould have been for his friends, which proved ſuch <hi>miſerable Comforters</hi> to him, <hi>Job</hi> 16.4, 5. <hi>If your ſouls were in my ſouls ſtead, I would ſtrengthen you with my mouth, and the movings of my lips ſhould aſſwage your
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:38419:51"/>
grief.</hi> Oh Sirs, how ſweet and ſavoury is it to a ſick Chriſtian, to receive ſpiritual Cordials from the wholeſome tongue of a cordial friend! Now this will be a reaſon and ground of our ſympathy, if we look on Believers in their ſickneſs, in their union and relation to Jeſus Chriſt; for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.36. <hi>I was ſick</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in my ſick mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) <hi>and ye viſited me.</hi> Conſider, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Chriſtian is a member of that Body, whoſe Head <hi>ſits at the right hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the moſt High:</hi> And as poor as this ſicK Saint lies here, yet <hi>he is</hi> virtually <hi>raiſed up with Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.6.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſits together with him in heavenly places:</hi> As miſerable as he appears now, yet the next time we ſee him, we ſhall ſee him <hi>appearing with Chriſt in glory.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3.4.</note> Come with theſe conſiderations when you viſit one another, and you will account it a mercy and great priviledge, if you, or any thing of yours be ſo bleſt, as to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of eaſe, or health, or comfort to ſuch a precious one; and you will finde all well improved, when Chriſt ſhall ſay unto you, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you; for I was ſick, and ye viſited me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>End</hi> 14. Chriſt viſits his people with ſickneſs, to glorifie his power and mercy
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:38419:51"/>
in ſtrengthening and comforting them in their ſickneſs: That of the Apoſtle is true of bodily, as well as of ſpiritual weakneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> Now is a time for God to ſhew his ſtrength in the weakneſs of his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.3. <hi>The Lord will ſtrengthen him on a bed of languiſhing; thou wilt make all his bed in his ſickneſs.</hi> Methinks that man ſhould lie eaſily, who hath the God that made all the world, to make all his bed in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The meaning is, God will be the cauſe of reſt, and eaſe, and peace to him in this condition. Hence <hi>Myconius</hi> in a fit of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs writes to <hi>Luther, Se non lethaliter, ſed vitaliter aegrotare; that he is not ſick unto death, but ſick unto life,</hi> having ſo much ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life and comfort in his ſickneſs: And one of Mr. <hi>Dods</hi> Converts told him in her ſickneſs, <hi>That ſhe was full of comfort, and could as hardly forbear ſinging now, as ſhe could crying when ſhe was in Child-bearing.</hi> That of the Pſalmiſt agrees to this, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73.26. <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth; but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's obſervable, that God hath this title in Scripture, <hi>The God of all comfort,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. becauſe whatever comfort we have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:38419:52"/>
from any creature, it comes from God through the creature: it's the goodneſs of God in the creature, which makes it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; it's the goodneſs of God which makes a Wife a comfort, a Childe a comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then he is the God of all comfort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he comforts us againſt all troubles: there is comfort from God through the creatures, but this is but ſome comfort: Money comforts a man againſt his debts, and meat comforts him againſt his hunger; but there are other caſes, as of ſickneſs, and ſpiritual wounds, and temptations, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> wherein theſe yield no comfort: But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the trouble be to a Believer, there is comfort in God againſt it: we have often God the Holy Ghoſt called in Scripture, <hi>The Comforter:</hi> now it's a ſpecial skill to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, which way God in a moſt eſpecial manner glorifies his ſeveral Titles: This Title, <hi>The Comforter,</hi> is glorified by Gods exerciſing his infinite power to comfort the hearts of his diſtreſſed people: Now ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is an affliction, wherein a man can have nothing to comfort him but God and Jeſus Chriſt; this is clear: for true comfort is the ſtrengthening of the heart againſt the preſent trouble: now that which comforts us, muſt be as truly ours, as the trouble
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:38419:52"/>
is ours; we muſt ſay, Our God, and our joy, as well as Our ſickneſs, or elſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have comfort. And again, it muſt be as near as our trouble; for it's no comfort to an hungry man to know he hath meat, if he cannot come at it. Now faith ſees God and Chriſt as near to the ſoul to comfort it, as ſickneſs is to the body to trouble it. And then laſtly, that which comforts us, muſt be good enough to take away the evil that troubles us: now a mans great trouble on his ſick-bed, is, for fear of loſing his poor ſoul: and in this caſe, to ſhew him riches, and honours, and pleaſures, will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, for they can do nothing in the removing his trouble; but if God ſay, <hi>I am thy ſalvation,</hi> now the man is comforted, and ſings at the very door of death. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.32. <hi>The righteous hath hope in his death.</hi> Now his hope is not for ſome place of preferment, or ſome rich purchaſe, or the like; for death brings no ſuch things; but he hopes for preferment <hi>in the great City that hath foundations,</hi> Heb. 11.10. <hi>where he is for ever to dwell in his houſe not made with hands,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. and theſe ſickneſs and death bring him into. That Scripture is ſweet, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19, 20. <hi>Which hope we have, as an anchor of the ſoul, both ſure
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:38419:53"/>
and ſtedfaſt, and which entreth into that within the vail, whither our forerunner is for us entred, even Jeſus.</hi> — The place within the vail is heaven, where the anchor of hope enters and ſticks: So that though a poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever lie gaſping and groaning on his ſick bed, or in other afflictions; yet this is his comfort, he is ſtill anchor'd and faſtned to heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>End</hi> 15. Chriſt viſits his people with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to fit them for greater ſufferings: As the Martyr Bilney <hi>put his finger in the fire, to fit him to burn in the flames.</hi> Chriſt by ſickneſs makes a man fit to die, and then he is fit for any ſufferings; for he that can obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently ſacrifice his life to God, can for the ſame reaſon offer up his health, liberty, and eſtate to God: and this made <hi>Paul</hi> ready to ſuffer all perſecutions, becauſe he was ready to die, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22, 23, 24. He knew that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where bonds and afflictions did way-lie him; but, ſaith he, v. 24. <hi>None of theſe things move me:</hi> I will not ſtir a ſtep out of my way of obedience, for all the bonds and afflictions that the hands of devils and men can make: What is his reaſon? becauſe <hi>I count not my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I may finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:38419:53"/>
teſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God.</hi> Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo that he could <hi>die in joy,</hi> and <hi>die in duty,</hi> he did not think his life too dear or too good to be ſpent for Jeſus Chriſt. So, ſaith he, 1 Cor. 15.32. <hi>I proteſt by your rejoycing, which I have in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, I die daily.</hi> He was ſo acquainted with death, that he made it his daily practice to put himſelf into a frame and poſture to die: and ſo many a Chriſtian hath got ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with death by ſickneſs, that he lives in a continual frame and readineſs to die: beſides, his ſickneſs makes him leſs fearful of men: <hi>for he knows,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 12.4.</note> 
                  <hi>when they have killed the body, they have no more that they can do</hi>; they have done their worſt, which is no more then an ordinary diſeaſe can do: and therefore, as the Philoſopher told the Tyrant, when he threatned to kill him, that <hi>a Fly could do that:</hi> ſo Believers need not fear what men can do, becauſe they can do no more then a Fever, Dropſie, Conſumption, or any other diſeaſe can do: and thus he is prepared by ſickneſs for other afflictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>End</hi> 16. To prepare them for great mercy. Beloved, ſometimes mercies are more dangerous for Gods people then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; they are often worſe in plenty
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:38419:54"/>
then in poverty, in credit then in diſgrace; more ſecure in health and eaſe, then in pains and ſickneſs. This happens, when our mercies are too big for our graces; as when we have great credit, and little humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: or elſe when our outward mercies do moſt feed our inward corruptions; as when riches do meet with a heart much inclined to covetouſneſs, and health and eaſe are given to a Chriſtian who is apt to be idle and ſecure: now therefore God melts his people in the Furnace of Affliction, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to be <hi>veſſels of mercy.</hi> Hence we read, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.11. <hi>That no chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheleſs, afterwards it yieldeth the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fruit of righteouſneſs unto them which are exerciſed thereby:</hi> As whilſt a Childe is under the diſcipline of the Rod, he receives the fruit of his dulneſs and idleneſs in the ſmarting of the Rod; but afterwards, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the fruit of his learning and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in honours and preferments: So whilſt Gods children are corrected with ſickneſs, and other afflictions, they receive the bitter fruit of their ſins, of their pride, froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſecurity, and creature-confidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is not for the preſent <hi>joyous, but grievous</hi>; but afterwards they reap the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:38419:54"/>
fruit of righteouſneſs and holineſs, of faith, fear, love, prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is ſweet and peaceable fruit: we have a pertinent proof of this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.5, 6. <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come again with rejoycing, bringing his ſheaves with him.</hi> As the Husbandman in a year of famine, when corn is dear, and ſeed ſcarce, he ſows, he ventures it in the ground, but he ſows in tears, he goes out with his ſeed weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Ah, thinks he, this corn would have made ſo much bread for my poor wife and children, or would have given ſo much money towards paying my rent: Thus with a ſad heart he ſows his ſeed; but when harveſt comes, and brings forth a plentiful crop, then he reaps in joy, and brings home his ſheaves with ſinging, ſhouting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing. Thus it is with Gods childe in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as ſuppoſe in ſickneſs, his grief is great, and his pains grievous; yet he ſows, though it be in ſorrow; he believes in tears, and hopes in tears, and prays in tears: well, after comes the harveſt of health, and he reaps the fruit of faith, hope and prayer, and he goes about rejoycing and praiſing God, and carrying his ſheaves of mercy
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:38419:55"/>
and comfort about with him. Our Saviour <hi>ſpeaks fully to this caſe,</hi> Joh. 16.20, 21. — <hi>Ye ſhall be ſorrowful, but your ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A woman when ſhe is in travel hath ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, becauſe her hour is come: but as ſoon as ſhe is delivered of the childe, ſhe remembreth no more the anguiſh, for joy that a man is born into the world.</hi> As a woman with childe, when the hour of her travel is come, is full of ſorrow with the throws and pains of her travel; but when ſhe is delivered, ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets her ſorrow, and with a joyful heart falls a kiſſing and imbracing her childe: So, my Brethren, when the hour of ſickneſs, or other affliction comes upon us, we are full of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with the pains and travels of our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but when we are delivered, and ſee what mercy our affliction hath brought forth, the joy and comfort of our graces, and experiences, and deliverances, doth ſwallow up the ſorrow of our affliction.</p>
               <p>We have a ſpecial inſtance of the glorious chain of Gods wonderful Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to confirm the truth in hand: his afflictions laſted about thirteen years: (for he was ſeventeen years old when he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited his Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.2. and thirty years old, when he was preferred in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>

Court, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.46.) Now in all this time his afflictions were ſad; he was parted from his tender father, he was bought and ſold; after this unjuſtly defamed and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; he was put like a Rogue in irons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.18. his afflictions were ſo great, that the afflictions of Gods people were long after, and ever will be to the end of the world, called the <hi>afflictions of Joſeph, Amos 6.6.</hi> yet he was after all this raiſed up in great mercie, and was made a bleſſed inſtrument to ſave the Church and <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God from periſhing with famine.

                  <hi>and have ſeen the end of the Lord</hi>; for as we read, Job 42.12. <hi>The Lord bleſſed the latter end of Job.</hi>

                  <hi>David</hi> upon this ground incouraged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his afflictions, becauſe he believed a good iſſue out of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.20, 21. <hi>Thou which haſt ſhewed me great and ſore troubles, ſhalt quicken me again, and ſhalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

               </p>
               <p>Conſider further, that ſickneſs when
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:38419:56"/>
ſanctified, exceedingly fits a man both for Spiritual and Temporal mercies; for then a man comes out of ſickneſs, as one who is raiſed from the grave, and ſo he is filled with the thoughts of death and eternity; and this is a frame of heart, which gives a kindly reliſh to all ſpiritual mercies; this makes him taſte God and Chriſt to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding gracious, in the likeneſs and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whom he ſees himſelf bleſſed and ſatisfied through all eternity: And this alſo fits him for Temporal mercies; for it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to uſe friends, lands, food, and all his temporal injoyments for eternity; he hereby learns to turn his treaſures in earth into treaſures in heaven: This makes him at the will of God to leave father and mother, and lands, and life, knowing that he ſhall receive the comfort of all in another world; ſo he cheerfully gives to Chriſt in his members,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.17.</note> knowing that this <hi>fruit will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound to his account</hi> when Chriſt and he come to reckon: and that this is <hi>laid up in ſtore as a good foundation againſt the time to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.19.

a journey beyond this world, turns his ſtock and eſtate to Gods glory here, believing that it will be returned to him a thouſand fold in the glory and joys of heaven, when he comes there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>End</hi> 17. Which is the laſt that I ſhall mention, is to gain to himſelf praiſe and glory in recovering his people from their ſickneſs. Hence we read, <hi>Job</hi> 11.3, 4. when it was told Chriſt, that <hi>Lazarus, whom he loved, is ſick:</hi> Chriſt anſwers; <hi>This ſickneſs is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</hi> Beloved, recovery from ſickneſs is a great mercy both to a mans ſelf and others, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> Phil. 2.27. <hi>He was ſick, nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him, and not on him onely, but on me alſo, leſt I ſhould have ſorrow upon ſorrow.</hi> And therefore upon this reaſon the hearts of Gods people have been filled with the praiſes of God: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1, 2, 3. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me praiſe his holy name:</hi> And this is one ground of this— <hi>Who healeth all thy diſeaſes.</hi> This was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his practice in this caſe; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.19. <hi>The living, the living, they ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day.</hi>— See alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. <hi>We
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:38419:57"/>
had the ſentence of death in our ſelves</hi>; that is, our danger was ſo great, (whether by ſickneſs, or perſecution, or rather both, I ſhall not inquire) that we looked on our ſelves as ſentenced to dye; and this ſentence was in us, and did fill us: but, ſaith he, <hi>God who raiſeth the dead, delivered us from ſo great a death,</hi> for this end, <hi>that thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</hi> Beloved, ſometimes our ſickneſſes are very grievous and dangerous, as <hi>Job</hi> cries out, <hi>cap.</hi> 23.2. <hi>My ſtroke is heavier then my groaning</hi>; and ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 10.16. <hi>Thou ſheweſt thy ſelf mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous upon me</hi>; that is, thou exerciſeſt thy marvellous power and greatneſs in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting me. Now this ſhould cauſe us to make the praiſes of God more glorious for our recovery; and therefore in ſuch caſes the godly have acknowledged this mercy to be a kinde of reſurrection from the dead: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.3. <hi>O Lord, thou haſt brought up my ſoul from the grave,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.6. <hi>Who bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</hi> Job 33.28, 29, 30. <hi>He will deliver his ſoul from going down into the pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light.</hi> And this is the Providence that all are to obſerve and acknowledge: <hi>Loe! all theſe things worketh God oftentimes with man, to bring back his ſoul from the pit,

They think in their hearts and conſcience, that God will never trouble them for their ſins: this ſecure temper of the ungodly is ſeen by that of the prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.7. <hi>The morning is come upon thee — the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the ſounding again of the mountains</hi>; or as <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Termellius</hi> read it, <hi>not the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho of the mountains:</hi> implying, that they feared no more the threatnings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, then a vain airy noiſe or <hi>Eccho</hi> in the mountains: this makes ſecure ſinners to bear no fear of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1. <hi>The tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.</hi> Their ſins are ſo notorious and viſible, that they declare in the very hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the godly, that there is no fear of God before their eyes.

with thy Creditor, or of meeting with the Magiſtrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but conſider when thou comeſt to meet God in his taking vengeance for ſin, he will not meet thee as a man, as a hard Creditor, or as a harſh Landlord, or a furious Souldier, or a ſevere Magiſtrate, but he will meet thee as a God of wrath and vengeance: Upon this ground our Saviour preſents God terrible, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4, 5. <hi>And I ſay unto you, My friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom you ſhould fear; fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you, fear him.</hi> Obſerve, that what our Saviour ſaith of men, is true of all bodily evils, when they have killed the body, they have no more that they can do; then the fear of them is paſt; there is no fear of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, or Fever, or Conſumptions in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: but now a wicked man can never ſay <hi>the worſt is paſt,</hi> becauſe he can never be paſt hell: for God after he hath killed, hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to caſt into hell; ſo that when you think it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a mercileſs Uſurer, or a cruel Landlord, or a bloudy man; or to fall into the fire, or water; or to fall into the Peſtilence, Fever, Dropſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then conſider that, <hi>It is a fearful
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:38419:59"/>
thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.31</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider, God is not onely a God of mercy, but alſo a God of judgment: the Devil devours moſt men by perſwading them, either that God hath no wrath, which makes them preſumptuous; or that he hath no mercy, which makes them deſperate. Now to arm you againſt the former tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, which concerns the buſineſs in hand, fill your hearts with the belief of God, as he is a God of judgement, for <hi>the Lord is known by the judgement which he executeth,</hi> Pſal. 9.16. therefore he tells us: <hi>I kill, and I make alive,</hi> Deut. 32.39. So ſaith he, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.7. <hi>I form the light, and create darkneſs; I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all theſe things:</hi> All the evil of puniſhment which comes into the world, comes from God; all the hurt that is done by fire, water, wind, thunder, earthquakes, God doth it; all the hurt that comes by famine, peſtilence, ſword, blaſting, mildew, God doth it; all that dye, God kills them; all that go to hell, God damns them: and is not this a terrible God?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, look not on God as men judge of him, when they are ſecure, and God is patient; but as he appears, when men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake with guilt, and God awakes in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:38419:59"/>
wrath. Beloved, if every Sin ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bring a Judgement, if every Oath ſhould kill a Cow, and every Lye break a Bone, and every act of Drunkenneſs turn a man into a Dropſie; then ſin would be accounted more dangerous, and God more terrible: But as we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.19. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</hi> When men can ſwear, lye, be drunk, ſcoff at godlineſs, prophane Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and yet eat, drink, ſleep, work, and play all alike; this makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that God is not ſo angry with them, as a company of preciſe Puritans would have them believe. We read of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical temper, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21, 22. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done</hi> (meaning the crying ſins fore-mentioned) <hi>and I kept ſilence</hi> (ſaith God) I did not diſturb thee, nor hinder thee; <hi>and thou thoughteſt that I was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuch a one as thy ſelf,</hi> that I liked ſin as well as thou didſt; but thou wilt be of another minde, <hi>when I come to reprove thee, and to ſet thy ſins in order before thee, and to tear thee in pieces, when there ſhall be none to deliver thee.</hi> We read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.11. <hi>Evil ſhall hunt the violent man to deſtroy him</hi>; and it is ſaid, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.23. <hi>Your ſin ſhall finde you out.</hi> Sinners lye cloſe and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:38419:60"/>
hide themſelves in their ſins, as if judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could never finde them: Oh, but conſider, ſickneſſes, and death, and hell are looking for thee, they are hunting after thee. Heark, methinks I hear the cry of the hunters, and the ſound of the feet of death purſuing thy ſoul: I may ſay unto thee as ſhe ſaid to <hi>Sampſon, The Philiſtines are upon thee Sampſon:</hi> Sickneſs is upon thee ſinner; death and judgement is coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee; the wrath of the eternal God is <hi>roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> againſt thee: theſe things ſhould make thee cry out with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.20. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of thy judgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Conſider God as a God of all ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and diſeaſes, to convince thee that he is a terrible God; theſe with other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are called <hi>the terrors of God,</hi> Job 6.4. <hi>The terrors of God do ſet themſelves in aray againſt me</hi>; and it's clear that God for this reaſon is terrible; for that is terrible which is deſtructive to the health, and life, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man; this makes fire, water, wind, thunder, men and devils terrible; and this makes Sickneſs, the Peſtilence, Fever, the Pocks, the Stone, the Conſumption, and Death, and Judgement terrible. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what a terrible Majeſtie is God, who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:38419:60"/>
makes all theſe ſo terrible? for as there is no fear of an Ox-goad, or of the Jaw-bone of an Aſs; but the one in the hand of a mighty <hi>Shamgar,</hi> was a terrible inſtrument of death to ſix hundred men, <hi>Judges</hi> 3.31. and the other in the hand of a ſtrong <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> killed heaps upon heaps, heaps upon heaps, a thouſand men, <hi>Judges</hi> 15.16. So this makes all diſeaſes, and all inſtruments of death terrible, becauſe they are in the hand of a mighty God, who for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is to be acknowledged and feared as a very terrible God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, informs us of the infinite pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God towards ungodly men; which appears, in that God hath all diſeaſes, and death at command to avenge himſelf upon them, and yet that he is pleaſed ſo long to forbear. The Scripture makes known the glory of God to us by this Attribute, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>The Lord merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. This patience of God is his infinite goodneſs, whereby he doth moderate and with- hold his wrath from falling upon ſinners. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning grace takes a way the wrath of God, and looſeth the believer from being bound to ſuffer it: But here the ſinner lyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and ſtands bound over by the Law,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:38419:61"/>
to ſuffer Gods wrath; but God by his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite patience forbears to inflict it.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall briefly propound theſe three Conſiderations, to convince us of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider the greatneſs of that wrath which God withholds from falling on you, <hi>viz.</hi> all the puniſhments which are threatned in the curſes of Gods Law: God doth not only keep off millions of diſeaſes, but alſo mountains of torments from coming upon thee every day: the great difference which is betwixt thee and a damned ſoul in hell, is made by the patience of God. Oh poor Chriſtleſs ſinner, when I ſtand ſeriouſly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on thee eating, and drinking, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſporting in thy ſins, as if thou thoughteſt thy ſelf as ſafe as ever an Angel of heaven; and then believe what the Scripture ſpeaks againſt thee, and ſee what is in God againſt thee; I cannot but tremble to look thee in the face, to ſee whither thou art ſo merrily going, and what an alteration ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death is ſhortly like to make with thee, but for preſent God in infinite patience withholds all the wrath that thou deſerveſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the great provocations that God doth bear: Sin is ſaid to provoke or call forth the wrath of God; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:38419:61"/>
ſuch horrid ſins call and cry for his wrath, yet in the infinite power of his patience he forbears. The Scripture aſcribes a Voice to three things which cry aloud for Gods wrath.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sin cryes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.20, 21. <hi>The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is great.</hi> — Swearing cryes, Pour out thy wrath on the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that belcheth out me: Drunkenneſs cryes, Oh thou conſuming fire, devour this Beaſt that commits me. So there is a cry againſt a Nation, and againſt a City or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Oh Profaneneſs cryes, Come away Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, come away Famine, and devour <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that is ſo filled with me: but yet God in infinite patience withholds his Judgments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Eſtates of men which are gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſin and wickedneſs cry for vengeance, James 5.4. Hab. 2.11. <hi>The ſtone ſhall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber ſhall anſwer it.</hi> The Prophet ſpeaks, as if all the parts of a houſe built by fraud and blood, did conſent to cry one after another for vengeance againſt the founders of it: the <hi>Stone</hi> cryes, Lord revenge the cruelty and injuſtice that laid me; and the <hi>Timber</hi> anſwers and cryes, Make inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the blood that laid me. Oh you that eat the bread of deceit, and live upon
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:38419:62"/>
lyes and injuſtice, were your conſciences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, you might hear the very bread on your tables, and the money in your purſes, and the ſtones and timber of your houſes cry for the vengeance of God againſt you; and yet this infinitely patient God bears with you.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the ſighs and groans of Gods people cry aloud for vengeance againſt their Perſecutors and Oppreſſors. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.7. <hi>I have ſeen the affliction of my people which are in Aegypt, and have heard their cry:</hi> Pſal. 12.4. <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor, and the ſighing of the needy, will I ariſe.</hi> Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the godly are hated for their likeneſs to God: this makes the difference betwixt them and the wicked; for herein they differ from the world; and a man muſt either make God his enemy, and the Devil his father, and be content to damn his own ſoul, or elſe the world and he will never be friends,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.29.</note> but <hi>he that is born after the fleſh will perſecute him that is born after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Now herein is glorified the patience of God, when they that wrong his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, rake in the apple <hi>of his eye</hi>; and yet this tender Father ſtands by, and ſees his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſcorned, and loathed, and murdered, for chooſing, and honouring, and fearing, and pleaſing him, and for a long time bears all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:38419:62"/>Laſtly, the infinite patience of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that he can always eaſe himſelf of his enemies, and yet he forbears. God complains, that the ſins of men are <hi>a trouble to him,</hi> Iſa. 1.14. and that they <hi>weary him,</hi> Iſa. 43.24. and, ſaith he, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.13. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am preſſed under you, as a Cart is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that is full of ſheaves.</hi> Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks, as if God did eaſe and comfort himſelf in the deſtruction of his enemies, Iſa. 1.24. <hi>Ah, I will eaſe me of my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> — Ezek. 5.13. <hi>I will cauſe my fury to reſt upon them, and I will be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Now God can ſuddenly thus eaſe and comfort himſelf: let him but command the Peſtilence, the Fever, the Pocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will quickly fetch them to hell, never to trouble him more; but in his infinite pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and long-ſuffering, he ſpares them, and bears with them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Informs us of the reaſon why godly Miniſters are ſo ſerious in ſhewing men their danger, and preſſing them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, becauſe they ſee Almighty God armed with ſuch a multitude of diſeaſes, and judgments, and deaths againſt men: when a Miniſter is filled with love to, and longing for the ſalvation of his people, and ſees the diſeaſes, and other judgments,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:38419:63"/>
which lye at the door of every ſinner; and knows, that the want of his care and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs may be the damnation of a ſoul, or more, before another opportunity; this muſt needs make Miniſters labour earneſtly for the ſalvation of their people: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an excellent thing for a Miniſter to preach, and pray, and adminiſter Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and live, as if he ſaw God, and Chriſt, and Angels, and Devils, and Death, and Judgment looking him in the face; to preach as if he were to die preaching, and people were to die under his Sermons. Hence, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We muſt all appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt:</hi> whence he infers, verſ. 11. <hi>Knowing therefore the terrors of the Lord, we perſwade men.</hi> Beloved, we know what Chriſt will do to us, if we preach the word deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and damn the ſouls whom we are ſent to ſave. We know the doom of thoſe <hi>who know not God, and obey not the Goſpel,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. We know whither drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, and whoremongers, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and worldlings, and all unregenerate perſons are going; and therefore <hi>knowing the terrors of the Lord, we perſwade men:</hi> we are ſent in the ſtead of Chriſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to heaven, and therefore dare
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:38419:63"/>
not ſtand in the ſtead of Devils to flatter you into hell. Sirs, it is not many weeks ſince I was even paſt preaching, and I know that death and I muſt ſhortly meet again, and I know ere long you will be paſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore I would preach and live ſo, that when ſickneſs and death return, I may be found labouring <hi>to ſave my ſelf,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.16.</note> 
                  <hi>and them that hear me.</hi> In the mean time, when I look upon God, and ſee millions of deaths in his hands,<note place="margin">Rev. 6.8.</note> and every death <hi>hell following it</hi>; I dare not but warn you <hi>to flee from the wrath to come,</hi> Mat. 3.7. Beloved, a faithful Miniſter would never tell you of your ſins, but to cauſe you to forſake them; and the word <hi>Hell</hi> ſhould not be ſo often in his Pulpit, but that he is afraid leſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould come there: he hath no ſecret grudge againſt you, neither <hi>deſires the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day, God knows,</hi> Jer. 17.16. but he dares not deceive you, he dares not be damned for you, in preaching you and himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell.</p>
               <p>The fourth informs us, whence it is that we hear ſo much of the unexpected deaths of men; why here is the cauſe, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a diſeaſe, or ſome other meſſenger of death, to go and to fetch them away, and they are gone: if any die, God tells
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:38419:64"/>
all the world who kills them; <hi>I kill,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39. Hence we ſee great men for a while fill a Country; and a frown of their faces, and a ſtamp of their foot, makes all to quake about them: but they prove like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> of whom we read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.17. <hi>Pharaoh King of Egypt is but a noiſe.</hi> So they make a great noiſe in the Country a while, and then like a ſound in the Air paſs away. Methinks a great man is like a great winde, it blows violently, and rageth a while, as if it would throw down all afore it; but it proves but a wind which is ſoon ſpent and laid. So a furious wicked man, he bluſters and ruffles a while, as if he would blow down God and man; but a diſeaſe, and death comes, and <hi>he gives up the ghoſt, and where is he? David</hi> made this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.35, 36. <hi>I have ſeen the wicked in great power, and ſpreading himſelf like a green Bay-tree.</hi> Obſerve, he ſpreads him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he enlargeth his power, and riches, and greatneſs: But ſee what follows, <hi>Yet he paſſed away, and lo, he was not; yea, I ſought him, but he could not be found:</hi> for a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes, and <hi>like a tempeſt takes him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a night,</hi> Job 27.20. and ſo <hi>by the blaſt of God they periſh,</hi> Job 4.9. So we ſee others which would be as great ſinners,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:38419:64"/>
but that they are not ſo great men; for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumenta explicandae nequitiae deſunt,</hi> as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>they want inſtruments to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief:</hi> theſe <hi>curſt Kine have ſhort horns,</hi> and ſo cannot do ſo much hurt: theſe men are full of lyes, oaths, drunkenneſs, and are ſet on fire againſt God and godlineſs, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with that impudence, as if they would out-face and brow-beat God and man, and make death and hell afraid of them; but a ſickneſs and death comes, and they are <hi>driven away in their wickedneſs, Prov.</hi> 14.32. whoſe end <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes, <hi>cap.</hi> 24.29. <hi>Drought and heat conſume the ſnow-waters, ſo doth the grave thoſe that have ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So alſo we ſee godly people, who are the bleſſing of their Age, of whom <hi>the world is not worthy,</hi> Hebr. 11.38. the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not the prayers, and counſels, and examples of ſuch men; yet theſe <hi>periſh, though few lay it to heart,</hi> Iſa. 57.1. (for in this caſe <hi>there is one event to all,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.2. for as they lie at the graves mouth, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the difference betwixt a <hi>skull that ſleeps in Jeſus, and a skull that is condemned to hell</hi>) and therefore it's true of theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ones, as was ſaid of the good Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.29. <hi>Iſrael muſt die</hi>; or as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:38419:65"/>
we read of <hi>David,</hi> Acts 13.36. <hi>After he had ſerved his own generation, by the will of God, he fell aſleep.</hi> All theſe things are from Jeſus Chriſt, who ſends ſickneſſes and death at his pleaſure; and many <hi>ſuch things are with him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 23.14</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, It informs us of the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, that we enjoy our health and lives ſo long, when he hath ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in his hands to deprive us of both: Hence he is called, the <hi>Preſerver of men,</hi> Job 7.20.<note place="margin">Deut. 30.20.</note> It is the Lord who <hi>is our life, and the length of our daies; who preſerves us, and keeps us alive.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 41.2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider the many deaths and dangers we are preſerved from, that thereby we may ſee and acknowledge the greatneſs of this mercy. Our Bodies and Souls were no ſooner united in the Womb, but thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of deaths were ready to part us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: we were liable to all the dangers that our Mothers were in, in whoſe lives our lives were bound up; beſides, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of evils might have kill'd us there, and a miſcarrying Womb might have loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us into Eternity. And if we look through the whole courſe of our Age, what year, or week, or day can we name, wherein ſome have not died? Oh infinite
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:38419:65"/>
mercy, that keeps us alive in a world of devouring devils and bloody men! what multitudes of diſeaſes might have bred in our own bodies! what ſudden deaths by Falls, Fire, Water, Thunderbolts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is never a beam in our houſes, or beaſt in our fields, or bit of meat on our tables, or ſtones in the ſtreets, but methinks it's like a Piſtol charg'd and cockt (if God ſay the word) to ſtrike us dead in the place: where ever we ſit, ride, walk, lie down, there is from thence a <hi>fall into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</hi> We may well wonder, when we read of the three Childrens preſervation in the Fiery Furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. and of <hi>Daniels</hi> ſafety in the Lyons Den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. and yet I tell you, our daily and hourly deliverances are as great, only they are not ſo rare: for to name no more, Devils can as eaſily kill us, as the Fire or Lyons could them; and we have no more power to reſiſt or eſcape theſe Murderers, then they had the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Flames, or greedy Lyons; but as God miraculouſly preſerved them, ſo doth he wonderfully preſerve us, even in a croud of deaths and dangers.</p>

               <p>Firſt, This is a ſin which brings a man under the heavy wrath and curſe of God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.6. <hi>The ſoul that turneth after ſuch as have familiar ſpirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even ſet my face againſt that ſoul, and will cut him off from among his people.</hi> Obſerve, for this ſin God will ſet his face againſt thee, all his power and wrath is ſet and bent againſt thee: O how canſt thou hold up thy face, when <hi>the face of God is ſet againſt thee!</hi> and whereas thou thinkeſt thou art planted in thy Country, and planted in the Church of God, and planted in thy Family, God will cut thee off from among thy people. Thus, poor wretch, thy diſeaſe is perhaps abated, and thou rejoyceſt in thy eaſe and health; but remember, thou haſt got the <hi>Devils bleſſing,</hi> and <hi>Gods curſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This is that filthy ſin of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. See again, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.6. <hi>The ſoul that turneth after ſuch as have familiar ſpirits — to go a whoring after them.</hi> Do not you account this a beaſtly ſin, for people to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:38419:67"/>
go up and down <hi>a whoring?</hi> Well, though thou thinkeſt thou keepeſt thy ſelf honeſt, and wilt ſay, I thank God no body can touch me in my honeſty; yet although all thy Neighbours judge thee to be honeſt, the Lord judgeth thee to be a filthy <hi>Whore,</hi> and <hi>Whoremonger:</hi> for though perhaps thou haſt not defiled thy body with a Whore, yet thou haſt defiled thy ſoul with the Devil, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.31. <hi>Regard not them that have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ſpirits — to be defiled by them</hi>; and thou mayſt be aſſured, that the Devil will not heal thy body, except it be to kill thy ſoul; and thou doſt hereby joyn that perſon to the Devil, which ſhould be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt; thou doſt yield thy ſelf to the power and will of the Devil: Hence thoſe are the moſt ignorant, ſottiſh, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, or covetous people, that ſeek to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Beloved, we ſhould do nothing, but what we may comfortably go from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it into the preſence of God in any duty, or to enjoy his preſence into Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Now, as a wife can have no delight to go from a whoremonger, into the preſence or ſociety of her husband; ſo how canſt thou comfortably go from a Wizard to Prayer, to a Sacrament, or to a Sermon, or from a Wizard into Eternity?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:38419:67"/>Thirdly, This ſin is the moſt abominable ſin of Idolatry, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.31. <hi>Regard not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hem that have familiar ſpirits — I am the Lord your God:</hi> Implying, that they that ſeek to ſuch, do deny God to be the Lord, and do diſown him from being their God, and make the Devil and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments their God. Idolatry is that ſin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men forſake the true God, and ſet up any thing in the place of God; and this ſin is ſo much the worſe, by how much that is more vile, and more unlike God, and more againſt him, which thou makeſt an Idol of; and therefore this is the worſt kind of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: for what is more vile, and more unlike God, and more againſt him, then an ugly damned Devil? yet by ſeeking to Wizards in thy diſtreſs, thou doſt in effect deny the power, and goodneſs, and mercy of God, and accounteſt the Devil more able, and more merciful, and more willing to do thee good then God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This ſin is an horrible violation of our Covenant with God, which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in by Baptiſm; for thereby we are bound to be for God, and Chriſt, and the Church, and Salvation, againſt the Devil and all his party: Now hereby thou goeſt againſt God, and owneſt the Devil to be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:38419:68"/>
thy friend to heal thee. The Prophet pleads this argument againſt this ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19. <hi>When they ſhall ſay unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar ſpirits, and unto Wizards, that peep and mutter</hi> (do not be tempted thereunto) <hi>ſhould not a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeek unto their God,</hi> the God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, but to the Devils and their Confederates, whom they have cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted againſt? We have the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pleaded, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.3, 4. where we finde that <hi>Elijah</hi> meets <hi>Ahaziah</hi> his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as they were going to enquire of <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> the god of <hi>Ekron</hi>; and he tells them in effect, You may ſpare your labour, for <hi>Ahaziah</hi> ſhall die. But mark how he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates with them, verſ. 3. <hi>Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not a God in Iſrael, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</hi> So Sirs, Is there not a God in <hi>England?</hi> And are there not means of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and are there not Miniſters and Chriſtians to pray for you, who are in league with him, but muſt you ſeek to ſuch who are in league with the Devil? Beloved, do not you look upon your ſelves as parts and members of Jeſus Chriſt? and will you bring a member of Chriſt to be healed by the Devil? What, hath the Devil more
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:38419:68"/>
care of Chriſts members, then Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? or hath Chriſt need of the Devil to help or heal ever a member of his? I tell you, Chriſt would not himſelf, and he abhors that ever a member of his ſhould fall down, or worſhip, or ſtoop to the Devil.</p>
               <p>Now to excuſe this horrid ſin, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ordinarily make ſuch Objections as theſe.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>My loving neighbours and friends gave me counſel to ſend to the wiſe woman for the health of my childe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is a device of Satan, when he tempts to ſin, to make as many as he can partakers of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore in this caſe he may tempt one to give this deviliſh counſel, and thereby he ſignifieth he is willing of it, and ſo becomes guilty both of the ſin it ſelf, and of being a Devil to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by tempting him to the ſame ſin: another is tempted to take the counſel, and ſo both conſents unto, and alſo commits the ſin; another applauds it; another is hired to go to the Witch; the Witch her ſelf is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in her ſin: and thus the ſin goes through many hands, and ſpreads over many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; ſo that often in this caſe, many in the neighbourhood, and the whole family
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38419:69"/>
where the perſon is viſited, and many more are fearfully brought into the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider what perſons they are who adviſe thee: Did ever any godly Miniſter or Chriſtian give thee ſuch counſel? Did ever theſe loving friends and neighbours (as thou calleſt them) ſeriouſly tell thee of thy danger by ſin, and exhort thee to become a new ereature, and to ſet up the worſhip of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in thy family, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the ſalvation of thy precious ſoul? I tell thee, thou mayeſt go to hell with the love of ſuch as thou calleſt loving neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but that will not eaſe thy torments when thou comeſt there.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let thy Counſellors be who they will, the Word of God hath plainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented this objection, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19. <hi>When they ſhall ſay unto you,</hi> (when they ſhall give you this damnable counſel) <hi>Seek unto them that have familiar ſpirits,</hi> do not be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them; for <hi>ſhould not a people ſeek unto their God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Object. <hi>Many in the like caſe ſeek to the wiſe-man, or wiſe-woman, as well as I; they come far and near to them for help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is moſt certain, as long as ſuch ignorant, unbelieving, covetous Atheiſts as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:38419:69"/>
thou art, live in the world, <hi>the Devil ſhall never want Cuſtomers</hi>; and if thou wilt <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a multitude to ſin,</hi> thou wilt finde when thou comeſt to hell, and ſtandeſt at the left hand of Chriſt at the day of Judgment, that thou art never like to want ſuch company.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Object. <hi>I know not that ſuch to whom I ſeek for help, are in league with the Devil; I am ſure they ſpeak godly words of God and Chriſt, and they do no hurt; and therefore for ought I know, they are as godly people as any are in the Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall anſwer this Objection in theſe four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Wizards uſing the Name of God, and Chriſt, or ſome Scriptures, excuſeth not his being in league with the Devil; they that know not this, are groſly ignorant both of the wiſdom and will of God, and alſo of the <hi>depths and devices</hi> of the Devil; for the Devil doth moſt deſpite and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God, when he conceals his own name, and forgeth the name of God to the moſt horrid wickedneſs: and therefore let not the curſed wretches deceive you with the name of God, and ſo bring you into <hi>communion</hi> with, and into the <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the Devil; but follow the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Word of God, which is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:38419:70"/>
given to undeceive thoſe that are apt to be a prey to theſe deluſions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19, 20. — <hi>To the law, and to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Judge no better of them, becauſe thou thinkeſt them ſo harmleſs: thou thinkeſt it's pity but ſuch a <hi>Hag</hi> were burnt, who bewitcheth peoples bodies, children, cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but thou ſayeſt theſe do no hurt, but much good, in telling to ſtoln goods, in healing the ſick, and curing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed cattel, or the like. But beloved, this is but a pretence for the Devil; for his greateſt <hi>wiles</hi> are to bring you to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with him in hell: and therefore he is content you ſhould be healthful, and wealthy, and merry, (for as we ſay, the Devil is kinde to his own) ſo that he can tempt you to be ſinful: Hence it is, that he will entice you to ſeek to him for the healing your bodies, becauſe it ſerves his deſigne to kill your ſouls: Beſides, there is a confederacy among the Devils, ſo that one Witch by her league with the Devil, may bewitch you into ſickneſs; another, by as bad a league, will (as it is termed) bleſs you into health; but though theſe ſeem to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:38419:70"/>
counter-work one another, yet the Devils in both agree to <hi>devour</hi> your ſouls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is enough to deter thee from ever ſeeking to ſuch, when they are branded with the names of Witches, Wizards, Conjurers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they are ſo reputed, not onely by ſome malicious ſlanderers (for Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was ſlandered as one who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Devil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24.) but alſo by the voice of the country, and by the ſober, wiſe, charitable and godly Miniſters and people, who hear of their Clyents, and of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this is a ſufficient reaſon for all to abhor the thoughts of ſeeking to them, becauſe they uſe ſuch means, upon the uſe of which thou haſt no Scripture-ground to believe, or call upon God for a bleſſing; as when they uſe inchanting words, ſpells, circles, herbs, ſalt, ſtones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have no natural virtue to work ſuch effects: for theſe are but ſignes upon the uſe of which the Devil hath bound himſelf to his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, to do what they truſt him for: For as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> well obſerves, the Devil is herein Gods Ape to imitate him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as God hath made a covenant of grace with his people, and hath ordained Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:38419:71"/>
ſignes and ſeals, upon the faithful uſe of which he is preſent to believers, to perform all that he hath promiſed in the Covenant. So the Devil makes a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Witches, and appoints them to uſe certain ſignes and tokens, upon the uſe of which he is preſent to do (ſo far as he can, and God permits) all that they call upon him, and truſt to him for: And thus you may ſee the nature, evil and danger of this horrid wickedneſs of ſeeking in your ſickneſſes to Witches and Wizards for health; that ſuch as are guilty may <hi>repent and pray to God,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This Doctrine reproves thoſe who are full of murmuring and diſcontent, when Chriſt viſits them or their friends with ſickneſs: If Chriſt commands diſeaſes to go, there can be no reaſon to murmur; if Chriſt doth it, no body muſt finde fault: yet moſt people are very apt to this ſin in time of ſickneſs; for this is the property of a man, that what ever is moſt in his heart, when he is troubled, it preſently riſeth, and works up into his affections,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:38419:71"/>
thoughts, looks, words and actions. I ſhall illuſtrate this by a clear ſimilitude: Take two bottles of wine, the one with ſugar, the other with dregs at the bottom; now ſhake them, and the ſugar and dregs will riſe and work up, and the one fills the wine with a ſweet and pleaſant taſte, and the other will make it muddy and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant both to taſte and look upon: ſo if a godly man and ungodly man be viſited with ſickneſs, when the godly man is ſtirred and troubled, his graces will preſently work, and the man will be full of faith, love, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and prayer, which makes his words and carriage exceeding ſweet and ſavoury; but when the wicked man is viſited, the dregs of ſin preſently riſe and work up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his words and actions are then full of pride, anger and diſcontent, which make him ſinful and unſavory: ſo that I ſay a murmuring and diſcontented ſpirit uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevails with men in ſickneſs, or other afflictions. The Jews are often branded for this ſin, which was ſo notorious in them, that the Scripture warns all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take heed of murmuring for their ſake, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Neither murmur ye, as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed of the deſtroyer.</hi> Now to arm you
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:38419:72"/>
againſt this ſin, I ſhall briefly 1. Shew you the Nature and Properties of it; 2. The Cauſes, 3. The ſad Conſequences of it.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, obſerve the nature of it in this deſcription: <hi>The ſin of murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is an unruly, diſobedient, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet frame of ſpirit, whereby the heart riſeth againſt God, ſo as to queſtion and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with him, as if he were unholy, cruel, unjuſt, and unmerciful in his proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As by the grace of contentation the heart doth quietly and obediently yeild to the Will of God, ſo as to approve and praiſe all his dealings as holy, juſt and fatherly to him; ſo a diſcontented ſpirit doth reſiſt God, and judge of all his diſpenſations, as if they were unworthy and injurious to him. This ſin is further known by theſe four filthy properties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a rebellious riſing of the heart againſt God, eſpecially as he appears in that Providence which is the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his murmuring. Hence murmurers are called <hi>rebels,</hi> Numb. 16.41. for now all the powers of a man are up in a <hi>tumult and inſurrection</hi> againſt God; the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thoughts riſe up in a quarrel with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:38419:72"/>
him. Oh what a fearful caſe is this, that when a mans body is ſo weak that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not riſe out of bed, yet his corruptions are ſo ſtrong, that they riſe in an uproar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Will, and Authority, and Juſtice of God!</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is an unjuſt judging of God: for whatever the murmurer pretends, his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel is againſt God, as the cauſe of his viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Perhaps in thy ſickneſs, thy diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſpirit flies out towards thy husband, wife, children, or ſervants which are about thee: but they may ſay with <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.8. <hi>What are we?</hi> (did we make thee ſick? are we the cauſes of thy aches and pains?) <hi>thy murmurings are not againſt us, but againſt the Lord:</hi> Nay, ſometimes the ſpirit riſeth ſo high, that it expreſly complains of God, as if the parties grieved would ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him, and call him to their bar, and be the judges of God and his diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo did the Iſraelites, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land?</hi>—Oh horrid pride and inſolencie! they challenge God as if he had wronged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them in bringing them from <hi>Egypt:</hi> Such men practice what <hi>Jobs</hi> wife tempted him unto in his ſickneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 2.9. <hi>Curſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:38419:73"/>
God and dye</hi>; they have curſed and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thoughts of God and his Providence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it appears that men do thus judge God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>That thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and be clear when tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> judgeſt;</hi> implying, that God is judged and condemned by wicked men; and therefore he is ſaid to juſtifie and clear himſelf: Oh thou proud worm, thou conceited clay, judge thy ſelf,<note place="margin">Job 33.13</note> and not God; for <hi>he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not account of any of his matters;</hi> and to be ſure <hi>he will overcome when he is judged.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.4.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A murmuring ſpirit makes his mercie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> little, and his afflictions great. This curſed property is ſeen in the Iſraelites; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their deliverance from <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſuch a Providence as God delights to be owned by: Hence he is ſo often called, <hi>The God that brought them out of the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>; and God chuſeth this as a fit preface to the Ten Commandments, as if it were a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon to all to worſhip and obey him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. yet how often did the diſcontented Jews upbraid God with that mercie?<note place="margin">Exod. 16.3. &amp; 17.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Would to God we had died in the land of Egypt! wherefore haſt thou brought us out of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:38419:73"/>
land of Egypt?</hi> Thus many in ſickneſs and pain forget the mercie of God in all the days of their health and life: in a few hours ſickneſs, they forget a whole age of rich mercie.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, diſcontent frets and diſquiets a mans ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.1. and therefore it hurts them more then the affliction; as if man have a cut, or wound in his fleſh, this will diſeaſe and trouble him: but if a fretting humour fall in the wound to vex and inflame it, this is far more hurtful and dangerous then the wound it ſelf: ſo thy ſickneſs muſt needs trouble thee; but if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy viſitation thy heart abound with proud and peeviſh humours, which makes thee fret againſt God; this makes thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition far more miſerable then the diſeaſe it ſelf would make it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, obſerve four Cauſes of Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ignorance of Gods dominion over his creatures: this is clear by the parable of the labourers in the Vineyard, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. where our Saviour doth ſilence the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers murmuring about their wages with this, <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?</hi> verſ. 15. implying, that if they had known and conſidered that it was his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:38419:74"/>
own, they would have found no cauſe to quarrel: So many murmure in their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſee worſe ſinners have their eaſe and health; but they do not conſider that their life, health, and bodies, are Gods own, and all diſeaſes are his own, and he ſends them to whom he will; and though others have more mercy, yet they have no wrong: do not you put your Oxen to labour, and after that to the ſlaughter? yet if any queſtion you for uſing the poor cattel ſo cruelly, you will not ſtick to tell them, Friends, we hurt nothing of yours, may we not do what we will with our own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sirs, God hath a greater right over you, then you have over your cattel; if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe you, and deſtroy you, he hurts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of yours; and therefore he may do what he will with his own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Diſcontent ariſeth from mens expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of ſettlement in the world; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they that truſt to <hi>vanity,</hi> ſhall be filled with vexation of ſpirit; for diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment always breeds diſcontent: as the Husbandman that dungs, and ploughs, and ſows his ground, if his expectation of a crop be too great, and he doth not conſider how many thouſand dangers may come between the Plough and the Sickle, but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:38419:74"/>
reckon aforehand of ſo many meaſures for his family, and ſo many to pay rent, and ſo many for ſeed: now if the crop fail at harveſt, here is a ſad repining and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: ſo if a mans expectation of the world is too high, and having heaped up riches, he begins to bleſs himſelf, ſaying, I have ſo much for a purchaſe, and ſo much for por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for my children; now if when he is juſt catching at them to uſe them,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.5.</note> 
                  <hi>they take themſelves wings and flie away</hi>; no marvel if they leave the owner murmuring at the Providence. When the Iſraelites were ſo miraculouſly ſaved from <hi>Egypt,</hi> they thought that deliverance had put a period to all their troubles; and therefore every croſs being a diſappointment, ſets them on murmuring: ſo they that promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves health, and eaſe, and plenty in the world, when ſickneſs and want comes, they preſently fret and complain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they that look and prepare for changes, live in a more compoſed and quiet frame; if mercie comes, they are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and if affliction comes, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>The third Cauſe of diſcontent is Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Hence the <hi>Iſraeliles</hi> murmure, becauſe they believed not the good report which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:38419:75"/>
                  <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> gave of the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> Numb. 14.11. <hi>How long will it be ere they believe me for all the ſignes which I have ſhewed among them?</hi> Sirs, an unbelieving heart is always a diſcontented heart; for an unbeliever hath nothing to ſtill and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et the heart with, in his afflictions: ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, every croſs takes away ſomething which did feed and pleaſe the heart, as health, riches, credit, pleaſures and friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now when theſe are loſt, a man doth, as it were, feel ſomething go out of his heart; but then faith fills, and ſtills the heart, by bringing into it God, and Chriſt, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>Why art thou diſquieted, O my ſoul! truſt ſtill in God,</hi> Pſal. 43.5. but now God, and Chriſt, and the promiſes, and heaven, are nothing to an unbeliever, and ſo yeild him no peace and comfort; therefore he muſt needs be <hi>like the troubled ſea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 57.20.</note> when the ſtorms and winds of affliction blow upon him, and he hath nothing to calm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his ſoul.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, diſcontent ariſeth from mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo very ſenſible of the evil of affliction, and ſenceleſs of the evil of ſin. Mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are tender, and their ſenſes quick, and therefore even the biting of a flea, the ſcratching of a Pin is preſently felt: and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:38419:75"/>
men are ſo tender of their reputation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and delights, that the leaſt touch in theſe is a croſs to them: but their hearts are ſo hard, and conſciences feared, that they can lye ſecurely under all the curſes of Gods book, and have mountains of wrath abide on them, and feel nothing; and therefore afflictions lye ſo heavie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin lyes ſo eaſie: Whereas, if a man knew what ſin is, and ſaw at night what wrath he had treaſured up all the day, he would rather wonder, that he were out of hell, then murmure that he were in trouble: this did ſilence the Church, when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the <hi>wormwood and the gall</hi>;<note place="margin">Lam 3.19, 22.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe knew that <hi>it was of the Lords mercies, that ſhe was not conſumed:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe pleads, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39. <hi>Wherefore doth a living man complain!</hi> A man that deſerves death and hell, cannot reaſonably complain if he be alive; as it is unreaſonable for a Thief that deſerves to be hanged, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain becauſe he is whipt: And then it is added, <hi>a man for the puniſhment of his ſin:</hi> Why ſhould a man complain of that which he hath brought upon himſelf? <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of this as very unequal, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.3. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of a man perverteth his way</hi>; that is, mans ſin brings him into trouble,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:38419:76"/>
                  <hi>and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord.</hi> Man is in all the fault, and he would have God to bear all the blame.</p>
               <p>In the next place, obſerve four ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this Sin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, murmuring debaſeth a man, by turning him into the likeneſs of the baſeſt creature: we have a remarkable Scripture for this, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. in the ſixth verſe; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith of his enemies, <hi>They return at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, they make a noiſe like a dog, and go round about the City</hi>; that is, they go about like the <hi>Devils beagles,</hi> hunting Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Well, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> verſ. 14. ſeeing they love the ſport ſo well, <hi>At evening let them return, and make a noiſe like a dog, and go round about the City</hi>; that is, let thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo afflict them, that they may like hungry and angry Curs go crying and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about the City: ſo that here the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of a man in trouble, is compared to the yelling of a dog; ſo this ſin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the roaring of Bears, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.11. <hi>We roar all like bears:</hi> and <hi>Zanchy</hi> obſerves, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> tranſlated <hi>murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> Phil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.14. ſignifies a noiſe like the <hi>grunting of a ſwine:</hi> nay, this ſin makes a man like the very Devil, who is a moſt reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and diſcontented ſpirit, and therefore is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:38419:76"/>
ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43. <hi>To walk about ſeeking reſt, and finding none.</hi> And it is true of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny on their ſick-beds, which we read, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>They have not cryed unto me, when they have howled</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> like beaſts) <hi>upon their beds.</hi> Now what a fearful caſe is this, that when in thy ſickneſs thou ſhouldſt have been full of the thoughts, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſavour of a Chriſtian, ſo as to be praying unto, and praiſing and pleaſing God, and ſaving, and edifying others, and quieting and ſolacing thy own ſoul, that thou ſhouldſt by murmuring and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, be yelling like a Dog, roaring like a Bear, howling like a Beaſt, grunting like a Swine, and be like a reſtleſs and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Devil!</p>
               <p>Secondly, diſcontent unfits the ſoul for every duty: you cannot indure to ſee your children go grumbling to meat, and grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to School, and grumbling to bed, and grumbling to ask you bleſſing: ſo it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provokes God to ſee people go murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to prayer, and murmuring to Sermons, and murmuring to Sacraments. Beloved, lay this up as a rule, and let it always reign in your hearts, <hi>viz. That a man can never go holily and comfortably to any duty, except his heart be reconciled to theſe three things;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:38419:77"/>
To God, to all men, and to all Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences:</hi> Therefore when a man is quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with God and men, and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at all Gods dealings; always either complaining that his mercies are too little, or his afflictions too great: how miſerably unfit is ſuch a man to look God in the face in any duty!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, murmurers are always miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to our Proverb, <hi>An angry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon never wants woe</hi>; as if a man that hath his body full of ſores, come in a crowd where he is always jogged and thruſt, this muſt needs hurt and vex his ſores. Beloved, a diſcontented ſpirit is a ſore ſpirit, and the leaſt touch of affliction doth vex it: and therefore for ſuch a man to live always in a croud of miſeries, wherewith he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually hurt and vext, this muſt needs be a miſerable man. It is obſervable, that God himſelf is ſet to croſs ſuch a man, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.27, 28. <hi>If ye walk contrary to me, I will walk contrary to you:</hi> As thus, God would have you to believe, love, fear, and pleaſe him: Now you walk contrary to God, you deny, hate, deſpiſe and provoke him: Well, you would have God to bleſs, preſerve, pardon and ſave you: Oh but God wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l walk contrary to you, he will curſe, deſtroy,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:38419:77"/>
and damn you: Now they cannot but be in an unquiet condition, who have God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf always croſſing and thwarting them. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.26. <hi>With the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward:</hi> If you will be croſs with God, he will be croſs with you: and therefore obſerve when you are diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſomething falls out from Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Servants or Neighbours, to exaſperate and fret you more: ſo that I ſay this ſin makes a man ſpend his days in bitterneſs and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, murmurers ſhall be judged at the laſt day as ungodly men, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 14, 15, 16. where we ſee, that when the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints, one great work of that day will be, to execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on ungodly <hi>murmurers and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> therefore as you fear the portion of murmurers then, do not live the life of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers now.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Doctrine reproves thoſe who are ſo ſtupid and ſenceleſs in their ſickneſs, as not to own the hand of Chriſt in their viſitation: for ſeeing all diſeaſes come from him, we are to receive them as the good meſſengers of Chriſt, ſaying with <hi>Naomi,</hi> Ruth 1.13. <hi>The hand of the Lord is gone out againſt me.</hi> This ſtupidity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:38419:78"/>
is that ſin whereby men ſlight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the judgments of God, ſo as neither to be affected in the ſenſe of their ſins, nor of Gods diſpleaſure for them: We have a clear inſtance of this ſin, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10.19. — <hi>I ſaid truly, This is my grief, and I muſt bear it.</hi> In the beginning of the verſe, the people ſadly bewail their preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: <hi>Woe is me for my hurt, my wound is grievous:</hi> now it aggravates their preſent miſery, to be upbraided with their former ſtupidity: <hi>I ſaid</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in my trouble here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore) <hi>truly this is my grief, and I muſt bear it off</hi> as well as I can; implying, that they formerly thought, that they could eaſily bear off the ſtrokes of God. We often hear the like confident language from many ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid ſinners on their ſick beds, ſaying, Indeed I am not well, I am ſomething out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but I will ſtrive with it, and hope to ſhake it off ſhortly, and ſo go on with my building, or trading, or purchaſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus uſually men flatter themſelves in their ſickneſs, talking as if they were but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to live, when perhaps they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die: theſe ſtrive <hi>to put far from them the evil day,</hi> Amos 6.3. Like thoſe who boaſted, that they <hi>had made a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell,</hi> Iſa. 28.15.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:38419:78"/>
as if they had made ſome bargain with Death and Hell, and had them in Bond and Covenant not to hurt them: this ſenſleſs ſpirit poſſeſt thoſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.25. This ſin is forbidden, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.11. <hi>My ſon, deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the Lord.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, it is a fearful thing to deſpiſe any affliction; perhaps yet it is but little, but it comes from a great God, and upon a great Errand: therefore remember, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.11. <hi>If his wrath be kindled but a little, bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider further the evil and danger of this ſin, in two particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It doth greatly provoke and call forth the wrath of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11. <hi>When thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee,</hi> they will take no notice of thy diſpleaſure; <hi>but they ſhall ſee:</hi> Oh then is the judgment of God fearful on the ungodly, when Gods wrath puts them paſt ſecurity, when the <hi>ſeared conſcience</hi> is turned into <hi>a gnawing conſcience:</hi> I tell thee, ſinner, if ſickneſs will not awaken thee, hell will. You know if a Father whip his Childe to humble and melt him, it cuts the very heart of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſee his Childe laugh in his face: So when God viſits a ſinner with ſickneſs, or other afflictions, if he ſcorn his Rod, it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:38419:79"/>
muſt needs be an unſpeakable provocation: for as it ſavours much of the ſpirit and grace of a Childe of God, to be ſuitably affected to the various manifeſtations of God, ſo that it is his moſt inward pleaſure to have God pleaſed, this <hi>puts gladneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heart,</hi> Pſal. 4.6, 7. and if God in diſpleaſure <hi>hide his face, he is troubled,</hi> Pſal. 30.7. ſo on the contrary, it is a ſign of a baſe ſpirit, when, as it is ſaid of <hi>Miriams</hi> diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Numbers 12.14.</note> 
                  <hi>God ſpits in his face,</hi> then to be ſo ſhameleſs and impudent, as if he could out-face the frowns of his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This ſpeaks a mans condition to be incurable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more:</hi> as if they were grown ſo deſperate, that corrections made them worſe. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this ſtupidity doth fruſtrate the end and uſe of Gods Viſitation; for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>hear the rod,</hi> if they do not <hi>feel the rod,</hi> becauſe the rod ſpeaks by its ſtrokes; therefore they loſe its teachings, when they do not feel it ſmart: the condition then of ſuch wretches muſt needs be hopeleſs, when they make Gods laſt remedy uſeleſs: as when a man is ſick, firſt you ſeek to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him by keeping him warm, and by wholeſome diet; if this fail, you ſend to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:38419:79"/>
the Phyſitian; but if the Phyſick do not ſtir the body, if he will not vomit, nor purge, nor bleed, then you look for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death: So when mercies will not melt, nor Sermons change a ſinner; and after all, God ſends ſickneſs, or other judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet theſe do not work, what remains but a fearful looking for of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgment? And now to conclude this, we may ſee the dreadful condition of ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſecure ſinners on their death-beds; they ſay they have made their peace with God, when it is but a peace with ſin, and an agreement with hell; and that they hope for ſalvation, when perhaps the <hi>Pulſe</hi> hath not many <hi>ſtrokes</hi> to beat, before they are ſure of damnation: yet they will go confidently with the fooliſh Virgins, as it were, to the door of heaven, till Chriſt tell them there to their faces,<note place="margin">Job 21.23</note> 
                  <hi>he knows them not</hi>; and thus they die, <hi>being wholly at eaſe and quiet:</hi> and carnal friends think they have made a comfortable end, when for my part I do not doubt to ſay, it is as comfortable to ſee men <hi>die drunk,</hi> as <hi>die ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, This doctrine reproves thoſe who in their diſeaſes truſt to Phyſitians for health: Diſeaſes (you ſee) are not at the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:38419:80"/>
command of Phyſitians, but of Chriſt. This was <hi>Aſa</hi> his ſin, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.12. in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe <hi>he ſought not to the Lord, but to the Phyſitians.</hi> His ſin was not in ſeeking to the Phyſitians, but in not ſeeking to the Lord. I know it is a great ſin, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Gods power, to be diſobedient to his will in deſpiſing Phyſick, which God hath ordained to be his means to reſtore us to health: this ſin is a tempting God, wherein we will try what God can do, and yet neglect what he commands; but we muſt uſe the Phyſitian, yet ſo, as to live by faith, and not by Phyſick: and therefore the rule is, to honour and uſe them as Gods Inſtruments, but not to put them in Gods place.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It reproves thoſe who uſurp Authority, and uſe their own power to hurt or diſeaſe the bodies of men; I mean not thoſe who have authority from God and man to execute bodily puniſhments, as Magiſtrates, Parents, Maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor would I abrogate the Law of ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the caſe of a violent and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable aſſault: but my aim is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thoſe of their ſin, who delight in quarrelling and fighting; who are ſaid to <hi>enter into contention,</hi> Prov. 18.6. who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:38419:80"/>
their callings to go to Cock-pits, Bear-baits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on purpoſe to quarrel and fight; and ſuch, who upon every little provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be at daggers drawing; no more with them, but <hi>a word and a blow, a lye and a ſtab</hi>; and ſuch <hi>mankeen beaſts,</hi> who delight to feed on the wounds and blood of men, accounting it a piece of gallantry and bravery to beat, hurt, wound and maim others. Now if all diſeaſes are at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, ſo that he bids them go, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then thou ſhouldſt not uſurp Chriſts Authority, to hurt or diſeaſe others. Now that you may for ever abhor and be afraid of this ſin, lay to heart theſe five Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This is a damnable ſin; without ſpeedy repentance, it will bring thee to hell: I ſay unto thee as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi> Acts 23.3. <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee, thou whited wall,</hi> for ſmiting thy brother: Oh look upon thoſe ſtrong arms and limbs burning with thy body and ſoul in hell! Oh conſider, what a poor credit it is to go va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly to hell! for this will be thy caſe: for if he that gives his brother but a foul word, be in danger of hell-fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. how much greater danger art thou in, who woundeſt and hurteſt that body which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:38419:81"/>
God hath bound thee upon pain of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the ſixth Commandment, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve!</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider what ſpirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in thee, when thou art fighting and quarrelling with others: I ſay to thee, as <hi>Job</hi> in another caſe to his friend, <hi>Job</hi> 26.4. <hi>Whoſe ſpirit came from thee?</hi> Is this the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, loving, humble, patient, meek, and peaceable ſpirit, which is ſo precious and ſavoury to God and men? Is this the way to pleaſe and honour the God of thy life, and limbs, and ſtrength, who ſtands by, and looks thee in the face, and ſees thee like a fool in thy rage? The Apoſtle clearly determines, that theſe <hi>fightings</hi> are fruits of your <hi>luſts, James</hi> 4.1. And is this thy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and gallantry, to fight ſo ſtoutly to fulfil a baſe luſt?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider how thou doſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by abuſe thy own body: Is thy body a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt, and thy hands and arms parts of Jeſus Chriſt? and wilt thou make a member of Chriſt a murderer?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider the perſon whom thou ſmiteſt; Is he not one towards whom thou ſhouldſt put on bowels of compaſſion, and whoſe ſalvation thou art bound to ſeek; and doſt thou think to bring him to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:38419:81"/>
by <hi>Club-law?</hi> Is he not fearfully and wonderfully made by God, in whoſe book all his members are written? and wilt thou by thy inhumane and mercileſs blows mar ſuch a choice piece of Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip? Is not, or may not his body be the <hi>Temple of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to ſerve God and his generation? and wilt thou by maiming and wounding him, make him leſs ſerviceable? Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is made after the Image of the Inviſible God; and I tell thee, in ſtriking him, thou doſt, as it were, ſtrike God in the face.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Conſider the many ſad and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequences of this ſin; it breeds ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and revenge, and cauſeth further quarrels and contentions among perſons and families; it begets many chargeable ſuits at Law, to the expence of thy precious time and Eſtate: beſides, men are hereby ſo fleſht with cruelty, and given to fight, that oftentimes the end of ſuch, is either to be killed or hang'd.</p>
               <p>Now for the defence of this curſed ſin, men uſually pretend theſe and ſuch-like Objections; which I ſhall briefly anſwer, and ſo proceed to other Uſes.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>Muſt I then be branded for a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:38419:82"/>
baſe Coward, in ſuffering every one to abuſe me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is a baſe Coward, that is ſo poor ſpirited as to ſerve a baſe luſt, and to be a ſlave to a conquered Devil; but he hath a Divine Spirit that will do the will of God, and rule his own ſpirit, and conquer himſelf: therefore ſhew thy courage, by ſetting all thy might againſt thy ſins. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> uſeth this ingenious art to divert the Chriſtians from beholding the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of cruelty in the Heatheniſh Games, by directing them to behold how grace doth conflict with, and conquer over ſin: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wantonneſs deſtroyed by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity; falſhood ſlain by faith; cruelty beaten by mercy; malapertneſs overcome by mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> &amp; tales ſunt apud nos agones, in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ipſi coronamur; <hi>and ſuch are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with us, in which we are crowned.</hi> De ſpectaculis, <hi>cap.</hi> 29.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:38419:83"/>Sixthly, This Doctrine reproves thoſe who threaten to do hurt and miſchief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others: This was <hi>Jezabels</hi> ſin, who threatned to ſlay <hi>Elijah,</hi> as he had cauſed <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets to be ſlain, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.2. <hi>So let the gods do to me, and more alſo, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them, by to morrow about this time.</hi> Thus <hi>Saul</hi> is ſaid <hi>to breath out threatnings and ſlaughter againſt the Diſciples of the Lord,</hi> Acts 9.1. and ſo thoſe bloody Jews <hi>bound themſelves under a curſe, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 23.12</note> And ſo many threaten others, that they will be even with them, that they will do them a miſhief, or that they will be the death of them: Now thou ſeeſt, that power to hurt, or diſeaſe, or any other way to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a man, belongs to Jeſus Chriſt; and what ground haſt thou to expect that Chriſt will exerciſe his power to fulfil thy luſts? beſides, this is a fearful curſe of God upon many, that they are ſo far left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to will, and intend, and threaten miſchief, and thereby bring guilt upon their own ſouls; and yet are never able to finiſh their ſin, ſo as to do the hurt they intend to others: and this is a very tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to many a malicious wretch, that he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:38419:84"/>
lives <hi>travelling with iniquity,</hi> and yet is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to bring it forth. Furthermore, how dareſt thou threaten to do a man hurt, when thou art bound to pray to God to do him good, yea, and to preſerve him from that very evil which thou threatneſt againſt him? Again, it often appears, that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the very ſame miſchief to thee, which thou intendeſt to others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.8. <hi>Let his net that he hath hid catch himſelf, into that very deſtruction let him fall.</hi> But to conclude this, conſider, that when many a man is threatning and deviſing miſchief to others, a diſeaſe from Chriſt doth ſuddenly take him and turn him to hell, before he can bring it to paſs.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It reproves the great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of ſuch who curſe others, by wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſes or other judgments upon them: We often hear ſuch horrible ſpeeches as theſe, A plague on him, a pox on him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if they, and not Chriſt, had power to command diſeaſes to go, and they will go; or as if the power of Jeſus Chriſt muſt be the ſervant and inſtrument of a proud, froward, and malicious heart: This ſin is forbidden to be uſed towards our worſt enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Bleſs them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you; bleſs, and curſe not:</hi> and it is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:38419:84"/>
made the ſigne of a graceleſs man, to have <hi>his mouth full of curſing,</hi> Rom. 3.14. for his heart is full of pride, malice, and anger, and theſe fill his mouth with curſing. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if thou curſe others, God will curſe thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.17, 18, 19. <hi>As he loved curſing, ſo let it come unto him.</hi> — Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider further, ſome will curſe their friends, their husbands, wives, or children; and ſometimes God hath puniſhed ſuch curſed ſpeeches in bringing their curſes to paſs. We read of a Mother that in a paſſion cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her Son thus: <hi>Get thee gone, I would thou mighteſt never come again alive:</hi> and the ſame day her Son went into the water, and was drowned: Another woman ſaid in her anger to her Childe, <hi>The Devil take thee</hi>; and preſently the poor childe was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the Devil. Theſe, and many more ſuch dreadful examples ſhould make all afraid of ſuch, or any other words of curſing. Conſider once more, that every man ſhould have his heart filled with love unto, and earneſt deſires of the good of all men, and ſhould be always in a frame to offer up theſe deſires in prayer to God: Now how contrary to this is that devilliſh ſpirit which inclines thee to hate and to curſe others! The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſets out
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:38419:85"/>
the great hypocriſie and wickedneſs of a man, who with the ſame tongue will bleſs God, and curſe men, <hi>James</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with bleſs we God, even the Father; and therewith curſe we men which are made after the ſimilitude of God. Out of the ſame mouth proceedeth bleſſing and curſing: My brethren, theſe things ought not ſo to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, This Doctrine reproves thoſe who haſten diſeaſes and death to themſelves by their own ſins: I may reaſon with ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Solomons</hi> words, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Be not over-much wicked, neither be thou foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; why ſhouldſt thou die before thy time?</hi> It is not meant the time abſolutely appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, for that cannot be prevented; but it's meant that time, which in the courſe of nature they might have proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lived unto; as a Lamp will burn till the Oyl be ſpent, but it may be quencht, or blown out ſooner: So in the courſe of nature, many a man might have proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lived many a year, but oftentimes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a ſudden blaſt of God, or by ſome diſeaſes which are bred by his own ſins, the lamp of his life is quickly blown out; and ſome of ſuch ſins I ſhall here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly reprove: I might inſtance in that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſin of ſelf-murder, which ordinarily
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:38419:85"/>
proceeds from pride, unbelief, revenge, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, diſcontent, or deſpair: when men cannot deſpite God and man enough by their lives, they will attempt to do it by their deaths, and will venture with their own hands to cut the thred of their own lives, and to looſe themſelves out of the troubles of earth into the torments of hell.</p>
               <p>I might alſo mention the horrid ſins of Treaſon, Murder, Witchcraft, Theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſins binde their bodies to the wrath and juſtice of men, and their ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the wrath and vengeance of God; Theſe ſins bring men to be hanged like dogs, becauſe they could not be contented to live like men. I ſhall inſtance in theſe five ſins which do provoke God to viſit men with diſeaſes, ſome of which do of their own nature bring men to untimely ſickneſs and death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Perſecution of Gods people: This is a ſin which doth not only bring everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damnation hereafter, but uſually it alſo brings ſome fearful judgments on the bodies and families of Perſecutors here. Hence we read, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 55.23. <hi>Bloody and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their daies.</hi> It would take up far more room
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38419:86"/>
then I can here ſpare, to inſtance in the fearful examples of Gods vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very bodies of the cruel enemies of Gods Church and people: whereby we might ſee, that all the cruelty which the moſt barbarous perſecutors have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to torment the Chriſtians with, hath not been comparable to thoſe torments wherewith God hath tortured their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with fearful and ſtrange diſeaſes. We read of that bloody <hi>Herod,</hi> who murdered the Infants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.16. that he was ſmitten by the hand of God with a moſt ſhameful and painful diſeaſe, ſo that his body boiled and burnt with heat, and his bowels were gnawn: he was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a ravenous and inſatiable appetite after meat: his privy parts were rotten, and full of filthy vermine: and after he had endured a while the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible pangs of a lingring death, he died in deſperate madneſs and miſery: See <hi>Euſebius Eccleſiaſtic. Hiſtor. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> amongſt other examples of the like kinde, reports, that one <hi>Claudius Herminianus</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> being enraged that his Wife was turned Chriſtian, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf, did exerciſe much cruelty
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:38419:86"/>
upon the precious Chriſtians; for which God did ſmite him with a fearful plague, wherewith after a while he was tormented, he dyed, <hi>ad Scapulam, cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Steven Gardiner,</hi> a bloudy butcher in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, hearing that Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> and Maſter <hi>Latimer</hi> were burned at <hi>Oxford,</hi> rejoyced greatly, and being at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ate his meat merrily; but whilſt the meat was in his mouth, the wrath of God came upon him, ſo that he was taken from his board to bed, where continuing fifteen days in intolerable anguiſh, by reaſon he could not expel his urine, his body being miſerably inflamed within, he was brought to a wretched end, with his tongue all black and ſwoln, hanging out of his blaſphemous mouth.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this, by warning all that either love their ſouls, lives, or poſterity, or country, to take heed of wronging the precious people of God, the truth is, the Nation, which perſecutors are a curſe unto, and the ſouls of perſecutors themſelves are dearer to godly Chriſtians, then all their own private intereſt which perſecution can take from them: and therefore I ſay to all malicious enemies, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid to <hi>Scapula,</hi> a Ruler in <hi>Carthage,</hi> and a cruel
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:38419:87"/>
enemy to Chriſtians. <hi>Parce tibi, ſi non nobis: parce</hi> Carthagini, <hi>ſi non tibi — Spare thy ſelf if thou wilt not ſpare us; ſpare</hi> Carthage, <hi>if thou wilt not ſpare thy ſelf.</hi> So I ſay, if ye will not ſpare the holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, ſpare your ſelves; if ye will not ſpare your ſelves, ſpare your families, ſpare your poor children; if you will not ſpare your families, ſpare the precious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſpare <hi>London,</hi> ſpare <hi>England</hi>; for you ſwallow up all, by ſwallowing up Gods people.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſin which I ſhall here reprove, is unworthy receiving the Lords Supper. God often puniſheth this ſin with bodily diſeaſes. Hence we read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep:</hi> Now that you may know the evil and danger of this ſin, I ſhall ſhew you what it is to eat and drink the Lords Supper unworthily: A man eats and drinks the Lords Supper unworthily, when he is without the gracious qualifications which make the heart fit, and meet, and agreeable to this bleſſed Ordinance. The beſt way to underſtand this, is to conſider what is in the Ordinance, and what is in the heart; and then by comparing them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſee whether they do meet and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:38419:87"/>
as for example, in the Lords Supper Jeſus Chriſt crucified, with all the bleſſings of the Goſpel are ſhewed forth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. well, and there is a Believer who by faith ſees and diſcerns the Lords Body, as it is ſet forth therein: now ſuch a heart and the ordinance do meet; the heart agrees, and is ſuitable to the ordinance, and ſo is fit, and worthy to receive it; but on the other hand, here is a dead unbelieving ſinner that hath no principle or faculty to diſcern Jeſus Chriſt, or to receive him as hereby offered; therefore he comes unworthily, he is not fit; for his heart and the ordinance do not agree, but he is like a blinde man before the moſt glorious ſhew. Again, here is ſpiritual food, meat indeed, and drink indeed, to feed and ſatisfie a ſoul, with grace, and pardon, and ſalvation: Well, and here is a poor ſoul hungring and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this very food. Now ſuch a man is fit, and comes like a hungry man to a good and wholeſome feaſt; but here is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother dead ſinner that ſees and feels his want of nothing, and ſo is no more fit and meet for ſuch an ordinance, then a man that lyes dead in a Coffin is to eat the bread and wine which is dealt at his funeral: nay, further, you may ſee the unworthineſs of a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:38419:88"/>
wicked man, in that his heart is againſt the Lords Supper; as a man is very unfit for a feaſt, when he loaths, and his ſtomack doth riſe againſt every diſh on the table, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the company: So, my Brethren, a man is very unfit for the Lords Supper, when his heart hates and riſeth againſt Chriſt, and againſt holineſs, againſt all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians. Sirs, here is ſet before us that which condemns all ſins, and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the greateſt ſtrictneſs and holineſs: ſo that to be ſure the man that hates Chriſt in a Miniſter, or in a Chriſtian, cannot but hate him in the Lords Supper. Well, you ſee who are unworthy, and who by this ſin bring diſeaſes and other judgements of God upon themſelves in this life, and alſo damnation on their bodies and ſouls in the life to come. I might here alſo tell you, that the godly themſelves, for want of the preſent exerciſe of grace ſuitable to this Ordinance, may bring diſeaſes and death upon themſelves; for as Chriſt with all his benefits is herein actually ſet forth, ſo grace ſhould actually come forth to meet him, to take, receive, and enjoy him; as when a feaſt is ready dreſt and diſht up, thoſe that are fit gueſts muſt not onely have life and ſtomachs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they muſt alſo actually
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:38419:88"/>
eat and drink. The application is eaſie: I ſhall therefore conclude this reproof in ſeriouſly warning all to take heed of unworthy, receiving the Lords Supper: would any man eat that which he knows would breed the Peſtilence, or the Fever, or the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie? Why, Chriſt tells you, if you come unworthily, <hi>you eat and drink judgement to your ſelves:</hi> And certainly, though the food be precious and wholeſome, and it is your duty to receive it worthily; yet by unworthy receiving, you do that which may bring the Plague, Pox, Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and without ſound repentance will bring damnation upon your bodies and ſouls for ever.</p>
               <p>The third ſin to be here reproved, is <hi>nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlineſs:</hi> this is a ſin whereby men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain from themſelves the lawful uſe of the creature; they have not hearts to take and uſe the creatures to thoſe ends which God hath made them good for, but baſely defraud their own backs and bellies, by grudging themſelves the meat, drink, clothes, recreations, phyſick, which nature requires, and God allows: The word ſpeaks expreſly againſt this ſin, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.12. ſuch men play the thieves, in robbing God of the honour, and themſelves of the uſe

                  </gap> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Whoredom and wine, and new wine take away the heart.</hi> This is given as one reaſon of the peoples wickedneſs mentioned in this Chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo beſotted with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and whoredom, which ſins took away all knowledge and wiſdom from them. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ebrietas eſt blandus dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, quam qui habet, ſeipſum non habet; Drunkenneſs is a flattering Devil, which he that hath, hath not himſelf.</hi> Drunkenneſs is <hi>voluntaria inſania, wilful madneſs,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks: A Drunkard, though at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times he may be learned, yet now he can neither underſtand, diſcourſe, ſee, go,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:38419:89"/>
ride, nor do any buſineſs as becomes a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man: look on a drunkard, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, yonder goes one with the immortal ſoul and precious body of a man; yonder ſtaring eyes, ſtammering tongue, ſtaggering limbs, would, if they were filled with the Spirit, be precious inſtruments to honour God, and become bleſſings to man; but what a beaſtly creature is he made by this filthy ſin!</p>
               <p n="2">2. A drunkard is unfit for any employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is good for nothing: Who will venture his buſineſs with a drunken Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? or his life with a drunken Phyſician? or his ſoul with a drunken Miniſter? how many thouſand of mens lives have been loſt by drunken ſouldiers? Whatever a mans eſtate be, he may be cheated of all when he is drunk.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A drunkard is unfit for all ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that for divers reaſons: I ſhall mention but this one, <hi>viz.</hi> a man cannot commit a ſecret to a drunkard; who will chuſe ſuch a friend to whom a man can ſpeak nothing, but what he will have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in every Alehouſe or Tavern in the Country? Now what ever a man ſays to a drunkard, no body knows but that the next time he is drunk, he will tell all.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:38419:90"/>4. Drunkenneſs betrays a man to all ſin: for a man at the beſt is full of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Sin: Now drunkenneſs is apt to ſet all a work, and leaves a man incapable of many reſtraints which might be uſed to a ſober perſon; who knows what a man full of ſin may do in his drunken mood, when he hath neither grace, nor reaſon, nor counſel of others, nor fear, nor ſhame to reſtrain him? and therefore what hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſins are committed in drunkenneſs! ſwearing, curſing, whoring, fighting; yea, and murdering alſo. <hi>Clitus</hi> was a dear and faithful friend to <hi>Alexander,</hi> yet <hi>Alexander</hi> murders him when he was drunk, though he was ready to kill himſelf for it when he was ſober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reports, that a ſon of one in <hi>Hippo,</hi> who was too much cockered by his Father, came home drunk, in which ſin he would have raviſhed one of his Siſters, ſlew his Father, and wounded to death two of his other Siſters.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, drunkenneſs ſhuts a man out of heaven, and by untimely ſickneſſes and death haſtens him to hell. The Apoſtle aſſures us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. that no drunkards <hi>ſhall inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> Oh what a fearful ſin is this! it hurries a man into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:38419:90"/>
and ſinks him into hell when he comes there: drunkenneſs is a ſin which of its own nature breeds Dropſies, Conſumptions, and other diſeaſes, as we read, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The Princes makes themſelves ſick with bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of wine</hi>; and daily examples witneſs the ſudden and untimely death of many drunkards: It is reported of one, that when he was drunk, as he was getting up on his Mare, he ſaid in a drunken frolick, that his Mare would carry him to the Devil; and his Mare threw him down and broke his neck.

               <p>This Doctrine is a great ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all the children of God, whereby they may ſee that all ſickneſſes, dangers, and deaths come through the hands of their own father: for it is a moſt certain way of comfort to the godly in any ſickneſs, to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:38419:91"/>
bring their hearts to the firſt Cauſe and Author of their Viſitation; for if they are at peace with him, they will be ſure to finde peace and comfort in their affliction. Hence the Apoſtle teacheth us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>Be careful for nothing</hi> (that is, do not torture, and diſtract, and break your hearts with ſinful cares and fears) <hi>but in every thing by prayer and ſupplication with thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, let your requeſts be made known unto God:</hi> (bring your hearts and deſires unto him) <hi>And the peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts and mindes through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Perhaps thou haſt nothing to keep thy eſtate from loſs, nor thy body from aches and pains, nor thy name from reproach, nor thy life from death. But however, thou ſhalt have the peace of God to keep thy heart full of grace and comfort through Chriſt Jeſus; and if the heart be thus kept, the bleſſing and comfort of all is kept in it; for in this caſe thou mayſt loſe friends out of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, riches out of thy eſtate, health and eaſe out of thy body, and yet thou mayſt keep the peace and comfort of all in thy heart.</p>
               <p>Now that your hearts may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with this Doctrine, I ſhall ſhew
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:38419:92"/>
herein theſe five grounds of comfort.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the ſeaſon of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. 2. Of the end. 3. In reſpect of the godly themſelves who are viſited, 4. In reſpect of death. Laſtly, in reſpect of the day of judgement.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the ſeaſon of our Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we may be aſſured that Jeſus Chriſt will chuſe the beſt and fitteſt ſeaſon to viſit us in. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Wherein ye great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoyce, though now for a ſeaſon (if need be) ye are in heavineſs through manifold tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations:</hi> This is an argument of comfort, that our afflictions come in a ſeaſon when we have moſt need of them. Husbandmen know that there is a ſeaſon when the ground hath need of froſt and ſnow; and parents know that there is a ſeaſon when their children have need of the rod: And ſo there are ſeaſons, wherein we that are <hi>Gods husbandry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cor. 3.9.</note> and Gods children, have need of his fatherly chaſtiſements; and in theſe times he chuſeth to viſit us.</p>
               <p>I ſhall contract all that I will ſay of this, in the application of a general truth to this particular caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the time and ſeaſon of Gods remarkable Providence, is called the <hi>fulneſs of time</hi> in Scripture: So we read, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>When the fulneſs of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:38419:92"/>
time was come, God ſent forth his Son</hi> — ſo that place ſeems ſomething pertinent to our purpoſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. <hi>That in the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</hi> Where note, that this is the great and myſterious work of God, to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one full body all his Elect, that thoſe which are already in heaven, with thoſe who are to be gathered out of the world, may all meet in Chriſt their Head; and ſo be the <hi>fulneſs of him that fills all in all:</hi> Now this work is ſaid to be done <hi>in the fulneſs of time:</hi> So that this is the glorious work which God is carrying on by ordinances, mercies, afflictions, diſeaſes, death; he is gathering all his people together, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into a body unto their head; and, I ſay, this is all done in the fulneſs of time.</p>
               <p>Now there are two things which make a fulneſs of time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When it's a time ſet and appointed by God for ſuch a diſpenſation; a time full of the Decree and Counſel of God, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Decrees are fulfill'd: So the coming of Chriſt was in the fulneſs of time, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time ſet by God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:38419:93"/>2. When time is fitted and prepared for ſuch a work; in which reſpect alſo Chriſt came in the fulneſs of time: time had been travelling, as it were, for this many ages: Propheſies, and promiſes, and the faith and expectation of Believers were full of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo the time being fitted for his coming, he comes in the <hi>fulneſs of time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to apply this to the caſe in hand; whenever ſickneſs or death comes, it is in the fulneſs of time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that time which is ſet by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and counſel of our Father, for the good of his children; he ſet the time of thy birth, and of thy new birth: ſo he hath appointed the time of thy viſitation, and of thy death; which are all times appointed to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and glorifie his infinite power and love towards thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They come in a time moſt fit for ſuch a work. Sin grows to ſuch an head, that it's time for ſickneſs, or ſome other affliction to come and bring it down: Grace grows to ſuch a ſtrength, that now it's able to bear a trial: a ſtorm is ready to fall; therefore, ſaith God, now it's to time to fetch my childe home: The Chriſtian is grown ſo ripe, that it's
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:38419:93"/>
time to bring him to heaven, as a <hi>ſhock of corn in its ſeaſon.</hi> Thus you ſee for your comfort, that ſickneſs and death come from Chriſt in the beſt and fitteſt ſeaſon: Sickneſs never comes, but to bring thee nearer heaven; and Death ſhall never come, but to looſe thee into heaven. Ah Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an! heaven and happineſs never come out of ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Comfort, in reſpect of the end of all ſickneſſes and death; they come from Jeſus Chriſt for our good. We read, 2 Cor. 4.17. <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory:</hi> where we ſee, that in all our afflictions there is a ſecret Power working us to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and ſalvation. As for example, in a Fever, Ague, or Conſumption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we feel a Power working outwardly againſt us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our health, ſtrength, caſe, and life; ſo there is a mighty Power working in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly for us, working us from ſin and the world, to God, and Chriſt, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Hence is that known and tryed Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I ſay, it's a <hi>tryed Scripture,</hi> it hath comforted many thouſand hearts, I mean Rom. 8.28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:38419:94"/>
them who are called according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi> Methinks this Scripture is a Spring which always runs with new and freſh comfort; and it's a ſure way to finde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to look upon all our diſeaſes, and other afflictions, through this Scripture. Now to apply the comfort of it to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, conſider what is that good which all things work together for; and this you may know by the following verſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Apoſtle demonſtrates this truth, <hi>That all things work together for our good:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, verſ. 31. <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things? If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> that is, let us look upon all our afflictions and miſeries, and then look upon our Predeſtination, Vocation, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Glorification, mentioned verſ. 29, 30. And we may joyfully conclude, that ſeeing God is for us, ſo as to predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, call, juſtifie, and glorifie us; and theſe links can never be broken; then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be againſt us, but all ſhall work for our good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that the great good that all things work for, is not to make the godly the great Gallants of the world, but to bring them grace and peace here, and glory hereafter: and all ſickneſſes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and deaths, and all other diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:38419:94"/>
are united and joyned together in this work, to bring Soul-ſaving good to them that love God. And the clear cauſe of this is in the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath the working of all theſe things; he ſends, and rules, and governs them: and therefore there muſt needs be a Fatherly work in them, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt, as our Father and Saviour, ſends them to us, and orders them for us: That of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes clearly for this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Death is yours:</hi> and by the ſame rule, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ours, and for our good. But why ours? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe the Lord of ſickneſs and death is ours. Hence we read, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. <hi>To die is gain.</hi> Sickneſs is gain, and death is gain to Gods Children. Many a Childe of God gains more by a moneths ſickneſs, then by the outward mercies of many years; and death will bring you more gain in one hour, then all the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Sacraments, and Sermons of a whole age: and therefore labour to ſee your gains as real and preſent to the eye of Faith, as your pains, troubles and loſſes are to the eye of Senſe: and in your ſad parting with thoſe things which ſickneſs and death take you from, comfort your hearts with thoſe things which they bring
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:38419:95"/>

Farewel my inward and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friends; farewel my dear <hi>Jonathans! How pleaſant have you been to me!

               <p>Farewel my poor, but precious body! go thou <hi>and ſleep in Jeſus</hi> in the earth, whilſt my Soul is raigning with Jeſus in heaven, where I ſhall remember thee, and long to ſee thee, till I meet thee again cloathed with Immortality and Glory. Theſe things, Chriſtians, are the comforts of a ſick-bed, the ſweet joys of a death-bed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Comfort, in reſpect of the godly who are viſited: Herein is thy comfort, that thou art a true part and member of Jeſus Chriſt, from whom all diſeaſes come; ſo that whatſoever Chriſt doth to thee, he doth to himſelf: <hi>I was ſick,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, when his members were ſick, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.36. So when the body is dead, the poor ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corpſe continues ſtill joyned and united
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:38419:96"/>
to Jeſus Chriſt. Hence the bodies of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ſaid to <hi>ſleep in Jeſus,</hi> and are called <hi>the dead in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.14, 16. and it's a moſt ſweet and ſavoury conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when a man looks on ſuch a ſad ſpectacle as a loathſome diſeaſed body, or thinks on the rotten carkaſs when the body is dead and <hi>ſown in corruption,</hi> then to fix the eye of Faith upon his glorious head, at the right hand of the Father: As thus; look on thy face covered with the Small Pox, and then look on the Face of Jeſus Chriſt: look on thy bones ſtaring upon thee in a Conſumption, and then look upon the glory and beauty of Jeſus Chriſt. Nay, go further, look upon thy ſelf as it were in the grave, and ſee thy ghaſtly skull lying in the duſt among the worms of the earth, and then look on thy glorious Head in Heaven: and ſo comfort thy ſelf with this, that as vile and loathſome a ſpectacle as thy diſeaſed body is now, and thy dead body will be ſhortly, yet it is a precious member of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who will by his infinite power, change and faſhion this contemptible duſt <hi>into the likeneſs of his glorious body</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.21.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Comfort, in reſpect of death; it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:38419:96"/>
comes to the godly without <hi>a ſting:</hi> In this we are taught to triumph, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting?</hi> — Now to clear up your comfort in this, conſider, that ſickneſs and death are ſaid to ſting, when God as a revenging Judge ſends them to execute the curſe of the law for ſin; ſo that death is compared to a fearful Serpent, which kills and devours all the men and women in the world: And, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the ſting</hi> of this Serpent <hi>Death, is ſin</hi>; it's ſin that makes the ſting; and then he adds, <hi>the ſtrength of ſin is the law:</hi> The ſtrength that ſin hath to ſting, is from the curſe of the Law, and the Law hath its ſtrength and power from the wrath of God; for <hi>the law worketh wrath,</hi> Rom. 4.15. So that by all you ſee, that by the ſting of death is meant the dreadful torments of hell, which at death come from the wrath of God through the curſe of the Law for ſin.

of offending his Landlord: for, ſaith he, I live under him, I am at his mercie, he can keep me in, and turn me out of my living when he will. Beloved, if we knew the power of Chriſt, as well as we do the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Landlord; and were as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of hell, as we are of looſing our livings, the ſame reaſon would prevail with us to be afraid of offending him; for we live at his mercie, and life and death is at his Will: let me therefore warn you, as God did the Iſraelites, ſpeaking to them of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.21. <hi>Beware of him, and obey his voice; provoke him not, for</hi> (if you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in your ſins) <hi>he will not pardon your tranſgreſſions: for my Name is in him.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground we are required to fear him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. <hi>He will break his enemies with a rod of iron, and daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel:</hi> Therefore it is made the wiſdom of Kings and Judges of the earth, <hi>to ſerve the Lord with fear.</hi> It is very obſervable, that as Gods Attributes give being and life to a Chriſtians graces; ſo a Chriſtians Graces bring glory to Gods Attributes: as for example, the Power and Truth of God cauſeth Faith, and the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God cauſeth Love, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God cauſeth Fear in the hearts of

the godly: So God hath a peculiar name of praiſe and glory from the graces of his people; becauſe of their faith and hope in him, he is called the truſt, and confidence, and hope of his people; and becauſe of their delight in him, he is called the ſong and joy of his people; and becauſe of their awe and dread of him, he is called the fear of his people, <hi>the fear of Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 31.42. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi> We have a ſpecial inſtance of this in <hi>Job,</hi> cap. 31. in which Chapter <hi>Job</hi> by many ſolemn proteſtations and ſerious impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aſſerts his innocencie in ſeveral duties, as in chaſtity, equity to his ſervants, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now he clears himſelf, that the reaſon of his integrity in theſe things, was not becauſe he was afraid of ever a man alive.

And then on the other hand
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:38419:105"/>
he may look in himſelf, and ſee all the powers of his body and ſoul united in this great deſigne to pleaſe, and praiſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God. So that by theſe things you may learn what it is to be at peace with God: whereby you may alſo ſee what is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity betwixt God and a ſinner; it is that whereby a ſinner is againſt God, ſo as to be fearfully bent to hate, and deny, and deſpite him; and God is againſt the ſinner, ſo as to blaſt, and curſe, and damn him; ſo that this is thy caſe, ſinner, if thou art not at peace with God, all manner of diſeaſes, and all kindes of deaths and dangers, yea, and all the curſes of the Bible are againſt thee, becauſe the God of all theſe is againſt thee. I would therefore ſeriouſly perſwade you to come to agreement with God; which that you may do, let me tell you, that I am this day ſent as an Embaſſador of peace from the Lord of life and death, who <hi>hath committed to me the word of reconciliation</hi>:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> So that I have authority from him to offer moſt bleſſed conditions of peace, <hi>viz.</hi> if you will this day ſincerely turn from ſin to God, and truely receive Jeſus Chriſt as he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Goſpel, you ſhall have the great God to be your Father, his onely begotten Son, the true God, to be your Husband and

Saviour, the infinite and bleſſed Spirit to be your Comforter; you ſhall have grace and peace to abide with you here, and an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom of glory to poſſeſs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy hereafter. Sirs, are not theſe bleſſed and honourable terms? Well, where lyes the difference? <hi>Anſw.</hi> In nothing but ſin: Now what a fearful caſe is this, that after God the Father hath ſent his onely begotten Son, and after he hath dyed the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, painful, and accurſed death of the Croſs, and after ſo many hundred Sermons and offers of peace; Wilt thou now break with God for a baſe luſt? canſt thou indure hereafter to lye among the Devils and damned in everlaſting burnings; and to ſee <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; and hear thy own conſcience upbraiding thee to all eternity, that thou haſt loſt heaven, and doſt lye in hell for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy cups, oaths, whores, or the duſt of the earth, better then Jeſus Chriſt? O Sirs, repent and believe quickly; you have more need to do it, then either to eat, drink or ſleep: for ought you know, you may be in hell before ſuch another offer be made. I am ſure there are millions of diſeaſes and deaths waiting at your doors to break up the treaty: I ſhall therefore conclude this in

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, prize and improve godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people, whilſt you have them, ſeeing it appears by this Doctrine, that you know not how ſoon they may be ſent for to heaven, where I am ſure they will be better reſpected. Now the greateſt honour that you can ſhew to godly Miniſters, is, to <hi>be doers of the Word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1.22.</note> which they are Preachers of. Miniſters are more honoured by the converſion, though of the pooreſt ſervants, then by the higheſt commendations, which the moſt able and learned Doctors are able to expreſs: for this is their greateſt glory, to be inſtruments of Gods glory in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of poor ſouls; for thereby the Word of God <hi>is glorified,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.1. By the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of men, Miniſters may be cryed up for perſons of excellent gifts and parts; but this is their greateſt glory, when by the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſouls,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>the excellencie of the power
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:38419:106"/>
appears to be of God, and not of men.</hi> But Beloved, the ignorant unbelieving world knows not the worth of godly Miniſters or Chriſtians, becauſe they ſee not the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of God, and Chriſt, and Holineſs, and Heaven, which are the cauſes which make them ſo precious: <hi>The world knoweth us not, becauſe it knew him not,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1. But whatever the men of the world think, who can prize nothing but honours, and riches, and pleaſures, to which they ſhould be dead and crucified; I tell you, godly Miniſters and Chriſtians are the bleſſings of their age; and thoſe are the beſt Kingdoms, and Countries, and Towns, and Pariſhes, and Families, which have moſt of them, and which love them beſt. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.11. <hi>The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life.</hi> I need not tell you what a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary publick mercy, a well of good and wholeſome water is to the Town or Family where it ſprings: Now a righteous man is a Well of Life; he is a ſpring of ſpiritual <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua vitae:</hi> Many a poor ſinner, or ſad ſwound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian, receives the ſpiritual life of grace, and ſtrength, and comfort from the mouth of a godly Miniſter or Chriſtian, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.4. <hi>A wholeſome tongue is a tree of life:</hi> It's a Metaphor taken from the Tree of Life in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:38419:107"/>
Paradiſe, which was Gods Ordinance to preſerve man alive, had he continued in innocencie. Thus a godly man is a tree of life in this evil world; he turns a Family into a Paradiſe where he grows, and is prized: ſo that many a man who was dead in ſin, and many a fainting childe of God, is quickned and revived by feeding on the fruit of <hi>his wholeſome tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now my Brethren, the ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that theſe bleſſings are by ſickneſs and death ready to be taken from us, ſhould cauſe us to eſteem and improve their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and ſavoury company. How did <hi>Eliſha</hi> cleave to <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he knew he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be taken from him! and therefore we finde, that three times <hi>Elijah</hi> (to try <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> his conſtancie) ſeemed to ſhake him off: but <hi>Eliſha</hi> every time anſwers moſt ſolemnly, <hi>As the Lord liveth, and as thy ſoul liveth, I will not leave thee,</hi> 2 Kin. 2.2, 3, 6. and if you read the ſtory, you will finde that it proved well for <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that he was ſo wiſe and careful to improve that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opportunity. See <hi>Acts</hi> 20.25. where <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth this Argument to preſs his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing exhortation: <hi>And now behold, I know that you all among whom I have gone preaching the kindom of God, ſhall ſee my face
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:38419:107"/>
no more.</hi> Oh people, honour your Miniſters; children, be inſtructed by your Parents whilſt you have them; for ſhortly you muſt ſee their faces no more. Chriſtians, <hi>exhort one another daily, whilſt it is called to day:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 3.13.</note> For yet a little while, and you ſhall ſee one anothers faces no more. We finde that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> to thoſe great and neceſſary duties mentioned 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 5. he preſſeth all with this melting motive, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand:</hi> as if he had ſaid, My dear ſon <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> I am not like to counſel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thee long; therefore hearken to the counſel of thy dying father <hi>Paul: Preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon,</hi> &amp;c. Sirs, look upon your Miniſters as dying Miniſters, and your Friends as dying Friends; and labour to draw from theſe wells of life whilſt they live; for you little know what a loſs you will have of them when they dye.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, believe and improve thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes which God hath made for the preſervation of your health and lives; and in the uſe of means, live by faith and prayer upon thoſe gracious promiſes. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.1, 2, 7, 8. <hi>My ſon, forget not my law,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:38419:108"/>
but let thy heart keep my commandments. For length of days, and long life, and peace ſhall they add unto thee,</hi> verſ. 7, 8. <hi>Fear the Lord, and depart from evil: It ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</hi> See alſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.20, 21, 22. <hi>Job</hi> 33.25. <hi>His fleſh ſhall be freſher then a childes, he ſhall return to the days of his youth.</hi> Hence we often ſee, that when a mans body is withered by ſickneſs, and baked like a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherd, he is reſtored by the bleſſing of God to ſuch a good conſtitution and temper, that his body becomes freſh like the fleſh of a childe: This is elegantly expreſſed by <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 103.5. <hi>Who ſatisfieth thy mouth with good things, ſo that thy youth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed like the Eagles.</hi> Some ſay that the Eagles at every ten years end caſt off their old Feathers, and are quickly cloathed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with new, as if they began to be young again, and ſo live till they be an hundred years old.</p>
               <p>Some alſo write of this property in the Eagles, that when by reaſon of old age, they have the upper part of their Bills bending down ſo far below the lower, that they are ſcarce able to feed, and ſo lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh with hunger, that then they break their beaks upon a rock, whereby being
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:38419:108"/>
able to feed, they grow to their former ſtrength; to which the tranſlation in the ſinging <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſeems to allude:
<q>
                     <l>Like as the Eagle caſts her bill,</l>
                     <l>Whereby her age renew'th.</l>
                  </q>
Whether theſe, and many other ſuch rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the wonderful properties of the Eagles be true, is uncertain; yet it's gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received, that they are Birds long-lived, and for many years continue ſo health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they ſeem to grow young again. And thus God often bleſſeth men with health, and ſtrength, and long life, that their ſtrength is renewed like the Eagles: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that which we read of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that when he was an hundred and twenty years old, <hi>his eye was not dim,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 34.7.</note> 
                  <hi>nor his natural force abated</hi>; yet we often ſee many live to a great age, with their health, and ſtrength, and parts through Gods mercie continued youthful and freſh to them. Now Sirs, lay up theſe promiſes in your hearts, and improve them by faith and prayer; ſo they may be the better to you then the wholeſomeſt dyet, or beſt phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in the world.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, uſe the means of health and life
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:38419:109"/>
ſo, as that the God of life may bleſs you in the uſe of them: for this purpoſe, make conſcience of theſe four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of your food: It is God that gives a bleſſing to this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.25. <hi>He ſhall bleſs thy bread and thy water, and I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſickneſs from the midſt of thee.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>pulſe and water</hi> with Gods bleſſing, made thoſe conſcientious Saints look and like better then others that were fed with royal dainties, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.15. Take then your food, as it were, out of the hands of God, <hi>who openeth his hand, and ſatisfieth the deſire of every living thing,</hi> Pſal. 145.16. and eat, and drink, as thoſe that ſee a preſence of God at your table: <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Ye ſhall eat before the Lord your God:</hi> eat as thoſe that therein ſeek to pleaſe and honour God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. <hi>He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, and giveth God thanks.</hi> I know theſe Scriptures intend particular occaſions of eating; yet they hold out upon the ſame reaſon our duty to eat and drink ſo, as to do the will of God, and to bring glory to him, according to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye eat, or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God:</hi> as God turns all to a Chriſtians good, ſo it's the admirable property of grace to turn all to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:38419:109"/>
A gracious heart can feed upon the goodneſs of God in, and bring glory to God out of every morſel of meat that comes into his mouth. <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives a very ſavoury relation of the Feaſts of the primitive Chriſtians: <hi>Before</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they ſit down to taſte their meat, they firſt taſte of prayer to God; they eat ſo much as hunger requires, and drink no more then is profitable for chaſte and ſober perſons; they are ſo filled, as thereby fitted to worſhip God in the night; they diſcourſe at meat, as thoſe that know that God hears them: and as they began, ſo they conclude the meal with prayer; and ſo they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, not as if they fed onely upon meat, but alſo upon diſcipline and inſtruction.</hi> I refer the learned Reader to his own words, <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. cap.</hi> 39. here is a moſt gracious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, worthy of the imitation of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>Secondly, make Conſcience of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; let it be ſuch as becomes a holy, chaſte, humble member of Chriſt, and not a proud, vain, wanton limb of the Devil; let your garments be both wholeſome and comely; neither ſo immodeſt as to diſhonour the Goſpel of Chriſt, nor ſordid as to diſgrace the Body of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, make Conſcience of lawful and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:38419:110"/>
ſeaſonable recreations: Theſe are healthful for our bodies, and when uſed in the fear, and according to the Will of God, do very much fit us for the moſt inward communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of one kinde of labour, is true of others, that it is a weakneſs and <hi>wearineſs to the fleſh,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.12. For as it weakens a bow to keep it always bent, and mars the ſtrings of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to keep them always ſtretcht; ſo it weakens the body to keep it too long bent to one imployment; therefore it is Gods will that it ſhould be remitted to its harmleſs, inoffenſive, and honeſt recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, make Conſcience of the duties of your relations, ſo that you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and revive, and not diſeaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another; our health and life doth much depend under God upon our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>You therefore that are parents, do not ſpend your childrens bread in whoredom, drunkenneſs, idleneſs and revenge: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parents finde their luſts more charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then their children: It is very ſad that children may cry out, We might have had better education, better trades, better por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions better health, had not our mercileſs
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:38419:110"/>
Parents loved their ſins better then their children.</p>
               <p>You that are children, make not your parents lives miſerable, who have been a means of life to you: be not ſuch fooliſh children, as to be <hi>the heavineſs</hi> of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.1.</p>
               <p>Husbands, <hi>Nouriſh and cheriſh your own fleſh,</hi> Eph. 5.29. Make not proviſion for your luſts, with that which ſhould make proviſion for your wives.</p>
               <p>Wives, do your Husbands <hi>good, and not evil, all the daies of your lives,</hi> Prov. 31.12. labour to be their Comfort,<note place="margin">Prov. 12.4.</note> and Crown, and not <hi>as rottenneſs in their bones.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="1">1. The principal efficient cauſe which makes this great preparation in us, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt. Hence Chriſt is called, <hi>The Author and finiſher of our faith,</hi> Heb. 12.12. Where Jeſus Chriſt begins a work of grace and ſalvation in a ſoul, he never leaves it till he hath finiſhed it, and made it up for heaven: therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Being conſident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it,</hi> or finiſh it <hi>till the day of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; that is, till the day of death, and of judgment: ſo that this is the great work of Jeſus Chriſt in every true believer, to fit him, and make him ready for ſickneſs, and death, and the day of judgment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is the ſubject of this work, or the perſon prepared, <hi>viz.</hi> every true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who is <hi>a veſſel of mercy prepared for glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:38419:111"/>3. Here is that wherein the nature of this work of preparation conſiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He muſt be ſetled in the ſtate of grace and ſalvation; that is, he muſt have a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-right to God, as he is the God of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo a right to heaven, and to all the bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He muſt be wrought into a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frame, whereby he is bent to yield up himſelf in ſubjection and obedience to the will of God, in ſickneſs, and in death.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Here is that which he muſt be prepared for, <hi>viz.</hi> all that God ſhall do to him by ſickneſs and death: If God fill him with pain and miſery, he hath his graces of faith, love, patience, humility, and meekneſs, to enable him to lie quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and obediently, and chearfully under the power and will of his heavenly Father. If God call him by ſickneſs into Eternity, he is with Saint <hi>Paul, ready to be offered</hi>; and is made fit by grace, to receive and enjoy the glory of heaven. This gracious frame of heart is fully epxreſs'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord</hi>;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:38419:112"/>
that is, we live to this end, to pleaſe, and do the will, and to ſeek the glory of the Lord, and we are ready to die to the will and glory of the Lord.</p>
               <p>So much for the Explication of this work of preparation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall preſs this Exhortation upon theſe ſeven ſorts of perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall exhort little children (ſo far as they are capable to know and practiſe this duty) to prepare for ſickneſs and death. Now becauſe this applica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion may ſeem ſtrange, conſider, that God himſelf thinks it not below him to be a Teacher of young children, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 148.12, 13. <hi>Both young men and maidens, old men and children, let them praiſe the name of the Lord.</hi> And all parents are commanded to teach their children to know and do his will, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>And theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thy heart; and thou ſhalt teach them diligently</hi>; (or wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t and ſharpen them) upon thy children. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Train up a childe in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</hi> Obſerve, there is a way for young children to go to heaven, and it is that wherein they ſhould be found when they are old; and all parents are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:38419:112"/>
bound to ſet them in that way: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; children are ſooner capable then moſt conceive, to know ſomething of God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, and Hell. <hi>Timothy</hi> knew the Scriptures, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>from a ſucking childe,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. And this appears by the timely fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that ſometimes drop from their pretty ſanctified mouths.</p>
               <p>And certainly baptized children being Chriſts Diſciples, and admitted into his School, the Church, have a right to be taught in the way to ſalvation; and Chriſt is a Prophet to them, and his Miniſters are Miniſters to them, as well as to others: And really, Miniſters have often more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from catechized Boys and Girls, then from many old ignorant Atheiſts, who are worſe then children in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures. And laſtly, it makes much for Gods glory, to have his Name praiſed by the mouths of little children, Pſal. 8.2. <hi>Out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings haſt thou ordained ſtrength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy enemies, that thou mighteſt ſtill the enemy and avenger.</hi> Obſerve, God hath ordained that his praiſe in the mouths of little children, ſhall be a ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means to ſtop the mouths of malicious
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:38419:113"/>
ſubtil Atheiſts, to ſtill the enemy and aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. So we read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.16. <hi>Out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the mouths of babes and ſucklings haſt tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> perfected praiſe.</hi> The praiſes that come to God by the bleſſed Angels, and all the Saints in heaven and earth, is perfected and made up by the praiſes of theſe young Saints. Now conſidering theſe things, and ſeeing ſickneſs and death fetch away ſo many young children into Eternity, I have choſen to direct one brief Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the young Boys and Girls among us.</p>
               <p>Oh come therefore, you ſweet and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty children, <hi>and I will teach you the fear of the Lord:</hi> be you prepared for ſickneſs and death. Heark, ſweet Children, you were born children of the Devil, and you muſt be born again if ever you will be the children of God.</p>
               <p>Good children, know and love the God that made you, and Jeſus Chriſt who died for you, to redeem and ſave you.</p>
               <p>You can be afraid of the Rod, and a Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; be afraid of ſin and hell.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you have godly parents, who inſtruct and catechize you in the knowledge of God:<note place="margin">Prov. 1.8.</note> Why, good children, <hi>hear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of your fathers, and forſake not the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:38419:113"/>
law of your mothers.</hi> God doth not love you as his children, becauſe you are pretty or witty children, or becauſe you are the children of rich parents; but if you will love and fear the Lord,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.30.</note> then <hi>you ſhall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good children, look on the graves in the Church-yards, and you ſhall ſee many who were no elder nor taller then you, dead and buried before you: as young as you are ſick, and as young as you are dead, and as young as you are in heaven and hell; therefore be Gods children whilſt you are young, leſt you be ſick, and dead, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before you be old.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Exhort parents to do their duty in endeavouring to prepare their children for ſickneſs and death, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, feed or nouriſh your children in the fear of the Lord. Beaſts can take care to ſave their young ones lives; but men, and women, and Chriſtians ſhould be careful to ſave their childrens ſouls: when thy children dye, if thou haſt neglected their ſalvation, it muſt (if thy conſcience be ever awakened) cauſe ſtinging reflections in thy ſoul. There is a ſtory of a father, who conſented that his daughter ſhould commit whoredom; which ſhe did, and ſoon after dyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereupon
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:38419:114"/>
the poor guilty father cryes out, <hi>I have damned my daughters ſoul, I have damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my daughters ſoul.</hi> Sirs, do not teach your children to to lye, ſwear, to be drunk or covetous, to ſcoff at Gods children or holineſs, leſt one day you have cauſe to cry out when it is too late, <hi>We have damned our childrens ſouls.</hi> When your hearts are affected to ſee your children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, then ſee diſeaſes and death at your doors, ready to make your children or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, or you childleſs; and conſider with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, how ſad it is, that ſuch pretty ſweet chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be for ever burned in hell. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, I would not have you worſe then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, in not providing for your childrens bodies; and yet I would have you better then Devils, in providing for their poor ſouls: It is a pleaſant ſight to ſee parents live, as if they were going with all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to heaven: It is comely to ſee parents ſitting in their houſe, and their children about them; or to ſee them ſitting in a Congregation, and their children about them: but how much more glorious will it be, to ſee them ſitting in heaven, and their children about them! though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation will end, yet the comfort of being a means to bring them thither will abide for
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:38419:114"/>
ever. Parents, if you cannot make your children heirs of houſes and lands, labour to make them heirs of heaven; do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach your children how to live, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo teach them how to dye: thou art trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſometimes to think, Alas, how will my poor children live! I tell thee thou haſt more need to think, How will my poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren dye! for there are few ſo poor, but they can make ſome ſhift to live; but there are millions ſo miſerable, that they know not how to dye.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Exhortation to young men. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you, O men, I call, and my voice is unto the ſons of men,</hi> Prov. 8.4. make it your care to prepare for ſickneſs and death. <hi>Solomon</hi> having taught, that <hi>childhood and youth is vanity,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.10. he infers this Exhortation to young men, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the daies of thy youth.</hi> It is neceſſary for all young people to live, as thoſe that know, <hi>that God will bring them to judgment,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.9. Conſider, you are never prepared for ſickneſs and death, till you are prepared for judgement. Oh young men and women, look upon your ſelves as going to judgment: Heark, do not you hear the great ſhout that calls you all to make your appearance before the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:38419:115"/>
judgment-ſeat of Chriſt. Sirs, be nothing now, but what you would appear to be at that great day: Wouldſt thou be judged as a Drunkard, or Swearer, or Whoremonger, or Worldling, or as an enemy to godly Miniſters and Chriſtians at the day of judgment? If not, then be not ſuch a one now; do not think your ſelves too young to enter into a ſerious way of godlineſs: For what if ſickneſs and death will not ſtay till you are old? Thou art not too young to be ſick, or to die: Do not then think that thou art too young to go to heaven, leſt God think thee old enough to go to hell.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Exhortation to old men to prepare for ſickneſs and death: The daies which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls <hi>evil daies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 12.1.</note> are already come upon you. Methinks I may allude to that of our Saviour, Joh. 4.35. <hi>Look on the fields, for they are white already unto Harveſt.</hi> When I look on old people, I ſee a white crop of gray hairs, which ſpeaks them to be ripe for the ſickle of death. Sirs, diſeaſes and death have done a great deal of their work upon you already; they have worn away your colour, beauty and ſtrength: yet how ſad is it to ſee an old man more unfit to die, then a very childe that begins to live!
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:38419:115"/>
He is old and ignorant, old and covetous, old and malicious, old and cruel, old, and yet a drunkard. Oh poor man, what haſt thou been doing all thy daies? Haſt thou had fifty, threeſcore, almoſt fourſcore years, to prepare for ſickneſs and death, and to lay up treaſures in heaven; and haſt thou done nothing elſe, but been heaping up wrath in hell! Heark, old Father (for I muſt needs honour thy hoary head) the ſick-bed, death, the grave call for thee: Oh then repent, and believe preſently; let not the Devil, who long ago perſwaded thee thou waſt too young, now perſwade thee thou art too old; for as old as thou art, yet it is better for thee to go to heaven a young Babe of Chriſt, then to go to hell an old ſlave of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Exhortation to rich and great men of the world to prepare for ſickneſs and death. Sirs, there are meſſengers at your doors to fetch you, where mountains of gold are worth nothing; your riches cannot guard you againſt ſickneſs and death: God can as eaſily turn a Bed of Down into a Bed of Languiſhing, as a Bed of Straw; and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe cares no more for the richeſt Velvet, then the pooreſt Sheep skin; and a ſickneſs can as eaſily catch thee in a Coach, as in a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:38419:116"/>
Cart; and death enters into the ſtatelieſt Caſtle, aſſoon as the pooreſt cottage. Read your caſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>As the flower of the graſs he ſhall paſs away: For the Sun is no ſooner riſen with a burning heat, but it withereth the graſs, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the faſhion of it periſheth; ſo alſo ſhall the rich man fade away in his ways.</hi> Oh tell thy friends, lands, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold, that thou art going into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and art preſently to ſtand before the Judge of Quick and Dead, and ſee what help they can afford thee: Thou wilt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly finde <hi>Solomons</hi> words true, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloved, If we would know whether a man be happy or miſerable, we muſt not look upon him as he appears in his honours and riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but follow him to his death, and the day of judgment; ſee how he ſpeeds there, and how he comes off then, for then the man comes to his proof: and we ſhall ſee, that all the riches of the world yield no profit in thoſe great daies, but then the higheſt carnal Monarch ſhall be no more reſpected by the Judge of all the world, then the uglieſt Devil of Hell; when a poor godly ſervant, or day-labourer, ſhall be crowned with incorruptible glory
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:38419:116"/>
before his face. Oh therefore you rich men, look among all your jewels and treaſures, whether you have a God, and Chriſt, and grace for your poor ſouls; theſe only are the proviſion which will maintain you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the terrors of death, and the dread of judgment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Exhortation to poor men to prepare for ſickneſs and death. We think them poor who have nothing to live on in this world; but they are poor, who have nothing to live on in the other world. Poor people! you cannot come at the ſilver, and gold, and riches of this world, when you will; but you have as much freedom to the riches of the other world, as the mightieſt Prince upon earth. Thou mayſt call God Father, and ask what thou wilt, and live upon the everlaſting Kingdom of heaven as thy own: and therefore you that are poor and godly, let your riches of the other world comfort you againſt the poverty of this: Look on thy cold Cottage, and then look on thy houſe not made wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hed when thou appeareſt with Chriſt in glory: Look on thy brown bread, and courſe fare, and then remember the entertainment which Angels
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:38419:117"/>
and Saints have in heaven. Oh poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! though you know not how to be maintained whilſt you live, yet get ſaving grace, and you will be rich enough to go to heaven when you die.</p>
               <p>The laſt Exhortation ſhall be to ſuch, who, in ſome reſpects, ſeem nearer death then other perſons. I ſhall inſtance only in three ſorts of people, to whom I ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this Exhortation to prepare for ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such whoſe callings and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do expoſe their lives to daily and great dangers; as Water-men, Colliers, Carpenters, Maſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe men, by a leak in a Boat or Ship, a fall of a little earth, a ſlip of a foot, may be turned to heaven or hell every day: Yet we often ſee, that many who live in the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, live in the greateſt ſins. My earneſt advice to you is, to prepare for death, that though you ſtand in dangerous places, yet you may ſtand upon ſure ground for the ſalvation of your ſouls. Sirs, for ought I know, you may get heaven with leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then you get your livings: Remember what precious ſouls you have, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time you venture your lives, you ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your ſouls too: Labour by ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:38419:117"/>
to forſake your ſins, and to turn to God. Do not ſwear, and lye, and be drunk, and deceive others: Do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Lords daies, if you expect that God ſhould preſerve you on working daies; labour by a ſound faith to reſt on Chriſt to ſave your guilty ſouls; ſee your nearneſs unto Eternity; be often looking from the places where you are, into heaven and hell, and ſee what a little there is betwixt you and them; and ſeriouſly conſider, if now you ſhould fall into Eternity, in which of thoſe two places would be your portion: Get ſuch a ſaving knowledge of God, that you may comfortably commit the keeping of your lives unto him, and ſolemnly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in your Cloſets and Families, and live in the fear of God, and in peace with him, and uſe your callings to his glory, that he may preſerve you in your ways; or however, that if you <hi>do die in your callings,</hi> you may not <hi>die in your ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Such, who though they have ordinarily preſent caſe and health, yet they are ſubject to dangerous and ſudden pains, and fearful diſtempers, as Convulſions, Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Sickneſs, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you have need, in regard of theſe, to be always prepared for ſickneſs and death: you would not be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:38419:118"/>
without what remedies you can get, when your diſtempers come: Oh do not be without God, and Chriſt, and Grace, if death ſhould come in them. Whatever you are doing, conſider, Now my diſtempers may ſurprize me; therefore if they take you in bed, at meat, at work, let them not take you in your ſins: in all likelihood, theſe fits will ſhorten your daies; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them haſten your repentance: theſe diſtempers will fill you with torturing pains, or for preſent deprive you of your reaſon, parts, ſenſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that then will be a very unfit time to prepare for death; therefore improve your times of health and eaſe, as merciful opportunities, that when your diſeaſes or death finde you, they may not finde you unprovided. Sirs, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that you carry death in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; therefore be ſure to carry grace in your ſouls.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Women that are with childe, have ſpecial reaſon to be prepared for ſickneſs and death: God hath inſeparably fixt this puniſhment upon this Sex, that <hi>in ſorrow they ſhall bring forth children,</hi> Gen. 3.16. And our Saviour tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.21. <hi>A woman when ſhe is in travel, hath ſorrow:</hi> And experience witneſſeth the grievous
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:38419:118"/>
pangs and pains of all, and the ſad deaths of very many in this condition: ſo that thou muſt certainly within a few weeks be grievouſly diſeaſed, and thou mayſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably dye: do not then venture into ſuch dangers in a Chriſtleſs ſtate. Poor woman! perhaps thou haſt bred that life which will be thy own death: therefore labour to finde that Chriſt is as ſure formed in thy heart, as the babe is formed in thy womb; and before that ſad and dangerous hour of the birth of thy childe come, examine throughly whether <hi>the new birth</hi> be paſt in thy ſoul: I would not have thee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thy heart with the diſmal fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts and diſtracting fears of that time: for to be ſure, <hi>ſufficient to that day will be the evil thereof</hi>; but I would have thee ſo prepared, that the ſhort pangs of childe-bearing may not end in the everlaſting pangs and torments of hell; and that thou mayſt be a new creature, and found in the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, that if thou ſhouldſt no longer live with thy Husband, nor enjoy the fruit of thy womb upon earth, thou mayſt live with Chriſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the fruit of his righteouſneſs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever. I ſhall conclude this with that ſuitable Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:38419:119"/>
ſhe ſhall be ſaved in childe-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, if they continue in faith, and charity, and holineſs with ſobriety:</hi> leſt poor women ſhould be ſwallowed up with the ſad thoughts of the ſin mentioned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe, where it's ſaid that <hi>Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the granſgreſſion:</hi> for which ſin, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and puniſhment is fixt to the Sex: theſe words are added for their comfort, to ſhew that, notwithſtanding that ſin and the puniſhment thereof, yet they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in childe-bearing, if they continue in faith, and charity, and holineſs with ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Poor woman! methinks I ſee thee walking with two ſouls over eternity, and both full of ſin; Oh therefore haſten to make thy peace with that God whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alone muſt <hi>take the childe out of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bowels</hi>;<note place="margin">Pſal. 71.6.</note> that ſo thou mayſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly depend and call upon him to ſave both your lives, but however to ſave your poor ſouls.</p>
               <p>I come now to urge this duty with theſe ſeven Motives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 1. It is the will of God that you ſhould be prepared for ſickneſs and death; in ſo doing, you do the will of God; he commands you to wait, and watch, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:38419:119"/>
prepare for the day of judgement, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.42. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.33, 35. Now it's a certain rule, that all thoſe Scriptures which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to prepare for the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do imply our duty to be prepared for ſickneſs and death, which are the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of that day; and the ſame prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which is made for the one, will ſerve for the other. Now, my Brethren, this is a ſufficient reaſon to move you to this duty: for it's the will of God which makes it our duty, and binds us to it, and muſt be the reaſon to us why we do it, or we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be prepared aright. Beloved, God would <hi>have us to be ſaved,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4. to reign with him in heaven; and therefore to be always ready againſt the time that he ſends for us thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 2. It's a ſigne of a very wiſe man to be prepared for ſickneſs and death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3. <hi>A prudent man fore-ſeeth the evil, and hideth himſelf.</hi> A wiſe godly man ſees ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and death, and the day of judgement before him: he knows he muſt go through all theſe, and therefore he takes care to provide ſo as to be ſafe and happy in thoſe great dangers. Beloved, it's the greateſt wiſdom in the world,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note> to be <hi>wiſe to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> It's better miſcarry in a thouſand bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:38419:120"/>
then in the buſineſs of Salvation: Now he that is wiſe to ſalvation, prepares againſt all the dangers that he muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from; and the greateſt danger is at death, when a man muſt go through that door where ſo many millions fall into hell: what a wiſe man then is he who is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſo, as that door to him is the door of heaven! Many that get eſtates and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in the world, are much admired for their wiſdom; and yet when death comes, they muſt be damned for their folly! Remember the Parable of the <hi>ten Virgins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>five</hi> whereof <hi>were wiſe, and five were fooliſh:</hi> Now why were thoſe five called wiſe? the reaſon was,<note place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> becauſe when that great <hi>cry</hi> was made at midnight, <hi>Behold, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom cometh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> they were prepared: and why were the other five fooliſh? becauſe they were unprepared for that great time. Beloved, when the great God our Saviour ſhall come out of heaven with his <hi>mighty Angels,</hi> and his glorious Saints, and ſhall ſhew his bleſſed face in the clouds, and ſound a trumpet that will call all the quick and dead before him in the <hi>twinkling of an eye</hi>; certainly they will prove the wiſeſt perſons, that are ſo prepared as to ſtand, and triumph, and lift up their heads with joy
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:38419:120"/>
in that great appearance. Ah Sirs, when <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>Go ye curſed,</hi> hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed and parted the world, it will then be known, who are wiſe men, and who are fools.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 3. Becauſe it's altogether uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain when ſickneſs and death will come, the Scripture uſeth this argument, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.33. <hi>Watch and pray: for ye know not when your time is. Solomon</hi> elegantly ſets forth the uncertainty of our time, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.12. <hi>For man alſo knoweth not his time: as the fiſhes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the ſnare, ſo are the ſons of men ſnared in an evil time, when it falleth ſuddenly upon them.</hi> As the fiſhes are ſporting in the water, and are preſently maſht in the net; and as the birds are hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the chaff, and are preſently caught in the ſnare; ſo poor man is ſuddenly and unexpectedly ſurpriſed in the ſnares of death. Sometimes a man is faſt aſleep, and ſickneſs awakens him: ſometimes he is feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the table, and death comes between the cup and the lip: ſometimes he is riding a journey, and death throws him into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and ſometimes he is making a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and death comes and breaks the bargain: ſometimes he is marrying a wife,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:38419:121"/>
and death comes and mars the match. Sirs, ſickneſs and death are under no rules of civility; they care not for diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the weightieſt buſineſs in the world: if therefore we cannot ſay of any thing, I will do this, or I will have that, before I am ſick or dead; certainly our very next work ſhould be to prepare for ſickneſs and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 4. Becauſe thou knoweſt not what kinde of ſickneſs or death may come upon thee. We read of <hi>a great death,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.10. Sometimes death comes with great pains, and great terrors, and great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which make it a great death; ſo that the proviſion of a whole age of grace will not, without the mighty ſupport of Gods Spirit, keep thee holy and cheerful at ſuch a time. It is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 18.13. <hi>The firſt-born of death ſhall devour his ſtrength.</hi> The firſt-born is the chiefeſt and mightieſt in it's kinde; and therefore the meaning is, that death ſhall come in the moſt cruel and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible manner to devour a man: Now ſet before thee thoſe that have dyed in the moſt fearful pains of body, and have been aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt horrid temptations, and conſider, this may be thy caſe; however, prepare againſt the worſt, that Sin, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:38419:121"/>
Death, and Devils, and men can do againſt thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 5. By thy being prepared for ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death, thou art alſo prepared for health and life; for there is none ſo fit to live, as he who is fit to dye; the ſame graces which will make thee holy, and patient, and joyful in ſickneſs, will make thee ſo in health; for the ſame faith, love, humility, meekneſs and patience, which qualifie the ſoul for paſſive obedience, do alſo fit the ſoul for active obedience; as the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of victuals or money which is made againſt a ſiege or famine, will be uſeful and profitable, if ſuch times do not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: ſo that you can neither be well, nor ſick, nor live, nor dye without this work of preparation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 6. That man is in a moſt bleſſed condition, who is prepared for ſickneſs and death; for every thing which makes him prepared, makes him bleſſed. I ſhall onely inſtance in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the happineſs of the other world is his own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Things to come are yours.</hi> Chriſtians, your ſins, ſnares and troubles are almoſt paſt, but they will be all over ſhortly; but your joy, glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs are to come: The happineſs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:38419:122"/>
is to come, and the glory of the day of judgement is to come: Now all theſe joys that are to come, are yours; for they are ſetled upon you in the Covenant of Grace, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> Now that man is fit to dye, and is in a moſt bleſſed condition, who when ſickneſs and death comes, hath a right to go to heaven. Poor childe of God! the beſt of thy hopes, and comforts, and happineſs, lies beyond death, and thou canſt not come at them for this life; but ſickneſs and death will put thee into poſſeſſion of all, and thou art like to ſee a ſtrange ſight, ſo ſoon as death hath looſed thee out of this life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is by the graces of Gods Spirit fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for heaven; he is <hi>made meet to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. Beloved, grace makes a man fit to receive glory; the joys of heaven are brought and received into the ſoul by grace; if thou wilt be prepared for death, live now as thou hopeſt to live for ever in heaven; do nothing but what thou wouldſt do going to heaven. Beſides, by grace the heart of a Believer faſtens on heaven; he <hi>lays hold on eternal life</hi>; he prayes, hears
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:38419:122"/>
and receives Sacraments with his heart, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faſt hold on heaven. How fit therefore is ſuch a man to have ſickneſs and death come to let him into heaven!</p>
               <p>Laſt <hi>Motive.</hi> If you are not prepared for ſickneſs and death, you will be prepared for hell. Sirs, if a godly man doth good, and a ſinner doth evil, both go into eternity; the one to be a treaſure in heaven, the other to be a treaſure in hell. Now what a fearful condition is this, for a man to be always laying up proviſion againſt himſelf in hell! We read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. of <hi>veſſels of wrath fitted</hi> or made up <hi>for deſtruction</hi>; if you will not be made up for heaven, you muſt be made up for hell: Oh believe what a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition this is, to be always ready to be turned into hell; thou doſt not think of this whilſt the pleaſures of ſin and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God laſt: But what a caſe wilt thou be in, when there will be nothing in thee but torments, and nothing in God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee but wrath! Beloved, be convinced of the certainty of hell; thou mayſt as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſee hell by the light of Scripture, as thou mayſt ſee men, and beaſts, and earth, and trees by the light of the Sun; hell is as certain as ſin and ſinners; there is wrath in God as ſure as there is ſin in man. God's
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:38419:123"/>
juſtice is as ſure as his mercie; and he hath bound himſelf to condemn unbelievers, as well as to ſave believers. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. Mark</hi> 16.16.</p>
               <p>See your nearneſs to hell, whilſt you are unprepared for ſickneſs and death: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I ſee that every ſtep thou goeſt, thou art ready to tread in the flames. Poor ſoul! thou hangeſt over the lake of brimſtone by the twin'd thred of life; when that breaks, thou art drowned and damned for ever; there is nothing appears between thee and hell, but the hand-breadth of time: Oh what a ſight is this, to ſee a company of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſinners drinking, and ſwearing, and ſwaggering, and ranting, and roaring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an hand-breadth of everlaſting burnings! Again, conſider the greatneſs of hell-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; here is a depth that thou canſt not fathom; who can ſpeak of the greatneſs of hell-torments, when it's our duty to believe they are unſpeakable? Canſt thou tell how many years eternity laſts? or how much pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſin deſerves? Doſt thou know how much wrath Omnipotencie can inflict? or how much torment a veſſel of wrath can hold? then mayſt thou meaſure the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell, and fathom the lake of fire and brimſtone. Conſider but this one thing,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:38419:123"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the greatneſs of God who inflicts the torments; he is a God to whom vengeance belongs, and he were no God if he could not do that which belongs to him: conſider God is great in every thing that he is; to whom he is a father, a portion, a husband, he is a great father, a great portion, a great husband; to whom he is an enemy, he is a great enemy: Oh how great muſt their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery be, who muſt for ever feel the weight of that hand which made heaven and earth! Beloved, if but the ach of a tooth be ſo grievous, that it takes away the taſte of a whole monarchy of the world while it laſts; how inconceiveably great muſt their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be, who have the power that made all the world ſet awork to torment their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſouls through all eternity! Nay, conſider further, God will raiſe up his glory out of his enemies miſery; thoſe are always great works which God makes to pleaſe himſelf, and to demonſtrate his glory: when he would glorifie his power, and goodneſs, and wiſdom, he makes a world; when he would glorifie his grace, and love, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, he gives a Chriſt; and when he would glorifie his juſtice and holineſs, he damns a ſinner. O wo, wo, wo be thoſe poor ſouls, out of whoſe torments God will raiſe up
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:38419:124"/>
to himſelf an everlaſting revenue of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able glory! Oh then what a miſerable cheated ſoul art thou, who wilt venture to be one hour unprepared for ſickneſs and death, when for ought thou knoweſt thou mayſt be in the bottom of hell before the clock ſtrike next!</p>
               <p>I ſhall now in the laſt place conclude this Uſe, by giving you ten Directions to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you how to prepare for ſickneſs and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Labour by a ſtrong and lively faith to be always receiving and reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the greateſt danger you are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt, is, that ſickneſs and death do not bring you to hell: Now being found in Chriſts righteouſneſs, you ſhall have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a ſafe and comfortable way and paſſage through theſe into heaven; for by reaſon of this, you may ſtand on the very gates of death, and triumph with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> Now this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt is as truely thine by faith,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:38419:124"/>
as it is <hi>Pauls,</hi> or ever a Saints in heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The righteouſneſs of God is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference.</hi> So that I ſay thou mayſt ſtand in this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and put all the enemies of thy ſalvation to the trial, and ask, <hi>Who can lay any thing to thy charge? or condemn thee?</hi> And thou mayſt in effect hear from all the like anſwer, which was made by other things in <hi>Job</hi> in another caſe: Sin ſaith, It is not in me; and Satan ſaith, It is not in me; and the Law ſaith, It is not in me; and Death ſaith, It is not in me; we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to charge upon a juſtified perſon: and therefore be always taking new and freſh hold in this righteouſneſs; for it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that God doth not onely in a ſet and ſolemn way, as in Sacraments, and Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> offer and give Jeſus Chriſt; but alſo he is conſtantly offering him in the Goſpel, and declaring it to be his will that we ſhould take him: and thou ſhouldſt not onely in the duties of Gods worſhip, but alſo upon all opportunities in ſecret, and at other times, be applying to thy ſelf, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and glorying in this righteouſneſs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; believe that God is always ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a ſweet ſavour in this righteouſneſs, as
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:38419:125"/>
offered for thee, and that Chriſt is by his continual interceſſion preſenting it to his Father for thee, and it's always of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Goſpel to thee; do thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore always take it for thy righteouſneſs to juſtifie thee, that when ſickneſs and death come, thou mayſt be found ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Learn <hi>to dye daily</hi>; for it is a certain truth, that <hi>he that will live when he dies, muſt die whilſt he lives:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> affirms it to be his practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. <hi>I proteſt by your rejoycing that I have in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, I dye daily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how can a man dye daily?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By a daily ſeparating and looſing his heart from all things, which death can looſe him and ſeparate him from: I mean ſo as not to account his life and happineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> death you know is a ſeparation from that which is our life. Now we have a kinde of life in husbands, wives, children, eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when death comes, it ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates us from theſe; therefore I ſay we dye daily by a daily looſening and parting the heart from them; this duty is clearly taught by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31. where
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:38419:125"/>
the Apoſtle exhorts, that becauſe our time to enjoy relations, pleaſures and eſtates is but ſhort, and we are preſently to ſpend an eternity without them, therefore <hi>let them that have wives be as though they had none, and they that rejoyce be as though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced not, and they that buy be as though they poſſeſſed not</hi>; that is, they muſt live with their hearts looſed and parted from theſe things: for as a traveller uſeth the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry accommodations of his Inne ſoberly, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably and cheerfully whilſt he ſtays, yet ſo as to forward, and not to hinder his journey home: So a Chriſtian muſt uſe the comforts of this life holily, cheerfully and thankfully, yet ſo as not to ſtop him in his way to heaven: Our ſweeteſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt neither make the thoughts of eternity leſs ſweet, nor our paſſage into eternity more hard. Now hereby a man is very much prepared for ſickneſs and death; for one thing which makes theſe ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, is, becauſe the heart hath taken ſuch hold of the creature, that it exceedingly torments him to be broken from it; ſo that it is often a greater trouble to looſe his ſoul from the world, then to looſe it from the body: but when by grace the heart is already looſed from the world, a great
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:38419:126"/>
part of deaths work is done already, becauſe death findes him dead to the world when it comes to take him out of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man dyes daily, by a daily living on thoſe things which he muſt live upon after death. We are commanded this duty, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above, and not on things on the earth:</hi> As the heart muſt be parted from the things on earth, ſo it muſt be ſet, and fixt, and faſtned on the things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and this is the property of grace, to make the heart dead to the world, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to a life in God, and Chriſt, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Now this alſo is a dying daily, for death to a childe of God is a removing him from a life on earth, to a life in heaven; and hereby he doth, as it were, go beyond death, and hath his life, and joy, and comfort in the other world: He walks by faith in the ſtreets of <hi>the City that hath foundations,</hi> and reſts and refreſheth his ſoul <hi>in his houſe not made with hands</hi>; he ſecretly departs from the company and comforts of this life, and gets his heart among Angels and Saints in heaven, beholding, and praiſing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:38419:126"/>
in the face of God and Jeſus Chriſt. Now ſuch a man muſt needs be fit to dye, becauſe his heart is ſet on every thing that death brings him unto: Like <hi>Paul,</hi> who having his heart fixt on Chriſt in heaven, cries out, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, a man dyes daily, by daily look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon himſelf as a dying or dead man: he lays death to his heart, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.2. his heart is full of the ſerious thoughts of death, <hi>Job</hi> 17.13, 14. <hi>If I wait, the grave is my houſe; I have made my bed in the darkneſs. I have ſaid to corruption, Thou art my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to the worm, Thou art my mother and my ſiſter.</hi> Ah ſirs, to one that knows he ſhall dye and ſleep in Jeſus, death and the worms are as ſweet as his deareſt relations. And thus a man prepares for death, when he doth, as it were, accuſtom himſelf to dye, and makes death familiar to him. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, look upon your ſelves, as always at the very point of death; when you are putting your flowers in your boſoms, remember you are, as it were, dreſſing a Corpſe for the grave; when you are waſhing and kembing your heads and faces, and looking on them in the glaſs, remember what ghaſtly skulls they will be ſhortly; yet let thy thoughts be
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:38419:127"/>
often among the graves; think, here lyes my Grand-father and Grand-mother; there lyes my Father and Mother; yonder lyes my Brother and Siſter; and I my ſelf am juſt going to lye down amongſt them. Thus learn to dye daily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Labour by an eye of faith to diſcern between things that differ. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, faith hath a very deep and piercing inſight into things; it judgeth of things by Scripture, it believes what God in his Word ſpeaks of them; and ſo a believers carriage towards every thing is according as the Word deſcribes and preſents it to him: and ſurely this makes people ſo unprepared to dye, becauſe they want an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things: It cannot ſink into their hearts, that ſin is ſo bad, and Chriſt ſo good; or the world ſo vain, or grace ſo precious; or hell ſo terrible, or heaven ſo glorious: but they are ſo confident that luſt is ſweet, and riches are precious, and death is far off, and hell is but a bug bear, and heaven is but a fanſie: And in this confidence they will live and dye; and therefore the Apoſtle prayes that the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians may try things that differ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>that they may be fit for the day of Chriſt.</hi> I ſhall therefore give you this Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:38419:127"/>
in theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Look upon God and the world toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you ſhall ſee the difference; for this end I beſeech you ſearch and believe that Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15,-17. <hi>Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the balance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, he taketh up the iſles as a very little thing. All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſs then nothing and vanity.</hi> Now let thy heart judge of, and act towards God and the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this difference: Set all the world before thee, give every creature its due; ſee what a vaſt world of Kingdoms and Nations it is; look upon the ſtrong Iſlands which are fortified and moted about with the Seas, which this great God takes up as a very little thing; ſee a world of great and mighty men before thee; ſee the rich world of gold, and ſilver, and precious ſtones, lying on heaps before thee; look upon the lands and buildings which make all the woods, fields, paſtures, medows, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, vineyards, gardens, towns, cities and ſtately houſes in the world. O what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious world is this, which made the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <hi>ſhout for joy at the rearing of it!</hi> Well,<note place="margin">Job 38.7.</note> take a full ſurvey of the glory and beauty
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:38419:128"/>
of this great world: and then looking on a drop of water hanging on a bucket, what a poor thing is this? which is ready to break, and fall on the ground, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy catcheth at it: look alſo upon the ſmall duſt of the balance, a thing of neither weight nor worth, it doth not ſo much as turn the ſcales: Now labour by faith to have ſuch a clear inſight into the greatneſs and goodneſs of God and Jeſus Chriſt, that thou mayſt be able to judge all the world to be but as a drop of the bucket, or as the ſmall duſt of the balance, to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Saviour; and let thy whole man act according to ſuch a wiſe, holy, juſt judgement: and this will exceedingly fit thee for ſickneſs and death, which come to looſe thee from ſuch a vain world, into the preſence and everlaſting injoyment of ſuch a glorious God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look upon ſin, and upon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; look upon theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Beloved, faith hath a deep inſight into the evil of ſin, for it ſees the glory of God, which ſin is againſt, wherein the evil of it appears, and believes the dreadful curſes of the law, and what the wrath of God, and what hell is, and what an immortal being a man is that muſt ſuffer theſe. Faith alſo

hath a piercing inſight into the excellencie of Chriſts righteouſneſs; it ſees what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely-glorious God Jeſus Chriſt is, which makes his righteouſneſs ſo precious and meritorious, and ſo ſavoury and ſatisfactory to the Father; and for this reaſon, ſo all-ſufficient for faith to reſt and live upon: for this is the precious property of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, that it receives Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ſalvation, for the ſame reaſon which God receives it for ſatisfaction; that is, becauſe it is the righteouſneſs of God; and indeed, faith muſt ſee God ſatisfied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can ſee the believer ſaved: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough in Chriſt for the ſatisfaction of God, it ſees the ſame ſufficiencie in him for the ſalvation of the Believer. Now Chriſts righteouſneſs never appears more precious then when the ſoul is filled with the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſight and ſenſe of ſin; for then the ſoul believes him to be a great Saviour, when he ſees the great evil of ſin which he ſaves him from: and therefore it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that the Apoſtle demonſtrates the direful guilt and filth of ſin, as a preface to that great Doctrine of Juſtification by faith in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. to the end of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:38419:129"/>And as you know, it was a ſad and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful caſe for the poor Jews to be <hi>bitte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> with the fiery Serpents,</hi> and to lye groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the pain and anguiſh of thoſe poiſonous and deadly wounds: yet then what a glorious ſight was it to look upon <hi>the brazen Serpent,</hi> and thereby to finde power and vertue to heal them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently?</p>
               <p>So, my Brethren, it is a fearful caſe in it ſelf, for a man to ſtand in the very jaws of death, and to look into the horrid nature of ſin, and ſee death, and devils, and hell, and all the curſes of the law ready to flee in his face: and yet how glorious is it then to look upon the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt and ſee them all ſwallowed up, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaved? And thus as he ſees the grace of God in Chriſt <hi>raigning and over-abounding</hi> all ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. ſo his faith, and hope, and joy grounded thereon, doth riſe above, and over-abound and ſwallow up all his fears of death and hell which he was in becauſe of his ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Look upon all your ſufferings on earth, and upon the glory of heaven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. <hi>We muſt through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> Obſerve, there is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:38419:129"/>
into the Kingdom of Heaven out of all our afflictions, and our way to heaven lyes through much tribulation: an hypocrite ſeems to go ſtrongly in the way to heaven, but oftentimes when he comes to trouble, perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there he is ſtopt, and can go no farther; but he that believes the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of duty, and the glory of heaven, if tribulation, ſickneſs, poverty, perſecution ſeek to ſtop him, he goes through them; he knows duty is ſweet and ſafe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will follow it, till it bring him to heaven, whatever it coſt him. <hi>Tertullian</hi> comforts the Martyrs in priſon with this, That in their cloſe and dark priſons they might ſee <hi>illam viam, quae ad Deum ducit, that way which leads them to God:</hi> There is a way to heaven out of priſon, ſick-bed, or any other affliction. Hence thoſe that come to heaven, are ſaid to come <hi>out of great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,</hi> Rev. 7.14. Sometimes a poor Saint comes hot, as it were, out of the furnace of affliction into heaven; from chains and bolts in a priſon, he is looſed into heaven; from gaſping and groaning upon a ſick-bed, to heaven: ſurely when he comes there, he findes a ſtrange alteration. Well, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy ſelf now as ſtanding between the two worlds: a world of ſin, ſnares, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:38419:130"/>
poverty, ſickneſs and death on the one hand; and a world of life, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and fulneſs of inconceivable joy and pleaſure on the other hand. Thus the Apoſtle ſeems to ſtand, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. we ſtand looking from our afflictions, on the things that are not ſeen. So <hi>Rom</hi> 8.17, 18. <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall be glorified with him.</hi> Well, put theſe together; put the perſecution from wicked men, and the Crown of Glory together; put a moment of pain and miſery on a ſick bed, and an eternity of joy in heaven together; and thou muſt needs conclude with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>For I reckon</hi> (ſaith he) I have caſt them both up, and I finde, <hi>that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, look upon time and eternity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Oh what is time, when a man looks into eternity! it ſeems but a breath, a twinkling of an eye, a ſtroke of a pulſe, to a man that ſees eternity before him. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks a believer is like a man on a hill by the ſea-ſide: he ſees a little ſpot of ground, and the great Ocean lying beyond it; ſo he ſees a little ſpot of time, and the great Ocean of eternity lying beyond it: he ſees
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:38419:130"/>
the end of all things: Oh, ſaith he, I am gone, I am gone: look how all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and riches, and comforts of this life do vaniſh out of my ſight; and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, or everlaſting glory will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me preſently! Sirs, this would make us live in a poſture to dye, if we did but ſee what a little while it is before we muſt ſit with Chriſt in heaven, or burn with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. Labour to <hi>fill up your time:</hi> this is the way to fit you for eternity: but you will ſay, What is it to fill up our time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Time is filled by applying our time to that work which God hath given us our time for: God hath given us time for our callings, <hi>to labour and do all that we have to do</hi>; time to worſhip God, and do his will; time for recreations, meat, drink, ſleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by all theſe, to honour God, to be bleſſings to men, and to ſeek ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our ſelves: and by doing theſe things, we fill our time: as for example, if a man ſhould write down his days work, (not that I would impoſe upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men) So long I was ſlugging in bed, ſo long I was glutting at meat, ſo long filling my ſelf with drink, at ſuch a time
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:38419:131"/>
belching out oaths; and then look upon this on a ſick-bed, here would be a black day to look upon, ſuch a day would make work in eternity. So if a man ſpend a day in idleneſs, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks of ſome idle perſons, <hi>that are buſied between the comb and the looking-glaſs</hi>; now if ſuch a one were to write his days work, he muſt leave a blank for ſuch a day, which would cauſe ſtinging reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when he comes to know the loſs of his precious time: But if a godly man ſhould write down, Such an hour I ſpent in ſecret prayer and meditation, ſuch an hour in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-worſhip, ſuch a time in the works of my calling, and ſuch time in a ſober uſe of recreations; now if this were done in a right manner, notwithſtanding many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible infirmities, yet here is a day well filled, and may cauſe ſweet reflections, when he ſees his days ending in eternity. Now that you may thus improve, and fill up your time, I ſhall briefly give you theſe five Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Labour to have your hearts filled with grace. Beloved, a mans time is full of that which his heart is full of; the heart fills the tongue, and fills the life, and ſo fills the time. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth:</hi> when all that is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:38419:131"/>
in a mans heart is good for nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good to honour God, nor to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor others, then his time muſt needs be good for nothing; it muſt needs be an empty, ſinful, unprofitable time; for ſuch a man hath nothing to fill up his time with. But on the contrary, our Saviour tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.35. <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth good things:</hi> The graces of Gods Spirit make a good treaſure in the heart; and all things that come from faith, love, humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are good things, and do much good: and a mans time is happily filled, that is full of prayer, of holineſs, of godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are all brought forth out of the good treaſure of grace in the heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do nothing in time, but what will paſs in your account, when your time is at an end: Chriſt will one day ſay to thee, <hi>Give an account of thy ſtewardſhip; for thou mayſt be no longer ſteward,</hi> Luk. 16.2. Give an account of thy Health, Life, Parts, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; of Sabbaths, Sermons, Sacraments, and all thy precious opportunities; for thou muſt no longer uſe or enjoy theſe. Now what a ſad reckoning will here be, if he hath one nothing with theſe that will
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:38419:132"/>
paſs in his account? as if a great man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt a ſervant to be his Steward, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him his money, rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe according to his Maſters pleaſure: Now if when the Steward is called to give up his account, he is able to reckon, So much laid out for proviſion for the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo much for the education of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo much to relieve the poor; theſe things will paſs in his account: but if he reckons, So much waſted in drunkenneſs, ſo much converted to my own uſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Maſter will never accept of this. So, my Brethren, when God calls us to an account of our ſtewardſhip, if a man can ſay, Lord, I ſpent my eſtate in the education of my children, in feeding and maintaining my family, in relieving the poor; I ſpent my parts in making God and Chriſt known to others; I ſpent my time to pleaſe and praiſe thee, to profit others, and ſave my ſelf; theſe things will paſs in thy account; and thou ſhalt be ſure of thy reward and honour of a faithful ſervant, when the time of my Stewardſhip is expired: but if it appear that a man hath waſted his eſtate on his luſts, and ſpent his time in his ſins, his account muſt needs be ſad, when he muſt have hell for his wages: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:38419:132"/>
ye do, conſider whether it will paſs in your account; and look upon every thing now, as it will prove when you are to give an acount for it. It is a remarkable expreſſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.17. I deſire fruit that may abound to your account; many things which a believer doth with an upright heart, ſeem but little now, but they will riſe, and abound to his glory, when he comes to give an account.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do nothing but what thou art willing to have thy ſelf; the very Nation wherein thou liveſt, and thy time, to have a name from the doing of it: for it is obſervable, that the actions of men give a name to theſe three things, <hi>viz.</hi> to themſelves, to the places, and to the times wherein they live.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then do nothing but what thou wouldſt have a name from the doing of it: man loves ſin, but he cannot endure to be called according to his ſins; but if thou doſt abhor the name of a drunkard, ſwearer, lyar, why doſt thou live in the ſins of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, ſwearing and lying?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do nothing that thou wouldſt not have the land to have a name from; for the land hath a name from the practice of the people; a holy people make a holy nation; a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:38419:133"/>
prophane, unclean, perfidious people make a land of prophaneſs, of whoredoms, of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What ſins thou liveſt in, thou doſt not onely make thy ſelf, but alſo, as much as in thee lies, thou makeſt the land laothſome to God and men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do nothing which thou wouldſt not have thy time have a name from; it makes thee have ſad thoughts to think of the time of drunkenneſs, whoredom, lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but times of prayer, meditation, holy confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſweet.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Take heed of idleneſs; this ſin makes empty and unprofitable times, and leaves people unprepared for ſickneſs. When <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> was reproved for inordinate labour, he gives this ſavoury anſwer: <hi>What,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>would ye have my Lord finde me idle?</hi> Sirs, would you have ſickneſs, and death, and the day of judgement finde you idle? Our Saviour in the Parable having intruſted his ſervants with their talents, he bids them, <hi>Occupy till I come,</hi> Luk. 19.13. See Chriſt's coming, and improve your talents for him till he come. Now that you may abhor this ſin of idleneſs,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, that if you be not doing good, you will be doing hurt; man is a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie creature: let a man look at any time
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:38419:133"/>
within himſelf, he can never ſee his heart ſtand ſtill. We read of ſome, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Who work not at all,</hi> and yet <hi>are buſie</hi>-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Sirs, the ſoul is quick at work; a man may quickly lay up abundance of treaſures in heaven or hell: For as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith well, <hi>If you are not exerciſed in the labours of men, you are in the labours of devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Make the work of Salvation thy main buſineſs; labour to turn every day into a day of Salvation. Sirs, it is an excellent thing for a man to live ſo in his calling, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, recreations, afflictions, duties of Gods worſhip, as if all the powers of his body and ſoul were ſet upon the work of Salvation: this will keep a man from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>For that man will never want buſineſs, that knows he hath a ſoul to ſave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider what little time thou haſt for this great work: perhaps it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be done, if it be not done now: they were fools that ſaid, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we dye:</hi> it had been a wiſer ſpeech to have ſaid, Let us repent, believe and pray, <hi>for to morrow we dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider what thou haſt to ſet thee on work, and to keep thee from idleneſs,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:38419:134"/>
look into hell, and ſee ſin, and the world, and devils thruſting thee therein, and thou wilt finde it buſineſs enough to ſave thee from thoſe unquenchable flames: Look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, and ſee God, and Chriſt, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Chriſtians always calling thee thither; and ſee thy own ſins, carnal friends, men, devils, a world of ſtumbling-blocks lying in thy way to ſtop thee from going into that everlaſting happineſs, and thou wilt finde work enough to go to heaven: Look into thy ſelf, and ſee what ſins thou haſt to conquer and bewail, what wants to ſupply, what graces to quicken and ripen, what duties to perform, what ſtorms and troubles to prepare againſt: Look on God, on Chriſt, and ſee what objects are there, for all the powers of thy body and ſoul to be exerciſed upon. Haſt thou any time for idle thoughts, or words, or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that haſt ſuch a God and Chriſt to think of, and to ſpeak of, and to ſet and fix thy heart, and love, and delight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Look into the family, and town, and place where thou liveſt, and ſee Chriſtleſs parents, or Chriſtleſs children, or Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs brothers and ſiſters, or Chriſtleſs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or Chriſtleſs neighbours, and thou mayſt have that in thee to ſpeak or do,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:38419:134"/>
which may ſave their ſouls from hell; and ſhall they periſh and be damned by thy idleneſs? Look into the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom where thou liveſt, and conſider where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou mayſt ſerve them, and be a bleſſing to them; and how thou mayſt be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to fill them with the Name, and Kingdom, and Will of Jeſus Chriſt: Nay, look upon every creature about thee, the Heavens, Earth, Waters, Birds, Beaſts, Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee them all filled with the Power, Wiſdom and goodneſs of God, and, as it were, bringing their praiſes to thee, that thou mayſt be their mouth to honour and exalt God. Methinks, Sirs, theſe things ſhould keep us from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That thou mayſt fill up thy time, take heed of loſing a ſuffering opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Beloved, a ſuffering opportunity is a precious opportunity; it's an opportunity to honour God, further the Goſpel, to ſave thy own and others ſouls, to be a bleſſing to thy poſterity, and to leave thy name as a bleſſed ſavour behinde thee. I would not tempt men to luſt after ſufferings; I know the Devil would have his ſervants to ſerve him by paſſive as well as active obedience; yet I would have none ſo baſe, as to chuſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:38419:135"/>
to ſin rather then to ſuffer, and to prefer Apoſtaſie before Martyrdom. Sometimes a man may fall into ſuch a nick of time, that duty may coſt him his life, and a ſin may ſave his life: This caſe is implied in the words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it; and whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall ſave it.</hi> Now that is a ſad loſs of a ſuffering opportunity, when a man ſaves himſelf from ſuffering by ſin: Conſider the fearful conſequences of this; hereby thou ſaveſt thy eſtate, name, life, and loſeſt thy ſoul; which is clearly implied in the next words, verſ. 26. <hi>For what is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> Remember, when thou runneſt into a known ſin, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſuffering, thou makeſt a bargain, thou makeſt an exchange; thou getteſt the world, and the Devil and Hell get thy ſoul. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider further, it is the higheſt improvement of thy name, eſtate and life, to ſacrifice it to the glory and will of Chriſt, by ſuffering for him: this is the beſt that thou canſt make of thy ſelf. Sirs, it is more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (if thou art called to it) to be burned at a ſtake for Chriſt, then to be burned with
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:38419:135"/>
Fever; or to die for Chriſt in a Priſon, then to die in a ſick bed.</p>
               <p>Conſider laſtly, What a woful caſe will ſickneſs and death finde thee in, when thoſe evils which thou fearedſt from men, ſhall be brought upon thee by God; when God ſhall fill thy body with greater pains then the cruelleſt Perſecutor could invent or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict! Oh what a loſs will then a ſuffering opportunity be, when a man may ſay, I had an opportunity to loſe my life, and ſave my ſoul; and now I muſt loſe my life, and my poor ſoul too!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 5. That you may be prepared for ſickneſs and death, do nothing but what you would have ſickneſs and death finde you doing. Remember, what ever thou art about, that ſickneſs and death may finde thee in it: Death found <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi</hi> in whoredom, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.8. and Death took <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> in a lye, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. and Death caught <hi>Eutychus</hi> ſleeping at a Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.9.</p>
               <p>And on the other hand, God took <hi>Enoch walking with God,</hi> Gen. 5.24. And when <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> were talking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no doubt of ſome good, <hi>Elijah</hi> was fain to break off his good diſcourſe to go to heaven, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.11. and Chriſt went
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:38419:136"/>
bleſſing his people to heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.51. And good <hi>Stephen,</hi> as he was praying, was taken from off his knees into heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.60. Oh Sirs, if you would not go ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſwearing, or drunk, or ſwaggering, or ranting into Eternity, do not practiſe theſe ſins now, but walk in your callings, recreations and duties, as if you ſaw ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death fetching you out of theſe into heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 6. Labour to be filled with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and tender diſpoſition towards others in their ſickneſs and miſery; this is a ſure way for thee to finde mercy from God in thy ſickneſs: <hi>With the merciful, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf merciful,</hi> Pſal. 18.25. <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> Matth. 5.7. We have a precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.1, 2, 3. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that conſidereth the poor.</hi> By the poor is meant, not only the poor in eſtate, but alſo thoſe that are poor and afflicted, in reſpect of other afflictions. And it's a moſt bleſſed frame of heart for men, when they ſit in health, and at eaſe, and ſwim in wealth, to be ſeriouſly conſidering their poor diſeaſed and afflicted brethren: <hi>The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord will preſerve him, and keep him alive.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:38419:136"/>
The Lord will ſtrengthen him on the bed of languiſhing; thou wilt make all his bed in his ſickneſs.</hi> I ſay therefore, ſhew mercy to others in their ſickneſs; and when the day of ſickneſs, and death, and judgment comes,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.18.</note> thou ſhalt be ſure (as <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> in the like caſe) to <hi>finde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at that day.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 7. Be fully ſatisfied in the belief of Gods care and providence towards thy friends whom thou art to leave behinde thee. Beloved, it makes the thoughts of ſickneſs and death more grievous to many, becauſe of the ſad and miſerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which their poor Orphans and Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows will be left in when they are gone; and eſpecially if their condition be like that of learned and godly <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> who when he ſhould have made his Will, had nothing to bequeath. But this trouble is not ſo much for want of an Eſtate, as for want of Faith: therefore go chearfully to your ſick beds, or death-beds, with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of theſe following Scriptures, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.11. <hi>Leave thy fatherleſs children, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them alive, and let thy Widdows truſt in me.</hi> In which words, as appears by the context, God threatens the <hi>Edomites,</hi> that their children and wives ſhall be left ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:38419:137"/>

And although I do not think that there is any intercourſe betwixt a Saint in heaven, and his family upon earth; and I do not know that he will in heaven be offering prayers for them upon earth; yet I do not doubt but he will there know, that he hath left a family behinde him upon earth, and by his glorious viſion of God, will ſee that Infinite Power and Providence which provides for his and all other families upon earth, ſo far as is for his own glory, and the good of his Church.</p>

This appears by the Preface to the Petitions in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven</hi>; whereby we ſee, that a Childe of God by prayer doth, as it were, part from the world, and is with his Father which is in Heaven. Hence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. Prayer is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>An entring into the Holieſt, viz.</hi> into Heaven: Beſides, it is eaſie to demonſtrate, that the ſame things which make us fit to pray, make us fit to die, and that a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame is a dying frame; for our hearts
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:38419:139"/>
are moſt ſet upon thoſe things when we pray, which we muſt receive when we die: Death brings us to the things which we pray for; and he that is unwilling to die, is unwilling to receive an anſwer to his own prayers. Beloved, it often puzzles the thoughts of men, to think what will be the iſſue of things, what things will come to at the laſt. Now it ſeems to me a clear and excellent expedient for our ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction herein, to ſtudy well the Lords Prayer, and to believe that all the Petitions therein ſhall certainly be granted; and whatever we ſee before, for certain at the Day of Judgment every Petition therein ſhall be fulfilled: and therefore the more a mans heart is ſet on thoſe things for which we are thereby taught and bound to pray, the more ready and fit he is for Death and Judgment. Prayer is one of the firſt and laſt things of a Chriſtian: ſo ſoon as ever the ſpiritual life is begun, it preſently breaths in prayer; and I am perſwaded, that the godly do uſually die in prayer.</p>
               <p>Laſt <hi>Direct.</hi> Live as one that knows that there are bounds ſet to thy life: It makes many ſo unprepared for ſickneſs and death, becauſe they look upon their lives as bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; they always think they have ſome
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:38419:139"/>
time to live, and therefore think of no time to die. Now it is clear, that God hath ſet bounds to the life of every man; and when he comes to thoſe bounds, he is ſtopt, and can go no further, <hi>Job</hi> 14.5. <hi>Thou haſt appointed his bounds, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs.</hi> Proud men climb to ſuch a height of preferment; and as they are riſing higher, Death ſtops them, and they can go no further: The covetous man gets ſuch an eſtate; and as he is reaching after greater wealth, Death ſtops him, that he can get no more. Oh what a ſudden ſtop did Death cauſe that rich Fool to make,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.20</note> when he was conſtrained to die the ſame very night, when he thought he was, as it were, beginning to live: The malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man goes to ſuch a height of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the godly; and as he is raging in his malice and madneſs, Death ſtops him, that he can go no farther. Oh what a ſtop did <hi>Haman</hi> meet with in the very height of his bloody deſigne againſt the Church of God! On the other hand, the poor Childe of God is zealous in worſhipping and ſerving God; and as he is ſeeking to ſerve and praiſe him more, Death ſtops him, and his work is done: therefore do every thing is knowing that thou mayſt meet with thy
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:38419:140"/>
bounds, and be ſtopt in the very midſt of thy work: <hi>All the daies of my appointed time will I wait till my change come,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, Cap.</hi> 14.14. <hi>Job</hi> knew that there was a change to come, and that Death would make a great alteration with him ſhortly, and that there was a ſecret time appointed for this change; therefore he will every day wait and look for it. Think with thy ſelf in a morning, I may ſee a great change before night; and think with thy ſelf at night, I may ſee a great alteration before morning. Sirs, when a man goes from his houſe, friends, food and eſtate, to heaven or hell, believe it, he will finde a great alteration. Oh then live, as if every day were to be the day of thy change; as if every journey, and work, and duty, would bring thee to the end and bounds of thy life.</p>

of mirth, and findeſt thy heart apt to be looſe from God in thy recreations; then remember the pains of ſickneſs, and this will cauſe a ſpirit of moderation and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety to rule thy heart: when thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to worſhip God, it may much quicken thee with a new and freſh ſpirit, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how near thou waſt to eternity in ſuch a ſickneſs, and to go to duty as one that is newly riſen out of a ſick-bed; and that thou art ſtill praying, hearing, receiving Sacraments, as it were, in the very gates of death.</p>
               <p>So when thou art tempted to any ſin, remember thy ſickneſs: conſider, Wilt thou bring again upon thy ſelf an Ague, Fever, Dropſie, Conſumption <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in abundance of caſes it will do your ſouls much good to be often remembring your viſitation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, examine what good thou haſt got by thy viſitation. Beloved, many come out of a ſickneſs like Rogues out of a gaol; Rogues they went in, and worſe Rogues they come out: So they were Drunkards, Whoremongers, Perſecutors of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they went into ſickneſs; and are far worſe, and more hardned in their ſins, when they come out of ſickneſs: Let us
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:38419:145"/>
therefore all examine what good we have got by our ſickneſs; as you know after a man hath been in a courſe of Phyſick, he obſerves whether he coughs leſs, or burns leſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whether his ſtomack be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſtrength better, and ſleep better; ſo if thou haſt been in a courſe of ſickneſs, obſerve whether thy corruptions abate, and whether thy heart be better ſince thy viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: is pride leſs, and peeviſhneſs leſs, and covetouſneſs leſs? and canſt thou pray better, and ſanctifie Sabbaths better, and hear Sermons better? and is thy diſcourſe better, and thy life better? <hi>David</hi> upon ſearch found ſweet experience of the bleſſed effect of his affliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.67. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was afflicted, I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy ſtatutes:</hi> So, canſt thou ſay, Before I was ſick, I could not endure to be provoked; I was very light and looſe in company, I was very apt to be proud and ſelf-conceited; but now I bleſs God I am more patient, and more ſerious, and more humble.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, take ſpecial care to avoid ſin after thy recovery; I ſay to thee, as Chriſt ſaid to another upon the ſame occaſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Thou art made whole, ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee:</hi> Thou
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:38419:145"/>
thoughteſt thy diſeaſe was very bad and grievous; but conſider, there are worſe things then thy ſickneſs was, worſe pains and worſe miſeries. Oh then ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee: I ſhall preſs this duty in theſe four Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, watch eſpecially againſt thoſe ſins which thou waſt moſt inclined unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy ſickneſs. Some conceive that the impotent man before-mentioned, was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eſpecially for ſome particular ſin, which our Saviour did particularly aim at in bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him <hi>ſin no more.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us of ſome, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. <hi>that return with the dog to his own vomit</hi>; where he compares thoſe that ſeemed to loath ſin, and after return to the ſame ſin, to a ſick dog, which when he hath eaſed himſelf by vomiting up that which made him ſick, goes and licks up again his own loathſome vomit: and ſo we ſee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many who lick up in time of health thoſe very ſins which they ſeemed to loath and vomit up in time of ſickneſs. Beloved, ſin appears in its actings moſt ſtrong, when the inſtruments are moſt ſtrong therewith a man commits it; and the weakneſs of the inſtruments cauſeth a weakneſs in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſin; and therefore when the body
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:38419:146"/>
is weak, all thoſe ſins which are fulfilled by the body, ſeem weak too: but now when the body gathers ſtrength, as a man hath ſtrength to eat, and ſtrength to work, and ſtrength to walk; ſo without the mighty power of the Spirit, ſtrength will alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into ſin. Therefore I ſay, Watch, and pray, and fight againſt thoſe ſins which thou waſt moſt apt to commit before thy ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, take heed of ſurfetting with the profits, and pleaſures, and preferments of the world; for as a man after long faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is apt to ſurfeit when he returns to his meat; ſo when a man by ſickneſs hath been long with-held from the creature, there appears ſuch a freſh kinde of pleaſure and delight in the world, and the heart is ſo eager in the deſires of it, that there is great danger of being glutted with it: We ſhould therefore receive all the bleſſings of the creature, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did eat the Paſs-over, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.11. where we finde that they were to eat the Paſs-over, as thoſe that were ready to go out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Canaan, with their loyns girt, their ſhoes on their feet, their ſtaves in their hands, and they were to eat it in haſte.</hi> So, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we ſhould eat, drink, buy, fell, work,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:38419:146"/>
take our recreations, as thoſe that are haſting away into eternity, and as if we were ready dreſt to go to heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Beware of ſecurity: for we are apt herein to be like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who when one plague was paſt, thought himſelf ſafe enough from that or any other: So when one fit of ſickneſs is paſt, we look for no more, but dream of a long time of eaſe, and peace, and health before us: but we ſhould be rather like one that is ſick of an Ague, who when the fit is over, eats, drinks, and is merry, but yet he looks for another fit: So Sirs, is a ſickneſs over and paſt? why, I do not deny but that God who hath given thee a ſtomach, and provided food, would have thee to eat and drink; and he that hath created matter for thy delight, and made thee a riſible creature, doth allow thee to be merry and cheerful; yet look for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit: ſickneſs is like to come again, and death will be ſure to come ſhortly; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed of ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that heed of pride and vain-glory; this was the ſin of good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> of whom we read, that after he was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from his ſickneſs, <hi>his heart was lifted up,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.24, 25. and this appeared, in that when he was courted by the King of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:38419:147"/>
                  <hi>Babylon,</hi> he did in a bravado ſhew all his riches, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39.2. Poor <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> thou waſt in a better frame, when on thy ſick-bed thou waſt turning thy face to the wall; but we may ſee by this ſad inſtance, how apt we are after a mercie and deliverance, to be puft up with high thoughts and conceits of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>The laſt Duty which I ſhall mention, is this: Be careful to perform thy ſick-bed-vows and reſolutions. <hi>A vow is a ſolemn promiſe made to God, either of a duty, or of ſomething which may further us in our duty to God.</hi> The matter of a vow is either to do that which God commands, or to forſake ſin which God forbids, or to do ſomething to further our obedience, or to abſtain from ſomething which might be an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, and which we may abſtain from: A vow muſt not be of a thing unlawful; for that were as if we ſhould promiſe God to hate him, or not to love him; it muſt be alſo of that which we have power to do, elſe we have no power to promiſe to do it: The nature of a vow is a promiſe made to God, which promiſe brings an obligation upon us to perform it: this promiſe muſt not be made raſhly; for a vow muſt be the fruit of grace, and not the fruit of ſin:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:38419:147"/>
and we muſt not make promiſes to God in a paſſion; yet I do not deny, but ſuch vows muſt be performed; for it's one thing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to vow, and another thing to vow to ſin; in ſuch a caſe we muſt be humbled for the manner of the vow, and graciouſly pay what we ſinfully vow'd. It hath been the practice of the godly to make vows to God in their troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.1, 2. <hi>Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member David, and all his afflictions; how he ſware unto the Lord, and vowed to the mighty God of Jacob.</hi> Now Sirs, in the fear of God make conſcience to perform your ſick-bed-vows: Indeed, wicked men are forward to make vows when they are ſick, and as forward to break them when they are well: As <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when the plagues were upon him, he would let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go; but when they were removed, his heart was hardned, and they ſhould not go. But it is the property of a godly man to make good his vows, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. Hence ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 56.12. <hi>Thy vows are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, O God.</hi> Beloved, vows are heavy things; <hi>David</hi> felt them lying upon him, and preſſing him to the performance of them. Vows take up a great deal of room in the ſoul; they fill the conſcience: when a man is tempted to do that which he hath
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:38419:148"/>
vowed againſt, his vow will be upon him preſently, that he dare not do it. See what conſcience <hi>David</hi> made of his vows, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.13, 14. <hi>I will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath ſpoken when I was in trouble,</hi> Pſal. 116.14. <hi>I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the preſence of all his people.</hi> Sirs, if you break your vows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your vows will break you. I ſhall conclude this in the words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.4, 5. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow unto God, defer not to pay; for he hath no pleaſure in fools: pay that which thou haſt vowed. Better it is that thou ſhouldſt not vow, then that thou ſhouldſt vow, and not pay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for the Exhortation to thoſe who are recovered from ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>My laſt Exhortation is, to exhort you to ſome Duties to be performed in time of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I ſhall lay before you in theſe twelve particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duty</hi> 1. Own and acknowledge the hand of God in thy viſitation: as a man in a croud, that receives a blow upon his head; will preſently turn about to ſee whence the ſtroke comes; ſo, as ſoon as Gods hand toucheth thee, let thy eye be upon him,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:38419:148"/>
and labour to finde a ſpecial preſence of God appearing in thy viſitation. Poor ſoul! thou art now parted from the uſe of Ordinances in publick, and thou muſt labour to finde Sabbaths, and Sermons, and Sacraments in thy ſickneſs; that is, thou muſt endeavour to finde the preſence of God that appears in theſe Ordinances, appearing to thy ſoul in the aches, and troubles, and pains of a ſickneſs. To this purpoſe, I have read a ſaying of an holy Miniſter of the Goſpel, which he ſpoke on his ſick-bed concerning people that were then worſhipping God in publick, <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that they did now ſee, what I do now feel!</hi> we have a choice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this duty of acknowledging the hand of God in our viſitation, in <hi>Job, cap.</hi> 1. where we read, that after he had ſtood ſtill, and heard the meſſengers which came one upon the heels of the another, with the ſad tidings of the loſs of his cattel, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and children; the very firſt thing he does, is to turn to God, and to fall down and worſhip him, and acknowledge his hand in his affliction, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20, 21. ſo I ſay, So ſoon as ever thy diſeaſe begins, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own, and acknowledge, and worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p God, who is the cauſe of thy viſitation; ſo did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 38.2. <hi>Thy arrows ſtick faſt
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:38419:149"/>
in me, and thy hand preſſeth me ſore.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, this affliction comes from the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Will, and Power, and Juſtice of God; and by this diſeaſe he hath now cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to come to thee, and to appear to thee; therefore labour to have thy heart filled with him, that all thy words and actions may favour of him. Hereby thou wilt ſee Reaſon againſt all Sin, and Reaſon for all Duties, and withal a ground for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duty</hi> 2. Labour to have thy heart filled with the thoughts of thy death and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it is the great ſin of many, that in their ſickneſs ſtrive to put the thoughts of death and judgement far from them, and labour to fill their hearts with confidence that they ſhall live; and ſo many poor wretches fall into hell before they did think they ſhould dye. But certainly, it's the ſafeſt and wiſeſt way, ſo ſoon as thou art aſſaulted with ſickneſs, to ſee thy death and judgement ſtanding before thee, and to receive <hi>the ſentence of death in thy ſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.9. Look upon thy diſeaſe as bringing thee to death, and after that to a judgement, which will ſettle thee in heaven or hell preſently. As thou
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:38419:149"/>
lyeſt on thy ſick-bed, look into the other great world, where thou art entring; ſee in what ſtate, place and company thou art now to all eternity to be fixt: Look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, and ſee thoſe many millions of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils that are chained up there: Look what a dreadful caſe the learned, great, rich, ſtrong and beautiful ſwaggerers, ranters, and gallants of the proud, preſumptuous, ſcornful, unbelieving, envious, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then look into heaven into thy Fathers houſe, and behold there <hi>the high and lofty one dwelling in that high and holy place,</hi> and the Lord Jeſus ſitting at his right hand in glory, and an innumerable company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels looking him in the face; and there ſee a great multitude of bleſſed and glorified Saints: <hi>Illic Apoſtolorum glorioſus chorus, illic Prophetarum exultantium numerus, illic Martyrum innumerabilis populus: There is the glorious quire of Apoſtles, there is a company of triumphant Prophets, and there is an innumerable multitude of bleſſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:38419:150"/>
ſaith <hi>Cyprian:</hi> There thou mayſt ſee thoſe who were upon earth, the poor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, deſpiſed, afflicted, perſecuted, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, baniſht, hang'd, burnt Children of the moſt high God, whom the world could not bear; but are now happily poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of their everlaſting Kingdom, where they are filled and ſatisfied with the likeneſs and preſence of God, and are ſinging and rejoycing with unſpeakable joy to behold his glory: And then conſider, Yonder is the place, wherein I am now to ſeek to enter. And thus let thy ſickneſs fill thee with the deep and ſerious thoughts of death, judgement, and the world to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duty</hi> 3. Be ſure of a well-grounded Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-peace ſetled betwixt God and thy ſoul: It's a good ſaying, That <hi>the day of death is a day of truth:</hi> See therefore that thou haſt a peace which will prove true and ſound when it comes to the great tryal of death and judgement. The unbeliever is not then to be tryed at the bar of his own ſecure and ſeared conſcience, nor by a Jury of carnal atheiſtical neighbours. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath then a preſent appeal from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:38419:150"/>
and alſo from the diſmal ſentences of his own doubting heart; and the Cauſe of both is preſently to go to a hearing before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt: Now ſee that thy peace be ſetled on ſuch a ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thou mayſt be found in ſafety and glory, when thou art called to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judge of quick and dead. There are two main things which may aſſure thy heart of peace and reconciliation with God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If Chriſts righteouſneſs be thy own, ſo that as ſure as thou art a ſinner in thy ſelf, thou art righteous in and by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and obedience of Jeſus Chriſt: See therefore that all cauſes agree to make this righteouſneſs thy own.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Set the Lord before thy eyes, and be able to ſay, I know, and am ſurely convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that <hi>God is a good God,</hi> a living, kinde and merciful God, and that he is good to poor ſinners; by the ſalvation of whom, he hath choſen to make his goodneſs glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to all eternity: I know that there are <hi>forgiveneſſes with him</hi>; that he hath a heart <hi>to pardon iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin</hi>; that he is inclin'd, <hi>and ready to pardon</hi> according to his infinite goodneſs and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and this goodneſs is the cauſe of all

that great Salvation revealed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: and I come to him, and my ſoul doth cleave to him, and love him; and all my expectation is from him, as he is a God of ſuch infinite and incomprehenſible good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

a godly, conſciencious and ſeaſonable ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of thy outward eſtate; this ought to be done, if it be not done before, and if thou art in a capacity to do it: This was part of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his meſſage to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> on his ſick-bed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.1. <hi>Set thy houſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for thou ſhalt dye, and not live.</hi> Now in making thy <hi>Will,</hi> be ruled by this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>Be ſure that thy will be ruled by the Will of God,</hi> that ſo thy laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the ſignification of thy will, may make it appear that thy will is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Will of God; and that thou doeſt Gods Will, when thou makeſt thy own will. For this purpoſe, obſerve theſe three Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If thou haſt got any thing unjuſtly, take order, ſo far as is poſſible, to make reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; do not dye in injuſtice, to go with a curſe to hell thy ſelf, and to leave the curſe of God behind thee upon thy family.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be full of love and faithfulneſs to thy Relations. Chriſt himſelf is our pattern herein, who when he was nigh unto death, commended the care of his Mother to his beloved Diſciple, <hi>John</hi> 19.27. <hi>Then ſaith he to his diſciple, Behold thy mother.</hi> Let thy laſt Will and Teſtament witneſs that thou dieſt in conjugal love to thy wife; <hi>Give her
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:38419:154"/>
of the fruit of her hands,</hi> Prov. 31. <hi>ult.</hi> endeavour to make thy poor widows life as comfortable as thou canſt: and although I adviſe not husbands to leave power in the hands of their wives to wrong and defraud their poor fatherleſs children; for ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience witneſſeth, that many widows are ſo careful to get themſelves husbands, that they grow careleſs of their poor children; yet however leave no tye upon her to binde her from after-marriage; ſeeing God hath made her free, do not thou leave her bound.</p>
               <p>Again, provide ſo for thy children, that there be neither want, nor ſtrife, nor emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation among them: and though I adviſe to nothing to prejudice the firſt-borns birth-right, yet I muſt witneſs againſt it as the great ſin of many Parents, that are ſo ambitious to ſet up their Families, that they highly advance the elder brothers, and often leave the younger to be as poor as beggars, or as bad as thieves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Dye in dear love to the Church of God, and to the poor, that ſo far as thou art able, thy laſt Will and Teſtament may ſavour of good will towards them. It is the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of many, that they ſeek to make a Monopoly of the world, by ingroſſing to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:38419:155"/>
themſelves and their families, and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good and uſe of it from others: but every man (keeping to the rules of juſtice) ſhould diſpoſe of his eſtate ſo, as may make it moſt uſeful for Gods glory, and to be a bleſſing unto man: And therefore conſider, that if thou expecteſt when thou dyeſt to be received into <hi>the everlaſting habitation</hi> of Gods poor in the other world, let their lives be made ſomewhat more comfortable by thee in this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duty</hi> 6. Uſe all lawful means to recover thy health; though thou art ready to dye, yet it's thy duty to endeavour to live; thy life is Gods, and he hath bound thee to keep it for him till he call for it; and thou art the Churches ſervant, and muſt not by thy ſinful neglect defraud her of her right: thou haſt yet need to mortifie ſin, and to grow in grace, and to ſtrengthen thy aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Salvation, and to lay up more trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in heaven; and thou oughteſt to uſe all lawful means to preſerve thy life for theſe ends: grudge not therefore thy ſelf whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and fit dyet: ſend for a skilful and careful Phyſitian, and depend upon the God of thy life in the uſe of them. To conclude, be ruled by this Principle: When life is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:38419:155"/>
moſt ſweet, be willing to dye; and when life is moſt bitter, be wiling to live: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, <hi>a man lives to himſelf, and dyes to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duty</hi> 7. Bear thy Viſitation patiently. The Apoſtle pleads for this duty, though in a more general caſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Furthermore, we have had fathers of our fleſh which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us, and we gave them revence; ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the father of ſpirits, and live?</hi> As it is a moſt unchild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like temper in children, to carry themſelves ſtubbornly under their fathers rod; ſo it is very unchildlike for Gods children to carry themſelves ſtubbornly under the correction of their heavenly Father: therefore yeild thy ſelf in patient ſubjection to thy Father under all his chaſtiſements. Now becauſe patience is ſuch a neceſſary, ſeaſonable and proper Duty for a ſick man, I ſhall preſs this Exhortation with ſome Motives, and then by ſome Directions teach you how to be patient.</p>
               <p>I ſhall uſe theſe five Motives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 1. Now is a ſpecial ſeaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>you have great need of patience,</hi> Heb. 10.36. for the greater our a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lictions are, the greater is our need of patience: now
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:38419:156"/>
every affliction is greater, by how much it comes nearer to a mans life; ſo that a man better bears afflictions in his Eſtate or Friends, then in his own Body: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there never appeared a want of <hi>Jobs</hi> patience, till his body was ſo ſore viſited. Beſides, there are many afflictions accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſickneſs, which make our condition more grievous, and patience more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: as for example, our enemies are now apt to triumph in our miſery. Thus they did by <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 41.8. <hi>An evil diſeaſe ſay they, cleaveth faſt unto him; and now that he lyeth, he ſhall riſe up no more:</hi> So that we have need of patience to bear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultings and upbraidings of our enemies: our friends alſo may be now eſtranged from us. Thus they were from <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88.8. and <hi>David</hi> complains of this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.11. <hi>My lovers and my friends ſtand a loof from my ſore, and my kinſmen ſtood afar off:</hi> Nay, our deareſt relations ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deal unkindly with us in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This did aggravate <hi>Jobs</hi> miſery, <hi>Job</hi> 19.17. <hi>My breath is ſtrange to my wife, though I intreated her for the childrens ſake of my own body:</hi> I begged of her, Good wife, do not forſake me now, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our poor children, which are gone,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:38419:156"/>
which were the ſweet pledges of our Matrimonial Love: Yet for all this (ſaith he) ſhe was ſo nice, that ſhe could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to come near my breath, which did ſtink, being corrupted by my diſeaſe. ſo that we have upon all theſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other conſiderations, great need of patience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 2. Your patience will prove you to be compleat Chriſtians. Thus the Apoſtle pleads, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, wanting nothing.</hi> Beloved, many ſeem to be good Chriſtians till they come to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience; but then they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be wronged, or provoked, or to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer loſſes, or pains in body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now here is a want in Chriſtiany; and it is better want any where, then be wanting in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: but when a man can with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bear all ſufferings, he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect entire Chriſtian, and wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe he can patiently want every thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 3. Thy bearing thy viſitation pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, makes thy ſuffering to be a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſake of Chriſt: Perhaps thou mayſt think, Oh if I had the honour to ſuffer baniſhment, impriſonment, yea death
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:38419:157"/>
it ſelf for the ſake of Chriſt, how patiently could I hear it! But conſider the anſwer which <hi>Cyprian</hi> makes to this objection, which the Chriſtians did object in his days in a time of great ſickneſs, <hi>Non ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem veſtrum Deus quaerit, ſed fidem: God ſeeks not your bloud, but your faith.</hi> If you did ſuffer for Chriſt, it is not your bloud and your death that pleaſeth God, but the faith and patience which you exerciſe in your ſufferings; and by theſe thou mayſt exceedingly pleaſe God in this Viſitation: And conſider further, that a man doth not onely ſuffer for Chriſts ſake, when he ſuffers for the name and truth of Chriſt; though I confeſs it is ordinarily taken in that ſence, yet there is another way of ſuffering for the ſake of Chriſt, which is indeed a clearer argument of ſincerity then the former, that is, when we ſuffer patiently for the ſake of Chriſts Will; ſo the reaſon of our patience and ſubmiſſion is, becauſe our viſitation comes from the Will of Jeſus Chriſt; and indeed this demonſtrates that the ſame graces, and the ſame reaſons, which make thee ſo patient under this viſitation, would make thee run with patience through all the ſuffering which thou ſhouldſt be called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for the ſake of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:38419:157"/>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 4. This puts a great grace upon a Chriſtian, to lye quietly and patiently under the hand of God in ſickneſs. <hi>David</hi> gives a relation of his ſweet temper in the exerciſe of this grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.2. <hi>Surely I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved and quieted my ſelf as a childe that is weaned of his mother: my ſoul is even as a weaned childe:</hi> As a weaned childe eats, and drinks, and plays, and ſleeps quietly without the breaſts; ſo <hi>David</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and quiet, and patient, and teachable under all Gods diſpenſations: I tell you, in the midſt of all naſty and loathſome diſeaſes, this ſpirit of patience puts a beauty and glory upon the very body of a Chriſtian. <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> elegantly expreſſeth the comely carriage of a patient Chriſtian under his ſufferings thus: <hi>His countenance is calm and pleaſant; his face ſmooth, not wrinkled with ſorrow or anger; his eye-lids let down in a cheerful manner; his eyes caſt down not with miſery, but humility; his mouth ſealed with ſilence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>De patientia,</hi> cap. 15.</p>
               <p>Laſt <hi>Mot.</hi> This will be a ſure proof to thee, that all thy ſickneſſes and miſery will end in heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. <hi>That ye be not ſlothful, but followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, all the glory of heaven is laid up in the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:38419:158"/>
promiſes; and the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs and Saints which have dyed in all ages, are now in heaven inheriting the promiſes; they are enjoyning that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which was promiſed to them in the Scriptures: but how came they to inherit theſe promiſes? why through faith and patience. Now we have the ſame promiſes made to us, which they do now inherit: but how ſhall we come to inherit the ſame promiſes? thoſe Saints are poſſeſt of glory, yonder they live and raign; but how ſhall we do to come among them? why be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of them; they are gone a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; away after them, follow their ſteps through faith and patience, and you ſhall with them inherit the promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe.</hi>

                  <hi>ſpirit,</hi> Prov. 15.32. Beloved, when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is troubled, it's an hard thing to rule the ſoul, to keep the affections, paſſions, thoughts, words, looks, actions in their place; much covetouſneſs, pride, unbelief, anger, and diſcontent, are apt to work, and diſturb, and diſplace the ſoul at ſuch a time: Now a patient man bears off his troubles by the ſtrength of his graces, and the ſtrength of all graces work in patience; he believes patiently, hopes patiently, and lyes patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the will of God, loving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in him; ſo that patience keeps the ſoul from ſinking, and it keeps corruption from riſing, and keeps all graces work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that the heart is full of duty, when it is full of patience; and hereby the heart is eſtabliſhed and ſetled in a holy, even, cheerful and obedient frame under the will of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be patient in obedience to the will of God; for it cannot be true patience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou bear thy affliction patiently for this reaſon, becauſe it comes from the will of God: I know a ſickneſs is not a thing it ſelf which a natural will ſhould chuſe; but when God ſignifies that it's his will that thou ſhouldſt be viſited, then here comes in the work of patience, to deny thy own will,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:38419:159"/>
whereby thou waſt willing to have eaſe, and health, and life; and to ſay, I am willing to go into a ſick-bed, or death-bed, to fulfil the Will of God. We have our Saviours example for this; he was innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willing to avoid the ſufferings by his created Humane Will; but looking upon them as coming from the Will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſubmits his will to his Fathers; ſaying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> So a childe of God may ſay, I am willing to have my health and life, to live in the world with my Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and to be a bleſſing to the Church of God: but if it be Gods Will that I ſhall be ſick and dead, let me die to fulfil the Will of God, rather then live to fulfil my own will.</p>
